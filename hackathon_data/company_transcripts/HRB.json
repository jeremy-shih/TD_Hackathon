All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Colby Brown, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results. On the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Tony Bowen, our CFO. Greg Macfarlane, Senior Vice President, U.S. Retail Products and Operations will also be available during our question-and-answer session.","In connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the Securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.

H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up, after which they may choose to jump back in the queue.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","William C. Cobb","Thank you, Colby, and good afternoon. Earlier today, we announced our results for the fiscal year 2016. Clearly, this was a disappointing season on many fronts. Our assisted tax preparation business continued to lose returns, and for the first time in several years, our digital do it yourself business did as well. Let me be clear, we will change the client loss trajectory and are hard at work to make this happen. Next season will not be all the same.","So with that as a backdrop, here is what we will cover today. First, I'll spend a few minutes looking back at tax season 2016. We did not deliver the results we wanted, and for that I take full responsibility. We have learnt some hard lessons and we'll change how we do business going forward. Next, I'll share our expectations for tax season 2017 and beyond.","We are fully committed to doing what it takes to turn our results around. Arresting the client decline and ultimately growing clients is our number one objective. We cannot continue the client trajectory we've seen.","Finally, I'll review the steps we are taking to achieve these objectives. Some have already been completed, many are in process, and others are yet to start. I am excited about the plans for fiscal year 2017 and beyond, and I am confident we will execute on those plans to deliver better results.","Let me, however, set some expectations upfront. I will not be able to provide full details regarding these plans given how far out from the tax season we are and the competitive environment. But I can tell you that we are taking a broad look at our options and we will be making meaningful changes in both the short and long term.","First, let's start by looking back at tax season 2016. From an industry perspective, the season started very slowly and consistent with the past few years did not reach its expected growth level until the last week of the season. And the results seen this season were disappointing for most of the branded players including H&R Block. One branded competitor, however, had an exceptional season.","Turbo Tax's Absolute Zero promotion won the tax season and likely took share from all major branded competitors. Despite their success; however, the industry shift from assisted and DIY was relatively consistent with the last few years at approximately 90 basis points.","Although the assisted category grew slightly, we believe H&R Block and our assisted branded competitors lost share to independents. Based on our analysis, the independent share of the market appears to have grown by approximately 80 basis points in tax season 2016 continuing the trend we have seen for the past several years. Finally, this season we saw increased fraud prevention measures at both the federal and state levels.","Stronger information security protocols in the DIY space were introduced at the public private security summit. Refund processing slowed at the federal level and states implemented measures designed to prevent and detect fraudulent activity. We will have a better idea of the impact these changes have on the industry when the IRS releases more information.","In the meantime, our government relations team will continue to focus on fighting fraud in all its forms, including tax identity theft and in proper earned income tax credit payments while my management team will be fully focused on running the business. Fraud is not the only issue we face, and as such, the solution of fraud is not the only answer to client growth.","Now let me discuss what happened in the industry, and let's talk about H&R Block's results. We lost 6% of our clients in the assisted channel or one point of share. The majority of the client loss again came from the early season filers obtaining the earned income tax credit and those filing the 1040EZ form. Those losses have come, while our retention levels have held steady over the last several years. What this means is that we are not driving new clients into our offices at an acceptable rate.","So why are we declining in clients? While there isn\u2019t a single simple answer for this question, there are a few things we can point to. This includes aggressive and compelling consumer promotions and product incentive offerings for both independents and DIY competitors including the recently reintroduced refund-anticipation loan or RAL-like product in the assisted channel.","While we cannot just look externally in our assessment, the truth is we did not perform well as a company. We saw core execution in all areas of our business; sales, marketing, and field operations. I intend for this to be the last time you will hear me say this. We do not intend to be outplayed again.","In order to move forward, we need to understand what didn\u2019t work which I've just described, but we also need to capitalize on what has worked. In the past, we talked to you about the four components of revenue; price, mix, volume, and product to cash. Although volume was down, the other three components positively impacted results. We achieved the 3% average price increase we had planned. Overall core mix continued to improve contributing an additional 1% in revenue growth.","Overall product to cash also increased driven by our Piece of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products, and despite the fact that we declined the most in early season clients, which impacts Emerald card and Refund Transfer Unit sales, our tax rates for these two products in our retail offices were strong at 15% and 33% respectively. We also had a strong first season with our new bank partner. The transition of our products was efficient resulting in a seamless experience for our tax professionals and clients.","Finally, in the assisted space, we are pleased with the launch of our new brand Block Advisors and we look forward to growing that business to over 350 locations in fiscal 2017. As we mentioned before the season, this is a long term investment for us, although I am pleased with the progress to date.","In our DIY business, returns declined 2.6% resulting in a 1 point loss of share. Yet, Turbo had a great season, while we also know that we did not market our product appropriately demonstrated by the fact that our DIY awareness continues to linger in the mid 60s range. This actually represents a great opportunity for us.","We have seen in the past that with the right marketing we can drive client and revenue growth. Our average revenue per client in DIY increased due to pricing, enhancements to the product, improved monetization, and an increase in product attach. Conversion rates also increased 1 point and our mobile usage increased significantly.","Moving to the Affordable Care Act, we did not see the impact we expected as early season client losses disproportionately affected ACA related volume. In addition, IRS compliance efforts around ACA penalties were not yet visible to tax payers which we believe were the continued and potentially increased tax filer noncompliance. As such, the percent of ACA impact to clients decreased slightly from 16% to 15%.","In the ACA impacted client base, we did see an increase in the number of clients completing the premium tax credit reconciliation as expected, which is the most complex of the three ACA forms or worksheets. The ACA impacts an important segment of our client base and we believe will result in growth over time. However, that growth is dependent on three things. First, our ability to grow clients who were impacted by the ACA particularly early season filers; second, overall growth in marketplace enrollment; and third, increased IRS compliance enforcements which we believe will start to happen later this calendar year.","Now with that overview of the business, let me provide a couple of additional thoughts on our financial performance. Coming into the year with the divesture of H&R Block Bank, we have anticipated a 1% drop in revenue and a 1 point decline in adjusted EBITDA margin. Actually results were in line with expectations resulting in a $35 million reduction in EBITDA.","We also encountered additional headwinds due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations that negatively impacted revenues by another point. Excluding the two points of decrease due to these impacts, overall revenues for the year increased compared with the prior year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we made great progress in aligning our capital structure with our business model this year. We divested our bank to provide capital flexibility and this enabled to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. In FY 2015 we repurchased 56.4 million shares representing over 28% of outstanding shares since the beginning of the fiscal year.","I am also pleased with the announcement today that the Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. Tony will speak to our dividend approach later in the call. With fiscal 2016 behind us it is now time to look to the future.","Going forward our number one goal is to arrest the client decline and ultimately achieve client growth. To do this, we must improve the value we provide to our clients and do a better job of communicating this value. We will fix this, both in the short term and the long term. In the short term we will make significant aggressive changes aimed at driving client volumes.","As we approach next season, we are reviewing our marketing efforts, product offerings, promotions and service delivery models, understanding however that we will not sacrifice the long term good of our company for short term gain. In the long terms we must consider the tax preparation needs of the market overall.","We are the only company that can serve clients however they want to be served and have the opportunity to expand our offerings to appear to their very needs in the market today. You will see innovative solutions designed to leverage our ability to serve our clients anyway they want to be serve. To deliver on these goals we are investing in research and development. These investments will be funded through our cost reductions efforts which I'll talk about in a moment.","So now that we know what we need to do, how will we do it? There are three main pieces to our fiscal year 2017 strategy. First, we will implement programs specifically designed to drive new client growth and I am excited about what we will bring to the market next season.","Next, we have evaluated all aspects of aspects of the business and identified cost savings throughout. This includes realigning our field management and identifying efficiencies at our corporate headquarters allowing us to reduce headcount and sharpen our focus on delivering client growth. Additionally, we will spend less on marketing and have taken out IT infrastructure and support costs.","Collectively, these actions will enable us to ensure strong free cash flow going forward while funding our client acquisition initiatives and the R&D efforts mentioned earlier. Given how far we are from the next tax season and the competitive environment, it is too early to share specifics regarding both our fiscal 2017 initiatives and our margin expectation. That said, we are not moving away from our long term EBITDA margin guidance of 28% to 32%. We will provide more details on the operational changes and financial expectations at our investor conference in December.","Finally, I have reorganized my leadership team. I have flattened [ph] the organization, divided it into more discrete areas of responsibility, taken on more direct reports, increased individual leader accountability and ultimately assumed a more optional role. Overall, I am very pleased with what this team has achieved in the first 50 days since the changes were implemented. They are focused on the right objectives and are working diligently to achieve them.","Karen Orosco, a nearly 17-year veteran of H&R Block will lead the sales side of the company owned assisted business and Kip Knight will lead the franchise side. Heather Watts, an experienced DIY professional will lead our DIY business.","In line with our research and development efforts, I am pleased to announce that Jason Houseworth is now our Chief Innovation Officer charged with bringing solutions to tax payers in new and creative ways. In this role, Jason will lead our cross functional organizations and is focused on innovations in the tax industry specifically around the client's tax filing experience.","And I have moved Greg Macfarlane into role where he will be responsible for all products and operations that support our retail business. Greg's operational mindset and business acumen will enable us to leverage his talents in an even more meaningful way going forward.","Which leaves me with Tony Bowen, who has taken on the role of CFO. Tony has held a variety of financial roles throughout his 12 plus years at H&R Block. Most recently he led the U.S. Tax Finance Organization working very closely with Greg and me. His institutional knowledge makes him a great addition to my leadership team and his strong financial acumen makes him an excellent choice for the CFO. I am excited about what Tony brings to our organization and I am confident that you will appreciate working with him in the months and years ahead.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Bill and good afternoon. First I would like to thank Bill and the Board of Directors for this opportunity. I would also like to thank Greg for his guidance and support. He has been a great mentor to me during my time on his team and has let big shoes to fill. I am excited about being the CFO of H&R Block. Despite having a difficult season, I know from my 12 years here at this great company with great people and what we do for our clients is important helping them with what for many is the largest financial transaction of the year.","This is a great business with a solid financial model that generates strong free cash flow and provides an excellent return on capital. I believe in the future of this company and look forward to serving as CFO.","So today, I'd like to talk about fiscal 2016 results, the financial strength of the company and my thoughts around capital structure.","First, let's talk about our results. In essence, this was a reset year regarding our financials given our divesture of the bank and a subsequent capital structure changes. Revenue decreased 1.3% to just over $3 billion primarily due to lower tax return volumes.","As we stated in our Investor conference we expected the bank divesture to have a 1 point annual impact on revenues and a 1 point impact on EBITDA margins. The actual impact was consistent with this guidance. In addition to the impact related to the bank divesture, total revenues were negatively impacted 1% due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our Canadian and Australian operations. ","Excluding the impact of the bank divesture and foreign exchange, revenues would have increased by approximately 1.5% over the prior year. Turning to assisted, return volume declines of 6% were partially offset by price increases of about 3%. ","In addition, we had a 1% increase due to improved mix as most of our volume losses were in less complex returns in the early part of the tax season. Lower tax return volume also resulted in lower overall product revenue. Despite the volume loss however, we were able to increase product attach per client. This was driven by increases in attach rates for our Piece of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products.","We also issued $1.8 million in more card in tax season 2016 and revenue per card increased 2% from the prior year to $52 per card. DIY tax preparation revenues increased 1.1% to $234 million despite a reduction in return volume.","Improved pricing and monetization efforts to n enhance product flow contributed to the revenue increase. Additionally, we improved our refund transfer product attach in our DIY online offering. Internationally, local currency revenues increased slightly compared to the prior year while U.S. dollar revenues were negatively impacted $26 million by foreign currency translation adjustments.","Turning to expenses, operating expenses increased 5.3% from the prior year, mainly due to expenses resulted from independent and franchise acquisitions and increased marketing expenses related to the early season sweepstake promotion. This was partially offset by the decline in compensation and benefit expenses driven by the decrease in tax return volume.","We completed the year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28% which is in line with the guidance provided in the mid season volume update with the issuance of an additional $1 billion of long term debt in September 2015 and the increased borrowings under our lines of credit, total interest expense for FY16 were $69 million. This represented an increase of $24 million from the prior year.","We were pleased that our effective tax rate decreased approximately 2 points to 32.6% mainly due to favorable discreet items. Notwithstanding that, we expect our long term base rate to be in the 35% to 36% range. Finally, the company\u2019s overall free cash flow for the year declined 14% to $432 million and adjusted earnings per share were $1.59.","Turning to discontinued operations, Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation of warranty claims were $65 million as of April 30. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil piercing arguments.","Next, I\u2019d like to discuss capital allocation. After divesting the bank last September, we\u2019ve returned to our historical practice of repurchasing shares and increasing our dividend. We repurchased 3.9 million shares during the fourth quarter bringing our fiscal year total repurchases to 56.4 million shares or more than 20% of outstanding shares. We remain committed to returning capital through share repurchases and though we're not going to discuss specific plans for this year, we will give more guidance later on the call.","Turning to leverage, we've previously shared that we intend to maintain investment grade metrics. We believe that to do this, we need to maintain an adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. Based on this year's fiscal results we are now in that range. As such, we don\u2019t plan to issue any incremental debt in the near term to finance share repurchases.","We will continue to evaluate the appropriate debt level as part of our overall capital structure plans going forward. Regarding dividends, the Board of Directors approved 10% increase in the quarterly dividend. This increase represents a bit of a catch up given our inability to increase the dividend during the past few years while we are regulated as savings loan holding company. ","Going forward, we are committed to an annual review of our dividend after each fiscal year. Any decisions regarding future dividends will depend on our operating results, market conditions and capital needs among other factors.","Turning to fiscal 2017, while we are focus on arresting the client decline, we have also completed a comprehensive review of our cost structure and implemented many of the cost reduction efforts Bill mentioned earlier. Because we are still in the planning process, we will provide more specifics for fiscal year 2017 at our Investor Conference in December.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill for final comments.","William C. Cobb","Thanks Tony. We\u2019ve covered quite a bit of information today. I want to emphasize that although we had a disappointing tax season, H&R Block continues to be a strong company with an experienced focused management team that will deliver better results going forward. We are taking full responsibility and are addressing the issues of last season.","You heard me say before, but I am repeating here. I own what happened and to that end, I will not receive a performance bonus this year. Looking forward, my senior leaders and I are very competitive group. We do not like to lose. We are smarter than we were at the beginning of the season and the lessons learned from tax season 2016 will benefit us in the long range. ","We are aggressively focused on arresting the client decline going forward and we will deliver strong results in tax season 2017. I look forward to sharing more about our specific plans as we get closer to the start of the tax season.","We are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger","Good afternoon, thanks. The \u2013 not much color on what\u2019s going to happen next year at this juncture, with the, Bill you had said at the beginning growing clients is the number one objective and clearly in the early season, you also said that marketing will be an area of expense reduction and you had specified initially.","I am curious what is the spend thought on marketing next year, and I would imagine you are probably going to have to consider some pricing reductions perhaps around 1040ez or a loan product being offered new, so a lot in there, but if you could just address all of the above? Thanks so much.","William C. Cobb","Scott, you always have a lot in there. So let me address a couple of the comments you made. One is, overall you\u2019re right. I\u2019m not going to get into specifics. Everything is on the table. I wanted to be very clear with all of you what our objective is and we\u2019re starting that right now and are putting plans together. I do think we can be more efficient in marketing. I think we\u2019re going to be more impactful and so that\u2019s why we will spend less next year, but I\u2019m not going to quantify the exact number.","So that\u2019s kind of the overview program wise et cetera, but let me address pricing because I do think that if you think about where the pricing piece goes, this gets to be kind of a complicated issue. I think that it is very strategic in the response we have to take, but let me try to lay out where I think we are.","One is, I do think that we are in line with our competitors. I think with some independents, we are higher priced with our branded competitors in the assisted channels, we\u2019re beneath them, but I do think that we do have pockets of clients where it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re going to have to take a different approach to our pricing, because I think that there are some value initiatives that we\u2019re going to have to look closely at on a surgical or strategic basis.","I think having said all that, I do believe we still have the ability to take price increases, but I do think that they are going to be modest as we go forward.","Scott Schneeberger","And then Bill just following up, any consideration and I am sure what you provide, but the next year for EITC clients, there is a mandate that refunds will be delayed until February 15, and that will likely cause probably a bit of a change in behavior and also potentially an opportunity, you did address some of the products out there in the early season. Just what are your high level thoughts on that dynamic and not that you\u2019re going to share too much about consideration for such a product but anything that you\u2019re thinking on that level? Thanks.","William C. Cobb","Again, no specifics, but I do think you\u2019re on what I think is going to be a big change in the market next year. I think this is going to be well known in the market, I think this will be in the mainstream press that refunds are delayed due to the tax act, past February 15 I do think that is going to have an impact on the market and we plan to take advantage of that.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay, thanks I'll go back. ","William C. Cobb","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","Hi, good afternoon. So when you talked about your initiatives to improve, you noted that they will be funded through the cost reduction plan. So should we take this as the cost reduction plan will be ex-dollars and all that will be put into kind of incremental ways to drive to drive an improvement then in top line?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I think what I'm trying to convey, Thomas, and again I'm not going to \u2013 we\u2019re not going to quantify this, when we get to the investor conference we're usually much more specific on our plans and the puts and takes, but I did want to make it clear that we did take an aggressive posture on cost reductions, because we knew as the season started to unfold that this was not turning out the way we wanted it to.","So I moved quickly in March and April to be aggressive on cost reductions. But I also wanted to convey to everybody that we are not at the -- as you go aggressively, a client growth or arresting the client decline, that\u2019s going to cost us something. So I wanted to be able to balance the savings that we get from cost reductions with what we believe will help to offset the cost of trying to drive our client growth up again.","Thomas Allen","Okay then my follow-up question, I mean I understand your reasoning for now want to give more detail on the plan given competitive rationale and \u2013 but in reality I mean your assisted volumes have been down 3% to 6% for each year for the past four years. So I\u2019d like just for the benefit of investors, I mean can you give us anymore anecdotes on how you think you can turn that around given the fact that this has been a four-year decline not just a one-year decline?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I think we've even noted this in one of your recent reports. We were very focused on profitable growth. That obviously needs to continue to be part of our arsenal, but the decline in the early season has been tough for us. So I think we have to address that most specifically the decline in the 1040EZ client and the TC client, so that is where a lot of our efforts will be spent.","Thomas Allen","Thanks Bill, it\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Gil Luria","Yes, thank you. So in terms of the product obviously you're not going to talk about what your product decisions are going to be for next year, but how much of a factor do you think the refund advances were in terms of what your competition did vis-\u00e0-vis the volume declines? And is there a path forward that doesn't include matching that offering and just the same on the DIY side, is there a path forward that doesn't include matching fully free given the impact that that\u2019s had last couple of years?","William C. Cobb","So with regard to the first question, we believe our estimates our goal is little hazy, but we think about a million routes we're done between the independents and JH and Liberty. So we think the number was in the range of about a million routes. So I think it did have an impact on us, and I think we have to bring that into consideration.","With regard to Absolute Zero, this past, if you go back to this time last year, we were reporting results in line with Turbo in terms of the number of returns and our revenue on a percentage basis was actually higher. We chose to stay with the same strategy for this upcoming year and it didn't work they outplayed us as I said. ","So again I'm not going to comment specifically, but we are quite mindful that Absolute Zero is here to stay and we'll have to figure out how we're going to react to that and obviously we're in the process of doing that right now.","Gil Luria","It sounded like you may have wanted to provide more guidance on the buybacks. Should we assume that if you're not raising new deck that means that the plan for the buyback going forward is for to be at the level of free cash flow less dividends or something less than that?","William C. Cobb","Why don\u2019t I let Tony handle that?","Tony Bowen","Yes, so as we said in the comments we're still committed to share repurchases. We don't feel it's appropriate right now to issue additional debt to do it. We're not going to talk about specific timing or amounts being our share repurchases in this upcoming year though.","William C. Cobb","But I do think with regard to buybacks Gil, I think we had indicated in our conversations previously that we will, we would be tempering that going forward really having nothing to do with the debt load. We did have a, we think we are substantially complete this opportunity sharing their on the franchise side and but I think overall we\u2019ll be looking at doing less acquisition and buybacks in the fiscal 2017?","Gil Luria","Then just a quick modeling question, how much did the franchisee acquisitions contribute to revenue growth this year?","Gregory Macfarlane","Yes, so we haven\u2019t disclosed the specific amount, but it was a material amount to our revenue this year consistent with FY16.","William C. Cobb","15.","Gregory Macfarlane","15, excuse me.","Gil Luria","Thank you.","William C. Cobb","Thanks Gil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning or good afternoon. Can you elaborate on what's changed this year in the independent market that\u2019s allows them to capture more market share from HRB compared to earlier year and are there new structural trends that perhaps you haven\u2019t talked about that are emerging, does that concern you?","William C. Cobb","Yes, George it is harder to get information about the independent market. We generally have to wait for further information from the IRS so, I don\u2019t have a great insight for you on that but we are anxious to dive deeper into that. ","George Tong","Okay, you\u2019ve indicated that Absolute Zero is likely here to stay. Can you discuss your interest in capturing volumes that they are not connected with material revenues, this is a pivot from your early decision to move away from the 1040EZ offering pre-filing?","William C. Cobb","I\u2019m not sure I fully understood your question, can you either repeat it or revise it?","George Tong","Yes, so are you interested in capturing volumes that really have low monetization value?","William C. Cobb","Here is how we see it. We cannot, the volume decline we saw on both sides of our business last tax season, we cannot sustain that. We do not want to be in that direction. So we have got to be aggressive on recapturing clients and we are calling and arresting the client decline. We do believe the early season decline has been a particular problem for us and we are committed to try and reverse our trends in that area specifically, but overall.","So, again I'm not going to say specifically what we are going to do, but I think and what I\u2019m trying to do is provide what our objectives are, what our priority is, where our focus is and then will talk to specifics as we get to the tax season.","George Tong","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Anjeneya Singh","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Bill, on the commentary that you made on the execution issues, you referenced that you guys have a recently moved to resolve them or have results on them, can you give some more specific examples of the execution or things that went wrong?","And when do you think you guys can get to market like growth and assisted? Is 2017 the year that we perhaps you guys maintain share and grow in line with the market and perhaps this is further out but the UBIs think that these initiatives or settings that they are perhaps even above market growth?","William C. Cobb","Yes, and again let me I\u2019ll get to your execution point, but let me address the I\u2019m going to at this point give any specific numbers on what we think it we\u2019ll do in terms of client growth. We have to stop the bleeding. We have to turn north. We have to and ultimately as I've said in the script, we have to grow clients and so that, whether that\u2019s in 17 we\u2019re still modeling everything out, but the direction of my team has been to be very aggressive.","On the executional front and as I've said I own this, I drove all these initiatives. We missed on this sweepstakes. It underperformed. I don\u2019t think this is our best year in marketing. I think that from a sales perspective I think our field team, everybody worked hard and everybody did that but we do not capture new clients at the rate that we have in the past. So, I don\u2019t think our efforts at the local level we\u2019re very strong. I think there were some executional hiccups also. And on the DIY side, well I think we\u2019re very pleased with our product performance and our reviews continue to show what a strong product we have that matches up very well with TurboTax. We just did the combination of marketing and really attracting new clients work.","So I was talking to somebody recently and I said, normally in business a few things hit and a few things miss and you hope you move ahead and every once a while you hit on everything. Well this was a perfect storm that wrong way. Virtually everything, whether it be foreign currency, the reset year with both, I mean everything went the wrong way here. That is why I think ultimately this was a bad tax season. This is way I\u2019m approaching it.","We are going to turn this around. We\u2019re going to fix this, but it was one bad season is the way I really look at it. I think in other seasons, we have had some plus and minus stuff and we\u2019ve been able to move forward with the credible results, this year they were unacceptable and we\u2019re committed to turn that around.","Anjeneya Singh","Okay, got it. And as we think about the timing of the initiatives that you guys are putting in place, is it right to think that all of them will be done in place for fiscal 2017 tax season? And I\u2019m also trying to understand why were they not previously done? Were they deemed too insignificant to be done and now you've found more opportunity or is it something else?","William C. Cobb","Yes, frankly I\u2019m not going to look back. I mean I can kick myself all day for I should have done this and I should have done that and we didn\u2019t, we missed. We are going forward aggressively. My plan is to have everything in place. Now as I said there are also some tests we\u2019re going to put in place because I want to make sure that we are set up for fiscal 2018. I\u2019m not putting all the, because I think that we have to look at this on a multiyear basis, in a highly seasonal business like this and you've heard us talk about that with a seasonal business in the S&P 500 when you miss, it hurts and it hurts a lot. ","So we will not only be looking to, I think that anything we want to do in 2017 on a national basis, we will be able to do, I don\u2019t see any impediments to that and in addition to that, we\u2019re going to be testing some things that I think will have some great impact in 2018.","Anjeneya Singh","Okay. Got it and one final quick one from me, you mentioned the portion of your client base that you may have to take a different approach on, can you sort of help us understand what portion of that client base, what portion that comprises of your client base and do you think that may compromise your ability to get pricing of 3% that you\u2019ve been able to get in the past few years? Thanks.","William C. Cobb","So, I do think as I said earlier, I think the early season client is one that we are addressing will be addressing aggressively. I also stated earlier when I think I was talking to Scott that we do believe and we've got to be strategic that we will have an ability to still have pricing as a positive aspect of our revenue, but I think it\u2019s going to be more modest as we go forward and much more surgical in terms of the way we apply that.","Anjeneya Singh","Okay. Thanks a lot for your time.","William C. Cobb","Thanks Anj.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Your line is open.","Michael Millman","Thank you. So following up on some other things, other questions, talking about the independents obviously, correct their share assisted was up, to what extent do you think it\u2019s pricing that is doing this much more than FFO or take much more than say routes for example?","And also you've talked about how clients actually for the last several years, and you talked about something on the other side of the coin, retention, particularly retention in different categories EZ and 40A and the 1240? And then finally ACA, should we lower our sights very significantly on the impact that ACA is going to have on you and the industry? Thank you.","William C. Cobb","Okay. Thanks Mike, let me try to take that one at a time. On the independents, I think a couple of things will apply there you mentioned pricing I think that has an impact. I think we - as I said earlier, I think we need more information on exactly what has happened there. It is tougher to get in the independents space.","I think a lack of minimum standards, which I continue to talk about as one of our top two government relations initiative continues to hurt us, because I think part of independents is fraudulent providers. But I again, I don't want to spend a lot of time on fraud. We continue to work on our government relations initiatives that is \u2013 but we have to focus on executing better. So we need more analysis on the independent space, but obviously we don't like to see them growing while we're not.","With regard to retention, our retention continues to be very strong. There was no change and our issue this year with the lack of attraction of new clients. So we were not able to get the new client push that we've seen in the past, but our retention continues to be quite strong. And then finally from an ACA perspective, I do think frankly, we were surprised by this year's results. The number of enrollees had gone up almost 50% to $11.7 million, and frankly we had very little change in the amount of clients that are impacted. Last year we had 16% client impacted, this year we have 15%.","We did have more clients, who were completing their premium tax credit. But to say that this was expected was is not true, we were surprised ourselves. I do want to say though a few things. One, the exchange continued to grow. There's nine million people enrolled in these exchanges this year, it's almost 13 million people enrolled in 2016. I think the \u2013 I think there has been some non compliance in checking other boxes, because IRS auditing efforts haven't begun. They're going to begin this summer. IRS is going to be able to match with all the 1095s to people who did not file correctly. So I think you will see more stepped up awareness that the IRS is coming after this.","I also think that with our focus on early season volumes, I think that is going to help us also. I think with our miss in the early season, it has hurt us on the ACAPs. So I believe that in the long term this is still a tailwind for us. I think this is going to continue to grow. I think it's still going to be a positive for us. Frankly, I think we had a bump this year that there we're a little surprised at, but I think in the long run this is still a benefit to H&R Block.","Michael Millman","As a benefit to you and volume, do you think there also as much a price benefit they have thought particularly TurboTax looks about how basically that you fold in the questions and their software? ","William C. Cobb","Yes, as stated we\u2019re making, I think that we have not seen a shift between DIY and assisted in terms of people seeing more complexity. And we'll just have to keep evaluating that as we go forward.","Michael Millman","Thank you.","William C. Cobb","Thanks Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Bill, earlier you said it was I guess a perfect storm in terms of things going the wrong way, but yet at the beginning you\u2019ve talked about H&R Bank divestiture going well. Were there are any issues there that my approach to this tax season and you\u2019re going to improve next year?","William C. Cobb","No, and again, nothing ever completely goes, now that was actually, that was actually good. I think the results were within our expectation. We had said, we thought it would be in the $35 million to $40 million impact on EBITDA. It turned out to be $35 million.","So from a financial perspective it worked fine. I think our partner [indiscernible] executed very well. I think it was seamless for our clients. So no, there is, no there was no impact from the bumpy [ph] relationship with regard to our results. We just with the client decline had less Emerald cards, less refund transfers and that was not an impact because of our relationship with Bumpy [ph].","Jeff Silber","Okay that\u2019s good to hear. And on the increasing dividend, I\u2019m just curious why 10% is our specific target in terms of dividend yield or other metrics that you're looking at that we should use going forward to see what potential dividend increases you might have? Thanks.","William C. Cobb","Excuse me, let me just step back on this, because I think it's an important aspect, and I think many of you have been asking for us to comment on our dividend policy. For years, we have not been able to issue dividends as we or issue any change in dividend because of our, being tied up with the bank and Dodd-Frank. So we have not commented on any kind of dividend policy or the like.","When we left the bank in September and came out with our capital plan, we said we would talk about dividends at the time when we think it\u2019s appropriate which is every June. And what we committed to is, we will have an annual review of the dividend in June because that\u2019s the time of year, three quarters of our revenue or more are in the fourth quarter that\u2019s the appropriate time for us we discussing any change in the dividend. So we are committing to investors that we will have that annual review.","Specific to this year we felt that early on in my tenure we did increase the dividend 33%. We hadn\u2019t done it for almost four years. So we thought it appropriate for us to do a 10% increase at this movement that will be effective with the dividend payable July 1. So, that\u2019s what we announced today was a 10% increase and that we will have an annual review of the dividend every June.","Jeff Silber","And I'm sorry, is there a certain payout ratio that you are targeting that you came up with the 10% number?","William C. Cobb","Yes, we have not Jeff just come up with, I mean let me put it this way. We\u2019ve committed to an annual review. We\u2019re not going to get into payout ratio or anything else. We\u2019ll take an assessment of how the tax season went, what our situation is, what are market conditions and then be transparent in terms of what our position is going forward.","Jeff Silber","Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.","William C. Cobb","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks for taking the follow up. I\u2019m curious, certainly there were some execution pause this year and it has been well highlighted on the call. But I think there is more speak of that and less own discussion of may be some structural industry pressures possibly tied to fraud prevention that might have disproportionally impacted the large branded store front and assisted providers relative to those mom and pops. And Bill, you mentioned you don\u2019t have great data, but could you just address that as far as those two dynamics vis-\u00e0-vis each other and magnitude? Thank you.","William C. Cobb","Yes, I can Scott, this issue of fraud I think is having an impact, a big impact on the assisted business, if you start with EITC and the disproportionate documentation requirements and all the improper payments tied to the EITC. It is very clear that people are using digital DIY method because they don\u2019t have to answer same questions. It makes no sense to me and you've heard me talk about this. So that\u2019s one piece that I think has impacted the assisted business and also the lack of minimum standards. So I think that is the other piece we talk about.","Now, I do think there are some things that are going to happen, not wishful thinking that is going to help the assisted business and ultimately I believe help us. With the IRS moving to matching W2 matching income, matching W2s to tax returns that is going to come into place this year that will have a positive impact on the assisted business.","Also as we talked about earlier, with the [indiscernible] Act, with refunds being delayed through the middle of February that could have a benefit for the assisted business if done in the right way. So I think there is some things that are going to start to happen that may lessen the impact of fraud on the assisted business, but at this point, I think it\u2019s still until those documentation requirements are equalized, I think it\u2019s tough for the assisted business.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks for that. And then one more if I could, the - still maintaining the long-term margin guidance, you didn\u2019t touch on fiscal 2017, I\u2019m guessing we will get some magnitude at Investor Day in December, but not I think \u2013 I think and it was only your tenure year the last time there was a large OpEx reduction, you quantified it as year-over-year. I believe it was $85 million to $100 million which you achieved and it was in the context of, hey we\u2019re going to reduce the operating expenses year-over-year it didn\u2019t touch on revenue and or anything else.","So it was say to provide without sharing too much information, I\u2019m just curious why you \u2013 why you chose not to share any magnitude on this call and provide it in that nature like last time?","William C. Cobb","Yes, you have a great memory Scott and a great database, but no that\u2019s fair. We chose not to because I think we\u2019re in a different situation. I think we're in a situation where as we amend our strategy, just say we are going to get much more aggressive on the client side.","We need to figure out the balancing act between the cost reductions flowing through and those that are going to help us fund the client acquisition efforts. Obviously you answered your own question. In December, I think we'll certainly be very forthcoming in terms of how we think the whole thing adds up, but at this point we chose not to give that specific number as we work through the balancing act here.","Scott Schneeberger","All right, thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that brings us to the end of today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks.","William C. Cobb","Thank you everyone for joining us on today's call and this will conclude the call."],"3451":["H&R Block Inc.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Colby Brown, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. On the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO and Tony Bowen, our CFO. Today, we will discuss our fiscal 2017 second quarter results, our thoughts around the upcoming tax season as well as our financial outlook. During our prepared remarks, we will be presenting slides via the webcast, which will also be available on our Investor Relations website following the call. We have also posted today\u2019s press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we will discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I will remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management\u2019s expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.

During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up, after which they may choose to jump back in the queue.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Cobb","Thank you, Colby. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. I am extremely excited for the upcoming tax season and as we shared some of our plans today, I will hope you will be as well. I am proud of my leadership team and the dedication and tenacity they have shown coming off a challenging season. We have been hard at work developing and implementing a comprehensive and aggressive plan designed to deliver stronger results in tax season \u201817. That same spirit and dedication is echoed in the thousands of hardworking associates throughout H&R Block. I am now entering my sixth tax season and the level of enthusiasm displayed for the upcoming season is the best I have seen. I recently attended our company and franchise conventions and was motivated by the energy level of the attendees. We are all ready to deliver.","Before diving into why we are energized for the upcoming season, I\u2019d like to outline what we intend to cover during today\u2019s call. First, we will have a short discussion about our second quarter results. Then I will provide some thoughts around how we will define success in both the short and long term. Next, I will share some key elements of our plans for the upcoming tax season. Tony will then review our second quarter financial results and our financial outlook for fiscal year \u201817. And finally, I will close out with thoughts on why we believe H&R Block is such a compelling investment.","With that, let\u2019s talk about our second quarter results. Overall, we are on track with our financial plans and Q2 results were in line with our expectations. We are pleased to report an increase in revenue and an improvement in both operating expenses and our pre-tax loss. Now that we have hit the halfway point of the fiscal year, we are starting to realize some of the benefits of our previously announced cost reduction efforts, which will not be fully realized until year end. And with our plans for this tax season now set, we have identified the areas in which we will invest to be successful. Tony will talk more about this later.","I am also pleased to discuss some good news in the fight against tax fraud. The public-private collaboration through the IRS Security Summit made a positive impact last year, as demonstrated by a decrease of over 50% in the number of new people reporting stolen identities on federal tax returns. We will continue to make progress this season through stronger authentication measures in the DIY category and better information sharing among tax software providers.","In addition, the Protecting American from Tax Hikes, or PATH Act, will take effect this season. The IRS will now have additional time to review tax returns containing the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit before processing refunds. While this will delay refunds for as many as 15 million tax filers until late February, it will help cut down on inaccurate or fraudulent returns, which is something we fully support. So, there has been a great amount of progress in the fight against tax fraud, but the work is far from complete. As an example, taxpayer safeguards, such as minimum standards for return preparers, have not yet been implemented. We will continue to advocate for the honest taxpayer in this fight.","While we are talking about the industry, let me address something many of you have been asking about the past few weeks, the recent election results. First, we congratulate President-elect Trump on his election victory. We look forward to working with Congress and the President-elect\u2019s team in the coming months. Some within the investment community committee have expressed concern about the possible negative implications for H&R Block that might result from the new administration\u2019s policies. I would like to take a moment to provide an alternative viewpoint to these concerns.","Like you, we have been listening closely to the comments of the President-elect and his nominees for key cabinet positions. Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin has talked about the desire to lower corporate tax rates and to have a middle class tax cut that includes increased Child Tax Credits and other rebates. There has also been discussion of limiting mortgages and charitable deductions and raising standard deductions. So, as you can tell, there are a lot of moving parts. On the Affordable Care Act, Health and Human Services nominee Congressman Tom Price has talked about repealing the ACA and replacing it with a new program that could include refundable credits. The President-elect is on record for wanting to retain certain aspects of the ACA, such as coverage for dependent children up to age 26 and covering people with preexisting conditions. It\u2019s also our understanding that any proposed changes will not impact this tax season and as media are reporting, they may not be effective for 2 or 3 more years. While there are many questions about changes to the ACA, we don\u2019t expect there to be a material impact to H&R Block, regardless of the outcome.","Finally, potential changes to the corporate tax rate, specifically reducing the rate to as low as 15%, could be a significant benefit for H&R Block. Given our historical effective tax rates in the mid 30% range, such reductions would have a material positive impact on our net income and cash flow. So as you can tell, the dialogue on tax policy is far from vague. Mostly, what we have heard is from the incoming administration, but Congress will have a great deal to say too. Regardless of the outcome, people will still need help to sort through the changes and the impact on their taxes. Thus, I am absolutely certain of one thing, taxpayers will continue to need and want H&R Block\u2019s help. The tax code was much simpler when this company began in 1955. People wanted our help then, just as they will in the future. We remain laser focused on helping our clients this coming season, the season after that and for many years to come.","Shifting gears, let me talk about our plan for the future, specifically focusing on defining what success means to H&R Block. Ultimately, return volume is key to how we will measure success. We understand this and are focused on addressing recent client losses, but this is not something that can be solved in one season. To that end, we would like to share you with how we are defining success in both the short and long-term.","In the short-term, we are focused on arresting the client decline. In our assisted business, given the losses we have experienced over the last several years, it is unrealistic to think that, in 1 year, we will be able to move from losing clients to client growth. We believe, however, that we will be able to significantly reduce the client loss this year as we move toward client growth in the future. And for our DIY business, we do consider last year\u2019s performance to be an anomaly as we were able to successfully grow clients for 5 consecutive years prior to last tax season.","In the long-term, our goal is to grow clients in both the assisted and the DIY categories. To accomplish this, we are approaching assisted tax preparation in a different way, by focusing on enhancing our client service delivery model, which really hasn\u2019t changed much in decades. In DIY, we have made significant progress in our user experience over the last several years, as validated by the strong independent reviews we received last tax season. We are building on this progress by adding more client friendly features designed to improve the DIY tax preparation experience.","While the objectives I just outlined center on arresting the client decline this tax season and growing clients in the long term, they must be accomplished while maintaining our financial health. We are a financially sound company with enviable margins, strong free cash flow and a solid balance sheet and we intend to stay that way. So let\u2019s talk more specifically about the changes we are making to achieve this success. We have been hard at work this preseason developing a winning approach for tax season \u201817, which includes changes in all customer facing areas of the business including our sales and service model, promotion, pricing and products and market. I will now talk specifically about each of these areas, providing details on what we plan to do and how we believe these plans will translate into results.","Let\u2019s start first with sales and service. After last season, it was clear that changes at the office level were necessary. This included a new approach at the local level regarding how we attract our clients and improvements at the tax desk or how we serve our clients. Ultimately, it was time for cultural changes in both areas. From a sales perspective, we have spent the preseason emphasizing with our field management and associates that not only is delivering excellent service important, but that they are also the best sales agents for our brand. We have provided trading opportunities to enhance their sales skills, develop new sales programs, including a B2B sales plan in which we are partnering with local and national businesses and hired experienced sales managers to further the sales culture. Our field leadership has been energized by this new approach and I am extremely pleased with the level of engagement we have seen today.","So while that addresses how we can drive client volume at the local level, we also recognized that we need to enhance the client experience once they are in our offices. Our service delivery model hasn\u2019t changed significantly in decades and we felt it was time to deliver a fresh new approach to tax preparation. We know from our market research that consumers want a more dynamic, personalized and engaging experience, which we intend to deliver. We expect most of those changes to the client experience to occur in the second half of the season. So you will hear more about this later this fiscal year.","In addition to instilling a sales and service mentality, we have also addressed gaps in our product and pricing strategies this off-season with a particular focus on early season assisted clients and DIY tax filers. I will address our three most significant efforts in these areas the Refund Advance, our free federal 1040EZ promotion and free DIY. Starting with the Refund Advance, early season clients typically have a compelling need for cash and want to access their tax refund faster than the customary two weeks to three weeks. The impact of the PATH Act make further increases need as refunds for over 15 million early season filers will be delayed until late February. In tax season 2017, H&R Block\u2019s Refund Advance will directly meet that need. The Refund Advance is a no-interest, no-fee loan that provides our clients quicker access to their cash. We work hard with our bank partners to develop a program that will be seamless for the client, built into the tax synergy and will provide the best product and service experience available. Tony will cover the details of this offer later during his remarks.","The next offer on our lineup is the reintroduction of our free federal 1040EZ promotion in our retail offices. The market is not the same as it was when we last offered this promotion. Specifically, the competitive landscape and the fight to attract simple tax returns has changed dramatically over the past couple of years with the introduction of numerous DIY free product offerings. For similar returns, free is now the norm rather than the exception. That said, we believe that there are tax filers using a free DIY products who would prefer assistance, but are swayed by the free offers in the digital space. The free federal 1040EZ offer will address those taxpayers\u2019 needs, providing tremendous value and driving filers to our offices during the early part of the tax season.","Finally, given the changes in the DIY category, we recognized that to compete, we had to reevaluate our pricing structure. Last year, our product lineup and pricing did not align well with the competition. As such, we have made changes to our product line and are now offering a free federal, free straight \u2013 free state product for 1040EZ and 1040A returns. But it\u2019s not just about the offer. We are also stepping up our game in terms of the product. We are excited about the new features and capabilities we will offer, such as the ability to easily import last year\u2019s tax return from any other tax preparation service or provider or the capability to take a picture of your W2 to easily import your information and get started quickly. With a user experience that can stand up to any in the DIY category and the right products at the right price, we believe we can achieve DIY client growth this season.","Now that we have discussed our approach to sales and service and our pricing and product changes for this season, I will mention a few things about our marketing efforts. We know that last year, our message missed the mark and did not yield desired results. Thus, we spent the preseason working to ensure that we better understood the value that clients are seeking and aligning our value proposition accordingly. What you will see is a more cohesive marketing approach for H&R Block with a new look, a new tone and a new value proposition that will appeal to tax filers. Additionally, we will more efficiently allocate our resources. We have eliminated programs that were not yielding results. In tax season \u201817, we will have lower marketing expense overall, but it will be spent more effectively. We will communicate our new assisted products and promotions timely and loudly and our messaging will be stronger in our DIY business with a goal of driving awareness and highlighting our value proposition in that category. So I covered a lot of ground describing our vision of success and the changes we are making to achieve our objectives.","I will now turn the call over to Tony to talk about the details of the second quarter look \u2013 second quarter results and to provide a financial view of the upcoming season.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Bill. Let me start by taking a few minutes to review the results of the second quarter. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of our business, the results in the second quarter are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Additionally, this will be the last time in which year-over-year comparisons for the quarter are impacted by the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the capital structure changes, which occurred last year. In the quarter, revenues increased approximately 2% to $131 million, primarily driven by foreign exchange in our international operations as well as improved product revenue in the U.S. Total operating expenses decreased from the prior year by $23 million or 6% due primarily to one-time costs of $21 million incurred in the prior year related to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and our capital structure changes. Even excluding this impact, operating expenses declined due to our cost reduction efforts, which were mainly realized through lower compensation and benefits. Partially offsetting these reductions were occupancy and amortization expenses related to franchise and independent acquisitions in the prior year. The favorability in revenues and operating expenses were partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of the long-term debt issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and prior year gain on sale of securities. Netting all of the changes, pretax loss improved 4% or $9 million.","Our income tax benefit was lower in the quarter primarily due to a lower base tax rate. As a reminder, a reduction on our tax rate will be beneficial for the full fiscal year, but reduces the benefit in quarters in which we record a loss. I will provide additional thoughts on our income tax rate when discussing our outlook for the fiscal year. Finally, loss per share increased $0.13 to $0.67, which was entirely due to the reduction in share count as a result of our share repurchases over the last 12 months. As a reminder, in quarters with the loss, reducing the share count negatively impact the loss per share.","Turning to our balance sheet, there are a couple of areas I would like to highlight. You may recall that H&R Block Bank owned a mortgage portfolio to satisfy regulatory requirements. When we divested the bank, we decided to retain the mortgage portfolio as market conditions were not favorable at that time. Given improving market conditions, we have now decided to sell this non-core asset and have moved mortgage loans held for investment to held for sale. We expect to complete the sale in the fiscal third quarter and receive cash proceeds of approximately $190 million, which is above current book value of $183 million. This allows us to streamline the balance sheet and accelerate cash flow, which we will fold into our overall capital allocation approach.","In the second quarter, we also continued to take advantage of the current share price, repurchasing 7.6 million shares at a total cost of $168 million. In total, we have repurchased 9.6 million shares for $217 million in fiscal year 2017. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing shares as a component of our overall capital allocation strategy. As we look forward to tax season 2017, we are very excited about our new offerings. Following the announcement in late October regarding our Refund Advance product, many of you have inquired about how the product will work for the consumer and what the financial implications are for H&R Block.","So, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the details. The Refund Advance is an interest-free, no-fee loan available to our assisted tax preparation clients. We have partnered with our existing bank partner BofI and MetaBank to offer this consumer-friendly product. From an operational perspective, we feel it is important to make the application and approval process as easy as possible for our clients. To obtain the loan, the client completes the application at the tax desk during the preparation of their tax return. The tax professional then submit the loan application electronically to MetaBank for loan decision. Loans will be made in the amounts of $500, $750 or $1,250 and most approved clients will have funds loaded onto the Emerald Cards within 24 hours. This will be a seamless process for our clients.","H&R Block will pay a fee of $32 to $36 on average for each loan, which is intended to cover loan origination fees, servicing cost and expected losses among other items. The fees will be recorded as a cost of revenue and will not be passed along to our clients, either upfront or on the back end. Franchisees will pay H&R Block a royalty for each loan at an amount slightly lower than the fee H&R Block is paying BofI and MetaBank. And while Refund Advance will not directly increase revenues, it will provide a tangible benefit to our clients and positively contribute to Emerald Card revenue and volume. Ultimately, the financial results of the program will be dependent on the number and mix of clients electing to take a Refund Advance.","One final note, to ensure we have the appropriate level of funding in place we have secured an additional $200 million of capacity from our Refund Advance partners under the same economic terms as the original agreement. This brings our total available funds under this program to $1.65 billion. We are excited to offer this valuable product that will appeal to many early season assisted tax filers.","Turning to our financial outlook, let\u2019s start by discussing return volume and pricing. As Bill mentioned, we don\u2019t expect to grow assisted return volume this tax season, but we have the right strategy in place to deliver client growth over the long-term. We do, however, expect to significantly reduce the client loss this tax season. With regards to assisted pricing, let me walk through some of the specifics. Given the changes in the competitive landscape we discussed earlier, free has become the new norm for the simple tax return. As Bill mentioned, we will be offering the free federal 1040EZ promotion in the early part of the tax season. Other forms in our assisted business will see moderate price increases, recognizing we cannot expect to arrest the client decline and ultimately grow clients while aggressively increasing price. We expect these changes to result in a flat to slightly down net average charge in our assisted business when compared to the prior year.","Turning to our DIY business, we believe that last year was an anomaly. And with the enhancements to the user experience, changes in pricing and increased awareness, we can grow clients this tax season and beyond. In terms of DIY pricing, our approach the past couple of years has varied from the market leader. For example, our free products did not include EITC or a free-state return. In tax season 2017, we will be more aggressive in our approach, which will require modifications to our product lineup. By making changes, such as including EITC in our free product, we will better align with other providers in the marketplace and appeal to more DIY tax filers.","The changes to our product lineup, coupled with our free federal, free-state promotion that Bill discussed, will result in a lower overall net average charge this season for our DIY business. This essentially represents a bit of a reset year for us with regard to pricing, especially in our DIY business. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate the optimal pricing model to achieve client growth, while not sacrificing the overall financial health of the business. These pricing changes, coupled with our promotional efforts, including the Refund Advance, will make us more competitive in both the short and long-term.","Turning to EBITDA, to offset the incremental expense of these initiatives, we have announced cost \u2013 we announced cost reduction efforts in June. I am pleased that as a result, we will continue to maintain a healthy EBITDA margin. When considering these changes as well as the ongoing impact of the bank transaction, we are setting our expected long-term EBITDA margin at 27% to 30%. We anticipate fiscal year 2017 to come in at the lower end of this range, which is comparable to last year\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.6%.","I will now move through other areas of our financial statements. Starting with CapEx, we are capital light with minimal investment needed to run our business successfully. After peaking in fiscal year 2014 due to needed office improvements, CapEx levels have moderated to levels we would expect for the foreseeable future. In fiscal \u201817, we expect CapEx of approximately $90 million to $95 million. Long-term, we expect CapEx to run at approximately 3% to 4% of revenues.","In regards to acquisitions, over the past 2 years, we have purchased approximately 600 locations that were previously franchised. These acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our trading multiples and as such, are accretive to earnings. As we have discussed in previous calls, however, the opportunity for franchise acquisitions will moderate while we expect to continue similar levels of independent acquisitions. We anticipate closing out the year having repurchased approximately 145 franchise locations and acquiring 65 independent locations for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $60 million.","Moving to depreciation and amortization, given the level of franchise repurchases and capital expenditures, we anticipate fiscal year \u201817 to be the peak year at approximately $175 million to $180 million. In general, approximately two-thirds of our D&A is CapEx-related while the remaining one-third is related to acquisitions. In regards to capital structure, you will recall \u2013 you will recall that last year, we made significant changes issuing long-term debt and putting into place our $2 billion line of credit. I am pleased that we were able to extend the maturity date of the line of credit an additional year to September 21. And regarding our overall level of debt, we continue to target adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA levels of 2.5x to 3x and are currently within that range. We believe this will help us achieve our stated objective of maintaining investment grade credit ratings metrics. Following these capital structure changes last fiscal year, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million.","In regards to share repurchases, the year-to-date weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding, at the end of the second quarter, was approximately 218 million shares. This number will decline on a full year basis due to the weighted average share calculation as our shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were approximately 212 million. As I mentioned earlier, going forward, we will continue to purchase shares opportunistically and have approximately $1.3 billion of our $3.5 billion share repurchase authorization remain.","Finally, we continue to do a lot of work around our corporate taxes. And going forward, we expect our long-term effective tax rate to be approximately 34% to 36% with fiscal year 2017 coming in at the low end of this range. Note that, this range does not consider any implications of future corporate tax reform, which as Bill mentioned would likely be positive for the company. I am excited about what we have in store for this upcoming tax season and beyond and I look forward to sharing the results with you after the third quarter.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Bill for some closing comments.","Bill Cobb","Thanks, Tony. I thought it was important to share all that detail regarding our plans and outlook, so thanks again, Tony. Before I conclude, I want to address the personnel change that we just announced in an 8-K filed this afternoon. Greg Macfarlane, our Senior Vice President of U.S. Retail Operations and Products, has decided to leave the company at the end of this month. Earlier this year, he transitioned to an operating role and performed as his usual high level, as evidenced by his many contributions to our tax season readiness. He will be missed. But we have a strong bench of leaders who are ready to seamlessly take over Greg\u2019s responsibilities and execute our plans in season. Personally, I want to thank Greg for his leadership over the past 4.5 years in both his current role and previously as our CFO. I am grateful for his many contributions and his friendship. We wish Greg all the best as he pursues the next phase of his career.","Now, I would like to wrap up by spending a few minutes discussing why we believe H&R Block is a strong long-term investment. H&R Block offers investors an opportunity for growth, value and stability. We participate in an industry that offers predictable and consistent growth. Tax filings in the U.S. have historically grown at 1% to 2% and we expect that to continue. Our Tax Plus products contributed over $400 million of revenue in fiscal year \u201816 and are a differentiator in the marketplace. While the addition of the Refund Advance product does not generate standalone revenue, it is expected to positively impact client volumes and increase the usage of other key products, such as our Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. Opportunity for growth in the DIY tax preparation category continue, we are the number two player in the category and are well positioned for future growth. And as a reminder, H&R Block is the only tax preparation company that offers taxpayers the ability to complete their taxes in whatever way they choose. Whether that be through assistance, using a DIY method or options that incorporate aspects of both methods, H&R Block provide solutions for all tax filers. And finally, there continues to be growth in the international space. Our operations in Canada and Australia provides tangible value to H&R Block and the opportunities we are cultivating in India will benefit us in the long-term.","From a value perspective, we are taking measures to ensure that our growth will not come at the expense of the bottom line. By taking the previously discussed cost reductions to fund client growth initiatives, we are able to maintain enviable EBITDA margins. We run a capital light business, which requires minimal infrastructure investment to operate successfully. In fact, our return on invested capital is consistently in the top quartile of the S&P 500. And ultimately the excess cash we generate is returned to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. This fiscal year, we announced a 10% dividend increase. We paid quarterly dividends consecutively since going public over 50 years ago and deliver a strong dividend yield well above the average in the S&P 500. Finally, regarding share repurchases, since the start of my tenure, we have repurchased approximately 102 million shares for $2.7 billion. Including dividends, total cash returned to shareholders over this time about \u2013 amounts to $3.9 billion, which is more than double our net income over the same period.","In closing, I want to thank our shareholders, last year was challenging and we appreciate the support you have shown. Although we believe we have a plan that will deliver stronger results in tax season \u201817, we understand that plans are just that and it\u2019s what we deliver that matters. We are playing to win and we look forward to sharing this season results with you after the third quarter.","With that, we will now open the line for questions. Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities.","Gil Luria","Good afternoon. So I see you are giving us EBITDA margin guidance, in terms of revenue guidance though, if you are talking about not quite stemming the loss of volumes and having prices flat to down, is there going to be enough offset in digital, international and financial products to create any type of growth in revenue or should we expect overall revenue to decline in this fiscal year?","Tony Bowen","Thanks Gil. Yes. We are not going to provide specific guidance for the overall revenue number, obviously. I think ultimately, it will depend on the mix of clients what the final growth is in both our assisted and DIY business. To your point, we do have some upside potential from product revenue. Obviously, the franchise buybacks that we have been doing will also provide a benefit, but we are not going to put a specific revenue target for the upcoming season.","Gil Luria","So then as a follow-up, in terms of the cost of the Refund Advance, $32 to $36 a loan, it sounds like order of magnitude, if you lend out the entire $1.65 billion, that\u2019s about $50 million of costs, did you say that\u2019s going to be contra revenue, where are we going to see that $50 million come out?","Tony Bowen","It will be in cost of revenue.","Gil Luria","In cost of revenue?","Tony Bowen","Expense.","Gil Luria","Yes, okay. Thank you very much.","Bill Cobb","Thanks Gil.","Operator","The next question is from George Tong from Piper Jaffray. George Tong, your line is open. The next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta","Hey Bill. Hey Tony. Tony, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the EBITDA margin guidance, just to understand better, did you say it was going to be flat compared to last year or did you say at lower end of your 27% to 30% guidance, so more closer to 27%?","Tony Bowen","Yes. So the range Kartik is 27% to 30%. We think it\u2019s going to be at the lower end of the range for this upcoming season, which \u2013 the statement I made was comparable to last year, which we ended at 27.6% on adjusted basis. We didn\u2019t provide the exact number, but it\u2019s in the 27% range.","Kartik Mehta","Okay. And then I guess \u2013 I know in the past, you have not talked about cost cutting, but I look at what you are doing to drive clients the free RAL, the free 1040EZ, the free DIY and you are anticipating probably flat to slightly decline in pricing and so I am wondering, can you provide a little bit more detail about the cost cuts you are making so that will allow you to kind of stay in that 27% EBITDA margin range?","Bill Cobb","Yes. And Tony if you want to add anything at the end here, so part of what we have not specified exactly where the cuts are, but you can see from our numbers in the release, etcetera, our comp \u2013 compensation and benefits expense is down. As I said in my remarks, marketing expense will be down. There are also field expenses that will be down. So overall, when we did the cost reduction efforts last March and April that we announced in June, they were comprehensive. They were across the board and they were in anticipation of knowing that we are going to have to get very aggressive with some of our offers. So those are some of the specific areas that we are reducing, but at this point, we are not ready to talk about the exact number. I will add \u2013 and hen Tony, if you want to add anything. As you know, given that 76% of our business, our revenue is down in the fourth quarter, the large majority of the expense reduction will occur at that time, which is when we do our business.","Tony Bowen","Yes. I think to Bill\u2019s point, we aren\u2019t providing the specifics on the cost reductions. It\u2019s obviously netted in our EBITDA margin outlook, but it really allowed us to be aggressive this year with adding the Refund Advance, bringing back 1040EZ, being aggressive in DIY, but we aren\u2019t breaking out that each individual line of the cost lines \u2013 cost items.","Kartik Mehta","Great. And just one last question Bill, Free 1040EZ, you have tried it in the past, then you decided not to do it again, for a while, you are bringing it back, I just wanted to kind of walk through what\u2019s different this time, why bring it back, what did you learn and how will you do it differently?","Bill Cobb","It\u2019s little hard to do it differently. It\u2019s free. I think what changed Kartik was the industry. Obviously, Turbo got very aggressive with simple returns. We had many more offerings in the DIY space and in the assisted space, again simple returns. So I think to look back and try to project forward, it was a different time and a different place. There wasn\u2019t the proliferation of free offerings. Now there is so for us to compete. And I think part of what we are trying to indicate in our \u2013 in how we are going forward is we are trying to compete across all filers, across all taxpayers throughout the entire season. So that is the difference, but we are \u2013 it was successful for us in terms of driving a number of clients and we think it will be successful again. Again, we do have in the offices, other ways to monetize that client. We actually have more ways than we had back then, such as the addition of the Tax Identity Shield, but we are \u2013 that is part of the reason we brought it back, but effectively, it was competitive conditions.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you very much.","Bill Cobb","Thanks Kartik.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger, your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger","Sorry. Hi, good afternoon, can you hear me?","Bill Cobb","I know this is going to be the first time in history Scott that you are quiet.","Scott Schneeberger","The mute button. I guess first question for you guys, a few moving parts, a lot of moving parts. It does look like it will be a challenge on the low end of the EBITDA margin guidance. So, I am curious just \u2013 if you would be so kind as to kind of rank order your priority of delivery, a 27% handle on EBITDA margin, arresting client growth or of relative pricing, although that\u2019s probably fixed going into the season. How do you rank order those, Bill, as far as what you would like to deliver to the extent you can control? Thanks.","Bill Cobb","Yes. Scott \u2013 and Tony, if you have a different approach, I don\u2019t view it as a rank order, we have crafted this plan, a lot of modeling, a lot of iterations, but this is designed to come together to yield a margin, as we said a couple of minutes ago, in line with where we wound up last year, but with a significant change in the client loss on the assisted side and client growth on DIY. Now, any change of this magnitude as aggressive as we are going, volume and mix will be indicators of this and we will adjust as we see forward, but we want to deliver across the board on what we have talked about here. So, I am not sure \u2013 and Tony, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add. I am not sure I would characterize it as rank order as opposed to this is a thorough and complete piece of plan.","Tony Bowen","The only thing I would add, Bill, is I think it\u2019s a balance. I think it\u2019s a balance across the financial health as well as changing the trajectory of the clients and we have talked about that from the beginning. I think that plan does exactly that. So, we haven\u2019t really thought about them as trade-offs, but more of a balance of price, investment and promotions, cost reductions and ultimately maintaining a good EBITDA margin. So, it\u2019s really a balance across all aspects.","Bill Cobb","And Scott \u2013 and again, these are \u2013 this is a qualitative factor. I made some comments in there. We are playing to win. When I was at the convention this year, we have a charged-up franchise and company teams. The sales and service move has been a big move for us with our company operations. So, I would like the fact that as we go forward with this plan that we just talked about, it\u2019s being done in a way that we are going to swing the bat this year.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay, great. I am curious on the Refund Advance loans, it\u2019s going to be tricky to maintain. Obviously, the client is not responsible for the bank fees, the tax preparer is. So you have new and existing clients that are going to take these. This is essentially a tool for a client acquisition. How are you managing that in delivery? Are you able to manage that in delivery? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Yes. Ultimately, the approvals, application and approval process will be ran by MetaBank. We have got estimates from them on what we think that\u2019s going to be. And to your point, this is a client acquisition vehicle for us. We are trying to drive new clients into the door. We do think that we are going to get some uplift in retention from prior clients as well, but the ultimate success of the program will be how many incremental clients we bring in during the offer period.","Bill Cobb","And when you have a client decline like we had last year, Tony is absolutely right, new clients are going to be the key. We want to make sure prior clients came in, too. So, we do not limit this. We want this to be a thorough offering. We want to create traffic in our offices, excitement in our offices. Tony and team did a terrific job working with our partners on upsizing the capacity. So, we are ready to go forward on January 9.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. And one more follow-up along the Refund Advance theme, the \u2013 you mentioned franchise buy-in. Do you have 100% franchise buy-in or participation in the Refund Advance? And I believe I heard they will be contributing in something less than that $32 to $36 per \u2013 Tony, could you just confirm that maybe elaborate to a little bit more? And then part of this question is also \u2013 it sounds like you have lower marketing expense last year. You had the sweepstakes that, I believe cost about $35 million. So, all of these initiatives we speak of are going to be less than that in the whole caboodle. If you could just \u2013 whatever you can share there, Tony? Thanks.","Bill Cobb","So, let me try to make sure I captured all that. So first of all, we are not going to disclose the specific around the franchisees. Let me say that the take-up of participation on this is extraordinarily high. I am not sure it\u2019s at a record, but it is extraordinarily high in terms of franchise participation and obviously, it\u2019s 100% on the company side. In terms of the cost to the franchisees, we are not going to give the exact number. I think Tony said it in his script, we gave you the \u2013 what the cost of each loan will be. The franchisees will pay a fee per loan. They will not participate in other costs. And they have been receptive to that, so that they can really have cost clarity around that, but I am not going to give you the exact number. With regard to marketing expense last year, our marketing expense was \u2013 in the K was $298 million. What we are saying is based on the reallocation we have done, the elimination of certain programs, etcetera, we will have a lower number on that line when we are finished with the tax season. However, I do think as I said we are taking a different approach to marketing, it\u2019s going to have a new look, a new tone, a new value proposition and impact matters along \u2013 and I think we will have impact. I don\u2019t think people will miss our offers as we go forward.","Tony Bowen","Yes. The only thing I would \u2013 and I am not sure exactly where you are going with your question, Scott, but the Refund Advance cost that we are paying are not part of marketing when we are setting that up. So, I wasn\u2019t sure if you were tying that back to Refund Advance, but it\u2019s really outside of marketing. But marketing, excluding Refund Advance, will be down this year.","Scott Schneeberger","It\u2019s all in OpEx though, right, Tony?","Tony Bowen","Correct.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay, thanks. I will pass it on. Thanks, guys.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","The next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Good evening. So, the biggest surprise for me for the quarter was the buybacks. So, can you just talk a little bit more about it? A) What\u2019s your leverage today? B) You are going to realize the gains from those mortgages next quarter. Did you kind of pre-fund that? And then c \u2013 or did you do buyback ahead of that? And C), are you going to be buying back during tax season this year?","Tony Bowen","Yes. So, I think it\u2019s just generally about buybacks and how we are thinking about it. So we have now done about \u2013 little less than $220 million for the first two quarters. As we have talked about, we are going to opportunistically buy when the price makes sense. You said \u2013 I think you said you were a little bit surprised. I think it\u2019s in line with our expected capital plan over the next several years. Obviously, we are not going to talk about what we are going to do for the remainder of the year, but we will opportunistically purchase as we have said. And I think that covers most of it.","Bill Cobb","Well, I think Scott \u2013 Thomas also asked, will you be buying in tax season? Last year, we did. And again, I am not going to commit to whether we are or we aren\u2019t, but we showed last year that we have the capability to do that. Whether we will, our stated approach has been not to disclose ahead of time whether we decide to take advantage of a price at a particular point in time, but last year we did prove that we are able to do that.","Thomas Allen","And just high level, I mean, can you just remind us of what your policy is on buybacks now? I think you guys did back away from the bigger target that you set a few years ago, right, last year? So, what\u2019s it now, the strategy?","Bill Cobb","It\u2019s a pretty big target.","Tony Bowen","We still have the $3.5 billion authorization remaining, that\u2019s through June 2019. So that hasn\u2019t changed.","Bill Cobb","Yes. There has been no backing off on that, Thomas.","Thomas Allen","Okay, perfect. And then just on the franchise and independent acquisitions, any expectation on how many returns that should add to the system in 2017? And then how many did it add in 2016? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Yes. So, the \u2013 I think you asked about the franchise buybacks and acquisitions?","Thomas Allen","Yes, exactly, franchise and independents, exactly.","Tony Bowen","So, for the franchise buybacks, obviously we don\u2019t add any incremental. We are just moving from franchise operations to company. So, it\u2019s a little bit of left pocket to right pocket. We are going to do about 145 offices this year. On the competitor acquisitions, I mean, those locations typically do 1,000 returns an office. So, we would expect somewhere in the range of 6,000 to 8,000 and that\u2019s fairly consistent over the last few years, Thomas.","Thomas Allen","Perfect. And then final question for me, with Greg leaving and Greg, you will be missed, who is going to be taking up his responsibilities? Thanks.","Bill Cobb","Yes. So, what I have done is I have moved different part \u2013 I am not replacing Greg per se. I am moving different parts of his team to different leaders. So, we are not going to talk about specifically that, but essentially, it reports in \u2013 my direct reports have absorbed some of that. So, we have kind of divvied it up. Greg had a very specific role that was really played to his strength. So what I have done is I have taken operations, areas move it to more operations people and product to marketing and things like that.","Thomas Allen","Helpful. Thank you.","Bill Cobb","Thanks, Thomas.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I want to go back to the refund anticipation and I am going to ask a stupid question. Is that only available for customers that file returns through you? And is it also available for both assisted and DIY?","Bill Cobb","It\u2019s not a stupid question and neither one. Yes, you have to file because the underwriting occurs after the return has been filed. Now, we are going to open up the ability to have a Refund Advance before e-file opens, but you still have to file the return and it is only available in retail offices or assisted offices. I don\u2019t know if there is any more detail you want to give on the...","Tony Bowen","No, I think you covered.","Jeff Silber","And when you have products like this in the past, I am just curious if you have studied the stickiness of these customers, these new customers when you get in. Are \u2013 what are retentions on this group going forward?","Tony Bowen","Yes. I mean, obviously, this specific product is new to us. We have had refund anticipation loans in the old days, but those were a very different product and frankly, that was 6 plus years ago. We would expect retention to be in line with other new customers, so people are brought in by the offer. We wouldn\u2019t expect retention to be materially different than other programs we run \u2013 that we ran in the past.","Bill Cobb","I think Jeff, the other piece that we will be learning this season is with the PATH Act, this puts a spin on this where people are delayed \u2013 well, there has been a lot of talk of refunds being delayed until February 15, the reality is that the funding to a particular taxpayer\u2019s account or card or whatever really will occur to more like late February. So, this is a number of weeks that people will be waiting for cash at a time of the year when people are really looking for cash. We think that\u2019s an advantage for this product. The other piece is this product is a \u2013 there is no interest there. And so no matter how long the refund is out, they have that access to that cash and are not going to be charged any interest there. So, from a consumer perspective, from a taxpayer perspective, it is about as client-friendly a loan as you are ever going to find.","Jeff Silber","Okay. If I could just sneak in one more, I know you are not giving specifics on the cost cut. But I am just wondering if you reviewed your office footprint, is that part of the cost cuts that we are going to see this year or is that something we may see going forward? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Yes, Jeff. We have done normal kind of trimming around the office footprint, but we think overall our number of locations will be fairly consistent year-over-year. So, there won\u2019t be \u2013 we obviously look at the profitability of all of our offices every year and always opened a few in new and expanding areas and we always closed a few that are underperforming, but it\u2019s fairly modest in the grand scheme of things.","Bill Cobb","Yes. On balance, that was not a big part of the cost reductions.","Jeff Silber","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks so much.","Bill Cobb","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","The next question is from George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Can you discuss your overall pricing strategy in the assisted category for 1040As and 1040 forms, whether the intention is to decelerate pricing growth or whether the plan is to reduce prices?","Tony Bowen","Yes. I think for this tax season, we talked about \u2013 we are obviously going to have the 1040EZ offer. The rest of the forms will see modest price increases. We are going to slow our price increases going forward. We just think it\u2019s important. I mean, given the client loss we have had the last few years, we are going to be much more slow to increase those prices in the coming years.","George Tong","Got it. And back to EBITDA margins, since most of the cost reductions will come in probably late fiscal 4Q and some of the early season promotions will start in fiscal 3Q, how do you plan the balance the puts and takes between the cost to fund the promotions and the savings associated with restructuring?","Bill Cobb","Let me say one thing about this and then I will let Tony answer the specific about funding. We still do not know what the file date is. So, with our particular business, trying to manage the quarter is not an effective straight. It really does come down to the full season. So, we can\u2019t recognize revenue until e-file opens. So, we don\u2019t know that. So, if part of your question is around quarterly performance. That\u2019s always hard to judge in our particular industry. Now, as far as funding, Tony, do you want to take that?","Tony Bowen","Well, I was trying to say essentially the same thing. I mean, we are really focused on, George, for the full fiscal year. I mean, I am not concerned about quarter-to-quarter results as much. And whether it\u2019s \u2013 what occurs in the third quarter, to your point, we are going to be going out aggressive with promotions. Some of the cost savings are going to hit in Q4. We are really focused on how it impacts the full fiscal year.","Bill Cobb","But the CLOC, if that was part of your \u2013 will be the main funding mechanism.","Tony Bowen","Yes, we have plenty of funding liquidity to fund any e-file open date, so.","George Tong","Right. I guess the question was around is there risk that the aggressive promotions will cost more than the cost that you eventually see down the line, the cost savings?","Tony Bowen","Yes. I mean, I think the biggest risk to our plan always is the client volume that\u2019s coming into our assisted and DIY businesses and that\u2019s no different this year.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Bill Cobb","Thanks, George.","Operator","The next question is from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie.","Kayvon Rahbar","Hi, this is Kayvon Rahbar filling in for Hamzah. Question for you guys surrounding leverage, how much more do you guys think you might have to be able to take on and still be investment grade? And would any of the potential future tax change implications have an affect on your appetite for leverage or decreasing it, what\u2019s your thoughts around all that?","Tony Bowen","Yes. As far as leverage, we think we are at an appropriate level now. We shared this back in June. We have no plans to issue debt in the short-term. Obviously, as EBITDA profitability change in long-term, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate, but we think the range that we are in now, which is 2.5x to 3x, is appropriate. We have no plans to do anything different. And I didn\u2019t \u2013 I couldn\u2019t quite hear you on the second part of your question.","Kayvon Rahbar","Well, is any of the speculation around the tax changes that might be out 2, 3 years from now, would that impact any of that, any of the leverage?","Tony Bowen","I think it would if they took effect. But again, that\u2019s more waiting until it actually happens.","Bill Cobb","Yes. I think \u2013 Tony has been clear that we are not seeking, at this point in time, any changes in our debt level. Now with regard to whatever policy changes emanate from Washington or state governments whatever, we will have to wait and see how that plays out.","Kayvon Rahbar","Okay. Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Anj Singh from Credit Suisse.","Anj Singh","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on that pricing question, I guess how should we be thinking about pricing, net pricing for the longer term and I guess related to that, should we expect the free 1040EZ promotion on this [Technical Difficulty] to be perennial offering?","Tony Bowen","Yes. Anj, I think you \u2013 two parts to your question. One, how are we think about pricing over the long-term, I am assuming in the DIY business and then the second part was are we assuming that 1040EZ is essentially \u2013 free EZ is here to stay, I think is your two questions, is that right?","Anj Singh","More net pricing on the assisted side, I think this year you guys are talking about flat to slightly down, but how should we be thinking about that net pricing over the longer term?","Tony Bowen","Yes. I would say this year is a little bit of a reset, because by re-launching the free EZ, I mean, it\u2019s the reason that we are flat to slightly down. The rest of our forms are taking a modest price increase. So I think going forward, we would expect essentially a modest level, which would probably be in the positive territory, because the main reason that it\u2019s flat to down this year is simply because of the 1040EZ free promotion, but much more modest going forward.","Anj Singh","Understood. And as it relates to the ACA and the percent of your filers that are impacted by the ACA, do you guys have any preliminary expectation for tax season \u201817?","Bill Cobb","I think our expectation at this point Anj is it will be consistent with last year. I think that\u2019s our best estimate at this point.","Anj Singh","Understood. And one final one for me, on DIY, do you guys have any thoughts on a new competitor that seems to be popping up and offering a free promotion, we have seen news about Credit Karma perhaps getting into the game also on the DIY side, any thoughts on how that might change the dynamics for you and the broader DIY category would be helpful? Thanks.","Bill Cobb","Yes. And there was a press release put out today. I obviously haven\u2019t spent a lot of time on it. This is a very different approach, because as I read the account of it, and like I said, I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time on it, to come out with a tax product, which is essentially the business model is we are going to sell your taxpayer information advertisers, I am not sure is going to be great. We know this industry pretty well, and people are very protective of their information on their taxpayer information. So, I haven\u2019t looked at it very closely, but that one stuck out, because obviously, one of our principles is we protect our clients\u2019 privacy. We protect their data. We do not sell data. And it looks like this is fundamentally about selling data, which I don\u2019t think is smart in tax preparation, but we will see.","Tony Bowen","Well, on the other thing I would add is, we do have a free product as well. I mean, we just said today that we are offering free fed loan free-state. So, free isn\u2019t exactly new to the space. Obviously, their offer maybe a little bit broader. I am not familiar with all the details, but we do have a free offer as well.","Anj Singh","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for your time.","Tony Bowen","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is for Michael Millman from Millman Research.","Michael Millman","Thank you. I guess I wanted to follow something from actually last quarter and that\u2019s this definition of arresting the declines. It sounds to me as you are actually saying you still expect declines. So, my question is do you \u2013 what do you mean is that your declines you expect in each of the first half and the second half will be less than last year? And secondly, how long do you think it will take before you reach the point where you are actually increasing returns in the first half and the second year? I have a couple of other things.","Bill Cobb","Yes. I mean, what we are trying to indicate in our discussion was we had a large level of client decline last year. It would be, in our view, unrealistic to think that in 1 year, we would be able to move from losing clients to client growth. We do think we will significantly reduce the client loss this year and we do believe that in the future, we haven\u2019t defined the future we will be at a position where we can grow clients in the assisted space.","Michael Millman","Again, you are talking about both in the first half of this tax season and...","Bill Cobb","We are talking about the total tax season, Mike.","Michael Millman","In the total tax season. In terms of reducing costs, some of those costs coming from the preparers. Are they having lower pay or different kinds of deals?","Tony Bowen","No, that\u2019s just really a component of it. It\u2019s more the full-time employees were impacted as we disclosed in June as well as a number of initiatives that we are no longer doing as well as, Bill mentioned, the marketing reduction as well.","Bill Cobb","No, we have not cut the pay of our taxpayer \u2013 tax preparers.","Michael Millman","And regarding the RALs and so same thing for free EZs, you are doing what the rest of the industry is doing. What was your thinking in not trying to \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s hard to be more aggressive than absolute zero, but in terms of assisted, having RALs at double $1,250 and such?","Bill Cobb","Well, I think what our approach is that we have been able to work with our bank partners and secure a very large amount of money of $1.65 billion. We are going to be able to offer clients a range of advances from $500, $750 and $1,250 on a client-by-client basis. So, we are looking to do a lot of loans to a lot of people and we will be marketing this aggressively. So, to try to \u2013 obviously, there is a \u2013 there is an underwriting component of this that we work with our partners on. There is, you can argue, a sweet spot, whether it \u2013 whether we will \u2013 we could have been $50 more or not, I am not \u2013 I think we have a terrific offer. I think we have terrific partners. I think we have a great user experience that will be seamless. It will be done at the desk and you complete your taxes. You are going to start the process right away. We believe that we are going to be able to tell people, we have to say for legal reasons, within 24 hours. But we think a very large majority of those people will find out very quickly within minutes to hours. So, I think this is going to be a very exciting initiative for us in the way we have set it up.","Michael Millman","And what\u2019s your assumption as to the percentage of potential clients for RALs that will be accepted by the banks?","Tony Bowen","Yes, we haven\u2019t disclosed specific approval rates, but it\u2019s very favorable from our perspective. We think we went with the industry leading underwriter that can provide a very good indication of potential tax liens and therefore approve at a very high rate for both new and prior clients.","Michael Millman","Okay, thank you.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Michael.","Bill Cobb","Thanks Mike.","Operator","That was the last question. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","Bill Cobb","Okay. Thanks, everyone again for joining us today and this will conclude today\u2019s call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fiscal 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would like to now turn the call over to your host, Mr. Colby Brown. Sir, you may begin.","Colby R. Brown","Thank you, Alea. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2014 third quarter results. Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Jason Houseworth, President, Global Digital and Product Management, will be available during the Q&A session.","In connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconcile the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures and the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under our securities -- under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","William C. Cobb","Thanks, Colby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we released our U.S. tax return volume through February 28, as well as our fiscal 2014 third quarter results.","As you may know, we had 1 day of return filings included in our results, and expected that we see a timing variance between the third and fourth quarters. We had a significant amount of returns pending at January 31, and you'll notice a much larger shift of revenues into the fourth quarter compared to last year.","In total, approximately $277 million of revenue shifted to our fiscal fourth quarter this year, representing completed returns that had not yet been e-filed with the IRS by January 31. When taking this revenue shift into account, you will find that our revenues in the U.S. were essentially flat to the third quarter last year despite a decrease in returns prepared. Greg will offer more details of the third quarter financial results later during the call.","With respect to the tax season, there's obviously been a lot of early noise in the market, so I'd like to provide a few key points about the industry and our performance so far this year. First, for the second consecutive tax season, we've seen some unusual movement in the industry during the early part of the season, making initial year-over-year comparisons very challenging. Most notably, IRS data has indicated that the industry has experienced an early shift in the mix of assisted and DIY e-filed returns.","During the first half of the season, however, the proportion of DIY filers typically is higher than in the second half of the season due to the fact that DIY returns are generally less complex. Additionally, as we mentioned at our Investor Day, we also believe that there's a real secular shift underway with Earned Income filers who also typically file their returns earlier in the year. Heading into this season, we've seen a trend in which returns containing the Earned Income Credit are increasingly being filed digitally. In fact, without this shift in EIC tax filers over the last 5 years, the overall proportion of DIY returns in the industry would have declined. And though the data is not segmented by filing channel, the IRS estimated in 2012 that there were between $12 billion and $14 billion in improperly issued Earned Income Credit payments.","Increased standards have been put in place to address these improper payments in the assisted channel only. If asking additional questions is a way to help reduce improper EIC payments, it makes sense that across all channels, all EIC filers, whether assisted or DIY, should have to answer the same questions. Thus, without significant changes in standards for filing DIY returns for these credits, we believe that similar shifts may continue to impact the mix of assisted to DIY filers, particularly in the early part of each tax season.","That said, we have seen this mix moderate over the last few weeks. And despite the unusual movements in the early season, recent IRS data has shown that total filings are now in line with our overall expectations for the year. The IRS just released data earlier today showing industry filings through February 28 up 1.4% over the prior year. Additionally, the data shows a continued and expected moderation in the assisted-DIY split from earlier reports. Therefore, we continue to expect total U.S. filing growth in the industry of 0% to 1%, and believe that for the full year, the proportion of filers who choose assistance versus those who do it themselves will remain relatively consistent with past seasons.","The second point I'd like to make is that we are executing very well against our objectives. You'll recall from our Investor Day in December that we detailed our multi-year Tax Plus strategy. This strategy is centered on driving higher revenues and profits through a balance of improved return mix and increased product attachment. To enable this strategy, we talked about investing in our offices to enhance the client experience and revamping our digital product to create a simplified and integrated user interface. We also introduced new product features to provide greater value to our clients and incented our tax professionals to promote the benefits of our Tax Plus products.","We entered this season with a deliberate and thoughtful plan to achieve this Tax Plus objective, and we are executing on this plan. We are smarter in our approach to the market and it's showing in our results. Most notably, we discontinued our Free EZ promotion in virtually all markets, which will result in an increase in revenues for the year. We enhanced our digital offerings, tailoring the product to each client and making it simpler to use. By better anticipating our clients' needs and matching them with the most appropriate product, we are seeing improved conversion and a substantial increase in product upgrades.","On the Tax Plus side, we've improved monetization through our financial services products with attached rates on Emerald Cards, refund transfers and peace of mind up across the board. We also continue to see improved users -- usage metrics in our Emerald Card with average deposit and reloader rates higher through the end of February compared to the prior year. And the Emerald Card continues to receive accolades. It was recently named by Paybefore, the leading information provider for the prepaid industry, as winner of their Top of Wallet and Best in Category awards as the best everyday use card with the most features and lowest cost structure.","Finally, from a marketing perspective, I'm thrilled with our campaign this year, which has served as a reminder that taxes are complex and millions of Americans leave money on the table each year by not seeking professional assistance. Taxes are more complex than ever, and with the Affordable Care Act presenting the most significant change to the tax code in the past 20 years, filing taxes will not get any easier. In fact, we conducted a study last year that found that tax returns from nearly half of Americans who did it themselves contained inaccuracies. And for those who left money on the table, the additional amount owed to them was well over $1 billion.","Our simple message of, Get Your Billion Back America, serves as a reminder that H&R Block is here to help. Based on market research, we know that our ads are resonating, as 75% of Americans are familiar with the campaign slogan, and for those that are familiar, 90% associate it with H&R Block. These results far exceeded our expectations in industry norms, and as a former marketer, I can tell you that these results are fabulous.","Put simply, we are serving an improved mix of clients this year and improving how we serve them. Of course, we anticipated that our strategy, which focuses our resources on generating revenue growth would create some headwinds from a return count and market share perspective. In particular, these decisions have an impact on our early season volume results. However, this was a volume on which we made little or negative profit in prior years. This has also freed capacity in our tax offices, allowing us to better serve our clients, leading to improved Net Promoter Scores this season.","In assisted, our decision to eliminate Free EZ in virtually all markets disproportionally impacts the first half of the season. It is also expected to impact our client counts for the year. But we expect revenue from our EZ clients to increase more than offsetting the impact from lower return counts.","Similarly in digital, we made certain changes that required some of our more complex filers who are filing for free in previous years to upgrade to a paid product. Some of these clients have opted to use our competitors free or heavily discounted offerings. It simply does not make sense for us to focus our resources in areas in which we do not generate profits.","As a result, through February, total U.S. returns prepared by and through H&R Block were down 5.9% with assisted returns down 9%, slightly offset by a 1% increase in digital returns. While it's too soon to speculate exactly where we'll land in terms of returns or share this year, we do expect that the actions taken this season will impact our overall client counts and will likely reduce our return share in both assisted and digital. It's important to note, however, that this attrition is coming from returns that are prepared at little or negative profit.","The net result of these factors is that we're achieving exactly what we set out to do, driving higher revenue and earnings by focusing on improving our service through an improved mix of clients and increasing the rate at which those clients take our best-in-class financial services products.","Finally, I'd like to discuss a topic that is extremely important to the industry and our country: fraud in the tax system. We believe the industry should be actively engaged in addressing this growing challenge and we are doing our part to contribute to the effort. We will host an event in Washington, D.C. on March 25 to stimulate conversation on this challenge among policy makers, influencers and other stakeholders.","When we last spoke to you at our Investor Day, we noted 2 specific short-term opportunities for improving fraud prevention. Applying the eligibility questions asked of our earned income credit filers in the assisted channel to those filing in the DIY channel, and IRS oversight and regulation of tax preparers and software developers.","I talked earlier to the earned income credit filers and the need for consistent standards between DIY and assisted EIC returns. So I'd now like to mention a few thoughts on the IRS oversight and regulation issue.","Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the IRS does not have authority under current law to regulate tax preparers. This, despite the fact that it was Congress who issued a mandate requiring the IRS to implement such standards.","With an ever-increasing rise in tax fraud, this ruling represents a loss for honest taxpayers. In a country where all 50 states regulate the way you get your haircut, it's hard to understand why all consumers don't receive basic protections on what, for many, is their most significant financial transaction of the year, filing their taxes.","Now earlier this week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a comprehensive set of regulations that will better protect consumers who hired tax preparers in the State of New York. While this is a positive step forward, millions of consumers throughout the U.S. still do not enjoy these basic protections. Thus, we will continue to vigorously support efforts to better serve and protect consumers through minimum standards for and the oversight of all tax preparation.","While we will continue to work with states that are considering regulating tax preparation, we look forward to working with Congress and the Treasury Department on any legislation that may be necessary to implement minimum federal standards, and we expect there to be a short-term effort to create a voluntary system for credentialing. We welcome the opportunity to work with the IRS in this interim step to set the standards and begin to get -- and begin to better protect consumers and prevent fraud.","So in conclusion, we're executing against our plans and are on track to achieve our primary objectives in growing both revenues and earnings this year. However, there is plenty of tax season ahead, and we have a lot of work to do between now and April 15. We expect it will take the balance of the season for the industry to normalize to expected levels, but we're well positioned to serve our clients in the second half and to drive improved top and bottom line results. We look forward to sharing our second half tax results with you in late April.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss details of our third quarter financial results.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the seasonality of our business and the fact that significant majority of our revenue and earnings come in the fourth quarter, our third quarter results generally are not indicative of the results we expect to achieve for the full year. This was especially true as we experience a delay to the start of the tax season for a second consecutive year with the IRS opening its e-file system on January 31. As this was the last day of our fiscal quarter, it led to a material shift of revenues from our third quarter to our fourth quarter. Thus, for the fiscal third quarter, total revenues decreased to $200 million.","For accounting purposes, we recognize the revenue from a completed tax return once the return has been e-filed with the IRS. As a result of completed tax returns yet to be e-filed with the IRS at the end of January, approximately $277 million of revenue shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. This shift was approximately $260 million more than the shift we experienced last year. Thus, third quarter revenues in the U.S. would have essentially been flat when taking the shift into account despite lower return volume.","In international markets, revenues were lower by approximately $11 million due to timing differences in our Australian operations. This overall decrease in revenues was partially offset by lower operating costs.","In total, our third quarter adjusted net loss from continuing operations was $209 million or $0.77 per share compared to $57 million or $0.21 per share in the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we continue to target adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 30%, consistent with fiscal 2013.","As we look at our overall financial position, our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. As of January 31, total unrestricted cash was $437 million and total outstanding debt was $1.1 billion. Reductions in cash from the prior quarter reflect our normal operating cash requirements. Additionally, all outstanding commercial paper at January 31 was paid off in February.","Finally, our third quarter effective tax rate was 38.8%. As we discussed in our Investor Day, we continue to focus on lowering our effective tax rate. As a reminder, however, due to significant one-time tax benefit received last year, we expect our effective tax rate in 2014 to more closely approximate pre-2013 levels.","Turning to discontinued operations which include results of Sand Canyon, our fiscal third quarter net loss of $2 million was $1 million higher than the prior year. Sand Canyon continue to engage in settlement discussions with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses relating to reps and warrants remained unchanged at $159 million.","Turning to H&R Block Bank, I realized that many of you are interested in an update as we continue to explore strategic alternatives. All I can say at this point is that we're pleased by the progress we've made over the past couple of months and continue to expect to have a transaction completed in time for the next tax season. We will continue to provide updates as we make progress.","One final housekeeping note before we turn it over for Q&A. This quarter, we've updated our reporting methodology for digital returns to be based primarily on accepted e-files. We believe this methodology is a more appropriate way to measure our performance, enhances comparability within the industry and also eliminates, from our counts, certain returns that could potentially be fraudulent. This change reinforces our position on fraud and is another example of our commitment to do the right thing. It's important to note that this is a one-time change and it does not impact how we view our share growth overall in the digital category over the last few years. We have included a table in our press release with historical return counts which reflects our updated reporting methodology.","I know we've covered a lot in today's call. So with that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Thomas Allen.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just doing some math here. According to your press release, the assisted volumes through the end of the fiscal third quarter were down 10% and you said revenues were flattish. So should we read into that, that pricing is up around 10%? And then, kind of going a step further, in the press release it says that revenues in fiscal '14 have been $200 million, and then you pushed off $277 million, and the previous year it was $472 million, so that kind of implies a 1% increase? So just trying to understand pricing or fee per return or revenue in general a little better.","William C. Cobb","Yes, Tom, let me take it and then, Greg can maybe help you with the math. I'll tell the theory. It's very hard to just make a blanket statement like that, but churn's down, pricing up. A lot of this is the component of mix comes into play. So this will be the first of probably 14 times I'm going to say this, we are in halftime of the game, there's a lot of season left to go and really, the full picture will emerge once we have completed the season after April 15. But Greg, you want to do some of the math stuff?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes, let me just talk quickly about the return counts. So really, the delta in our perspective is driven really by the Free EZ elimination. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, that those are really done at 0 or like minimal to negative value on the bottom line, but on the revenue, it was basically free. So that elimination, a lot of those people have actually are not paying us, so I guess that's the price increase, if you think of it that way, but we just think of it more of just getting rid of the promotional that we've had in the last 3 years. More broadly on pricing, we've outlined to you that we know as an industry, we've got pricing power. That's not lost on us. We go into the season, wanted to be much more strategic in how we handle pricing. We're quite pleased with how we've executed that and we'll be able to talk about that more at the end of the season with you. And also, just closing off this thought with Bill's point, which is mix is a very important part of this conversation, and we have been pleased with our mix thus far in the season.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then going on to pricing, I think a lot of us, and I think you agree that the Affordable Care Act is a big opportunity for you going forward. So just a little curious why you're willing to give up market share now given the level of customer attention ahead of kind of this big opportunity next year and going forward?","William C. Cobb","Yes. I think, obviously, well, the intersection of taxes and health care really come into bear in fiscal '15. I think what we're trying to do is get our system ready to serve the clients that we want to serve. We are very focused on this Tax Plus strategy which is having tax returns and attaching our best-in-class financial services product. So I don't look at it as by giving away our service for free, that we've given up a lot from that.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, on the bank sale. Great to hear that you still expect to get a deal done by next tax season. But can you just give us an update on how long you think you would take to get a transaction completed to get through all the regulatory requirements and everything?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes. So we remain committed to obviously selling our bank, we remain very much committed to selling world-class management products. Those 2 things aren't changing. We're simply transacting the bank for broader regulatory issues and capital issues related to the additional capital requirements that would be required. And we've been working on this for quite a while, and we actually know a lot about this specific in terms of what we're trying to sell for. As we looked last summer when we made the initial announcement with our previous partner, we'd outlined a timeline that is really announced in July, and we felt comfortable that we'd be able to commercially and operationally get things done at the time felt the regulatory process had enough time to. We had sort of felt that, that would be a mid-October, early November would be really the window that was important for us to hit this tax season. We sit here really halfway through the tax season very much just focused on executing the tax season and running our business. And we continue to believe that getting a solution in place for next tax season is going to happen at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes in the line of Hamzah Mazari.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Anj Singh dialing in for Hamzah Mazari. I was wondering if you can give us some color, one, on just more if you can be a little bit more explicit on what the attach rates and the metrics looks like on the Emerald Card that you mentioned?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I think we'll be doing that at the end of the tax season. Again, first half of the season is one part of the game. Well, all that data will be coming forward at the end of the tax season.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","I mean, we spent a lot of time in December describing all the progress the team has made on developing features and functions. We've seen double-digit year-over-year improvement in annual users. As we sort of stand halfway through the season, we're very pleased with executing that strategy. I think it will be a good story at the end of the season.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question, building on the bank sale question earlier, can you comment on what your view is on what the optimum leverage might look on the balance sheet post you being regulated as a bank holding company?","William C. Cobb","Yes. I'll go back to what Greg said, and then, Greg, if you want to comment on this specifically. Right now, we have 2 major priorities in the company, one is to put together a great tax season, and we are hopeful that, that will happen and we feel good about where we're at. And two is to get a transaction done, so that we do execute the goal that Greg outlined earlier that we'll have a bank partner by the -- by tax -- next year's tax season. That's where we're completely focused on. We are having discussions, obviously, about other elements of our business, but we're not prepared at this time to have any announcements around that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit about what -- now that we are a few months into Affordable Care Act, some of the new rules attached to it, you've been doing some trials in Phoenix, you've been -- you have an interface online for consumers to go buy health insurance. How happy are you with the results so far? Is -- are the online results better? The physical store presence resonating more with your customers? What's the update on those initiatives?","William C. Cobb","Yes, we're not going to go through specific numbers. Here's what I would say. Obviously, this whole initiative got off to a rocky start. There's now stability at healthcare.gov. I think the White House said today, enrollment will definitely end March 31 next year. We just got word, it's now going to be a 90-day enrollment period between November 15 and February 15. And the reason why I'm starting to answer your question in this way is, this is such a fluid situation. What I'm most pleased about is the fact that we are in the game, we are learning, we are talking to clients, we are seeing what matters, we're trying to reduce confusion. It is still a very hazy initiative for a number of clients. I think this is going to help us. I think we've pointed out in the Analyst Day presentation, there are 46 changes to the tax code associated with this initiative. So by being in the middle of this both for the DIY product and a direct-assisted product, we have learned an awful lot, and that really was the goal for this year. We had signaled that there would be an EPS hit of, I think, it was $0.03 to $0.04, Greg. And that -- really, that was part of the cost of getting the website up to speed, getting the offices in Phoenix ready, and really just being prepared to learn in this business. I don't know if you have anything to add in that, Greg.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","No, just an observation, Gil, to share with you. So we've outlined in December, I think, a fairly detailed explanation of why we think this is an exciting opportunity for the tax preparation industry. And now that we're halfway through the tax season, we have spent a lot of time at our competitors' locations, we've been spending a lot of time looking at the competitive offerings online. And it's our belief that the amount of investment, thought leadership that Block has done is disproportionately large than the entire rest of the industry combined, and that will benefit us as we think about next season. And I guess, I will also say that we've overinvested this year and it's highly likely we'll be over investing next year because we continue to believe this is a good opportunity for Block.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","How about the ability to charge directly for some of this? The IRS is likely to have a form next year and you charge per form. In Massachusetts, we're hearing that you're now charging for their health care form around the neighborhood of $5. Is that an indication of your ability to charge for this? Should we think of $5 as the price point? Or is there still work to do in terms of what an additional form would be priced next year at the national level?","William C. Cobb","Yes, and again, I think I don't mean to, if you will, sidestep your question, but I think we do have to see the form. And I think the issue is, there are other considerations with regard to Massachusetts as we look at this, we really need to see the form, we really need to see how that 1095s are going to rollout, which is what everybody's going to be getting along with their W-2s next year. So all that intersection, we have to figure out. So I wouldn't make any assumptions on the particular price with regard to as we true-up folks next year and assess the impact of tax penalties on people who chose not to take insurance.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","And relative to that, for what it's worth, Gil, I'll just mention, so we are charging in Massachusetts and frankly, probably should have done it historically, but part of the reason we're doing that is, I mean, we're incurring work and training time and we're doing value for our clients by that. But of course, there's broader lessons that we're trying to learn. But keep in mind that the Massachusetts form made materially different than what we see from the federal government, and that's what Bill is really trying to get at. We have to wait and see.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Kartik Mehta.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","I wanted to get your thoughts on the impact so far this tax season, at least through February, because of no Free 1040EZ. Now how much of that 9% would you say is the result of not offering the preparation of 1040EZ?","William C. Cobb","Most of it. We're not going to get in the specifics, but the large, large majority of it is that decision.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Any thoughts on how much of it is -- I'm assuming it's weather and the Free 1040EZ, or has some of the weather stuff are -- have been made up by now?","William C. Cobb","Yes. I think the weather stuff and actually, we have a young executive here who actually did a very expensive weather analysis for us, his geospatial work that he did to show the impact of how much snow has impacted literally each of the, I believe, it was 7,100 offices that got hit by snow this year. So we have a very good understanding of what the impact of the weather was. That is obviously starting to abate as the weather hopefully starts to normalize. So I think that weather, obviously, did have an impact. There were days, especially in places like Georgia, where we did 8% of the returns we were supposed to do on that particular day. So I would say that it was, again, a weird start to this season, there was for all retailers in a variety of businesses big impacts from the weather. The great thing about our industry is you have to come file. So I think, and I think we said this in our prepared remarks, everything's starting to normalize now. We've got 40 days and 40 nights left in the tax season, and we're really focused on the big finish here.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then, Bill, you talked about, obviously, pricing is going to -- or revenues are going to be higher than what return count is going to be. Would you anticipate that in the first half pricing will be better than the second half? Or will it be the same throughout the tax season?","William C. Cobb","When you say pricing will be better, I assume you mean will be a higher percentage. Obviously, now charging $39 versus $0 last year, that's a monumental price increase that will appear to be. That's why Greg was talking about earlier the mix element of that by not having -- by not giving away our service for free. That is having an impact. So as we get into the second half where we're overlapping the same pricing on something like EZ, you're certainly going to see that start to normalize. In addition to that, and again, I think it's critical that we continue to focus on what is our core strategy and back to what we talked about in Analyst Day, Tax Plus or our ability to attach these financial services products that we are so proud of, that is a big component of our revenue drive. And while we have not given specific indication, I think Greg and I certainly, speaking for the company, feel very good about the way the field and the digital business has responded to attaching products.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one final question, Bill. You talked a little bit about the online business, and I'm just wondering, the share loss you're seeing in the online business, is that strictly because of the pricing initiatives that you talked about, or is there a little bit more to it? Or maybe how you're going about marketing the product this year?","William C. Cobb","Why don't I let Jason take a shot at that.","Jason L. Houseworth","Thanks for your question, Kartik. So as Bill mentioned, we have made some changes in our product that require more complex filers to upgrade, and this has led to a significant portion of what we see is why we trail the industry for an online perspective. But what I want to say is that, I'm really pleased with the results of our product redesign. And as I talked about in December, we're in year 1 of a 2-year redesign. And this year, we're seeing better conversion of our clients and a much better job of driving the growth in our average revenue per user. But I think that you have to consider results from a competitive perspective. And what I see is that we're in maturing digital industry. And my main competitor, Intuit, I have a lot of respect for, frankly, have seen our growth in online segment share the last 3 years, and this season, they appear to be using price as a lever to grow volume. And this is likely because they see parity with us from a product perspective, and it's our viewpoint that this isn't sustainable really in the long run. So with that said, there's a lot of season left, so stay tuned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'll start with the bank guys. So it sounds like no update yet, it sounds like you're confident you're on the timetable that you've been discussing recently. Some other guidelines you provide us in the past were that you had the ballpark of 5 or 6 final suitors with whom you were looking. The first question is, have you whittled that down? Are you comfortable in saying, yes, you're the final 1 or 2 right now? And then the second bank question is, you are also comfortable telling us not too far back that we should continue to think once a partnership's announced that the dilution would be similar to what it was that over public. Do you still feel that those are comfortable guidelines for us to think about as we move forward?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes, so the message is really the same as we've been talking about. We're confident we're going to get this done. Our goals and motivations remain the same. We have wide and varied interests in doing business with Block. I'm really not going to get too much more specific at that point. But I want to make it clear that even though the message has not changed from your perspective, I don't want that to be misinterpreted. There's been a substantial amount of work in the last 3 months from our side, and we continue to feel very comfortable and confident that this will get resolved for next tax season. Now there's always a regulatory angle here that needs to be considered. We learned a lot from that last time, but we should never ignore the fact that there will be regulator approvals that have to go on here, and that, obviously, we're trying to factor into our decisions here. In terms of the form of the actual arrangement when we arrive at it, we'd be really premature to speculate on it what the actual commercial terms would be. But in terms of the general expectation, Scott, we would say we'd be fairly much in the ballpark of what we did with our previous announcement.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful on that. The -- I'm going to shift it over to tax now. Whatever went on our end of the phone is trying to figure out is how at this halftime point are revenues progressing? And Bill, one of your parting -- I think before you turned it over in the prepared remarks to the CFO, you said we are looking to drive, or I don't know if you said, but drive improved top and bottom line result, is that -- are we to take that literally in looking at the full year that you expect improved year-over-year top and bottom line results?","William C. Cobb","I think the answer is yes. I don't know, Greg, if you want to give any more...","Gregory J. Macfarlane","No, I mean, this is very consistent how we've talked about what we believe the opportunity of Block at this industry is you've got core growth every year. In this case, we think it will be 0% to 1% in terms of more returns in the industry. We continue to believe that even for the support in our view from the IRS' release this morning. The second thing is, we know we have pricing power, and that should add another point or two over time, so we sort of believe at Block that getting to 3% to 5% revenue top line is the right starting point for this conversation. That hasn't changed at all here. We, obviously, have come out of several year period where that's not been true, but the trend has been moving in the right direction. We have revenue growth last year for the first time, small growth, but still some growth. And of course, we believe from a fixed cost leverage and focus on expenses and productivity that, that should also have a bigger impact on the bottom line. We've shared with you during today's conversation that we think margins this year, EBITDA margins, will be in line with last year, which will be around 30%.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just because a bunch of my peers have obviously asked these questions, and in the same way, you obviously don't want to quantify the price impacts or the revenue impact here at halftime. But I think it's implied and what's being discussed, it will be a net positive by year end is what you're continuing to anticipate. Is -- and I think Tom has asked this, but are you comfortable saying within a couple of hundred basis points, your pricing growth is positive relative to the 9% negative? Or maybe even just talking on the total volume number of 5.6%. Is it fairly comparable at this halftime point, a little ahead, a little behind?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So I want to be really clear here that if anyone is believing that price is up 9%, you're mistaken. I think you're really misunderstanding mix and some other sort of factors that will come in here in terms of attach rate and some of the other international things. So I think you really need to be careful when -- in terms of conclusions there. We're not going to go on record in terms of what the price increase is going to be. We'll talk about that more at the end of the season. But we're happy with how we're executing our pricing strategy this year. I think we'll be in much more nuanced this year, much more thoughtful because we're in this business for the long run.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Greg, are you making a rate versus yield comment in that response? Obviously, mix is something that helps revenue per customer go up, but you're saying, hey, rate has not increased 9%, but could, in fact, the revenue per return, probably the bottom line and what people look at, could that still be in the same ballpark? I just want to make sure I understand the message.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So my comments are really focused in on the specific price, the net price or the gross price how you think about it.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on marketing, I see that, and I'm just curious if this is a timing issue. It looks like $77 million spent on that line item versus $99 million last year, please correct me if that's correct. But is that you're spending a lot less this year, or is that because of some timing of the third quarter versus the fourth quarter? And a follow-up to that is, how -- are you still -- are you looking to spend the same amount year-over-year? Are you going to get some efficiencies?","Jason L. Houseworth","Yes, I won't get into specific spending plans but what I will say is, when you have a campaign like we have with the impact it's had, with the great reception that it's gotten from consumers, you can get a lot of bang for the buck, and that's what we've gotten this year. It's a fabulous campaign, awareness is extremely high, all our field leaders are calling into our marketing group and saying, people are walking in the door saying, \"Give me my piece of the $1 billion back.\" It's really been very exciting to see. So whatever the -- if Greg wants to comment on any of the numbers, but really, what we need to do as a marketing-driven organization is really make sure that the impact from the messaging that we do is high, and I think we've certainly achieved that this year.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I could add 2 more, 1 for Jason. Jason, a comment from -- I guess, it was from Greg mentioning the new reporting format of the digital category and how that's adjusted out for what you believe could have been fraudulent returns. Could you give us the old -- how it would have been reported otherwise? Or just a way for us to think about that as we compare you to some other industry peers. And any thoughts on perhaps, I know it's a stretch, but if others had adjusted their numbers a similar way, I just want to understand apples-to-apples comparison.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So let me, Scott, if I can, just give you a bit more of a mechanical view, and then Jason can give you some broader thoughts. But I mean, the spirit of this is right, which is we're trying to really give you all the best estimate of how many Americans we help to file their taxes. And I think as time's gone on, we have missed that a little bit in some of the definitions, this change was really in the spirit of fixing that problem. It's really -- and when you kind of do the math and, by the way, afterwards if you want to -- anyone wants to call, they can go through the math with you. But in an absolute sense, the numbers have changed, but relatively speaking, they haven't changed at all. The market share gains that we've reported are basically dead on as they were before. But this, I think, is in the spirit of a much cleaner reporting. We do think it has better comparability and, of course, we're able to also spike out this fraud issue, which is a very real issue. And frankly, would be nice to see if some of our competitors recognize that as well.","Jason L. Houseworth","And, Scott, the 2 things that we really took out specifically were online free returns that were printed instead of e-filed, and returns that were e-filed but rejected by the IRS, and that makes up the approximately 600,000 reduction from the FY '13 digital return counts. And I just want to make one last point which is that there was no revenue associated with any of these returns that were counted.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","All right, guys. That's helpful. One more, Bill, for you, if I could. I know that you've had discussions with folks at the Treasury with regard to if there will be a health care form next year, and you touched upon that a little bit today on what would be delivered with the W-2. But as far as the tax form, do you anticipate there will be -- do you -- is there progress on that? Just an update would be great.","William C. Cobb","Yes, Scott. The only indications we received is that we will see the form, I think, the latest indication we have, this summer. I have certainly indicated in my conversations with the government officials that the sooner you can get that to us, the more I think we can weigh in and give advice. And maybe we'll see -- fresh eyes will see something in that, that has been received. Well -- but we have not -- none of the people in the tax institute or anything have seen the form yet. But we're hopeful that in the next few months, we'll get a peek at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Following up on some of the -- from many of the questions. Just to make sure, the IRS in counting their online, that's only accepted by the IRS, correct?","William C. Cobb","That's correct, Michael.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Regarding the billion-dollar marketing campaign, can you give us some ideas how -- what impact that's had? I guess, quantify the impact and the source?","William C. Cobb","Well, again, I think I said this, what we track is we track consumer reaction to all the ads we do. Overall, the core message, which we've obviously been very focused on and zeroed in on, for -- this was, I think, 4 weeks into the campaign, it might have been 5 weeks, but we had 3 quarters of all Americans could recite the line. It's part of the consumer vernacular right now. And 90% of the people associated with Block, which for our marketers, sometimes you have a message and you don't know what brand it is. So we've been able to hit on both dimensions which is very exciting for us.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I think I should ask this a little differently. In terms of those coming in who cite the promotion, were they coming from do-it-yourself and coming to assisted? Were they coming from other places? Or were they Block clients who said, boy, I saw this, it was great?","William C. Cobb","Yes, we don't disclose source of volume. But what I would say is, it's coming from all places in terms of the way this campaign has caught the imagination of America.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","In connection with, I guess, with the online, the assumption was that this was aimed to be online. And yes, you discussed it -- discussed the numbers, but it just seems that the IRS is 7.5% day-to-day is so much bigger than the number you cite, I guess, on a date-to-date as well. Is there some loss of share in there?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Sorry, can you just be clear what the question is, Michael, please?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","So the IRS number today that was -- self-prepared up 7.5%, and you indicated that you dropped some of nonprofitable business. I was just trying to sort of reconcile numbers, if they're comparable and you reconcile, or if you're gaining share or losing share?","Jason L. Houseworth","I'll just point back to Bill's comments as far as our strategy to really go -- to do 2 things this season. One is to look at more complex and high-value clients from a digital perspective and how do we attract those, and then the other to look at our large number of historically free clients and determine how can we create more value. And as he noted and how I also noted in my earlier comment, this decision has led to a significant portion of the delta that you mentioned.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay. Moving on, the -- you indicated a 3% to 5% revenue growth over the long term. If it's not been there, could we expect over the next several years better than 3% to 5% to get -- to average it out?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So the 3% of 5% that I outlined earlier doesn't include the ability to take market share, it doesn't include the ability to attach and grow financial services products. As you all know also, our international business is growing at a faster rate. But at this point, let's just get to 3% to 5%, and then we'll talk about what's beyond that.","William C. Cobb","Yes, and this is consistent with what Greg laid out at the Investor Day. This is, as he puts it, what we should expect over the long term, and we're certainly not talking about anything specifically about this year. We'll play the season out and then we'll be reporting to you post-season.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions.","Colby R. Brown","Okay. Thank you, Alea.

Finally, Tony will review our 2018 financial results and we\u2019ll provide thoughts on our outlook for fiscal 2019.","Let me begin by looking back at tax season 2018, starting with overall industry. Total U.S. return growth was approximately 1.5%, as expected, with assisted returns growing 0.5% and DIY returns increasing 2.5%. Consistent with prior years, industry results show a slight shift from assisted to DIY. However, like last year, it was moderate. We estimate the shift was only 40 to 50 basis points, which is less than the average over the last several years.","This moderation is likely due to the IRS\u2019s great work to crack down on fraud in the system and confirms what we hear from a large percentage of the tax paying population that they turned to Tax Pros at H&R Block for help, because they want to ensure they\u2019re getting all they deserve and they want someone they can count on should questions arise. We continue to see the primary driver in choosing a method is the individual\u2019s confidence with taxes, not the complexity of their tax situation.","Turning to H&R Block. Our goal for this season was to build on our momentum from 2017 by continuing to improve the client trajectory and we achieved that goal. We outperformed the market and took share overall and in the DIY category and we delivered improved results in assisted.","As I shared in December, we focused on three areas: improving operational execution, new products and partnerships and marketing and promotions that drive demand for the H&R Block brand. In the Assisted business, we saw improved performance driven by client retention and well-executed promotions.","U.S. assisted volumes declined 60 basis points, compared to a 2.5% decline last year and a 6% decline the year before. Retention continue to improve, increasing 65 basis points to 73%, as our clients continue to see the benefit of the help our Tax Pros provide.","Regarding new clients, while we didn\u2019t see the growth we wanted, we continue to see millennials turning to H&R Block with over half of our new assisted clients under 35 years old. And from an overall mix and pricing perspective, our net average charge grew 2%, which translated to growth in assisted revenues, as expected.","As a great example of how our Tax Pros help clients, this season we offered personalized assessments of the future impact of the new tax law. Our clients learn whether they would have paid more or less if the new tax law had been in effect for 2017, which helped them determine how to appropriately adjust their withholdings for 2018. We know due to lower withholdings it\u2019s likely many consumers will now receive lower refunds and they can turn to us throughout the year with any questions they have.","Turning to DIY, we achieved outstanding client growth overall, and we believe several factors contributed to this performance. Importantly, we make significant improvement to the user experience that are making it easier than ever to pre-populate information from tax forms and switch to H&R Block. These changes are being recognized and our products continue to receive accolades in third-party reviews.","We\u2019re also doing more to ensure that consumers know H&R Block do-it-yourself is a great alternative to others in the industry. A strong product, great value and consumer awareness is a winning combination we will continue to improve and deliver. This tax season we introduced the new online product for self-employed filers and partnered with Stride to make it easier to track expenses and lower their tax bills.","We also strengthened existing partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most, including Walmart and Amazon. Additionally, clients continue to see the value in our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows us significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free.","These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY. We saw an 11% increase in new clients and nearly 200 basis point increase in online conversion and an over 20% increase in the use of mobile. The net result is an increase in total DIY clients of 8%, driven by online growth of 10%.","We know the key strength of H&R Block is being able to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in-between. This is why we\u2019re so excited about the possibility of H&R Block Tax Pro Go and our redesign Tax Pro Review product.","By developing a technology platform to enable our large trusted network of tax professionals to serve clients virtually, we leverage a major asset in new ways and create an experience for consumers that gives them ultimate choice. Initial feedbacks from clients has been positive and our learnings will save future iterations and offerings to enable clients to start and finish their return using whatever channel or method they prefer.","The strong performance across the H&R Block portfolio translated to positive results. Overall, U.S. clients grew 2.5% and total revenues increased 4%. EBITDA margin was at the high-end of our guidance range and earnings per share increased $1.02 to $2.98. Of this increase, $0.85 was due to a lower corporate tax rate resulting from the recently passed tax legislation. Tony will cover this in more detail.","In summary, we are pleased with our results. Our focus on operational execution, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotion help drive these results and will inform our plans as we look to fiscal 2019.","I\u2019d like to now shift gears and provide an update on the enterprise strategy work that\u2019s underway. When I joined Block, I challenged the team to go deeper than we have in the past and to think differently about our business. Over the last six months, we\u2019ve taken an objective and analytical look at every aspect of our business, as well as the consumer trends and truths that will inform our future plans.","We\u2019ve taken an inventory of our strategic assets, those tangible and intangible elements of H&R Blocks that can be more fully leveraged. And we reviewed nearly two decades of history to gain a very clear picture of where we\u2019ve been and what we\u2019ve gotten right and wrong along the way.","Our work has confirmed that while we have a trusted brand, we have opportunities in which we can improve such as brand relevance and new client growth. By addressing these opportunities from our current position of strength, we\u2019re setting our company up to achieve sustainable growth over time.","We came out of fiscal 2018 with a large client base in two straight years of improved results in both our Assisted and DIY businesses. Our client retention is very strong, the new client growth is not where we wanted to be. We have the opportunity to improve to do greater differentiation, a stronger value proposition and ensuring the client experience is delivered seamlessly and consistently across all our channels.","We continue to be the only tax company that can serve clients however they want to be served. This create opportunity to further improve our cross-channel experience for technology and tax pro\u2019s need.","Our financial position is strong with a solid balance sheet and significant cash flows. By using the resources wisely with a focus on investing in our business for the long-term, we can position Block for a successful future. And while it\u2019s easy to think about a simply U.S. tax preparation provider, we currently have a diverse portfolio of products and services both within and outside the tax event and across the number of countries. We have opportunities to leverage these assets even more.","For example, we have an emerging expat business that caters to the taxpayers living abroad who are required to file U.S. tax returns. Many of our offices are driving growth through bookkeeping and business services. Clients turn to us year around for help resolving issues when they receive a letter from the IRS. And our Tax Plus suite of products, including among other things, Emerald Advance and Emerald Card provide opportunities to interact with our customers more than once a year.","The strength and opportunities we\u2019ve identified have informed the framework that will guide us towards sustainable growth over the next several years, which is driven by five strategic pillars. Within these five pillars are specific initiatives the tactical work that will occur each year, we expect the initiatives to evolve over time, but the strategic pillars will remain constant to ensure we\u2019re taking a multi-year view of our business and will be a guide for how we talk about H&R Block going forward.","The first strategic pillar is to elevate our talent and culture. This simply about investing in our people and ensuring that our leaders are equipped with a training and tools they need to help us deliver the best possible experience to our clients. It\u2019s also important culturally to recommit to serving and connecting with communities where we do business a hallmark of our founders.","Second, we will own a sustainable brand position by delivering compelling value for clients to differentiate and demonstrate why we\u2019re the best choice for help. H&R Block is a well-known brand that is trusted in synonymous with tax. And while our strong history has positioned us well, we aren\u2019t as relevant as we need to be to today\u2019s consumer.","By differentiating ourselves and demonstrating why we are the best choice for consumers, we will position H&R Block as a modern brand with momentum. Part of this involves making sure our clients see the value they expect for the price they pay. Simply put, we\u2019ve been too reliant on price to grow revenues. So we\u2019re challenging how we think about the value equation going forward.","Third, we will win on customer experience by leveraging innovation and personalization to give our clients the experience they want. Customer experience is essential across the spectrum from complete in-person assistance to do-it-yourself and everything in-between. We are uniquely positioned to meet the needs of consumers regardless of what channel they choose. We are modernizing our capabilities for acquiring, engaging and retaining clients and we will innovate to develop and scale seamless cross-channel experiences.","Fourth, we will build operational excellence by improving the quality and consistency of execution in our tax offices and across the organization, including simplifying our processes and continually seeking ways to improve.","And finally, we will invest for the long-term by modernizing our core technology platform, funding strategic investments and building capabilities that enable growth. Consumer expectations about how they seek and want help from H&R Block are constantly evolving, and we need consumer-facing products that not only meets, but exceeds consumer expectations.","For 2019, we have a number of initiatives that are planned or in process. We will make investments to modernize our key technology platform to enable more innovation and reduce our IT run rate spend over time. Additionally, we will invest to improve cross-channel client experiences and enhance our marketing and advertising capabilities.","We\u2019ll improve the service quality and consistency in our offices. This work is in process and we\u2019ve already started to make some changes, including our decision to consolidate 400 smaller company run offices. This action will help optimize our footprint and enable us to more effectively manage our field operations, elevate our talent and deliver more consistent quality to our clients.","Additionally, we will focus on improving the value proposition by evaluating how we price for tax preparation taking into account the recent tax legislation. These changes will require an investment in fiscal 2019, which Tony will provide more details on in a moment.","Strengthening our value proposition, modernizing key technology platforms, building brand differentiation, delivering cross-channel client experiences and focusing on quality and consistent execution are important steps. These investments coming from a position of strength enable us to deliver sustainable growth over time and ensure the help of H&R Block for the next generation of clients and associates.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our fiscal 2018 results and financial outlook.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m excited about the work we\u2019ve done on our enterprise strategy and what it means for the future of H&R Block. Due to this work, we are taking steps to ensure we can achieve sustainable growth for the long-term.","Before I provide some additional detail on our outlook for fiscal 2019, I\u2019ll walk through our fiscal 2018 results and how we performed against our expectations. Let me start with the objectives that we outlined prior to the tax season and how our performance measured us.","With respect to volume and pricing in our Assisted business, we expect an improvement in the client trajectory and moderate inflationary price increases. We achieved these objectives with the decline in returns of just 0.6%, compared to a decline of 2.5% in fiscal 2017.","Net average charge increased 2%, which was in line with our expectations. In DIY, we anticipate an increase in client volumes, along with a net average charge consistent with fiscal 2017. We outperformed expectations with overall DIY client growth of 8%, including 10% growth in online.","Additionally, we delivered a 3% increase in net average charge due to better than expected product mix. Overall, we came into the year expecting modest revenue growth, and I\u2019m pleased to report that we exceeded our expectations with revenue increasing 4.1%.","From an earnings perspective, considering our revenue growth projection and the impact of inflationary cost and investments, we expected EBITDA margin to be at the high-end of the 27% to 30% range. Similar to fiscal 2017 and as expected, we delivered a margin of 29.8%.","In summary, we achieved or exceeded all of our objectives. With that context, I\u2019d now like to provide additional details on our key financial metrics, starting with the income statement.","As I just mentioned, revenue grew 4.1%, or $124 million. U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties together increased $40 million, due to increased net average charge and favorable mix, partially offset by the decline in return volumes. DIY\u2019s tax prep fees increased $24 million, due to increased return volumes and net average charge, which was due to favorable product mix.","Regarding our Tax Plus products, we saw an increase in net tax rates overall, driven by Emerald Card, Peace of Mind and [Tax Advantage Shield] [ph]. Additionally, we increased the price of refund transfer this year, which led to a $24 million increase in revenue, balanced against a slight decline in the tax rate.","This was our second year for Refund Advance. Applications of Refund Advance increased 14% over last year and the average loan amount increased 45%, due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier. Despite these increases, we were able to keep the total cost of the program flat at approximate $30 million. International revenues increased $17 million due to favorable results and exchange rates in Australia and Canada.","Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses grew at a lower rate than revenue, increasing $88 million, or 3.8%. This was primarily due to expected increases in compensation cost related to the increase in revenue, occupancy cost and bad debt expense, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and advertising expenses.","Moving through the remainder of the income statement, we saw interest expense decreased $3.6 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year.","Regarding corporate taxes, fiscal 2018 represented a unique year for the 35% statutory rate for the first eight months of the year when we generate a loss and a 21% rate for the final four months of the year when we generate a profit. This resulted in a full-year effective tax rate of 6.3%. Going forward, we expect an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% for fiscal 2019 and beyond.","Our solid financial performance coupled with the unique corporate tax situation, resulted in a 52% increase in EPS from $1.96 in fiscal 2017 to $2.98 in fiscal 2018, up $1.02 increase, $0.85 was due to their lower corporate tax rate, resulting from the recent tax legislation.","Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon Corporation made several payments of $4.5 million this fiscal year, which were previously accrued and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal 2016. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures and the company\u2019s reports on forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.","I\u2019d now like to provide some initial thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal 2019. As Jeff shared, we have developed a multi-year strategic framework to guide us over the next several years and outline the areas we\u2019ll be focusing on for fiscal 2019. Historically, we have provided our financial \u2013 our fiscal year outlook on the December earnings call just prior to the beginning of the tax season.","This generally included our thoughts on volume and net average charge along with an EBITDA margin range. Considering the changes planned for next year, including investments in the business, as well as the impact of tax legislation on both the corporate and individual side, we\u2019re taking the unique step of providing more detail than we have historically at this time of the year.","As Jeff mentioned, we are making changes to our pricing structure, which will improve our ability to deliver value in our Assisted business and address the impact of the recent tax legislation. As a result, we currently expect total revenues to be $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion in fiscal 2019.","We will also be making strategic investments in technology, as well as operations, including charges related to our office footprint optimization. Given our revenue expectation and the planned investments, EBITDA margin is expected to be 24% to 26% for fiscal 2019.","As we previously shared, fiscal 2018 represented our high watermark for depreciation and amortization, as we see the impact of office upgrades and franchise buybacks from several years ago rollout. Thus, we expect D&A to decline in fiscal 2019 and be between $170 million and $180 million.","As a reminder, approximately two-thirds of our D&A is CapEx-related, while the remaining one-third is related to acquisitions. We expect CapEx in fiscal 2019 to be $95 million to $105 million. Interest expense will be $80 million to $85 million. And as mentioned earlier, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 25% range.","Regarding capital structure, our solid financial performance this fiscal year, along with the help from the changing corporate tax rates drove strong free cash flow of $751 million, a 62% increase over last year\u2019s free cash flow of $463 million. The reference we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures.","Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. At the top of the list, it\u2019s maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality. We didn\u2019t make investments back into the business that we believe deliver value to our clients and drive sustainable growth.","Next, we will deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. These priorities are grounded in our commitment to maintain investment-grade credit rating metrics, an integral part of our financial strategy.","I\u2019m pleased that our Board of Directors has approved a 4% increase in our dividend to an annual rate of $1, or $0.25 per quarter. This represents a third consecutive year of dividend increases. We remain committed to paying quarterly dividends and will continue to perform an annual review of the dividend after each fiscal year.","With respect to share repurchases, as we discussed on prior calls, there were no repurchases made in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, we\u2019re adjusting our prior practice and plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants in order to at a minimum prevent an increase in our shares outstanding. We believe this is an important part of our capital allocation and in addition to offsetting equity grants, we will continue to be opportunistic in share repurchases going forward.","In summary, I\u2019m excited about the changes we\u2019re making in the business as we position ourselves for sustainable growth.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Tony. We met our objectives for fiscal 2018 and deliver what we promised. We are increasing our dividend and reiterating our commitment to maintain investment-grade credit rating metrics. We\u2019ve outlined the strategic framework that will guide our efforts over the next several years and highlighted initiatives for fiscal 2019.","Now it\u2019s the right time to building our strong foundation to invest for the long-term and generate sustainable growth over time. We along with our Board are excited about the years ahead for H&R Block.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions. Ian?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, we \u2013 the obligatory question here Jeff is, with these investments, and Tony, being made in 2019 has a significant margin hit? What longer-term is they are a run rate or something that we\u2019re looking to achieve longer-term? Could you just hit nearly 30, we\u2019re chopping by, let\u2019s call it, 500 basis points. I know there\u2019s no formal guidance, but how are you thinking about that? And kind of the part B to this question is, could you give a little bit more on what the investments are? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones","Hey, Scott, it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll tee it up and let Tony chime in as well. And I think first of all, what was really important in both of those was that we start sharing information about where we\u2019re headed much more soon than we normally do, which is what we want to get the conversation started on this June call.","Ultimately, the work that we\u2019ve been up to over the last six months really gave us the sense of strength and opportunities to improve. And the big opportunities for us, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are really about relevance and a new client growth, in particular. And so while your question is specific about earnings guidance, the macro point for us is this really is about long-term sustainable growth to the business.","As we get closer to 2019 and the tax season we\u2019ll have more to share as we get closer to the season. But for now, we just believe it\u2019s the right time coming from a position of strength to start positioning the business for real long-term growth.","Tony Bowen","Yes. And as far as the investments that we talked about the new pricing structure in the Assisted business, obviously, that \u2013 that\u2019s having an impact on revenue taking into account the recent tax legislation. We talked about improving our technology. We now have a multi-year roadmap. We\u2019re going to begin to execute against to really put us in a really good place from a technology perspective. And we\u2019ve also got some one-time charges related to the office footprint optimization that Jeff talked about, all of that is taken into account in our outlook for FY 2019.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. And just a follow-on to that, Tony, specifically, will there be more updates from H&R Block prior to the start of the of next tax season with what\u2019s going to happen with pricing, or is that just going to kick in and we\u2019ll watch and see what we had? I\u2019m just curious on how much of your hand you\u2019re going to show prior to the season? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Yes. I mean, obviously, at this point, for competitive reasons, keeping that fairly close to the vest. But as we approach tax season, we expect to provide additional details on not only how we\u2019re thinking about pricing, but other promotions and details around the tax season.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. And I\u2019d like to consider all that. My one \u2013 my first question to sneak in a follow-on. You mentioned 200 company-owned locations probably at the smaller locations you\u2019re probably going to be looked at production. Just curious, it sounds like you\u2019ve done some work on that space. Jeff, what\u2019s the right amount of footprint you anticipate longer-term for the company? Thanks. That\u2019s all.","Jeffrey Jones","Yes. Scott, thanks. So it\u2019s actually 400 locations. And I think as in retail [indiscernible] at the footprint, every year is important. It\u2019s something we learn every single year. I think, one of the factors that led to kind of that number of this year was really focused on quality and consistency of execution in the offices and what\u2019s the right kind of span of control to think about our field organization to lead the different offices, that obviously led us to then go deep in terms of what\u2019s the right number, or what\u2019s the right size threshold.","And we have, because we have closed offices over the course of time, we have a really good plan in place for how we think about migrating clients to adjacent offices. And so what we have always done in the past, we\u2019ll implement that plan and move Tax Pros and Clients to a nearby location.","Scott Schneeberger","Great. Thanks for sharing that. I\u2019ll turn it over, guys.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Assisted volumes narrowed and declined this year, driven mainly by improved retention rates. Can you elaborate on the strategies you have to drive improved gross customer additions? And when you might expect to see eventual growth, positive growth in assisted volumes?","Jeffrey Jones","Hi, George, it\u2019s Jeff. Again, [indiscernible]. First, you\u2019re absolutely right. We\u2019ve seen kind of year-over-year consistent improvement in assisted volume. Retention did play into that. You think about two years in a row, we\u2019ve had success with refund advance. Two years in a row, we\u2019ve really been focused on improving execution in the offices. The second monitor the way the Tax Pros interact.","So some of the investments we have made have resulted in improved retention. As we mentioned, the big opportunity for us is in new clients. And it\u2019s a big part when we talk about brand differentiation and value proposition. It\u2019s really what we\u2019ve seen over time is, the Block brand is extremely well-known, we\u2019re synonymous with taxes. We start from a positive place.","But as the competitive landscape shifts, as consumer preference have shifted, we just realized that our promise to the marketplace is less differentiated. And so we think the key to starting to see client growth over time in assisted is actually making a really clear promise about the value that H&R Block can provide and that\u2019s what our strategy work is really intended to do.","George Tong","Gotcha, that\u2019s helpful. And Jeff, you\u2019ve outlined as a result of your strategic review over the past several months some of your key pillars and initiatives. Can you discuss what your priorities are out of all of those pillars and initiatives? And where you think there\u2019s most opportunity to unlock value?","Jeffrey Jones","Well, absolutely. I mean, the initiatives that we share really are the top priorities. And so, as you see, those range in terms of investing in technology in order to enable us to deliver a modern client experience. This, as Tony alluded to, this is a multi-year technology roadmap and it does require investment, but we also see run rate savings over time. This is essential work.","We see initiatives focused on the client experience, both improving the experience in a given channel. In assisted, it\u2019s really about just what we talked about in terms of retention continue to improve the quality and consistency of service delivery.","In the DIY channel, we\u2019ve done a really nice job of improving the product, delivering a great value and actually marketing the product in a way that people understand that we\u2019re a very good alternative and option in the category. Those two priorities are very important.","You hear us talk about cross-channel experiences and just continue to evolve Tax Pro Review, Tax Pro Go and how we serve clients really in whatever terms they desire. And then the value proposition work in brand positioning this is essential to everything we do, and this includes a look at price.","But it\u2019s really the fundamental reason and the promise about what H&R Block does is differentiated. And we think over time, we have stopped telling our own story and have \u2013 really told the story more about what you would say are the category benefits around promotions and things like that.","So the initiatives that are on the page really represents the most important priorities for the company and what the entire leadership is focused on delivering.","George Tong","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, George.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Hey, good afternoon. So going back historically, I mean, two years ago, I think that H&R Block and Jeff as before you were there significantly disappointed investors. And I feel like over the past two years, you guys have done a very good job of kind of executing and doing well. And now you guys are guiding margin down 500 basis points and you\u2019re in the difficult situation that you\u2019re not going to prove that you can only prove out your results every year once a year basically.","So like, I mean, why make such a drastic investment today when you\u2019re not going to be able to kind of show results for a couple of years when you could have done a more gradual shift?","Jeffrey Jones","Tom, it\u2019s Jeff. It\u2019s a great question, obviously, one we\u2019ve been thinking a lot about, because over the last six months, there are few things that have really jumped off the page at us.","Number one is, we are coming off two years of improved performance. And what that signals to me is our ability to execute against our commitments, and so that\u2019s the strength about the business right now. We also know from a consumer perspective, whether it\u2019s any given channel or in a cross-channel world, we \u2013 our proposition, our promise is as relevant as it needs to be, so we need to tackle that.","Ultimately, we have been a business that only thought about one season at a time. And so you see us now taking a multi-year view at how we really position the business for long-term growth. Tax legislation has been another input in terms of what \u2013 what\u2019s happened in the last year and the impact on pricing our value proposition.","So they\u2019re really just a number of different things that over the last six months, we recognized that this set the company up and position us for long-term growth. These are all things we need to start tackling now and to do it from a position of strength financially and to do it from a position of strength in terms of our ability to execute is why we\u2019re making the decisions we\u2019re making.","Thomas Allen","Okay. And then just on the 400 company offices you\u2019re going to consolidate, is there like a easy like one-time charge for that? It seems like a number that can be put together?","Tony Bowen","Yes, Thomas, it\u2019s included in the overall outlook we provided. The specific number, we think most of it will happen in Q2 as we exit those locations and buyout of the remaining lease liability we will take the charge. Right now, we expect that to be $15 million to $20 million for FY 2019.","Thomas Allen","All right. Well, thank you very much.","Tony Bowen","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. Wanted to go back to your revenue guidance for fiscal 2019. You mentioned, I guess, the new pricing structure in assisted. Is that where the bulk of the year-over-year decline is coming, or should we expect decline from some of your other line items as well?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, that\u2019s definitely a key component of it. Obviously, Jeff, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. Pricing and the value we\u2019re trying to deliver in the assisted side being a big part of it. But you\u2019re right and that is a big part of it.","Jeff Silber","And then just jumping a little bit further on the pricing side, again, I\u2019m expecting you to divulge your pricing strategy. But kind of stepping back, because of tax reform, in theory, tax returns are going to be less complex next year. And I know you typically charge by complexity even excluding your changes in prices would we have expected your revenue per assisted return to go down just because of tax reform?","Jeffrey Jones","There definitely is some impact. As you\u2019re right, we do price on complexity and there are certain clients that because of the standard deduction change mainly would have been paying a lower price. And we took that into account thinking about our overall pricing approach to the upcoming season.","Jeff Silber","Okay. And then finally, just one more, I\u2019m sorry. Would we expect, and again, I\u2019m looking at office. Are you expecting assisted volumes to continue to decline next year getting worse, getting better, any color on that would be great? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones","This is Jeff. I mean, I think the reason why we\u2019re embarking on this is the opportunity we see in the business and the goal of long-term sustainable growth and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re tackling this as holistic as we\u2019re.","Tony Bowen","Yes, I mean, just to add on to that. I mean, I think the growth is not only revenue over time, but obviously clients as well. So we\u2019re not providing specific client outlook for 2019 definitely at this point. But as Jeff mentioned over the long-term, we would expect client and revenue growth.","Jeff Silber","Okay, appreciate the color. Thanks so much.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital.","Hamzah Mazari","Good evening. Thank you. The first question is just on the strategic investment spend as well. Maybe if you could highlight, is this a one-time spend, or is spend going to be elevated next year as well and the following year? And how much of this is a catch-up? Block has had many restructuring and over the years store improvement was part of that, too. And so just curious how much of this is a catch-up versus sort of Block moving to a completely new direction?","Jeffrey Jones","I mean, I think it\u2019s a little bit of both, Hamzah. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t call it a catch-up, but there\u2019s definitely investments that we\u2019re making that we\u2019re expecting to continue to make for the next several years. The IT would be the one example on the technology side, where it\u2019s a multi-year roadmap, it\u2019s not just a 2019 impact.","That being said, we\u2019re expecting those investments to essentially level off and not like we\u2019re expecting EBITDA margin to have another decline the following year. But at this point, we\u2019re not providing a long-term guidance for either revenue or EBITDA.","Hamzah Mazari","Okay. And then just on the investments, again, is there a return that we should think about on these investments, how you think about that these in terms of payback or any other metrics that you could share? And then along side that a big part of this investment is \u2013 appears to be new client acquisition. Maybe if you could frame for us historically what has new client acquisition run at either our dollar number of your total revenue base, or however, you quantify that and what should it look like, just any color there? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, I mean, it\u2019s hard to say on a specific payback perspective. I mean, I think what these investments are allowing us to do and the changes we\u2019re making along with from a strategic perspective is really setting us up for long-term sustainable growth. And if we talk about new client continuing decline in the most recent year, overall clients in the assisted business, while much better still declining last year, and we\u2019re trying to think about what are the changes that we need to make.","So that over the long-term, not the next two or three years, but 10 or 20 years, H&R Block is still a viable company with its healthy growing revenue, growing client. So I don\u2019t think about it in terms of specific ROI in the short-term, because a none of the things are foundational capabilities that we need to position us over that longer term period.","As far as client acquisition cost, again, it\u2019s not something that we want to get into today. It\u2019s a combination obviously of not only new clients, but also continue to drive retention. We made improvements over the last few years. But we still \u2013 we want to try to increase retention, especially across the various bands. I mean, when we think about our 10-year of new clients all the way up to a 10-year plus client, we still have opportunities to retain more new clients in the second year they come back and see H&R Block. So it\u2019s obviously largely a new client story, but it\u2019s also providing a great service and consistent experience at the desk, which should drive additional retention over the long-term.","Hamzah Mazari","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman","Thank you. Over the many years, many taxpayers have used H&R Block and then going on. What makes you think that, because you make some changes that people who\u2019ve been there done that will come back? And sort of it\u2019s related, it seems that, as you suggest, assisted may be down because of the Tax Pro change simplification, for example. And it would seem investments are going into do-it-yourself. So I guess, the bottom line question is, do you see the growth in do-it-yourself, or something similar do-it-yourself and and looking away from offices, or do you see it continue people to come into the office as they have over the many years?","Jeffrey Jones","Michael, it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll teed up and let Tony chime in as well. I mean, I think, in addition to our improved performance in client trajectory and assisted over the couple of years, it\u2019s important to note that the assisted category grew about 50 basis points this year, the second year out of the last three with the assisted categories grown, I think, it\u2019s grown four out of the last eight years, if my memory serves properly.","So we definitely still see viability and growth in the assisted tax preparation business. Now we\u2019ve improved retention. We extend our client loss, but we believe that a better value proposition and more clear differentiation leveraging all the assets that make H&R Block the leading tax preparation company give us the opportunity to win back clients who may have defected for some reason or to attract net new clients who haven\u2019t yet tried us.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks and more on this as we get closer to the season, but little fact that I love seeing that give me optimism for the help of the business or things like the number of millennials who choose H&R Block assisted every year.","So one of the things that\u2019s become very clear to me is that it\u2019s not just about if someone complex or simple, I mean think about today 70% of tax filers already take a standard deduction. The majority of tax filers take a standard deduction. While the majority of tax filers also using assisted method today, we know that that shift from assisted to DIY has moderated in the last couple of years and we talked about what a couple of those reasons maybe.","So, there\u2019s a lot of evidence for us that make us optimistic about better quality and consistency, stronger value proposition, more clear differentiation are all reasons we can get back to growth. And as Tony said, that\u2019s revenue growth and new client growth and we think both of those are important to our future.","Michael Millman","Just kind of follow-up. You\u2019re not or at least this past year you didn\u2019t buyback shares. Your cash flow has been very good, as you pointed out. The tax cut helps that. Does this suggest that we\u2019re going to see some very big investments and\/or acquisitions?","Jeffrey Jones","Well, I think the first thing to suggest is, through the strategic work we\u2019ve done, we have realized that we see opportunity to improve the core business, that\u2019s priority number one. Priority number two and this is the near-term for us is that, we have many things in our portfolio today that we aren\u2019t leveraging to their full potential. I gave you a couple of examples in the prepared remarks of what those may be.","So those are priorities number one and two. Tony can talk more about share repurchase and how we think about capital allocation as part of our strategy. But as we signaled on the call, we are \u2013 we will be opportunistic again in terms of buying back our stock. Tony, anything else you want to add?","Tony Bowen","No, I mean, I think you\u2019ve hit some really good points. Obviously, we bought back a lot of shares over the last few years. We didn\u2019t buy any this year, but the year before, we bought several $100 million, obviously, a couple of billion dollars over the last three years in total.","So, we\u2019re still very shareholder-friendly from a share repurchase perspective. We raised a dividend again this year third consecutive year. So it\u2019s still a key part of how we think about our future strategy, but as Jeff said, we\u2019re really going to be opportunistic going forward.","Michael Millman","Great. Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Michael.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And at this time, I\u2019m showing we have no further questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Colby Brown. Sir?","Colby Brown","Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes today\u2019s call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you greatly for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"3441":["H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) Q1 2014 Earnings Call September  3, 2013  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Colby R. Brown - Vice President and Corporate Controller","William C.

My name is Adrian, and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the show over to Mr. Colby Brown, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Colby R. Brown","Thank you, Adrian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter fiscal 2014 results. Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Other members of our senior management team will be available during the Q&A session.","In connection with the call, we have posted today's press release and slide presentation on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures and the schedules attached to our press release and in the Appendix of today's slide presentation.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.","Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","William C. Cobb","Thanks, Colby, and good afternoon. I hope everybody had a great Labor Day weekend.","Earlier today, we announced our first quarter results for fiscal year 2014, which ended July 31. As many of you know, our off-season results are not indicative of our financial performance for the full year given the seasonality of our business. Greg will take you through the details of our first quarter earnings later in the call.","We have been hard at work this summer in planning for the upcoming tax season and beyond, and I'm very pleased with the progress we've made. We have a lot of work to do, but I'm confident that we're poised to take advantage of the long-term opportunities that lie ahead. We'll have much more to say about this during our Investor conference in December, but I'll offer a few insights today regarding the upcoming tax season, H&R Block Bank and our efforts regarding health care reform.","First, while we don't have complete information from the IRS on returns filed on 2013, we've already begun to leverage some of the lessons learned from last year. We continue to believe that many of the challenges faced by the industry last season were an exception, and we now expect IRS filings to grow around 1% in 2014. Looking ahead to this season, we have to focus on what we do best, serving our clients the way they want to be served. Our primary objective will be consistent with last year, striking the right balance of profitability and growth.","Next I'd like to talk about H&R Block Bank. Last year, we announced that we're exploring strategic alternatives for our bank due to proposed rules that would impose higher capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory constraints that would result from these proposed rules are inconsistent with our strategic plans. Thus, our aim was to exit the bank with the hope of accomplishing 2 primary objectives. One, to cease being regulated as a savings and loan holding company; and two, to find the right partner to help us continue to grow our financial services business.","We have been diligent in our pursuit of these 2 objectives, and in July, we announced that H&R Block Bank had entered into a definitive agreement with Republic Bank & Trust Company to sell certain assets and liabilities, with the intent of forming a long-term relationship with Republic to offer financial services products to our clients. We're confident that the structure we put in place and the partner we selected accomplished our 2 objectives.","As discussed on our call in July, the transaction was contingent on various closing conditions, including successfully negotiating, executing and fulfilling other agreements with Republic, and receiving the required approvals from each party's respective regulators. Prior to entering into this agreement, Republic, which currently operates under a state bank charter, filed an application with their regular -- regulator to convert to a national bank charter. This application is being processed by Republic's regulators concurrent with the review of the transaction between H&R Block Bank and Republic.","At the time of our announcement, we were hopeful, based on our review of recent bank transactions of the approvals, would take 2 to 3 months. We acknowledge, however, that it was difficult to know with any certainty how long the process may take, and as such, that there was a possibility that regulatory approvals may not be received as soon as we had hoped.","Republic has indicated to us that their regulators will require additional time to process their applications. Though both parties have done everything in their control to finalize the transaction and have made significant progress in negotiating the remaining required agreements, this development makes it unlikely that regulatory approval will be received by September 30. As a reminder, September 30 is the deadline for regulatory approval as stated in the agreement to enable the transition of the company's financial services products to Republic in time for tax season 2014. Thus, we expect to continue offering our financial services products to our clients through H&R Block Bank for the upcoming tax season.","Though we are disappointed in this development, we are prepared for it. Our bank remains well-capitalized and we've made significant progress in our financial services business over the last few years. In particular, we are pleased that Emerald Card continues to rank as one of the top amongst its competition in independent reviews of the prepaid debit card market in the U.S. This is a testament to the value our financial services products bring to our clients everyday. I'm confident that we will continue to provide consistent, best-in-class services and products to our clients this upcoming tax season.","That said, I want to be very clear. We remain focused on exiting the bank and continue to believe it is the best -- it is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders to do so. Exiting the bank allows us to cease being regulated as a savings and loan holding company and allows greater flexibility with our capital structure strategy and our ability to return capital to shareholders.","Now many of you have asked specifically about share repurchases. We have made requests to our regulator to repurchase shares over the last 12 months. However, we have not received approval to do so.","Now turning to health care. Activity has picked up regarding the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, with the health insurance exchanges opening October 1. We expect that there will be increased publicity in the coming months as Americans begin to think about their health insurance options and how their tax situation is impacted by the requirements under the new law. We continue to believe that health care reform will not result in a materially positive impact to our business in fiscal year 2014. And while we haven't received any additional updates on what new forms the IRS may employ or how some aspects of the law will be implemented, we believe Americans will need help, and that H&R Block Bank -- H&R Block is best suited to assist them in this process.","Last quarter, we talked about a nationwide program for health care exchange enrollment, as well as a pilot program that we will be running in 1 state. I'm pleased to announce that we have contracted with GoHealth, a company with extensive experience in the insurance industry, to help us execute these plans. Throughout the nation, we've joined with GoHealth to provide an H&R Block branded service that allows our clients the option of purchasing their health care insurance online or over the phone through licensed GoHealth agents. Additionally, our pilot program, which we will run in Arizona, will allow clients to be served in our offices with licensed agents on-site. These agents will help our clients understand what the new law means for them and their tax situation and will assist clients in selecting and enrolling in health insurance.","In addition to our relationship with GoHealth, we again plan to place an emphasis on our tax and health care review in all of our offices across the country this tax season. Last year, our clients appreciated the value provided by this review, and we believe it will be even more relevant this year due to the continuing implementation of the Affordable Care Act.","While it's likely going to take a few years for any opportunity presented by health care reform to develop, we have to make smart investments now to ensure we're prepared to serve our clients and meet their needs in the space.","Rolling out these initiatives will likely be dilutive to earnings by approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share in fiscal 2014. As I've said, this is a long-term play, and we'll need to be prepared when our clients turn to us for help in understanding how the new law impacts them. With our size, scale and resources, we are well positioned to serve our clients, and I believe offer a compelling and unmatched value as American seeks assistance.","Our investment today will allow us to stay ahead of the competition and ensures that we are the trusted brand for Americans as they seek to understand this newly created intersection of taxes and health care. We'll provide further details regarding our efforts in this space during our Investor conference in December.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss the first quarter financial results.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. Earlier today, we reported our adjusted net loss from continuing operations increased 3% to $108 million or $0.40 per share. These amounts exclude nonrecurring bank transaction costs in the first quarter of approximately $8 million or $0.02 per share.","GAAP net loss per share from continuing operations of $0.42 was $0.04 higher than in the previous year as increases in revenues were more than offset by an overall increase in expenses. The variance is primarily driven by increases in expenses related to the bank transaction, higher variable costs on increased revenues, foreign exchange adjustments and increased legal expenses.","Turning to our tax -- our segment results, Tax Services revenues increased $31 million to $122 million, primarily driven by an increase in revenues in our international operations of $21 million. This was due to timing differences in our Australian operation as revenues shifted from the second quarter to the first quarter. Additionally, fees for financial services increased this quarter as preliminary results indicate that Emerald Card usage is improving in the offseason. The increased revenue was more than offset by an increase in operating expenses, which grew $35 million to $266 million. This increase is due to greater variable costs on higher revenues and the foreign exchange currency losses and higher legal fees mentioned earlier. This resulted in a $3 million increase in the segment's pretax loss to $144 million.","In corporate, revenues declined slightly due to lower interest income from H&R Block Bank's diminishing mortgage loan portfolio. Operating expenses increased $11 million to $46 million, primarily due to professional fees related to the H&R Block Bank transaction, partially offset by lower interest expense. Accordingly, our pretax loss increased to $12 million to $40 million.","As we look at our overall financial position, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong. As of July 31, total unrestricted cash was $1.2 billion and total outstanding debt was $907 million. Reductions in cash from the prior quarter reflect our normal offseason operating cash requirements.","Our first quarter effective tax rate of 38.6% was up 100 basis points to the prior year, driven by differences in discrete tax items. We continue to focus on lowering our effective tax rate. But due to the significant one-time tax benefit received last year, we'd expect our effective tax rate in 2014 to more closely approximate pre-2013 levels.","Turning to discontinued operations, which include results of Sand Canyon. Our first quarter net loss of $2 million was essentially flat to the prior year. During the first quarter, new representation of warranty-related claims at Sand Canyon were $69 million. Sand Canyon completed a review of claims during the quarter with an approximate principal balance of $39 million with no losses paid.","At quarter end, total claims of $72 million remain subject to review. Sand Canyon continues to engage in settlement discussion with the counterparties that represent a significant majority of claims submitted to date. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses, relating to reps and warranties, remains unchanged at $159 million.","Before I turn it over to Bill, I want to thank all of you who took time to meet with us during our roadshows earlier this summer. It was helpful to hear your perspective, and I look forward to continuing our dialogue at this year's Investor conference in New York City.","I'll now turn the call back to Bill for our closing remarks.","William C. Cobb","Thanks, Greg. In conclusion, I am pleased with the progress we've made this offseason in preparation for tax season 2014. This year, we'll continue to focus on driving profitable growth and maximizing our value offering to our clients. There, obviously, remains much to do. But as we look ahead, I like our competitive position and believe that we have the right people, resources and expertise to continue to provide best-in-class service to our clients.","When I took this job more than 2 years ago, I told you that I joined this company because I believe not only in our brand, but in the long-term opportunities of the business. I believe in these opportunities now more than ever and feel the actions we've taken in the past few years, position us well to capitalize on them in the years ahead. We look forward to sharing additional plans with you at our Investor conference on December 11 in New York City.","With that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","I think initially when you talked about the bank sale, you had indicated that you thought it was going to be $0.06 to $0.09 dilutive. And as you look at the fact that it's been delayed, would that mean that it won't be at least that dilutive for the upcoming fiscal year? Or have things changed? Or are there other expenses maybe that you aren't thinking about that have to be considered now?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Kartik, it's Greg. Earlier this summer, when we made the announcement about the signing of purchase assumption agreements that were filed with the various regulators. We had also shared our thoughts on what the financial implications of the transaction would be. And so you're correct in that we have said that we would expect $0.06 to $0.09 per share in fiscal year 2014, and we also indicated that there be an additional $0.03 to $0.04 of one-time charges that we'd incur. Given the regulatory delay and our belief that tax season '14 will be processed H&R Block Bank, the $0.06 to $0.09 will not be -- will not impact us this year. However, the one-time cost, $0.03 to $0.04, we still estimate will impact us. In fact, in the first quarter that we just reported, you already saw $0.02 of that included in those numbers.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then I think, Bill, you talked you had gone to regulators to try to buyback shares. Obviously, they've said no. Maybe a 2-part question here, can you talk about maybe the amount of authorization you were requesting and maybe what their hesitation was, if they told you?","William C. Cobb","So no and no, the answers to the question, but I'll elaborate a little bit. No, I'm not going to discuss conversations we have with our regulator. I don't think that's appropriate. So I'm not going to talk about that. And obviously, with regard to -- there are very specific capital holding requirements that have been published. And we are obviously fully mindful of those. But Greg, I don't know if you want to add anything, but we're not going to discuss amounts.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Our team continues to be the same that we're working hard to sell the bank. And there's 2 reasons we're selling the bank is first and foremost, we're looking to find a great solutions for our clients, and we're excited about the opportunity to sit there. And so we need to find a partner that will continue to support that, which we have in Republic. And the second goal is to cease being regulated as a savings and holding company and this is really tied up in the capital requirements that were part of the Basel III legislation that was passed.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one final question, Bill or Greg, any change in strategy on the bank products now, especially with you controlling them this year, thoughts about if this year will be different now versus if when Republic was going to take control of them?","William C. Cobb","No, there's no change in strategy. The same products that we've offered in the past will continue to be offered. And that was the same whether we're able to have received regulatory approval, or as we indicated now, we are likely to use the H&R Block Bank. So the products -- remember, these H&R Block branded products, whether it was Republic or H&R Block Bank, these are the products -- it's about the client facing products and we always wanted to make this seamless, so there is no change in strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You mentioned in your prepared remarks that Emerald Card usage was improving. Can you just give us any kind of additional metrics or color you can on that?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So we're very excited about the Emerald Card. Last December at our Investor Meeting, we shared with you a lot of the features and functions that we've been beefing up. We had a tax season where we sold a lot of those cards. We continue to believe that selling more cards is an opportunity, but the real magic, the financial magic for H&R Block is convincing clients that, that card, that Emerald Card product, is fully functioning and can be used as a year-round debit card solution. And I think early results are positive, Thomas, but truthfully I think that we still have long room for improvement to get to what we sort of expect entitlement to be and this will be one that we will talk about more in December. But we don't have any specific metrics that I would want to share with you right now.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then any updated thoughts around your dividend? Do you look at it on a payout ratio basis or yield or what? And kind of are you being restricted on increasing your dividend to? Or is that kind of different?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So we, I guess, just declared again our quarterly dividend, so that's good news. As I said, as we've said before, we don't talk about specific discussions with the regulators. What we shared with you today is specific commentary we felt appropriate around share repurchases. But I'm not prepared to talk about dividends at this point.","William C. Cobb","But obviously, we've been able to continue the dividend throughout this time and plan to continue to do so.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just final one, why did you choose Arizona for the navigator program for the pilot?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I mean, there's a variety of reasons. There's internal reasons about execution, et cetera. But overall, we like the market characteristics, the demographic characteristics. We felt it was going to be a good pilot for us and a good place to do that. And it was a variety of factors, but we're excited about the team we've put in place down there and we're ready to go on October 1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess, first, probably not surprising that there's a delay, it was a pretty tight window on getting regulatory approval. I guess the key question I have, Bill, is will it be -- how comfortable are you with Republic, again not shocking on the delay, but do you feel comfortable they will be approved as your counterparty by, I think, March 1 is the next regulatory deadline? And has this increased your uncertainty? Or is it just the delay you might look elsewhere for another party?","William C. Cobb","I can give you the official legal, you can never count on regulators, but let me answer in a different way. Obviously, that is true but I feel that we still believe we have chosen the right partner. We still believe that approval will be forthcoming. We have had a very good partnership with Republic, as we've said in our remarks, we've made substantial progress in all the various agreements. And I think we've had good open dialogue with all the regulators. So there's no reason for us to feel, at this point, that this is anything other than the way you described it.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. You mentioned at the beginning, and I just want to clarify it. And then ask a subsequent question, was it IRS growth returns that the IRS growing 1% for the fiscal '14 year?","William C. Cobb","So that is our best thinking as we sit today that we think that the year was an anomaly. The hard part is we still haven't received final numbers from the IRS for 2013. And I think other tax preparers have said this, it's a little difficult to analyze. But in terms of our current thinking, we're thinking that IRS filing growth for 2014, at this point, will be around 1%. In December, not to assume that there will be any change, but obviously we'll update those assumptions when we meet with you in New York.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And a follow-up to that is how do you anticipate your performance, perhaps your revenue growth or your returns growth response, I guess, revenue would be the more desirable answer relative to IRS.","William C. Cobb","Yes. I think we're going to -- we're still heavily into the planning season. So I don't have anything to share with you on that.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, Greg, could you speak a little bit the higher legal fees within tax and then you mentioned -- and you might have broken this down, I just didn't get a chance to work it out, the sub-segmentation, the higher variable cost on the increased revenue in the Tax Services segment year-over-year. Is it -- could you piece that out a little bit more? I think you may have covered it, but just to be clear, because I thought with all the cost savings initiatives, you would have been down a lot. Just curious about the variable part and was it really the legal fees that drove it higher? What were the associated legal fees? And then I'm sorry, the long question with a few parts. But lastly, any feel for the incremental ability to have cost savings beyond the $15 million that trickled through that you had outlined for fiscal '14?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","That's okay. So in the first quarter and you'll have a chance to digest this when you get the quarterly filing here and also we'll be happy to talk through more specifically. But in general, I kind of looked at the first quarter expense numbers and see a lot of noisy things in there. The noise includes legal fees, as I mentioned, there was a foreign exchange mark-to-market that went through, the bank sale related fees of $0.02 a share, we had a timing difference with Australia, which pulled forward both revenue and expenses. But I'll first talk about expenses, you'll see increased expenses because of that. When you isolate each of those items, they're kind of smaller in the grand scheme of things. You kind of get a more normal run rate, and I'm pretty satisfied that the first quarter run rate is very much in line with what I was expecting coming out of a -- the cost work that we have done in fiscal year 2013. I think the broader maybe question you're getting at is how do we sort of see expenses shaping up for the year. Last year, we guided to about -- we said, we want to be in the 27% to 32% EBITDA margin range. Last year, we moved to 30%. And I think right now my best estimates will be in around 30% this year.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","That's helpful and that kind of -- a broad way to answer all the questions. I guess, the last one I had to follow on that, though, which we may have just covered it, this incremental $0.03 to $0.04 dilutive impact from your ACA initiative investment upfront, that is included in everything you just said, the 30% margin this year and any incremental cost reduction?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","It would be included in the 30%, plus or minus number, I just mentioned, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Would you mind elaborating a little bit on the GoHealth relationship? Is this something that would be available through your website? Or is there an aspect of it that you'll start incorporating into the store this year? Could that be a potential source of revenue this year? Or does that fall under the expectation for a revenue impact only further down the road?","William C. Cobb","Yes, Gil, let me handle that last part of your question. I mean, our belief is, as Greg indicated -- or I guess I indicated in my remarks, the $0.03 to $0.04 includes, I believe, that revenue off any of our initiatives for this year will be immaterial. Obviously, we've got pilots in place, so it's primarily an expense-driven area as we go forward in this. But we think, as I stated, it's important that we get into this issue, I think that there is an intersection here of taxes and health care. I think we are the best position. So we are going to launch our efforts in 2014. What I'd like to do specific to GoHealth is Jason Houseworth is with us in addition to, as I tell him, his day job running our digital business. He is also leading our initiative in health care, and he's worked very closely with the team with GoHealth. So why don't you describe a little bit about what they're doing, Jason?","Jason L. Houseworth","Sure. Thanks, Bill. So Gil, to answer your question, both will really be available to clients. They will be either available to go into the website for both an enrollment and plan selection, as well as in the state of Arizona, have licensed and appointed health pros or think about it as a tax pro to help clients enroll and select a health care plan. And GoHealth is just the underlying platform that will service both of those channels. However, to the client, the client will really see an HR Block-branded health service when it comes to enrollment and plan selection.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. So you will not be rolling out the platform into your stores outside of Arizona?","William C. Cobb","So just to be clear, the platform will be available on a 50 state -- I mean, it's going to be online and there will be a number through the telephone. So any one can access GoHealth. But in terms of us having insurance agents\/brokers in all of our offices, that will only be in Arizona. Is there anything you want to add, Jason?","Jason L. Houseworth","No. Good clarification. Thanks, Bill.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then I want to ask the share buyback question a little differently. Obviously, I don't want to share the specific conversations you're having with regulators. But is it safe to assume that since there's not likely to be a change in status until after this upcoming tax season that your share buybacks will be limited all the way through April 30, 2014, and we should think of it that way?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So what I'll say is that as any regulated entity needs to, we'll have to get permission from the regulator before they do any type of capital distribution. That includes regular dividends, increasing the dividends, share repurchases. We just disclosed to you that we have had made requests for share repurchases, which have not been approved in the last year. Going forward, we also want to make sure that we're not going to give-- to us, our view is we're trying to manage for our shareholders benefits and we don't want to exactly tell our clients because it's very much time-based and situational. So I don't really have a forward-looking kind of view of that for you.","William C. Cobb","And that's been consistent. We don't forecast or announce share repurchases or dividends in advance. So that's consistent with that. We thought it was important though to -- we're asked about this question in a lot of different ways that we fill you on our broad discussion that we've had with our regulator.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Michael Millman from Millman Research.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Several questions. One, just following up again on the same topic, do you intend to continue to talk to your regulator regarding distributions and share repurchases?","William C. Cobb","Well, I think -- again, I'm not going to discuss anything going forward. But we speak to our regulator often on a variety of topics.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","So following up on another on your IRS outlook, could you break that down into what you expect total returns, digital and online growth, these 3?","William C. Cobb","Yes. I think what I'd say about that, Mike, at this point without having full knowledge, we wanted to give you kind of our thinking that's guiding us as we are doing our planning. What I'd say about that is we believe that the assisted returns will be modestly below the 1% and that the do-it-yourself returns will be modestly above the 1%.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay. Skipping to something you haven't discussed is DOMA. The IRS has come out and allowed amendments. Can you talk about your thinking on how you're going to present this? I know liberty tax has come out and said they will do these amendments at no cost.","William C. Cobb","Yes. So we're -- obviously, the information just arrived. We are going through that, working on as we do with anything that comes out as a regulation change, how we'll adapt to that? Obviously, we've always had in place, so it's very natural for us to offer a free second look. We encourage anyone who this regulation might affect, come see us and we'll do that free second look. So we will plan on doing this just as we had for any of our taxpayers with their particular situation as we go forward. So it fits very well in our overall branding and executional efforts to be able to do a second look. So the same will apply in this case.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","The look is free, but is there any changes, is that charged for or is that included free?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I'm not going to talk about pricing specifically.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay. Can you maybe discuss this in a way, capital expenditures like they doubled in the quarter, can you talk about what's behind that?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","I can. So we believe and we talked last year with all the investors and interested parties that we think more longer-term about 3% of revenues is a good CapEx target. That's obviously, plus or minus. But that feels to be about the right number to refresh our stores, the client experience in the store, the hardware, the software investments that we needed to make to support our business and some other things. Last year, we were higher than that and that's really a reflection of several years where previous management, I think we had under invested in some of those things. And we believe this year also that we'll be spending more than that 3%, again, making up for some lost years there. But I think longer term, we still think that 3% of revenues is the right target for us. Specific to the timing of the quarter, just to add is timing, Mike. I don't -- I think there's nothing unusual in the first quarter to point out to you.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","And SG&A was up close to 30%. You've touched upon it, but I wasn't sure if you basically talked to it.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes, well, I mean I'll kind of circle back the question from before a little bit because the route is each individual item isn't worth talking about, except in the aggregate. But you have some increased legal fees, our mark-to-market and foreign exchange, bank fees are related to the transaction of $0.02 a share, that was a bit more material. We had a timing difference with Australia as we pulled forward some stuff, that's really just an accounting timing difference in our view. Once you remove all of that, we felt that SG&A was in line with our expectations around what our run rate should have been, coming out of the year when we took a bunch of costs out of that group of expenses.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Colby R. Brown","Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to talking to you in the future.","William C. Cobb","Goodbye.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"3339":["H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) Q1 2013 Earnings Call September  5, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Derek Drysdale - Director of Investor Relations","William C.

My name is Kenisha, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the H&R Block First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  Mr. Derek Drysdale, Vice President of Investor Relations, sir, you may begin.","Derek Drysdale","Thank you, Kenisha. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal first quarter results. On the call with me today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO.","In conjunction with this call, we have posted today's press release and slide presentation on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com.","Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedule attached to our press release and in the appendix of today's slide presentation. Unless otherwise stated, please note that all growth rates discussed today refer to the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2012.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. And as a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.","You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2012 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","William C. Cobb","Thank you, Derek, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. I hope all of you had a great Labor Day weekend.","During the second half of fiscal 2012, we completed a thorough review of our organization and made some very difficult decisions to reduce our cost structure and to drive efficiency. While our off-season results typically don't offer a lot of insight into our performance for the year given the seasonality of our business and that most of our revenues and earnings are generated in our fiscal fourth quarter, I'm pleased by the impact our cost-reduction initiatives have had to date.","On an adjusted basis, our net loss from continuing operations improved by 6% to $105 million, primarily due to reduced operating costs. Greg will take you through our results later on the call, but this quarter's key takeaway is that we continue to believe our cost-reduction initiatives will add $85 million to $100 million of pretax earnings in fiscal 2013, leading to earnings and margin expansion.","In addition to these initiatives, we've had several recent and positive developments. First, several weeks ago, we announced a new $1.5 billion 5-year committed line of credit agreement. The new agreement provides us significant financial flexibility and more closely aligns to our business needs. The prior agreements' net worth covenant and clean down requirements have been replaced in the new agreement with leverage and interest coverage tests, which better align with a consumer services company like ours.","We also recently announced a significant milestone in the company's history. Our 200th consecutive quarterly dividend will be paid on October 1 to shareholders of record on September 14. Since Henry and Richard Bloch took the company public 50 years ago, the resiliency and consistency of our business has allowed us to generate substantial free cash flow, and that has enabled us to continue this dividend streak. Since 1962, H&R Block has paid a total of $3.5 billion in dividends. This is a strong testament to our business, and I am proud to be affiliated with a company that has a long tradition of returning capital to shareholders. We expect to deliver appropriate returns of capital to shareholders for many years to come.","Next, I'm pleased to announce today that we've entered into a new partnership with Sears, which we believe will be slightly accretive to fiscal 2013 earnings. Under the new agreement, we've elected to reduce the number of Sears locations in which we operate in to focus on 112 of our best performing Sears locations. The agreement also allows us to open seasonal offices in other Sears locations throughout the country during peak tax season.","In the Sears locations where we'll no longer operate, we believe we'll retain the vast majority of our clients based on our historical experience. In fact, since 2008, we've exited more than 200 Sears locations and we've retained nearly 75% of the clients served in these locations.","To put this in perspective, our retention of all Sears clients last year was 76%. So we do not expect this agreement will have a material impact on the number of returns we prepare going forward.","That said, we're very pleased to maintain our long-standing relationship with Sears, and we believe the new agreement benefits both parties and our clients.","We also recently completed our first tax season in both India and Brazil. Our primary objective was to establish a presence in both of these markets, and our preliminary results are encouraging. While India and Brazil won't move the needle on our operating results or materially impact our capital allocation in the near future, both remain long-term growth plays. In the coming months, we'll continue to review our businesses in both markets and plan to make prudent investments focused on profitable and sustainable growth.","And finally, representation and warranty-related claim activity at Sand Canyon declined significantly during the first quarter, although we expect claim activity will continue to vary considerably from quarter-to-quarter as related statute of limitations continue to expire. The accrual for representation and warranty-related liabilities remained essentially unchanged at $129 million.","Turning to our core business, we're working very hard on our plans for successful tax seasons in fiscal 2013 and beyond. It's been a really busy summer, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making. We still have a lot of work to do, but I'm confident that we'll take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead. For competitive reasons, I won't provide details now. But I look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Conference in New York on December 6, and we'll share our plans with you at that time.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss our financial results.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. Earlier today, we reported our adjusted net loss from continuing operations improved by 6% to $105 million, primarily due to reduction in labor, occupancy and other expenses driven by our cost-reduction initiatives.","Our GAAP net loss per share from continuing operations of $0.38 was negatively impacted by $0.03 due to fewer shares outstanding in the current year and $0.01 by discrete adjustment to income tax reserves.","We remain on pace with our cost-reduction targets, which we expect will add $85 million to $100 million of pretax earnings in fiscal 2013. Given the seasonality of our business, most of the savings we expect to realize from these initiatives will be back-end loaded during our fiscal third and fourth quarters. We expect approximately 2\/3 of the savings to come from lower labor and occupancy costs, with the remainder coming from other expense categories. The total savings in fiscal 2013 should be relatively evenly distributed between cost of services and SG&A.","It's important to note that the total pretax savings of $85 million to $100 million excludes any potential impact of variable expense growth, we should be reasonably inline with revenue growth. Ultimately, we believe we're well positioned to expand earnings and margins in fiscal 2013. We'll continue to update you on these cost-initiatives throughout the year.","Turning to our segment results. Tax Services revenues were down 1% to $90 million. Last year, the Canadian tax season was extended by 2 extra days, which contributed $4 million of additional revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The segment's adjusted pretax loss improved by $9 million or 6% to $144 million, primarily due to reduction in labor, occupancy costs and other expenses driven by our cost initiatives.","In Corporate, our pretax loss improved by 9% to $28 million. Corporate operating expenses declined by approximately $6 million or 14%, primarily due to our cost-reduction initiatives and lower loss provisions in mortgage loans held for investment at H&R Block Bank.  Corporate revenues declined $3 million, due in part to lower interest income from H&R Block Bank's shrinking mortgage loan portfolio.","As we look at our overall financial position, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong. As of July 31, total unrestricted cash was $940 million and total outstanding debt was $1 billion. Reductions in cash from the prior quarter principally reflect our normal off-season operating cash requirement and the repurchase of 21.3 million shares at an aggregate price of $350 million or $14.82 per share.","At July 31, 2012, 271 million shares were outstanding compared to 306 million shares outstanding at July 31, 2011.","Our first quarter effective tax rate of 37.6% was down 300 basis points to the prior year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily driven by discrete adjustments to income tax reserves. Excluding discrete tax items, we continue to expect our effective tax rate from continuing operations will be approximately 39% in fiscal 2013.","Turning to discontinued operations, which include last year's results of RSM McGladrey, as well Sand Canyon, our first quarter net loss of $2 million improved by $54 million, largely due to a noncash impairment charge recorded in the prior year in connection with the sale of RSM.","Sand Canyon received new claims for alleged breaches of representation and warranties in the principal amount of $142 million during the first quarter. Sand Canyon completed review of prior claims during the quarter with an approximate principal balance of $527 million. At quarter end, total claims of $260 million remained under review.","Sand Canyon had equity of $265 million at July 31 and it's accrual for representation of warranty-related liabilities remained essentially unchanged at $129 million. Before I conclude, I'd like to thank all of you who took time to meet with us during our road shows earlier this summer. It was a pleasure getting to know many of you, and I look forward to spending more time with you in the future and continuing our dialogue.","During my first 90 days on the job, I focused most of my attention on our strategic plan, reviewing our capital structure and assessing each of our businesses to identify ways we can grow and create value. One of my first priorities was to finalize our new committed line of credit agreement. We were very pleased with the terms of our new agreement, and importantly, we delivered on our promise to have these negotiations completed this summer. We believe this agreement provides all the financial flexibility a consumer services company such as ours needs and further demonstrates the confidence our banking partners have in our business.","With the CLOC negotiations behind us, we are now working to refinance our $600 million notes maturing in January. As many of you are aware, there is very strong demand for the depth of company such as ours. H&R Block is a well-known, seasoned issuer with ready access to the market, and we are currently in detailed discussions with banks to complete refinancing by year end.","And finally, I know many of you are interested learning more about our capital structure. At this point, it would be premature for us to provide any detail as we're continuing to review the appropriate structure. We plan on sharing more details with you in December.","I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for closing remarks.","William C. Cobb","Thanks, Greg. In conclusion, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made so far this year. We're on pace to achieve our cost-reduction targets, and we're finalizing our plans for the upcoming tax season. As next tax season quickly approaches, we continue to like our competitive position. We look forward to sharing our plans and outlook with you at our investor conference in New York on December 6.","With that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research -- I'm sorry, that question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So one of your competitors talked about outsourcing their prepaid debit card business because possibility was worse than expected because of new regulations. Can you just talk about the Emerald Card? And how new regulations are impacting kind of your earnings there?","William C. Cobb","How the regulations are affecting our earnings, is that the question?","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, on the Emerald Card.","William C. Cobb","Well, I'll let -- I think, Greg, I'll just say something and then I'll let you participate. We are very committed to the Emerald Card. We think it's a great source of growth for us. We think it's a great service to our clients. We are one of the largest issuers in the country of general purpose reloadable cards. We issued almost 3 million last year, loaded almost $10 billion in deposits. So we are very committed to not only continuing to grow Emerald Cards, but managing it very appropriately. And then I'll turn it over to you, Greg, in terms of any earnings impact.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes. I mean, our view is that we're -- I mean, currently we have a very successful program, I mean, at the top 3 programs in terms of the number of cards issued. And if you look at the amount of money that's loaded onto that, it's quite a substantial program. And as we develop our detailed plan here for this upcoming tax year, we're very bullish on the opportunity that, that program represents for us. Specific to regulations,  I mean, we're obviously very aware of the things we need to be in compliance with, and we always use that as a starting point. But our goal is to deliver a product to our clients that meets their needs, and we always try to do better than that. And our current products, in terms of the rate structure, the fee structure, disclosures, have -- it's actually award-winning from many of the consumer groups that we've sort of showed it to. So I guess, I'm not specifically worried the regulatory issues that maybe our competitors are facing. But from our perspective, we think it's a great program and we feel really good about our position.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you wouldn't expect any decline in margins in that business next year?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","No, no. We're not really giving forward-looking forecast at this point in time...","William C. Cobb","In order we break out margin by line item like that. But I wouldn't anticipate in any -- anything. But like I said, we'll be -- give a fuller review of our entire plans in December.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I think -- can you give us the losses associated with the Sand Canyon claims reviewed this quarter? I think you used to in the past, I just didn't see it this quarter.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So in the quarter, the validity rate was up 4.5%. We, as you well know, we review each put-back on a loan-by-loan basis. We are under our contract. Our contract, I should say, have a prescribed time in which to do that, and we're always diligent about doing that. And then once we've sort of reviewed that, the claim, which gives us validity rate, we then figure out the actual payment date, how much that is. And so is there more that you're looking for?","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No. Yes, I mean, just the 4.5% validity rate's fine. I was looking for a number, but that's fine. And then just in terms of I know you said you're going to give more color on the capital allocation strategy in December. But can you just -- I mean can you say have you bought back any stock quarter-to-date? And just from modeling reasons, should we not expect any buyback, since maybe you've renegotiated the January 13 maturity?","William C. Cobb","So the year-to-date, we bought back $315 million worth of stock. It's about -- I think it's 21.3 million shares specifically. And then with regard to going forward, we are not going to get into when and how much we're going to purchase. Obviously, we have an authorization from our board. And obviously, during my time here, we bought back almost 12% of the shares of the stock. So I'd rather you judge us by our actions. But we're not going to commit to any time frame or say when we are or aren't going to look at stock buybacks. As you know we're continuing to protect the dividend as we have for the last 50 years.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'll bulk [ph] around the horn a little bit. On the tax front, with the Sears reduction, could you guys give us perspective how many Sears stores you had been in? And then outside just across retailers, remind us where you are with Walmart and who else you may have relationships with. And then finally on this question, just your long-term strategy of dealing with retailers.","William C. Cobb","Yes. I'll take Walmart first. Walmart last year, we're in about 250 stores. And while we're not ready to disclose the exact number that -- we're in discussions with Walmart right now, we will have an increase in those number of locations for fiscal '13. With regard to Sears, we're in about 500 Sears locations last year. We will be in 112 Sears stores. They were our highest volume, highest profitability stores. We will continue to maintain a presence there. We also have the opportunity in under 100 mall locations to also have a presence there. So they're in some ways additive. We're working on leases and the like. But like I said with regard to our ability to retain clients, which ultimately it is about client retention, we're confident that we've done this before and we know how to do that. And in effect, we're able to save money by reducing our footprint. And yet the win-win for us, in addition to the partnership with Sears, is that we're able to reduce costs in some of our less profitable stores, yet keep our best and brightest.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Going to just capital structure, as I break you guys in the tax capital structure and put-back capital structure. The credit facility versus commercial paper, can you give us just what your preference is to use during this off-season and compare and contrast this year as to how soon you might tap into working capital borrowing in this off-season?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So I think between the lines, are you sort of saying congratulations on getting the CLOC renewed? Scott, was that right? I think I heard that, but...","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","That's implied. Nice job.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes. I mean I do want to spend a minute on that, because it was a lot of work. It's a big number. A lot people here at H&R Block work quite hard to get there, and that was really the first step for us. And so I don't want to lose sight of that because the CLOC historically has been our backup liquidity source. And getting that taken care of at, I think, very favorable rates, and there's lots of details in the disclosure so you can read through that, was a big accomplishment. And it was also during the time line, which we outlined pretty much consistently, which I think is also worth noting. Specific to utilization commercial paper, that has been the traditional source of primary liquidity during the slow season. The slow season is typically 3, 4 months of the year. That's generally speaking kind of what we look at for the next season. In terms of maybe ultimately between the lines going forward, that's all tied up in how we may kind of go forward with our capital structure solution, which as I said before, we're not really prepared to get into right now. We'll share more details with you in December on that.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just I want to touch on the validity, again, on mortgage put backs. It's a very low number, the 4.5%. Could you just give us a feel for how that's trended over the past few quarters, years? And just speak to the most recent batch coming in. I mean, I know you haven't looked at it, but any additional color you care to share. That's an open question.","William C. Cobb","Yes, Scott, In terms of the new batch, I mean, if you're referring to the $142 million that came in, in the first quarter of new put-backs, we don't comment on that in quarter. Our validity rated 4.5% has continued to decline over time. The 4.5% validity rate is pretty consistent with the last few quarters. I don't have the chart in front of me right now. But that's in line with what we've been seeing over the last 3 or 4 quarters. So that would be a more consistent pattern right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up, I don't know, Bill or Greg, just on the financial products, I know one of your competitor will be more aggressively advertising around product. Is there any new products that you might have this year to come back at or other new products? And then also on the Emerald Card, I know in the past there were some thoughts maybe to expand the usage of that, to get clients to use that outside of tax season. Could there be a greater push to find other avenues in retailers? Are there any themes there or plans to develop those products?","William C. Cobb","So let me take those, and, Greg, if you want to join in. With regard to the competitors with RALs, et cetera, we anticipate that some of them may offer RALs through nonbank lenders to the extent that they offer RALs, any competitors, we think they're going to be only on a limited basis and through a narrow segment of consumers. So we don't look for this to be a big initiative. I mean, obviously, we'll continue to evaluate the market, respond to our clients' needs. But at this point, I would anticipate a similar season that -- relatively low impact from RALs. With regard to Emerald Card, stay tuned. But I think we do have Susan Ehrlich and her team in financial services are hard at work at driving, not only increased number of cards, but increased card usage. So I wouldn't comment specifically on retailer partnerships. But look for us, that will be a stated objective of ours to increase that.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","And the best way for you to kind of get a real, sort of live -- a real-time example to what functional rarity of card is to get one for yourself and all your friends and family too, please. But you'll -- and there already have been over the summer some enhancements to that product, and that's just the beginning of a very methodical plan that Susan and the team have developed. And we look forward to sharing that with more detail in December.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Great. And another question that probably comes up all the time that I'll -- or every year you probably get asked. Is there any ability to relook at your offices and maybe try and find some cost saves on a seasonal basis? Or is that -- I know it's hard to close them in the off-season and -- or at least shut them down and find other usage for them. But is that something that you beat that dead horse? And -- or are there -- is there a new playbook that you're willing to brush off?","William C. Cobb","I mean, the footprint is something that we look at on a continuous basis. That narrow reports into Greg's group. And so we will not only look at are we sized appropriately with our 10,000-plus touch points in the retail business. We're very pleased with the mix we have between company and our partners, our franchisees. So at this point, it's one of those things where we decided to reduce by about 200 branches this year. We decided to take the initiative with Sears. We're actually expanding in Walmart. So it's something that's very dynamic in a process that we looked at. We're looking really to just optimize on a continuous basis, whether we would do anything unseasonal, et cetera. I wouldn't say we have any plans in place for that. But obviously; anything's on the table. And great thing about having somebody like Greg here is he brings some fresh eyes to a very experienced team that looks at it. So we're having a good dialogue on that. But I think it's consistent with what we've been doing. I don't know if you have anything to add.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","After 90 days, I guess the only major conclusion I've got is the word optimize, that Bill uses the right word. I don't think it's the right thing for the company to dramatically move one direction or another. They've got a great retail footprint. They have a very good understanding of the economics behind that and for us to bring more rigor and more analysis to that's probably what we're focused on. But to me, that's just results in more optimization  than any substantial changes.'s","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And you do have a question from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I guess starting from the back. I think in the past, here we said that Walmart was the least profitable tax-preparation business. Maybe you could talk a little bit about why that may change. Secondly, can you give us some ideas as to why -- or what your ideas have been as to why the free RAC didn't work last year? Competition, was it poorly done? Market doesn't care? Other reasons? And thirdly, historically, your processes always taught us that when they're -- you can show optimism in the season by increased losses in the first quarter. And it looks like in fact your first quarter, when you make all the adjustments, was kind of flattish, maybe was down, but certainly the loss wasn't higher.","William C. Cobb","So let me take the free RAC. I think just to be clear on free RAC, it was a success in the sense that we've got a lot more Emerald Cards into people's hands. We've got a lot more deposits on the free RAC. I don't think it was a financial success because it was really an attachment product. It wasn't a traffic-driving product -- is in simple form why we believe we shouldn't repeat it. But it did have some benefits and it also gave us a competitive entry during the last year of RALs. As far as losses in Q1, Greg?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes. So obviously, Mike, I can't comment historically what the management team was communicating. It's not a word, the details. But our first quarter, we gave you kind of the quick variance. But the one thing I was watching for very carefully was did we, in terms of the actual numbers, see the benefits of project when they come through. So when we look at line item by line item, national expense account by national expense account, headcount, costs, computation of benefits, the real estate footprint, some of the IT costs, did we actually see it come through, and we did. And that's why we reinforced the $85 million to $100 million is we know at a macro level, at the project management level, it's executing. We also can see it in the financial. So you get that benefit because we shared that plan with you before. I think part of -- implicit, I would guess in your comment is the ramping up of investment, getting ready for the next season. I would say that my kind of observation is that there was a very specific plan that we've got that we're working through coming out of last tax season. We spent a lot of the summer talking in detail what that looks like. We're now executing that. I mean, we're not giving any guidance here, but we feel really pretty good about going into season about a lot of things that's under way, and we'll share more details with you in December.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay. And there was also the Walmart question.","William C. Cobb","Could you repeat the Walmart question, Mike? I'm sorry.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","In the past you've said that the Walmart business was your least profitable business, the least profitable tax business. But maybe you can talk about what kind of things you may be doing to increase the profit? Or is there some other reasons to be in it? Promotion, for example.","William C. Cobb","Yes. I think the biggest reason why we want to expand this year was we found it as a great source of new clients for us last year, and that's really what our focus would be. I think we manage our expenses very well. We don't disclose specific channel profitability. But I think that you can look at our expansion with Walmart as really a drive to pick up a growth in new clients. So that would be, to me, the strategic rationale for the expansion of Walmart.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Amanda Lynam with Goldman Sachs.","Amanda Rae Lynam - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just hoping that you could give us a reminder on what exactly you believe the statute of limitations to be that is affecting the Sand Canyon loans to give us some perspective on how those '05, '06, '07 vintages might be affected? Is it 5, 6, 7 years? And then just going back to the validity rate just 1 more time, I think historically that validity rate had been as high as I want to say in the teens percentage range. And so what is the driver of the decline in the validity rate? Is it simply that you are seeing claims that you don't believe were as strong as those that were submitted earlier in the cycle? And if that is the case, is that due to behavior on the trustee side? Or just any color would be helpful from that end.","William C. Cobb","Okay. I'll take a shot at it, and then, Greg, if you want to add anything. So first of all, with regard to statute of limitations, the stated answer is for a contractual claim to enforce a rep and warranty obligation is generally 6 years. It can be shorter depending on the law of the state where the event occurs. Sand Canyon believes that the limitation period runs from the applicable closing date of the sale loan. So unless -- and frankly, there's limited case law on this issue. But generally, in our conversations and that Sand Canyon has had with counterparties, it's generally believed that 6 years is the proper way to look at this. With regard to validity rate, I believe the first put-back back in 2008 was the highest validity rate at 15%. That validity rate has come down over the last 4.5 years to where it's generally been the last few quarters, as I said earlier, in the 4%, 4.5% range. Now Sand Canyon does not comment on why we think because again back to what Greg said earlier, Sand Canyon's approach is Sand Canyon no longer originates mortgages, Sand Canyon no longer services mortgages. So if there are valid or  a belief that there are valid claims, then each, we'll -- we, Sand Canyon will review loan file by loan file, and make a determination. There's not a stated objective. It's done on a loan-file-by-loan-file basis. And obviously, we report out from Sand Canyon what the validity rate happens to be, and it has been in that range. Speculation as to why the quality has declined in terms of valid put-back claims, I probably wouldn't speculate at this point because as I said it will go, if you will, $150,000 mortgage at a time and see what the particular issue is there. I don't know if you have anything to add, Greg.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","No.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Derek Drysdale","All right. Everyone, thank you for joining us. We appreciate your time, and please follow-up with us, Investor Relations, if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you. Have a good night.","Gregory J.

I'll now turn the call over to Colby Brown, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2018 first quarter results. On the call today are Tom Gerke, our Interim President and CEO and Tony Bowen, our CFO.","We posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com.

Good afternoon and thanks everyone for joining us. Earlier today we announced the results for our fiscal 2018 first quarter, which ended July 31. As a reminder, given the highly seasonal nature of our business, the first quarter is not indicative of our performance for the full year. Tony will walk you through the first quarter results in greater detail shortly, but overall, they were in line with our expectations.","Now I'd like to provide an update on our CEO transition, our overall strategy and our preparation for the upcoming tax season. Starting with our leadership transition. We announced last week that Jeff Jones has been appointed our new President and CEO effective October 09. Jeff brings 27 years of executive management experience, great leadership and operational excellence to H&R Block.","Having held key roles at top companies in the retail, consumer products, agency and technology industries. The management team will actively work with Jeff over the next several weeks in advance of his arrival to ensure a seamless transition. We are delighted by the Board's selection of Jeff as our new CEO.","And in addition, we would also like to give a final thank you to Bill Cobb for all he did during his tenure at H&R Block. During this time of transition, the leadership team has been and will be continue to be laser focused on delivering a strong tax season '18.","We've largely completed our planning efforts and are working to operationalize those plans. While we're not prepared to discuss details regarding our expectations for the upcoming tax season, our long-term goal continues to be achieving client growth in both the assisted and DIY channels and our strategy to get there remains unchanged. ","So, here's what you should expect from H&R Block this year. We will continue to aggressively go after client growth through compelling promotions and product offers. We'll continue to invest in innovative solutions designed to leverage our ability to serve our clients any way they want to be served and we will continue to improve the value we provide to our clients and we'll effectively communicate that value.","Again, while we're not prepared to provide a lot of specifics today regarding our tax season '18 plans, we can talk in a little more detail about our key product and our operating line up the refund advance. After a successful launch in tax season '17, we're excited about this product in place for tax season '18.","Last month, we reached an agreement with BofI to be our exclusive refund advance provider this year. This expands our relationship with BofI which also provides our Emerald Advance, Refund Transfer and Emerald Card products and by reaching this agreement in July, we solidified the terms of our Refund Advance program much earlier than last year, giving us more time to enhance our execution of the program as well as to focus on other initiatives.","Refund Advance continues to be a valuable product for the early season clients, looking to access their refund faster and it rounds out our Tax Plus product suite, which is the most robust in the industry. Our products combined with the expertise of our tax professionals and Watson, offer compelling value for taxpayers.","Beyond Refund Advance, we have many exciting plans for the upcoming tax season as we continue to look for ways to innovate and provide our clients with outstanding promotions and product offerings. We look forward to sharing more details regarding our tax season '18 plans on our second quarter earnings call in December.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tony.","Tony Bowen","Thank you, Tom and good afternoon. As Tom mentioned, given the seasonality of our business, first quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.","To put it in perspective, first quarter results typically represent less than 5% of our annual revenues and less than 15% of our annual expenses. That said, our results were largely in line with our expectations.","With that as a backdrop, I'd like to provide additional context on the quarter. Revenues increased $13 million or 10% to $138 million primarily due to increased U.S. tax preparation fee and revenues from prior year sales and our Peace of Mind product.","Turning to expenses, total operating expenses increased $13 million or 4% to $323 million. Increases in amortization expense and occupancy cost were due to acquired franchising in the businesses in the prior year. We also saw inflationary increases in both occupancy cost and compensation expense.","Pretax loss increased approximately $2 million to $205 million as increases in revenue were offset by increase in operating expenses. Additionally, other income declined due to the sales in mortgage loan portfolio, which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.","The quarter's income tax benefit was less favorable compared to the prior year due to lower base tax rate as well as lower discrete tax benefits. Finally, loss per share increased $0.07 to $0.62.","Approximately half of the increase was due to the reduction in the share count, which will be accretive on a full year basis, but negatively impacts those quarters with a net loss. The remainder of the change in loss per share was due to the decrease in income tax benefit.","Turning to capital, we remain committed to our practice to returning excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases after making appropriate investments in the business. Regarding share repurchases, there are a number of factors that impact the amount and timing of repurchases, including our financial position, market conditions, trading ranges, blackout periods and operational considerations.","So, we'll continue to be opportunistic in our approach. There were no repurchases in the first quarter and we currently have approximately $1.2 billion remaining of our $3.5 billion share repurchase authorization effective through June 2019.","Turning to dividends, last quarter the Board authorized a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.24 per share. We remain committed to paying the -- to paying quarterly dividends which we have done every quarter since becoming a public company over 50 years ago.","Turning to discontinued operation, Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims was unchanged from the prior fiscal quarter at $4.5 million as of July 30. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil-piercing arguments.","As Tom mentioned, our plans for fiscal year '18 are well underway and we're still working on certain areas that may impact our financial outlook for the year. Consistent with last year, we'll provide additional details during our second quarter earnings call.","That said, I'd like to provide some color around our operating expenses, which is an area many investors have asked about during the past few months. As we stated previously, we do not plan any large-scale cost reductions this year, but you can expect us to diligent about cost management.","As we discussed during last quarter's call, fiscal year '17 represents a new baseline for expenses. That said, we had one-time benefits of approximately $15 million last year that will not recur in fiscal year '18. Additionally, expenses will be impacted by variable cost and inflationary increasing in areas such as compensation and occupancy costs. We'll provide details on expenses, margin and other elements of our financial outlook during our second quarter call in December.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tom.","Tom Gerke","Thanks Tony. In summary, we're on the right path to deliver for tax season '18. We're aggressively building up of last year's momentum. We're excited about the arrival of Jeff Jones and are working to ensure a smooth transition. We look forward to sharing more in December on our Q2 earnings call.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question is from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta","Hey good afternoon, Tom and Tony. Tony, I think you talked about RAL program or the bank's products programs going with one bank. I am wondering if you anticipate any other changes in the RAL program? It seems like you had some success last year and I'm wondering are you planning to make any changes and anticipate those changes having greater success?","Tom Gerke","Yeah and Kartik, thanks for the question. Obviously, our goal is to try to improve on the success we had last year for Refund Advance as far as what the specific changes will be.","Obviously, we're not going to talk about it for competitive reasons, but we're really pleased with the performance that that product had last year in driving a new client. Open to build on that performance in the second year, but as far as the details, more to come.","Kartik Mehta","And then, what do you anticipate for low tax market growth, both for the total market and the DIY?","Tom Gerke","So last year as we you know was a bit of an anomaly from our perspective and we think the fraud controls at the IRS put in place both the PATH Act as well as the AGI PIN change that they made in DIY definitely had an impact on industry volume.","If you take last year on and you look at over the last 60 plus years, the growth is highly correlated with employment. Right now, the economy is strong, employment is strong. So, we would expect the IRS returns to return to more historical growth patterns of around 1%.","Kartik Mehta","And then, Tony, just your thoughts on the assisted market and DIY market. What do you anticipate growth wise from those two markets? Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Yes so, sorry I missed the second part of your question, I think last year was a bit of a unusual year. We saw the migration from assisted to DIY be about half of what it was in the prior years. I think part of that had to do with some of the fraud controls I mentioned before.","I think part of it had to do with the product offerings that you saw in the assisted side of the business, specifically Refund Advance. We expect that there will be a migration from assisted to DIY next year. Exactly what that is, is really depends on a lot of factors including competition, different offers in the marketplace etcetera.","I think overall, we would expect assisted to be relatively flat and see positive growth on the DIY side.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Kartik.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thank you. Good afternoon. I was curious to hear that no share repurchases in the fiscal first quarter. Just Tony, any commentary on that? Is that something where you're going to hold off before tax season? Or just happenstance? Or any commentary surrounding that?","Tony Bowen","Yeah, so thanks Scott. Obviously, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends. We've returned over $2.3 million over the last couple years through share repurchases. In that two consecutive years of raising the dividends. So, we definitely feel like we've returned a significant amount of capital.","As a matter of practice, we don't comment on the levels or timing of share repurchases either in the past quarter or in what we're expecting in the future, but we really think about it as trying to be opportunistic for our shareholders, not programmatic. So, we'll continue that approach in the future, but I can't speak too detailed about why we did or didn't buy during this last quarter.","Scott Schneeberger","All right. Thanks, and a primary competitor recently mentioned kind of three thematic focus areas for the upcoming tax season and number one was the focus more in early season segment and compete effectively in the free segment.","How clearly, you're bringing back the RAL 1040 EZ was the first time the -- for free was the first time this past year. Should we anticipate that that would likely perpetuate and that's question one and part two of it is just taking a step back, what do you see what regard to the competitive environment you can approach that however you like for the upcoming tax season, thanks.","Tom Gerke","Thanks Scott. So, I think your question was do we plan on continuing for EZ as well as Refund Advance. So, Refund Advance is EZ, one of the answer is yes. We've already announced that. So that will definitely be in the assisted channel.","1040 EZ was a program we introduced last year. We had some good success bringing clients and driving trial to the assisted brand and I think it just provide a nice offer for us to bring clients and then ultimately monetizing in future years.","As far as what competition does, obviously the tax maker is highly competitive right now especially on the DIY side with new entrants like Credit Karma and others. So, we would expect that competition to continue.","That being said, competition was pretty fierce last year and we were able to outpace the market on the DIY side, gain market share, outpace TurboTax for example. So we feel like we're well positioned to do that again next year. We're focused on continue product innovation, being aggressive in the space and having an offer that we think competes effectively.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Tom Gerke","Thanks Scott.","Operator","The next question is from Anjaneya Singh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one, last summer you guys had focused on developing a strategy around arresting the client decline. Fully realizing you share more details on your 2Q call.","We're curious to see if you can share any high-level thoughts on direction of strategy you have in place for fiscal '18, is it more about getting flattish volumes in assisted, is volume growth in assisted that is something that you can try and achieve in '18?","I'm asking because I know in the past you've been pretty upfront that assistant volume growth wasn't likely in the foreseeable future declining volumes are a bigger focus in arresting those or the biggest focus. So just trying to get a sense of how your targets are evolving there thanks.","Tony Bowen","What I would say is we obviously had good progress in changing our client trajectory last year and at this point, we're planning to improve from that level. I am not going to say whether or not that's plus one client or zero or minus one, but there is definite an improvement from last year as our expectation on the assisted side.","In DIY, we gained market share. We outpaced the market. We had positive growth. We will continue to do the same on the DIY side as well.","Tom Gerke","This is Tom. The things that I would add is we had a lot of things this last year that are things that we can clearly built upon. So, we talked about the Refund Advance. We announced the Watson relationship and enhanced the client experience by drawing them into that experience with a devoted monitor for them and those are just a couple of examples of some things that you're going to see us built upon.","Also, a thought on cost, but also just operational effectiveness. We made some improvement is efficiency effectiveness and we had a senior league team where every member of the senior lead team is back at what they were doing last season and in many cases for many seasons before that.","So, despite transition at the CEO office, we got a pretty incredible degree of stability as we prepare and plan for execution of the upcoming season.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. As for second question, I wanted to just ask on the hire of Jeff Jones, clearly his experience in retail, consumer, digital all speak volumes, but curious to see if you can share any thoughts on why the Board didn't pursue someone with more tax industry experience? Is it simply a matter of wanting fresh eyes on the business? Is it something else? Aby thoughts you can share there. Thank you.","Tom Gerke","Sure, well just taking it up a little bit of a high level, the Board had the opportunity, took the opportunity to do a very disciplined broad search. We retained recruiter and then looked at all of the attributes.","Given the size of the tax industry, at least as Block plays in at both assisted and digital and again at the level of expertise that we operate at. I think you look at all the different attributes and you touched on a couple of them, but proven leadership, the broad retail and digital experience, a comfort level with innovation, probably driving emerging technologies both into the client offering but into your operations.","And I think when you look -- look at us and the available pool of people's to even tax, that probably recedes and some of these other attributes are far more important and then you can get up to speed on the nuances of the tax industry and especially when you get somebody of Jeff's proven talent to do that.","Anjaneya Singh","That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Tom Gerke","Thanks, Anjaneya.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Savino from Morgan Stanley.","Mark Savino","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just on the expense side, with the 4% cost growth in the quarter, wondering if -- I know you guys had mentioned you plan to be diligent on cost management, but is that level of growth indicative of what we should expect for the full year?","Tony Bowen","Yeah thanks Mark. What I would say is we're going to provide more clarity on what our full-year margin impact would be given all of our financial plans for this upcoming year. On our Q2 call, I wouldn't read too much into Q1.","It's obviously not a large quarter for us especially on the revenue side, but we'll provide more clarity once we get to Q2.","Mark Savino","Understood, thanks. And just following up on that a little bit, you did talk about occupancy cost as being a bit of a headwind, given the retail environment is generally weak, is there an opportunity for you guys to potentially renegotiate some of your leases across the own store base?","Tom Gerke","Yeah, we have about 20% of our leases that come up for renewal every year typically execute those in the spring and their early summer timeframe and we got a lot of people ask us about the weakness in the retail space and if we're benefitting from that.","And the reality is there are some, but not a lot. I think a lot of that weakness is happening more in the big box retailers, maybe the more anchor tenants and the places that we operate in more strip centers, for example, we're not seeing a lot of weakness. We're not seeing a high level inflationary increase. It's more on the 1% range.","Part of that occupancy costs you saw increase this year, probably the bigger chunk was due to the fact we have more locations on the company side due to buybacks. So, we're moving from franchise to company and we're now paying the full year of rent expense that's probably the bigger chunk. There is a little bit of just inflationary increase in there as well.","Mark Savino","Very helpful. Thank you.","Tom Gerke","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Actually, just a quick follow-up from that last question. Are you still in process of repurchasing franchises on a relatively fast scale compared to prior years?","Tom Gerke","Yes Jeff, it's happening at lower rates. Remember we had peak debt over 300 offices in 2015. That number has continued to come down. I think last year we did about 170 offices, expect that number to come down even more this year, but we are continuing to repurchase franchise locations that make sense.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Great. And then going back to the discussion on the refund advance loan, I'm just curious was this your conscious decision just to go with one bank? Are you comfortable that BofI can handle it? I think give a little bit more color in that decision, that will be great.","Tom Gerke","Sure, well we're very comfortable that BofI can handle it and we believe based on our range that we'll have ample funding for the upcoming tax season. I also think about the other products that we have and just the complexity of having multiple parties involved and so we were satisfied to go this route.","Meta was a good partner and played a great role last year, so we have lot of respect for them, but we have this existing relationship with BofI and we're very comfortable with how we've extended it and that it will allow us to do what we want to do with that product offering.","Jeff Silber","One more. Are you planning an Investor Day in December like you typically do?","Tom Gerke","No Jeff. We're going to plan to do the same thing we did last year, which is do an extended Q2 call including slides and additional financial outlook information.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Tom Gerke","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital.","Hamzah Mazari","Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just if you could maybe update us on what you're hearing on potential tax reform in terms of simplification of the tax score or anything else you may be hearing on the regulatory front positive or negative, just update us there?","Tom Gerke","Sure. Thanks for the question, this is Tom. I guess I'd probably start by saying it's always difficult to predict if anything is going to happen in the legislative process and that's especially true now frankly probably buried by the weak.","And the only thing that's merging is that there's definitely a lack of consensus around any single proposal. But I then go back to what do I know? What did we know at H&R Block? ","We know we've been doing taxes for 60 plus years and the tax code had all different degrees of complexity and what not during that and people have consistently needed help and people have consistently wanted help.","So, if something happens here, it's conceivable I guess. It could be simpler, but there's no scenario where it would be simple, the U.S. tax code. And then their credits under discussion, there is child care credits, there are other things like that, that are being discussed.","So, it's not just that. It's like every time we get into one of these reform processes, we can't resist adding to it as well. So, there is certainly those kinds of additions that are being considered. The other thing is that any time there is change, change equals uncertainty, uncertainty equals a desire for certainty that they're maximizing the refund, maximizing taking advantage of a new credit or any change in the way the tax law works.","So that can often and will materialize and desire for assistance. So, and again I'd probably finish that comment on these taxes about where I started 60 plus years people need help, people want help. I guess that's why I finish on individual taxes.","On corporate taxes. I think it's really important to remember that a 25% or lower corporate rate would result a substantial reduction in H&R Block's taxes and provide us a considerable tailwind and you asked your question more broadly used the word regulation.","I guess the other thing that I would say is that we're just not seeing new regulation come out of DC at the pace we have in the past and I think we probably benefit from that the way everybody who has a broad consumer offering products benefits. So, it's businesses what I would probably sum it up.","Hamzah Mazari","That's very helpful. Just a follow-up question and I'll turn it over. Any sense of how you're thinking about your non-tax related revenue? I guess it's 15% or so of your book of business? Is the Block Advisors' initiative still alive? How do we think about their Tax Plus strategy or is that something we wait for the new CEO to figure out whether there is a focus on nontax related book of business?","Tony Bowen","Yeah, So Block Advisors would be reported tax prep revenue, just as a clarification, and it definitely is still a focus. It's now in its third year of having that brand out in the marketplace. We knew it would be a slow build to get that to a place where it was adding significant contribution to the business, but still positive things happening and more to come on that front.","As far as Tax Plus products, we feel like we made a lot of progress over the last several years from both in a cash perspective as well as best functionality and features in the marketplace. We include refund advance and that said, even though it's not directly attributable from a revenue perspective, it brings clients into the door. They get to experience their product and we think that's an overall benefit to H&R Block.","Hamzah Mazari","Thank you.","Tom Gerke","Thanks, Hamzah.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman","Thank you. I guess a couple questions regarding some of the costs, you said 4% in the first quarter. Just wondering, however, if the $15 million cost benefit from the end of the year isn\u2019t somehow included in that or that was a one-time deal related to cost also, both the -- will they be charging the same $32, $34 to do RA's? And\u2026","Tony Bowen","Go ahead Michael. Did you have another part, just go ahead?","Michael Millman","That was that part, separate question might as well get it out. I'm not sure I heard your answer to Scott's question and to its talk about going after Assisted and then you mentioned tax reduction. What is your actual cash tax rate?","Tony Bowen","Yeah, we got a lot of questions. So, we'll try to take these one at a time. First one on expenses, so the $15 million, so we reduced expenses, a significant amount last year, we view most of that expense reduction to be essentially permanent in nature. There was $15 million approximately a benefit that we got last year that we don't expect to recur in FY '18. So that's $15 million.","So, part of that reduction last year will be coming into the P&L as essentially a headwind or increase in expense over the next four quarters. So that's kind of that piece. As far as BofI and what we're paying them, we're not sharing the specific details at this point.","At the end of the day, the key number to think about is what is the total amount we're spending in origination cost to offer the Refund Advance program and that's both a combination of what we're paying on a per loan basis as well as the total volume of loans that we're giving out to our customers and then ultimately how many customers we're driving in as a result of offering that product.","We feel like we're in a good place, but we're not sharing specific details on each of those buckets at this point.","Tom Gerke","I'll jump in. On Intuit, there really isn't anything new to the industry trying to have various hybrid models or have assisted as part of DIY. We expect that to continue frankly especially in the light of the fact that you saw even less than half of the 70 to 90 basis points of shift we've seen in the prior two seasons.","I'd just focus, and I think Block for a long time now has been talking about and I think is well positioned to serve our customers anywhere, anyhow, any way they want and we've got the experience of 70,000 plus tax pros to provide and have ample base to provide any assisted whether that's on its own or in a blended fashion.","And we look forward to continuing to bring those offerings forward and enhance then and so we'll continue to fair quite well, it's our belief in that space and back to Tony.","Tony Bowen","Yeah, and so I think Michael your last question was on cash taxes versus essentially GAAP taxes, our effective tax rate last year was around 33%. Our cash taxes were less than that. We put some things in place that we haven\u2019t fully realized from a GAAP perspective, obviously booking some provisions along with those benefits. So, it is less than our 33% of our effective tax rate.","Michael Millman","So, a 25% tax rate you wouldn't get the difference between that and the 33% in effect.","Tony Bowen","Yeah, well first of all there is state taxes implied in the 33%. So that's another factor to take into effect, but part of the difference between the cash and the GAAP basis is some timing and things that are yet to be realized. So, there's obviously a lot of complexity that go into exactly what the changes are from a corporate perspective before we realize what the full benefit would be.","I think Tom's point is that anything south of 25% and really under any scenario be a positive for H&R Block. Definitely from a GAAP perspective, but even from a cash perspective.","Michael Millman","Great. Thank you very much.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Michael.","Operator","That was our last question. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Tony Bowen","All right. Thanks everyone for joining us. This concludes today's call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Mr. Brown, you may begin your conference.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Kyle. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter fiscal 2015 results. Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO.","In connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations Web site at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconcile the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures and the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.","Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Cobb","Thanks Colby and good afternoon. I hope everybody had a great Labor Day weekend. Earlier today we announced our first quarter results for fiscal year 2015 which ended July 31st. As many of you know our first quarter results are not indicative of our financial performance for the full year given the seasonality of our business. As such our prepared remarks will be relatively brief. I\u2019ll provide a few initial thoughts in the year ahead and then Greg will take you through the details of our first quarter results.","We\u2019ve been hard at work this summer continuing to move forward with our planned bank transaction with BofI and refining our short and long range plans for the upcoming tax season and beyond. We\u2019re looking forward to the upcoming tax season as we continue to demonstrate our value and expertise to our Tax Plus strategy and as our clients begin to face complexities in their tax situations resulting from the Affordable Care Act. While there is a lot of work to do I am confident that we\u2019re poised to take advantage of the long-term opportunities that lie ahead.","We had a strong year in 2014 and we\u2019re ready to carry that momentum into next year. We\u2019ll have much more to say about this during our investor conference in December but today I\u2019d like to offer a few thoughts regarding H&R Block Bank, the upcoming tax season and our efforts regarding healthcare reforms.","First, let me provide a brief update on H&R Block Bank. As most of you know, in April, we announced an important step in our effort to exit the bank and cease being regulated as savings and loan holding company. H&R Block Bank entered into a definitive purchase and assumption agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities to be a federal bank.","The parties also agreed to the terms of a program management agreements to form a long-term relationship in which BofI will offer core financial services products. The Emerald Advanced line of credit refund transfers and our general purpose reloadable debit card the Emerald card to H&R Block clients.","Our transaction with BofI remains subject to regulatory approval and we continue to expect to complete this transaction in time for tax season 2015. I understand that many of you are interested in specific dates and time lines for the completion of this transaction. We\u2019ll issue a formal announcement once we\u2019ve received all required decisions from the regulators regarding their review.","If approved we then expect it will take approximately 30 days following regulatory approval to close the transaction. As has been our practice we\u2019ll continue to provide relevant updates whenever it is appropriate to do so.","Turning to the next tax season. After returning to normal growth levels in 2014, we expect total IRS filings to continue to grow between 1% to 2% in 2015. We expect the assisted category to grow modestly and the digital category to outpace overall industry growth to the continued migration of those who previously filed using pen and paper and earn income credit filers.","We have taken an industry leadership position against tax fraud and continue to advocate for consistent standards in both assisted and DIY tax returns in all respects. And in particular those are that contain the earned income credit. Until such parity standards are in place, we believe the industry will continue to see a shift in returns containing these credits from assisted to DIY.","Aside from the EIC shift, we continue to expect the mix of assisted and do it yourself filers to be relatively consistent with prior seasons. Our primary goals in 2015 will be to continue executing on our Tax Plus strategy and growing our business profitably. We will also continue making investments to enhance our service offering and to update our offices and technology to ensure we\u2019re well positioned to continue offering best in class service to our clients in the coming years.","In digital, we\u2019re entering the second year of a multi-year effort to enhance our products and drive improved market penetration, conversion and monetization.","I am confident that Jason Houseworth and his team will continue to execute on our strategy to simplify the user experience and to grow the business. From an operational perspective, we\u2019re in the midst of preparing our network for the changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act; updating our systems, training our people and finalizing our strategy for 2015. As most of you know the IRS released many of the draft forms in late July offering the industry at first glimpse of how the law will be implemented from a tax perspective. Additional worksheet and instructions are anticipated which will enable us to gain a fair understanding of how ACA will impact tax returns. Thus we won\u2019t cover too many details on today\u2019s call, but we\u2019ll highlight some key takeaways from graph forms released since July.","First, as expected the forms are very detailed and can present significant complexity depending on the filers covered status during year, income levels and household composition. Depending on these situations, there are instances where filers may need to file multiple new tax forms and complete additional worksheets. Second, while 1040EZ filers maybe not necessarily be the primarily demographic impacted by the ACA those that received an advanced tax credit will no longer be eligible to file their returns on a 1040EZ. Third, many filers who did not have qualified health insurance coverage for the full year will either face a tax penalty or will be eligible for an exemption. Depending on the type of the exemption, the process to claim it could be quite cumbersome and time consuming.","Finally for this coming tax season, those filers whose households are covered by qualified health insurance plans will be able to sell to test their coverage status on their tax returns without the need to provide additional documentation. After analyzing the early drafts of these new forms, we continue to believe that healthcare reform will impact our claims and intern presents an opportunity for H&R Block to demonstrate our value. As we said all along; however, it\u2019s going to take a few years for the opportunity presented by healthcare reform to develop.","This is a long-term play and we\u2019re making smart investments now to ensure we\u2019re prepared to serve our clients and meet their needs when they turn to us for help in understanding how the new law impacts them. We believe we\u2019ve committed more resources of this initiative than any in the tax industry. And I am confident we\u2019ll offer unmatched value as Americans seek assistants. We\u2019ll provide further details regarding our efforts during our investor conference in December.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Greg to discuss the first quarter financial results.","Greg Macfarlane","Thanks Bill and good afternoon everybody. Early today, we reported our results for the first quarter fiscal 2015. As a reminder, due to the seasonal nature of our business, these results are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Adjusted net loss from continued operations was unchanged in the prior year quarter at $108 million or $0.40 per share. GAAP net loss per share from continued operations was also $0.40 per share representing a $0.02 improvement over the prior year.","Turning to our segment results, tax services revenue increased $7 million to $129. This increase was driven by the extension of Canadian tax season into May which shifted revenues from fiscal 2014 into the first quarter of fiscal 2015. On the expense side, total operating expenses increased $14 million to $280 million, higher depreciation and amortization from planned office and technology upgrades, increased wages, and higher occupancy costs drove most of the increase as an expense. This was partially offset by lower foreign exchange currency losses and legal fees compared to prior year.","The second pretax loss increased $6 million to $151 million. In corporate, revenues declined slightly due to lower interest income from H&R Block banks diminishing mortgage loan portfolio. Operating expenses declined $16 million primarily due to lower provisions for losses on mortgage loans held for investment and lower expenses related to the pending sale of our bank, accordingly our pretax loss in corporate improved $15 million to $25 million.","Turning to discounted operations which includes results of Sand Canyon, our net loss of $7 million was $5 million higher than the prior year, Sand Canyon continued to engage in constructive settlement discussion with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its certain claims. Based on continued settlements discussions with these counterparties during the first quarter, Sand Canyon recorded a provision of $10 million for potential losses related to its representation and warranty obligation bringing a total accrual July 31st to $194 million. As reminder Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments.","I will now turn the cal back to Bill for our closing remarks.","Bill Cobb","Thanks, Greg. In conclusion, I am pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made this off season in preparation for tax season 2015. This year we\u2019ll continue to focus on driving profitable growth and maximizing our value offering to our clients. There obviously remains much to do but as we look ahead, I like our competitive position and believe that we have the right people resources and expertise to continue to provide best in-class service to our clients. We look forward to sharing additional plans with you at our investor conference on December 9th in New York.","With that, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Question on the digital side of the business, you lost market share in the most recent tax season. How important is it for you to maintain the momentum you had in the two previous seasons and continue to gain market share as you go into the next tax season.","Bill Cobb","It was three previous tax seasons and then last year Turbo grew faster than we did on a unit basis and we grew faster than they did on a revenue basis. So I think it is important, I do think we made some great strides last year in terms of our user experience. Jason and his team did some great things in terms of getting more people to upgrade to different levels of the product. So I am not going to get into all the marketing details. But we remain committed to be a very strong number two in this category and we\u2019ll compete vigorously as we go forward into next year.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","So does that mean that if price competition continues, it\u2019s alright that you would also have to adjust your prices?","Bill Cobb ","I am not going to get into any specifics at this point Kartik you know that. But we\u2019re certainly mindful of what Turbo did last year, and we\u2019ll be ready for this year.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Greg can you just talk a little bit about the bank in terms of what does the drop dead date have to be for you to get approval if for some reasons something happens and you\u2019re not able to get approval who would be the contingency plan?","Greg Macfarlane","Well I think it\u2019s important to start with really the broader point here which is we really are targeting our bank, job number one. And in conjunction with that as they do it seamlessly from our client\u2019s perspective and that continues to be our focus. We continue to believe that we\u2019ll get this done by tax season. The drop dead dates kind of a very black and white term. But we believe we still have adequate time to get this thing done for the tax season.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Not to push you too hard on that last point, but if it takes 30 days to 40 days to close the bank transaction and you typically start the Emerald Advanced product around Thanks Giving. Does that mean that you\u2019re going to need to sell the bank around mid October or get regulatory approvals by around mid October in order to have the bank either be BofI or stay with you for -- or can you put to kind of close to the actual tax season?","Bill Cobb","Let me answer and then Greg if you want to add anything. Let\u2019s go back to what Greg\u2019s first point is. Job one is to exit the bank and cease being regulated as savings and loan holding company. We still believe that we will be able to do that in time to have a seamless experience to our clients this tax season. I am not going to get into specific dates but obviously we have talked to everybody about upon approval, assuming we get approval which we believe we will. It will take about 30 days to close.","So you can do the math but where we continue to remain focused on is working closely with our regulators and with BofI we have formed a great partnership with BofI, our relationship with our regulators they are completely professional, they\u2019re thorough. You all should be thankful of the job that they do. And I think we believe that this will still remain on the time line we\u2019ve talked about previously.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","And then just in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you expect this assisted category to continue to grow modestly and digital category to outpace overall industry growth due to continued migration of pen and paper. But I think that some of us are hoping that there is going to be a shift from do it yourself to digital given the complexity of ACA. Do those comments suggest otherwise?","Bill Cobb ","I wouldn\u2019t read too much, I think what we\u2019re talking about overall is we believe that the category we believe is normalized now and the 1% to 2% overall growth is correct. I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on saying that until we get, we still haven\u2019t gotten into a tax season where the Affordable Care Act has had an impact. It\u2019s going to take a few years to see how that all shapes out. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re cautious on trying to predict any increase in the number of factor. We just have to see how this plays out.","I do think what\u2019s important for us is to have our tax pro\u2019s [ph] ready, have them trained, have our office standards up high and we\u2019re ready to certainly serve clients as they face into what we believe to your premise Thomas is correct that this is going to be much more complex. I am sure a number of you have looked at the forms and we do believe that people are going to need help in filing out these forms but again until it plays out we\u2019re not going to get ahead of ourselves on this.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","And then just finally I saw on the quarter you announced the partnership with BMRG and you have been expanding your small business footprint due to that was zero. How big of an opportunity is this if you can elaborate on it at all that would be very helpful.","Bill Cobb ","Again I want to be transparent but also say this is a pilot for us and we\u2019re actually very excited about some of the steps we\u2019ve taken, we\u2019ve been in business services in a relatively small way for many years. We have a few thousand offices who offer business services and this is an attempt for us to have a best in class service for small business. We will be piloting it this year, so I would say stay tuned. But it is certainly something that we want to see if we can get a best in class offering and see what that does for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities","Thanks for taking my questions. So, now that you\u2019ve had a chance to look at the new form, sounds like you\u2019ve done analysis. You shared great amounts with us last Analyst Day about how many people you expect to be in some of these categories. What\u2019s your updated view over how many people are going to need, what proportion of overall customer base and then your customer base, is going to need to fill out any number of these new forms?","Bill Cobb ","We don\u2019t have an update today. Gil, I think what we\u2019re planning on is updating as we get the full worksheets, all the rules, et cetera. We\u2019re planning on doing that in December at the Investor Day. As I think when we\u2019re travelling with you I said we probably not going to do as much disclosure as you\u2019d like. But we will, I think we\u2019ll be similar we\u2019re planning and marching with our all presenting again. And I think we\u2019ll give you an update at that point. We really want to get the full offering if you will from the IRS we\u2019re working through how that masses up. There is not a lot of data at this point we know 8 million people enrolled but we still have -- and there are things coming out all the time. So I think we can give you a much better feel for that in December.","Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities","And then in terms of the health insurance product, are you going to try to do a few more pilots this year in your physical stores? Now that or in year two when hopefully the systems or the government systems are working a little bit better or are you going to stick with the online distribution for this next tax season?","Bill Cobb ","We\u2019re going to stick with the online distribution. We like the relationship we have with GoHealth; we think the user experience is excellent. The Phoenix pilot we are not going to continue with many of the clients who came in were more Medicaid clients and didn\u2019t -- weren\u2019t able to sign up on these changes. So I think we\u2019re going to focus on and we think that that experience is actually the best for our clients. And so for this tax season that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on.","Greg Macfarlane ","And then just want to add to make it clear I know Gil but you understand that. But we said the online experience I mean what we\u2019re doing is using the in store experience as a way to have a discussion with our clients about their healthier needs if there is an identified need then we would then basically forward them on encourage them to build the contact GoHealth, is there a phone number or to the online experience. As you went to a store you\u2019d seen store merchandising, you\u2019ll see signage, the actual tax software that sits there in front of the clients. There is information available to them and of course the tax professionals will be able to talk about it in a meaningful way. They\u2019re of course not licensed or points so they can\u2019t quote and quote sell insurance but certainly we\u2019re going to use as an opportunity to encourage the client to move over to the GoHealth opportunity.","Bill Cobb ","I mean, ultimately, we have an enrollment service which is a GoHealth opportunity. We will be engaging with millions of clients obviously on the tax implications enduring their 2014 tax returns and what the Affordable Care Act has brought.","Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities","And then finally on tax loss, Emerald Card, how do you feel about the kind of post tax season performance in terms of the reloads and the number of cards outstanding and where is that headed over into next tax season?","Greg Macfarlane ","We continue to think to have a good story. We showed you good progress on the year end usage for the last two years I mean we\u2019ve gone roughly from $35 a card, we\u2019re into the mid-40s now, so that\u2019s $10 per card over two year period. We haven\u2019t given specific numbers over the summer at this point. You\u2019ll probably see some more information on that at our December conference. But I would say in general that we still feel very good about what that bank team and our broader merchant [ph] team is doing around that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Following up on the partnership with GoHealth and that sounds like you\u2019re going online route versus the how you did in Arizona. Greg how should we think about that being accretive or dilutive? You gave some guidance on that last year on what that initial pilot was, the whole shebang. So could you just give us a little feel for a little less so now that you\u2019re out of locations with humans or maybe a little bit more spend on online?","Gregory MacFarlane","I mean I think it\u2019s important that we\u2019re interested in this area. We think there is value for our clients and we think we\u2019ve got relevancy here. The fundamental issue from a forecasting perspective is last season was so unusual with the delays with the government it was hard for us to use that information and to extrapolate but we\u2019re prepared to put resources behind the GoHealth this year. GoHealth is a good partner as Bill mentioned earlier. This is going to unfold just like the broader healthcare opportunity but we are interested and that\u2019s why we\u2019re talking about it.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Obviously you mentioned the way to why the update on the form and we\u2019ll obviously get an update in Investor Day I think the one question folks are looking to get and you probably don\u2019t have the answer, but I am asking it anyway is how much incremental change do you anticipate coming to the forms or do you think you have, you think this is largely what you\u2019re going to look like entering the season, barring anything from -- dramatic specs?","Bill Cobb ","I think we have a majority of information would be my guess, but I don\u2019t want to speak for the IRS in terms of the complete array if you will. Scott that\u2019s why we are being a little cautious in terms of going forward when I made new announcements about monetization or how this is going to impact our interview obviously the forms are more complex. There are a number of avenues that you can take because given that the law of the land now is to have health insurance, if you have it that\u2019s one path if you have it to the exchange that\u2019s another path, if you don\u2019t have it that\u2019s another path. To pay a penalty you will get an exemption. So we are working through all of that. And like I said, we will hopefully give you a much more complete picture as we have what we believe will be all the information by the time we meet with you in December. ","Greg Macfarlane ","So one specific area I would say that we are still very curious about the penalty process and how that\u2019s going to be actually handled as it relates to reputed tax events and that\u2019s really the main open question that is available to us.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","And then curious I am curious to get your take on, we\u2019ve now gone two years where instead of mid January start we\u2019ve had a late January start. Even that\u2019s going to be the new norm and reasons why or why not. And then just any thought whatever your answer is on how we may think about model in third and fourth quarter. Thank you.","Bill Cobb ","Yes, I think -- I don\u2019t think we know at this point. I think the plan is the IRS sometime in the fall will give us an indication of when the file will open. Obviously over the last few years, there were some mitigating circumstances around the fiscal cliff and then government shutdown. Whether or not anything comes out of -- there is an election year there will be leaned obsession but I think we may know before that. So I think -- so the IRS is working closer where we have not gotten any special word on that at this point. ","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","And then just a couple of more quick ones. I noticed it\u2019s in the release with regard to the elevated expense and then seasonally soft quarter year-over-year. Just curious Greg if you could address higher wages higher occupancy cost and then offset by the legal fees part. If everything going as planned at this point of the year, should we think of anything more or less with regard to a spend on monetization of stores or anything else to think about that.","Greg Macfarlane ","Yes, I mean there are a lot of moving pieces in the expense line, I think normally our 1Q and 2Q, we do spend more time talking you all about our expense planned but what we are going to do though is really in December better kind of idea we think margins are going to be. We continue to articulate the 27% or 32% range. 31% last year EBITDA margins and 32% the year before. Those you can be tracked. We could see if this is up in the first quarter part of that was timing. We\u2019ve referred to the revenue shift in Canada because of the delay there past the April 30 cutoff for their tax year \u201914, that all types of expenses that moved from the fourth quarter to first quarter. We had some wages increase which is really some additional headcount that we\u2019d have added to system really around, some of these growth initiatives, some things we\u2019ve talked to you all about before. Other than that, we saw a lot of timing things. Of course DNA was up; CapEx was up last couple of years. It\u2019s just more math. We\u2019ve seen some of the rent costs go up a little bit and I think that\u2019s mostly a function of just inflation combined with probably gotten through our shrinkage period with Wal-Mart and Sears and we\u2019re more stable that maybe adding a slight number of new stores. So there is a lot of moving pieces, but that\u2019s kind of the highlights for you. ","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks for sharing that. And then lastly the towing agreement this is I think second quarter in a row where there is an increase to the loan loss reserve. Clearly you have a lot of disperse occurring. I know you can\u2019t share too much I guess Greg you are the right guy to ask. With two quarters in a row is how should we think about that, is there anything dramatic going on, is the end near?","Greg MacFarlane ","Well I mean my kind of point of view assuming the people behind us really think right so I will just give you point of view. And I have in the frequent regular kind of continuations with the. I feel it\u2019s a positive. The tolling arrangements that Sand Canyon has entered into are almost exclusively short term in nature and that\u2019s measured in a couple of months usually. The fact that Sand Canyon and its Board of Directors feels there is value and therefore renews them is a good sign in my view of they thought it was always trying to them and said why they were needed in my kind of thinking. ","And it\u2019s a fact that there is -- in again my perspective a small amount of change the reserve is in the grand scheme of things is pretty small. To me suggests they are probably closer to some resolution but time will tell these things take a longer than we always want them to. In my mind it\u2019s always in a positive step forward. Okay, thanks for taking my question guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya Singh - Credit Suisse","From a complexity perspective and the draft forms that are available it seems the 89.62 is a lot more complex than the 89.65. Is there a minimal change from this juncture? Do you foresee a pricing opportunity on both of these forms? So if you could just help us think about that, I\u2019d appreciate it.","Bill Cobb ","Again, I\u2019m going to frustrate everybody by saying that we are looking closely at all of this; we want to make sure that we look at this question as opposed to form by from, what could we price this at. We\u2019re looking at in the totality of the entire tax return and what might be -- what might the life -- the best used cases on life situation being conjunction with these forms. So it\u2019s a little more complex in saying 8962 we can get X amount for that. So that work is underway and as I said, it\u2019s a combination of what we know now and try to model that out and then knowing that there may be additional information.","Again, I think that what you will see in December is more clarity from us. I doubt we\u2019re going to give a pricing schedule, but we haven\u2019t got to that level of specificity because I don\u2019t think for competitive reasons we should do that. But I do think we\u2019re going to give you a better feel for how we see this whole thing unfolding and again we\u2019re not trying to just kick everything to December, but it actually is a really good time for us. Our plans are done. Our conventions are done with our company operations and franchisees. We\u2019re very close to tax season, so it really does work well in terms of being able to expose to our investors where we see that the tax season unfolding.","Anjaneya Singh - Credit Suisse","Okay that\u2019s helpful and more for me. On the digital side, what is your thinking on retention of your current mix of customers as let\u2019s say into what was to be aggressive on price again and if you could share any changes or investments in the product experience for the 2015 tax season?","Bill Cobb ","I think Jason led out last year at Investor Day a two-year plan in terms of user experience and upgrading the product. That is on pace. You will see further enhancement here. I am very excited about the work he and his team have done, so you\u2019ll certainly see an enhanced product with regard to pricing again like I told Kartik. I am not going to comment specifically on that, but obviously we\u2019ve done a lot of analysis on last tax season and we\u2019re formulating our plans as we speak for next year.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Michael Millman from Millman Research. Your line is open.","Michael Millman - Millman Research","Thank you. I am following up on some of the things in terms of return count for both you and from the IRS; it would seem 1% to 2% is below where employment was this year. And we take into account something a couple of percent from ACA industry could grow faster than this and I would think that block considering last year cut some returns for profitability reason, the numbers should be better, would like to make comments on that?","Greg Macfarlane ","Yes maybe Mike thank you for the question. So the guidance that we gave a little bit earlier, Bill outlined is really I think of it as a normal expectations based on employments and some other factors we have in our model. We from an ACA perspective we didn't really take a position on that forecast.","Michael Millman - Millman Research","Okay in terms of pricing excluding now the ACA pricing, last year your prices were up importantly because you reduced low price products, but we think about this year\u2019s re revenue per return as being greater than that? Liberty, Don, you talked about 5% and that can give promises anything that might help us think about your revenue per return thinking?","Greg Macfarlane ","Adding the revenue per return is also a function of mix of match, it\u2019s not just a function of price. But I will just isolate price for you, we will tell as an industry that we have pricing power on the assistive side. We know that last 50 curves were quite well. We have pricing power in DIY business, it\u2019s not quite strong but I\u2019ll focus really on retail side. We have blocked in last 10 years of increase our pricing, all things being equal other than price a little bit great than the rate of inflation so that\u2019s kind of our expression of pricing power. Last year we did a lot of clean up things more discounts controls limited to some promotional campaigns like the pretty easy, that's had a price impact, but it\u2019s not traditionally pricing. In terms of the go forward look around ACA as Bill has mentioned, but we\u2019re not prepared to talk about that at this point.","Michael Millman - Millman Research","Okay and third maybe to ask, can you talk about whatever you believe that ACA is going result and kind of refund delays this year and next season?","Bill Cobb ","I don\u2019t know Mike. It\u2019s a good question in terms of how we anticipate things playing out. I do think the IRS given that this is the first year. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d messed around with. I would underestimate the IRS. I wouldn\u2019t mess around with trying to see if we can beat the system because I think they\u2019re going to be very keen to make sure that people are answering their -- answering -- putting the forms together the right way. I think there will be very attuned to this area whether that will delay refund. Again, I think if take some liberty you\u2019re going to be in separate [ph] processing and nobody wants to go there. So I don\u2019t know again, we got to see how this plays out. This is the first year of that there will be some shakeout, but it\u2019s an interesting observation and we\u2019ll start to see how it plays out.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to management.","Bill Cobb ","Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes today\u2019s call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

You may begin.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Ladip. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2020 first quarter results. On the call today are Jeff Jones, our President and CEO, and Tony Bowen, our CFO.","We've posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com.

During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up after which they may choose to jump back into the queue.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thank you, Colby. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you may remember from our last call, we made tremendous progress in our tax business last year. We achieved the high end of our financial outlook and strengthened our growth trajectory through the acquisition of Wave.","Today, I'd like to provide initial thoughts on our plans for fiscal 2020, the second year of our strategic journey. Tony will then discuss how we're reporting Wave's financial results, our first fiscal quarter and our full-year outlook.","Starting with Wave. We announced the acquisition on June 11th and the transaction closed a few weeks later. We're delighted to have the Wave team officially onboard. As the two teams have come together post-acquisition, we are more excited than ever about how the combined entity can deliver value for small business owners.","We've been working with the team to establish the appropriate operational cadence to enable their sustained growth. We're also prioritizing the numerous growth and monetization opportunities that lie ahead for the business as Wave continues to innovate. ","An example of this is the recent launch of instant payouts. Managing cash flow is one of the most critical issues entrepreneurs face, resulting in significant day-to-day stress and causing small businesses to fail.","When entrepreneurs accept payments through credit cards or ACH from a third party, it typically takes up to two business days to process, leaving them waiting longer for their cash.","With Wave's instant payouts, they can get their cash in seconds, significantly reducing the time it takes to receive funds and, ultimately, making it easier to manage cash flow. This is one simple example of how Wave is constantly innovating on ways to serve the needs of entrepreneurs.","Wave continued its historic trends by posting 50% revenue growth this quarter when compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Through product innovation and organic growth, Wave has generated consecutive year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of greater than 40% over the last several years.","It's clear from these results that Wave is solving challenges for entrepreneurs and delivering value. By improving its world class offering and developing new solutions that simplify the financial lives of entrepreneurs, Wave will drive monetization and increase its user base. And the Wave team is excited about the additional capabilities that H&R Block brings that can accelerate them on this path.","This acquisition is a key element of our strategy as we invest for the long term. Wave is a strong strategic fit that will allow us to accelerate our efforts in serving small businesses, driving overall growth and enhancing shareholder value.","In the tax business, we're coming off the first year of our multi-year strategy. We made excellent progress against our long range objectives. We achieved strong results in assisted, DIY and virtual, taking share overall.","Our associates and franchisees delivered significant improvements in how we serve our clients. We've led the industry with upfront transparent pricing and we made tremendous progress on our technology roadmap.","As we enter the second year, we're building on our learnings to continue innovating across all our platforms, providing better service to our clients and enhancing our brand relevance.","In assisted, we'll remain focused on operational excellence and improving our value proposition. By concentrating our efforts on the standard operating procedures that matter the most, we're simplifying our approach in driving consistency within our offices and we'll further leverage upfront transparent pricing, which was extremely well received by both tax pros and clients.","In DIY, we'll advance our challenger strategy to continue our growth and share gains. We're investing in enhancements to the user experience, which is earning accolades from independent reviews.","This includes better help within the product to drive consumer confidence and conversion, leveraging AI to personalize the experience, and effectively setting expectations upfront and throughout on price.","These enhancements will be complemented by competitive pricing and aggressive marketing to ensure consumers know about our award-winning product.","And in virtual, we will continue to lead in this emerging segment, building on the success of the past year in which we attracted new clients to our brand through innovative products.","This year, we're taking the feedback we received from clients to improve our offerings and better leverage our Tax Pro network as we provide expertise and care in new ways.","All of these efforts enhance our value proposition, which in turn elevates our brand relevance. We're demonstrating in very tangible ways why consumers should switch to H&R Block.","To wrap up, we're building on our momentum from the last few years. We have great plans in place that align with our strategy and position us for success. I'm excited to share more details closer to the start of the tax season.","With that, I'll now hand the call over to Tony.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into details of Q1, I'd like to discuss how we're reporting Wave's financial results. Wave revenue will be reported as a separate line within our MD&A table. Like most high growth technology companies, expenses related to Wave consist primarily of investments in people and technology. These expenses will largely be included in compensation and technology-related expenses in our MD&A table. Additionally, each quarter we'll provide relevant commentary regarding Wave that we believe will be helpful to investors.","We will not report Wave as a separate segment, given its size relative to our overall business. We will continue to evaluate our segment reporting as our business evolves. ","Additionally, we're in the process of completing the purchase price allocation. We expect to complete this work by the end of our second quarter and we'll provide an update on expected amortization for the fiscal year.","Turning to our Q1 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal first quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, first quarter results are not representative of our full-year performance.","Starting with revenues, we saw year-over-year increase of $5 million or 4% to $150 million. Wave contributed $3.6 million, representing one month of activity. Additionally pre-season results in the US tax business have been strong, resulting in increased tax prep revenues in assisted and DIY.","Our international revenues also increased as Australia has seen positive results in the first part of its tax season. These results were partially offset by a reduction in reported revenues from our Peace of Mind product related to the timing of how we recognize deferred revenue.","Turning to expense, total operating expenses increased $18 million or 6% to $346 million. This was due to planned increases in compensation and technology-related expenses as well as Wave.","The changes in revenue and expenses resulted in an increase in pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $8 million. Loss per share was unchanged at $0.72, driven by the increase in pre-tax loss and lower shares outstanding, offset by an increased tax benefit due to favorable discrete items.","As a reminder, while beneficial on a full year basis, the lower share count negatively impacts EPS in quarters in which we report a loss.","In discontinued operations, there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC filings.","Turning to the balance sheet. This quarter, we implemented the new lease accounting standard, which requires recognition of liabilities and assets for leases previously classified as operating. As of July 31st, we have recognized right-of-use assets totaling $486 million and a lease liability of $479 million. This change will have no impact on our income statement or cash flows going forward.","Regarding capital, our priorities remain unchanged. At the top of the list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality. We ended last year with a strong cash position after another year solid cash flow generation. ","We then made strategic investments back into the business that we believe deliver value to our clients, ultimately benefiting our shareholders. Making prudent investments to drive sustainable growth remains a key element of our capital allocation.","Last, we'll deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. With respect to dividends, the health of our business and our outlook for the future has allowed for dividend increases over the past four years. Over that time, our quarterly dividend has increased 30%. We will perform an annual review of the dividend after each fiscal year.","Regarding share repurchases, we remain committed to, at a minimum, repurchasing shares to offset dilution from equity grants. During the first quarter, we repurchased a total of 1.6 million shares for $44 million at an average price of $27.68. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase approach.","I'd now like to provide thoughts on our outlook for the year, which remains unchanged from what we provided during our call in June. The Wave transaction closed slightly earlier than anticipated, resulting in an immaterial change to expectations and no impact to our total company outlook on revenue and margin.","For revenue, we continue to expect growth of 1.5% to 3.5% in fiscal 2020, driven by growth in the tax business following the recent year and the addition of Wave. With respect to earnings, we anticipate total EBITDA dollars to be slightly higher than fiscal 2019 as we return to revenue growth.","We will offset the operating losses from Wave with other cost reductions to maintain the strong EBITDA level. As a result, we expect revenue growth will outpace EBITDA growth, which will impact our margin.","Therefore, we continue to anticipate EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% for fiscal 2020. We also expect our effective tax rate to be 23% to 25%. This may fluctuate should unanticipated discrete items occur during the fiscal year.","We'll provide additional details on our financial outlook along with our tax season plans on our Q2 call in December. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the fiscal year.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, Tony. We have great momentum coming off a strong year and are committed to executing our strategy. We're on the right track with the tax business, making prudent investments to improve in key areas. And we've added a great strategic asset with Wave, which enhances our growth profile, focused on driving another year of strong results. And I look forward to sharing more in December.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Ladip?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, Jeff, could you speak to how you're thinking about balancing price and volume in the assisted channel going forward? Just some high level thoughts now that we're well past last season and well in advance of next season. And I know it seems to be an aspiration of the company to drive positive volume growth in assisted, just anything at this time of year, you might be able to share with us regarding that for the coming season. Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones II","Absolutely, Scott. Thank you. No doubt, our aspiration is to return to growth in the assisted business. We're on a multi-year improvement in our trajectory. That's absolutely our goal and where we're headed.","Price and volume, the first thing I want to reiterate, is we do not intend to reset prices again. We took the price reset a year ago. We knew that we had just gotten too high. And what that was doing was it was keeping the value conversation from really happening in the office.","At the pricing levels we're at, we feel really good that we've made nice progress. We look at a lot of different factors, what we hear from the consumer, what we hear from the Tax Pro. And in both cases, it made a big difference in their choice of block.","With the consumer, we saw the improvements we talked about at the end of the year in price for value. From the Tax Pro, what we heard was, we don't have to spend time now at the end of the tax event to try to convince people about what the price is. We can focus our time on delivering value, providing expertise, delivering tips.","And so, we feel good about where our price is. Our intention is, we are not going lower. As we've said, we want to keep prices essentially flat going into 2020. We believe that, as we continue to rebuild the trust and credibility of the brand, improve the value proposition, we believe we can get back to inflationary level price increases in the future, but that's not what we're going to be doing in 2020.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. I appreciate that. For my follow-up, I'll turn it to Wave. And just kind of a two-part question. Your initial impressions, just on Wave organic growth, what you see there and what you see as potential? And then, to the extent you can comment at this juncture, any cross-selling opportunities you see of the strategic pairing of H&R Block and Wave? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones II","Yeah. Two great questions. So, what we saw in the revenue growth this year is the kind of year-over-year quarterly growth they have been seeing for several years. We were excited to see that performance continue.","If we take a step back from the business, we love the fact that this is a brand that is still unknown. So, we still see opportunity to deliver this value proposition to more people, remembering who Wave is focused on are small business owners that are currently using nothing. They're using Shoe Box or using Excel. And so, the strength of the value prop, combined with the fact that not enough people yet know about them, we believe there's opportunity on the upside, and one of the things we were excited about in the deal.","We also see them really doing a nice job on the product pipeline. So, continuing to think about new products, all in how they serve the small business owner more and more. When we did the deal, the deal economics did not assume any revenue or cost synergy. But as I shared in my prepared remarks, we've already begun the conversation about how Block's clients can benefit from their offering and how their clients can benefit from Block's offering, but we're taking a long-term view on that. We really want to make sure that given the product pipeline they have in place that we can do everything we can to support that innovation of pipeline, but also know over time there is absolutely synergies between our two businesses.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Appreciate that.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Goldstein of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Jeff Goldstein","Hey, good afternoon. You've talked about implementing cost reductions to offset the Wave dilution this year. Can you expand on where exactly those reductions are coming from and where you could see maybe upside or downside to these expected savings?","Jeffrey Jones II","Hey, Jeff. I'll just tee it up by saying that what Tony is about to share with you are all things that are identified and plans in place that are not to go-dos as the year plays out. And I'll let Tony talk to you about exactly what those things are.","Tony Bowen","Yeah, it's a bunch of smaller items that we've identified that's going to allow us to offset the operating loss from Wave. The biggest bucket is the office closures that we did last year, which resulted in a one-time expense. That's, obviously, not recurring this year. So, that's rolling off. That would probably be the largest number. That was about $11 million or $12 million from last year. The rest of it smaller $1 million, $2 million, $3 million items that we've identified. To Jeff's point, they are already kind of actions that are put in place that's going to allow us to offset that loss and maintain a strong EBITDA level going into fiscal 2020.","Jeff Goldstein","All right. That's helpful. And then, just given that you bought back $44 million of stock in the quarter, which is, I know, less than you did in 1Q of last year, just how should we be thinking about the pacing for the remainder of the year. So, does the Wave acquisition inhibit your ability at all to accelerate repurchases from here. Just how should we be thinking about that?","Tony Bowen","Yeah. So, we deployed about $400 million of capital for the Wave acquisition, but we believe we still have excess capital to deploy opportunistically for share repurchases. As you pointed out, we did $44 million during Q1. And there's a number of factors that we take into account when deciding to do share repurchases. Obviously, trading volatility, number of trading days in a particular quarter, a number of factors that all come into play. We typically don't guide on when or how much we will do in share repurchase. But I think we've proven, in the last several years, that we will be opportunistic and take advantage of volatility and buy shares when it makes sense.","Jeff Goldstein","All right. Thanks for the color.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Hey, Jeff. I wanted to get your thoughts on the DIY product. Obviously, I understand you won't talk about strategy for next tax season. But this tax season, the strategy seemed to be you wanted to gain market share, you improved the product, you are price lower than TurboTax. And I'm wondering, as you move forward, do you anticipate a similar type of arrangement where you're trying to maintain a gap between \u2013 at least a pricing gap \u2013 somewhat of a pricing gap between you and your competitor?","Jeffrey Jones II","Hey, Kartik. So, first of all, I feel really good about the multi-year progress in the DIY business both in terms of the results, but I think especially important in terms of the product improvements. The team is completely focused on more and more personalization and making it easier and easier. That's what all the product roadmap is about.","I love the fact that the product is now being recognized by third parties. We're getting great accolades about those improvements. And I do think the broad strategy remains intact. We have to have a product that is great and getting better all the time. We believe that we have a great price-value relationship relative to the market and competitors and we will constantly test pricing to maintain that advantage."," And then, the third piece of the puzzle, which you've seen us do, is be aggressive in how we market that value proposition. As we've talked before, we still don't believe enough people even know we're in that business. And so, we still see upside in all three pieces of that puzzle.","Kartik Mehta","And then maybe, Tony, for you, just a little bit understanding on Wave. One is, is the client growth in line with the revenue growth that you've quoted? And would you anticipate Wave to then become margin accretive in fiscal 2021?","Tony Bowen","So, first, on the client side, we shared their overall client number is approximately 400,000. We shared that in June when we announced the transaction. We're not breaking out specifically at this point what their incremental client growth is. But I will say that revenue is growing at a rate a little faster than clients and that's because they're growing their client base, but they're also figuring out incremental ways to grow revenue through additional monetization.","As far as the accretion, the near-term goal is to continue to focus on top line growth and growing the base. And we believe they have a plan to get to profitability in the future. But like I said, the main focus is growing the top line and continue to invest in new products, grow the pipeline, grow the awareness and grow the overall user base. That's kind of job one and profitability is the secondary goal.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, Kartik.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Paris of Barrington Research. Your question please.","Chris Howe","This is Chris Howe sitting in for Alex. Good afternoon, everyone.","Jeffrey Jones II","Hey, Chris.","Chris Howe","Hey. My first question pertains to Wave and then my follow-up question is on product improvements. As it relates to Wave, you mentioned the 50% revenue growth that you saw year-over-year in the quarter and the consecutive year-over-year revenue growth of over 40% that you're seeing. Can you parse out in the quarter, what portion of revenue growth was attributable to North America versus outside of North America?","Tony Bowen","Yeah. Almost all of it is in North America. They have very little monetization outside of North America today. Most of those clients are finding the product organically and almost all of the revenue growth is in North America, with the majority of that being in the United States.","Chris Howe","Okay. And then, this is to satisfy my curiosity. You talked a lot about product improvements and the different investments you're making within each phase. As I dig deeper into these improvements, how would you break out what portion come from internal observations versus external observations that you're seeing within the competitive environment?","Jeffrey Jones II","So, I'll tee it up and Tony can add in if he wants. Without trying to put precise percentages on it, I would say the overwhelming majority is based on consumer and user feedback. So, we do a number of things across all of our products, especially digital products, in-home observations, surveys, net promoter scores, tracking verbatim. That's really the primary source of product improvement, is really listening to the unmet needs of the consumer and then creating solves for those problems. We always pay attention to competition . You have to be smart to be aware of your competitors, but we spend way more time focusing on what we hear from consumers than anything else.","Chris Howe","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll hop back in the queue for now.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open.","Michael Millman","Thank you. So, first question, I'd like to follow-up Scott's question in regard to what do you see assisting returns actually ending for the year and what's your expectation for assisted returns next year?","Tony Bowen","Michael, just one clarification. You mean for the industry or specific to H&R Block?","Michael Millman","Well, I meant the industry, but I think I'd have you add on the latter?","Tony Bowen","Yeah, last year we think was the little bit of an anomaly. The category had a lot of unusual things occur, starting off with the government shutdown and then, obviously, tax reform led to, in our belief, a lot more extensions being filed. A lot of those extensions are now being converted in the extension fees, if you will. But going into next tax season, we have no reason to believe that we won't return to historical levels of growth of approximately 1% for the overall industry, assisted being flat to slightly up and DIY growing 3% to 4%, which is what we've seen over the last several years.","For H&R Block specifically, and we've been on a multi-year improvement of client trajectory in the assisted business, we've, obviously, grown the DIY business for several years and taken market share. We expect that trajectory to continue to improve. We're not guiding specifically whether that means positive growth in assisted or slight improvement on the trajectory we've seen. But over the long term, we definitely expect the assisted business to be growing along with the DIY business.","Michael Millman","Okay. And the other question was sort of discussion question. Two areas. One, and it has to do with Intuit, you seem to be moving in sort of the same direction in terms of small business in Wave and their small business growth.","And secondly, in terms of using pros, they are using pros to take assisted and move it to then in do-it-yourself and you seem to be using pros to hold on to assisted. Maybe you can discuss if indeed this is an appropriate way to look at it or we should look at it a different way or ways?","Jeffrey Jones II","I'll tee that up. And I'll answer the second one first, actually, because I think what we're doing is building a platform to serve consumers any way they choose. And one of the advantages that we know we have is our team of 70,000 tax pros that all they do is taxes. As you may recall from prior, on average, they have 10 years of experience only doing taxes. Every year, they go through 40-ish hours of training on taxes. So, we know we have a great asset base in that expertise. And our ability to scale up or down how those tax pros serve people is a really important part of the strategy.","Obviously, in the assisted business, in the virtual business and in the multiple products we offer, we're essentially giving people choice on how much expertise they want and how do they want to receive it.","Keep in mind that, in our DIY business, two of these products are add-ons to DIY, what we call Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review. And that's really because we saw that there are many consumers that are very confident doing taxes themselves and DIY is the right method. We also know there are many that didn't like that choice by itself, but also didn't love the alternative of full assisted. So, for them, they get extra help on their terms. So that's really how we're thinking about the expertise of our tax pros and how we can match their expertise to how the consumer wants it with this range of options.","On your first question, one of the first things we did was look at our current business today and we know that we serve just under 2 million people in our tax business today that are small business owners. We know in our franchisees, they currently do a range of business services in bookkeeping for small business owners.","So, as we think about the evolution of our strategy, we know that we're starting from a place where we're already serving small businesses. So, Wave is really a chance to add to that by a different offering, doing it digitally and really targeting small business owners specifically, not the accountant. So, that's really where that decision came from was looking inside our own business today and the fact that we already have this asset base and we believe there is more upside and more that we can do.","Michael Millman","I appreciate that. Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. We're still several quarters away from tax season. But can you provide some thoughts on how your approach to marketing and promotions will be different this year compared to last year, specifically what worked well for you last year that you'd like to keep and what didn't work so well that you'd like to change?","Jeffrey Jones II","Yeah. Hi, George. So, I won't give you the play by play quite yet, but there is a few things I would highlight that worked very, very well that we'll continue. I'll start in the macro, which is the broadest television advertising. The spokesperson that we introduced this year, she was incredibly effective. We saw our advertising metrics all improve and we know that she is incredibly relatable to the customer that we're serving. So, we think we have a great success in Lisa.","And if I go to the opposite end of the spectrum, this year, we really shifted our investment in our mix into more performance marketing, really finding micro targets of consumers that we could test messages against and watch their behavior at a very, very micro level. That capability continues to grow with the company and that also was quite successful.","So, those are broadly two things that you will continue to see us do, use television and Lisa to deliver the broad big messages to help people understand why they should switch to Block and use performance marketing in the very micro targeting to deliver individual messages to individual consumers, knowing there's a lot of things that we could say, but we don't have to say it to everyone.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. You've indicated that you won't be decreasing prices next year in assisted,. With pricing no longer a driver, can you elaborate on the operational excellence levers that you hope to lean on to improve market share performance this year versus last year?","Jeffrey Jones II","For sure. We continue to think about things like what we call schedule readiness, a really important operational lever which is all about matching the person to the pro at the right level of expertise when they want to be served, an incredibly important part, one that we refer to as work in process. There are consumers that visit an office and, for some reason, need to leave the office and we can do a lot better job of making sure that when they leave, they come back. So, there's a lot of operational protocols around work in process. This is very retail tactical, but how we answer the phone, a very important part of the first impression to get the right appointment made to serve somebody when they come in. So, we wrap it all up into five standard operating procedures, but those are few of the examples.","Tony Bowen","Yeah. And the one thing I would add, George, is I don't think that upfront transparent pricing is completely leveraged. We rolled that out last year as a big change for the business and a big change for the industry, and I think there's a lot more that we can do this year building on the momentum we had from last year in year two of that change.","George Tong","Great, thank you.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, George.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I just want to go back to the last tax season \u2013 and forgive me if I asked this question before \u2013 but I'm just curious if you saw a lot fewer filers that itemized this past year relative to the prior year. And if so, do you think we might see more of a shift to DIY next year, now that we'll be in year two post tax reform and these folks might be a little bit more comfortable?","Tony Bowen","Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. It's Tony. We definitely saw fewer people itemizing. I think that was true at H&R Block, as well as across the entire industry. I think the IRS provided some stats on that, that given the tax reform change and the increase in the standard deduction that there were a lot fewer people itemizing.","There's, obviously, always switching between assisted and DIY. Some people, their life situation changes and they may feel more comfortable doing their own taxes or vice versa. So, that has always been true and will be true for this upcoming year. I have no doubt there'll be some clients that, because of tax reform, will feel more comfortable taking a shot at doing their own taxes, but we also know that there's DIY clients last year that got stuck, needed help along the way, and maybe didn't get the tax outcome that they wanted, so there could be migration to assisted as well. How that all shakes out, our base expectation is that the net migration from assisted to DIY will be somewhat in line with what we've seen over the last several years.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. That's helpful. And to focus on the quarter that you just reported, and I know this is minor, but I think there were a lot more extensions this past tax season than we saw in the year prior. Do you think that helped boost revenue in the July quarter you just reported? And if so, roughly how much?","Tony Bowen","Yeah, definitely had an impact. Client volume has been strong in both assisted and DIY and I think that's partly due to the extension filers that filed at the end of last tax season that are now converting in the pre-season. It was offset by lower net average charge, though, especially in the assisted business. The pricing changes we made last tax season are now carrying over into the pre-season. We have the same upfront transparent pricing model in the pre-season, what we're calling extension season. So, that had an offset to the increase in clients, but there is no doubt the extension filing activity that we saw at the end of last tax season is carrying forward into the extension season.","Jeff Silber","Great. And that should probably help you in the current quarter as well, ending in October, correct?","Tony Bowen","Yeah, I would expect that to continue into Q2 as well.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Colby Brown for any closing remarks. Sir?","Colby Brown","Thank you, everyone, for joining us and this will conclude today's call. ","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the call.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our full year fiscal 2015 results. Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Jason Houseworth, President U.S. Tax Product Strategy and Development; and Mark Ciaramitaro, Vice President, Health Care will be available during our Q&A session.","In connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.","Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict.

H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Colby, and good afternoon, everyone.","Earlier today we announced our fiscal 2015 results. This has been a challenging tax season, as the first year implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the continued and growing issue of tax fraud impacted the industry as a whole. We expected industry volume unit growth of approximately 1% to 2%, consistent with growth in employment. Instead, total filings increased less than 1%, and assisted returns were essentially flat to the prior year.","I'm pleased that despite these challenges, we delivered top line revenue growth for the third consecutive year. We saw positive changes in our assisted return mix. Our DIY business did very well, delivering 12% revenue growth on volume growth of 8%. Our tax professionals delivered expert ACA advice to our clients and are positioned to be trusted ACA advisors for years to come. We also successfully launched a timely new product, Tax Identity Shield, designed to combat the growing threat of tax identity theft faced by all Americans.","Greg will provide more details on our fiscal year-end results later, but now I'd like to focus on three specific areas: first, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on the industry and our results; second, the growing reality of fraud within the industry; and third, our performance.","Let's start with the ACA. Taxes and healthcare intersected for the first time this year, causing confusion and affecting refunds for millions. Prior to the season, we anticipated that 25% of our clients would be impacted in some way by the ACA, whether by completing an advanced premium tax credit reconciliation, claiming an exemption, or paying a penalty.","Actual results were below expectations, and we completed the season with 16% of our clients impacted, as a greater number indicated that they were covered by non-marketplace insurance than expected. Remember, this year a taxpayer did not have to provide documentation to make this claim, but that will change next year when a 1095-B or 1095-C notice form will be required for a taxpayer to claim coverage.","The vast majority of our clients who were impacted either paid a penalty or claimed an exemption. The average penalty was $178, which was much higher than the $95 many taxpayers expected. For the small percentage of clients that completed an advanced premium tax credit reconciliation, almost two-thirds underestimated their annual household income and had their refunds reduced an average of $729, representing a full 30% of their refund. Twenty-five percent overestimated their household income and received on average an additional refund of $425.","As we've been saying for quite some time, it will be several years before the full impact of the ACA is felt. In fact, there are several important changes coming in just the next year. First, total marketplace enrollment is expected to increase over 65% to nearly 12 million people. Next, penalties for not obtaining healthcare will essentially double to $325 per adult or 2% of household income, whichever is greater. And finally, new documentation requirements will impact those taxpayers claiming to have employer-provided or private insurance.","It's clear that taxpayers will continue to feel the impact of the ACA through their tax returns for years to come. Because of the clients we serve, we believe H&R Block is the best positioned tax preparation company to meet taxpayers' ACA needs, and the work we have done has positioned us to be their trusted advisor going forward.","Next, tax fraud continues to have a significant and growing impact on our country. Specifically, there are two areas in which our industry has seen significant trends over the past several years, tax identity theft and EITC fraud. We'll start by talking about tax identity theft.","To fully understand how tax identity theft occurs, let's walk through a typical scenario. A taxpayer prepares his tax return and electronically files it with the IRS. This return is rejected by the IRS because someone else, a fraudster, stole his personal information, prepared a fraudulent tax return in his name using a DIY product, and filed it with the IRS to improperly receive a refund. The legitimate taxpayer then faces substantial paperwork to prove the return as fraudulent, which leads to lengthy interactions with government and legal authorities. It may take several months or even years of effort to resolve the theft, resulting in significant delays in receiving his tax refund.","In just one year, from 2012 to 2013, tax identity theft occurrences increased over 60%, from 1.8 million to 2.9 million. This increase of over 1 million returns is roughly the same amount as the assisted to DIY shift for the same time period. The stories I've heard from discussions with others in the business community regarding people impacted by tax identity theft has been shocking. And while we don't yet have official numbers from the last tax season, we believe the overall growth in this type of fraud will be stunning.","Turning to the earned income tax credit, in 2014 the government estimated that 27% of all EITC returns contained errors, and that improper payments related to the EITC cost the U.S. Treasury $16 billion to $19 billion annually, up from an estimate of $13 billion to $15 billion just one year earlier. We believe this number will be even higher this year.","Additionally, for those obtaining the EITC, the disparity in requirements between assisted and DIY tax filings has been a factor influencing the material shift in EITC clients' tax preparation methods. In fact, without the shift in EITC filings to DIY, assisted tax filings would have grown over the last several years.","Additionally, as we have seen through our acquisition and development efforts, fraudulent or inaccurate payments are not limited to the DIY space. There are numerous independent tax preparers whose tax preparation methods illegally achieve higher EITC payments and overall refunds for their clients at the expense of tax law compliance. Whether these efforts are purposeful or due to lack of understanding of tax regulations, it places those completing accurate and compliant returns such as H&R Block at a disadvantage.","H&R Block has been advocating for actions to address tax fraud for several years. Now, meaningful attention within the tax preparation industry is finally being paid to these issues that continue to cost taxpayers billions of dollars. We have led the industry's fight against fraud, and we remain focused on advocating for change that benefits consumers by strengthening anti-fraud measures. There are some common sense solutions that should be implemented immediately, including: minimum standards for paid tax preparers, clarity between assisted and DIY returns for claiming refundable credits; and more stringent information security managers within DIY tax software such as uniform authentication requirements.","I will be in Washington DC later this week with the IRS Commissioner and others in the industry to continue this discussion, with the hope of implementing real change before the 2016 tax season. As investors and analysts, we believe it is important that you understand how serious this growing problem is. These matters require immediate attention, and we will continue to lead the charge to bring solutions to the industry.","Now that I've provided some context on the season, I'd like to focus on our performance. For the third consecutive year, we grew the top line and delivered strong margins despite a decline in returns prepared by and through H&R Block of 0.1% to $24.2 million worldwide. This was primarily the result of a 4.4% decrease in returns prepared through our U.S. assisted offices to $13 million, which was mainly driven by the continued decline of returns containing the EITC, and to a lesser extent, the second-year impact of the company's decision to discontinue the free federal 1040EZ promotion. The decline in volume also negatively impacted volumes of some of our Tax Plus products including refund transfers and the H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard.","Despite these challenges, we had numerous successes this season. Our DIY products had a very strong year, increasing revenues, return counts, and market share. Considering the market pressure placed by our top competitor who gave away certain products for free, I'm very pleased with our revenue and volume share gains, which demonstrates H&R Block's outstanding user experience and effective marketing. And while we achieved an 8% increase in accepted e-files, I'm especially pleased in our 12% revenue growth, which outpaced the industry. Our advertising and promotion efforts were strong, increasing product awareness 6 points. And by improving our product and the overall user experience, we're better able to monetize and improve our mix.","Internationally, our operations in Canada and Australia continued their strong performance, growing local currency revenue by 8%. Our Tax Plus products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. We launched Tax Identity Shield, a timely product that helps to protect our clients from the growing threat of tax identity theft. Sold as a bundle with Peace of Mind, the product met our expectations and helped to drive Peace of Mind attach rates, which improved 2 points.","Other products such as the Refund Transfer and Emerald Card were negatively impacted by the decline in volume and the shift away from EITC returns but continued to be profitable offerings that our clients value. And on an operational note, we were ready for the ACA. Our significant investment in training, systems, and marketing ensure that we're well positioned to assist our clients who navigated the intersection between tax and healthcare for the first time this year.","We also focused on our infrastructure to ensure we're well positioned for success going forward. We implemented a new tax preparation tool in our assisted channel. The new software allows our tax professionals to better use our tax knowledge while providing an improved client experience. The majority of company-owned offices have now been upgraded to achieve a more welcoming professional look and feel. And we purchased and integrated approximately 340 franchise offices into the company management structure that we believe are best suited to be company-run locations.","In summary, although this season had its challenges, we achieved much of what we set out to accomplish. We served our customers well, continued to deliver value to our shareholders, invested wisely with an eye toward the future, and advocated for improvements within the industry. As we head into fiscal year 2016, we will capitalize on our successes and continue our focus on profitable growth, ensuring we continue to provide value to our clients and deliver for you, our shareholders.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss our results in more detail.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon everybody.","This year we were able to achieve both top line and strong EBITDA margin growth, despite a decline in total returns, the growing impact of fraud in the industry, and the negative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue has increased $54 million or 1.8% to $3.1 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin up 30.8% was slightly better than our guidance and was consistent with the prior year.","Earnings per share from continuing operations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis declined 2.2% to $1.75. Free cash flow totaled $283 million and the company ended the fiscal year with unrestricted cash of $2 billion.","In our Tax Services segment, U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties combined increased 2.3% to $2.1 billion. This was the result of pricing increases, improved return mix, and the impact of franchise acquisitions, which together offset a 4.4% decrease in assisted returns prepared.","I would like to spend some time walking through the details of the increase in tax preparation and royalty revenues. First, we achieved price increases of approximately 3% this year in line with our plans. We were pleased with the results of our pricing efforts, which were consistent in both our company-owned and franchise network. This does not include the impact of pricing related to the ACA or offers such as the 50% off promotion.","Second, we saw a mix improvement of approximately 2.4% to the declines in EITC and EZ returns and the impact of ACA-related forms. Finally, the remaining increase was due to the impact of franchise buybacks and discount controls, offset by the midseason 50% off promotion.","Now, as Bill mentioned, our DIY business had a very successful year. Increase product awareness and improved user experience and well-designed promotions contributed to 8% client growth and improved monetization. The overall result was a 12% increase in digital tax return preparation revenue to $228 million.","International return volume increased 4%, and local currency revenues increased 8%. The negative impact of foreign exchange rate translation, however, reduced current year revenues by $18 million.","For the second consecutive year, Canada's tax season was extended to May 5th, which resulted in a similar revenue shift out of fiscal 2015, as we experienced the previous year.","Turning to our Tax Plus products, both refund transfers and Emerald Card units were negatively impacted by lower assisted volume. Additionally, with fewer EITC and 1040EZ clients, attach rates declined for both products. Overall, we sold approximately 5.1 million refund transfers and issued 2 million Emerald Cards.","Offsetting the decline in volume in attach, Emerald Card average deposits and usage increased, which resulted in revenue of $51 per card, up from $44 in the prior year. This is a continuation of our multiyear effort to drive usage, which has resulted in a 40% increase in revenue per card since 2012. Additionally, Peace of Mind attach rates increased 2 points to 26.5%, and we achieved strong take rates with our new product, Tax Identity Shield, because revenue was recognized over multiple years for Peace of Mind and over two years for Tax Identity Shield, the majority of the financial impact on increased volume for these products is not realized in the year of sale.","Operating expenses increased 5.1% to $2.2 billion. Franchise acquisitions drove much of the increase, specifically resulting in higher occupancy and equipment expense of $12 million and amortization of $18 million. Additionally, the office upgrade Bill discussed increased depreciation amortization by another $17 million. Because of the acquisitions and other infrastructure investments, depreciation amortization is expected to remain elevated for the next few years at $170 million to $180 million. Approximately one-third of this amount is attributable to amortization of intangibles related to the repurchase of franchisees or acquisition of other businesses. Marketing cost and increased variable compensation also contributed to the increase in operating expenses.","In our corporate segment, pre-tax loss decreased $19 million to $18 million, mainly due to lower interest expense as a result of repaying the $400 million note in October of 2014. Additionally, the provision for losses related to our mortgage loans helped for investment decreased as loan performance improved and property values increased. Finally, our effective tax rate was 34.5%, which was consistent with the prior year.","Turning to discontinued operations, the net loss of $13 million was an improvement of $12 million from the prior year. As we discussed during the third quarter call, Sand Canyon entered into a settlement agreement with a counterparty related to certain of its representation and warranty obligations. The settlement was fully covered by prior accruals and was paid in the fiscal third quarter.","Sand Canyon continued to engage a constructive settlement discussions with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. At year-end, the representation warranty approval was $150 million. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing argument.","Turning to cash flow and our balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong financial position. By focusing on expense management, we have been able to invest significant dollars back into the business while achieving a 30.8% EBITDA margin. After dividends, we achieved free cash flow of $283 million in fiscal 2015, and as of April 30, total unrestricted cash was $2 billion and total outstanding debt was $506 million.","As we have mentioned previously, until the bank sale is complete, we will continue to maintain a considerable amount of capital on our books due to regulatory requirements. While this year's free cash flow increased the amount of available capital, the paydown of our $400 million note in October offset that increase. As such, we continue to expect to have approximately $1 billion of excess capital on the balance sheet when the bank deal closes. It is the desire of the board and management to use this capital and also incur some incremental net debt while maintaining an investment grade rating to return capital to shareholders. More details regarding the capital plan will be shared after the bank deal closes.","Before concluding, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about a key metric in the tax -preparation industry, unit count. Unit or return count is widely used to evaluate performance in our industry. It is generally viewed as a proxy for market share, so given the differences in tax for our complexity and methods of filing, we believe that revenue share is a more relevant measure.","And while unit count is viewed as an important measure, it is not clearly defined. One may assume that a unit equals a tax return, but this is not always the case. Consider the example of desktop software sold in a box at a retail location. When sold, it can be clearly counted as one unit. However, one box can be used to prepare multiple returns. Further, the unit count method used by one tax preparation company may differ from other tax preparation companies or even from the IRS.","As tax preparation fraud becomes more prevalent, without a defined methodology, we are not able to clear quantify the impact identity theft and other irregularities are having on unit counts. For more than 10 years, taxpayers have used an assisted tax preparation method approximately 60% of the time as a DIY method, including software the remaining 40%.","In the past five years, however there has been a slow gradual shift from assisted to DIY. Considering that the vast majority of tax identity fraud occurs through the DIY channel, in our opinion this is impacting unit counts. For example, from 2012 to 2013, the number of tax identity theft victims increased by $1.1 million. In 2012, following a 60:40 filing pattern, approximately 700,000 of the returns would have been filed using an assisted method and approximately 400,000 using a DIY method. Then, when the identity thefts occurred in 2013, virtually all 1.1 million of those returns would have been filed using the DIY method, effectively decreasing the returns prepared in the assisted channel by 700,000 returns.","To be crystal clear, we believe the shift from assisted to DIY is driven by fraud. In fact, if you took a reasonable position on the level of fraud in the DIY category, including tax identity theft and EITC fraud, the DIY category actually declined over the past five years. Said differently, despite the increasing number of free DIY options, if we were to exclude the impact of fraud, we believe the proportion of DIY returns would have actually decreased while the proportion of assisted returns would have increased.","Having said all this, there is some benefit in providing unit counts. For this measure to be valuable, however, it's important it is clearly defined. Thus, we are taking the lead in fully disclosing how we define a unit.","A key element of our count methodology is the need for a payment, which we believe discourages fraudsters. For assisted returns, a unit is defined as an individual tax return that has been accepted by the client who has either paid for our services or settled with a refund transfer, regardless of whether the return is electronically filed or printed and mailed. This includes returns for both the current and prior tax years. Also included in our assisted returns are extensions and business returns, each of which account for less than 1% of assisted returns.","For desktop and online returns, we define a unit as a return that has been electronically filed and accepted by the IRS. We also count online returns purchased with a credit card and printed for mailing, which constitute a very small portion of our total. We do not count state-only returns as part of desktop and online returns.","Now that we have taken the first step and shared our unit count methodology, we strongly encourage others in the industry to provide transparency into the method they use to record and report tax return units.","Now with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Greg.","Before we conclude, I'd like to comment on H&R Block Bank. Let me be clear. While we respect the work of the regulators, we are frustrated by this process and the length of time it is taking for the transaction to come to conclusion. We continue to work with BMI and our regulators, and believe that on its merits this transaction should be approved.","We understand your desire for additional information as the approval process timeline lengthens and appreciate your patience throughout this process. At this time, however, we do not have any additional information to share. We remain committed to providing updates when appropriate.","To wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance this year, growing revenues, gaining share in DIY, maintaining strong margins, and advocating for industry-wide fraud controls. We're already hard at work on next tax season and are excited about what the future has in store.","With that, I'll now open up it up for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, good afternoon. Bill, following up on the bank, we realize no update at this time. I'm just curious, though. Are you in regular dialogue with the regulators? Has it been radio silent for a while, or is there interaction back and forth?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Scott, I am not going to comment on the specific work we are doing with the regulators. Suffice it to say that any questions they have, we answer timely and quickly. The discussions have been professional and courteous, thorough. And like I said all along, on its merits we believe the transaction will be approved.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks. I'm curious. On ACA, I think in the press release you mentioned 16% of Block clients ACA-affected. I think that was a little lower than what Block anticipated going into the season. I'm just curious. Is that in fact accurate? And what drove that? What do you think was the dynamic affecting it itself?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll have Mark comment in a second. I do want to say that while we did think that it was going to be upwards of 25% of our clients impacted, we have said repeatedly that this is going to unfold over a few years; that with all the consumer confusion and all of really the newness of taxes intersecting with healthcare that this was going to take a while to unfold. Now specifically, I'll let Mark speak to the difference between the 16% that actually occurred and the 25% we were anticipating.","Mark Ciaramitaro - Vice President-Health Care","Scott, this is Mark. We came up with that figure of 20% to 25% based upon survey market research work. But what we found this past tax season is that more of our clients actually filed indicating non-marketplace coverage for them and their household members. We think this is related to the fact that the IRS had really limited mechanisms in place really to enforce compliance, and a lot of people used the checkbox process as a way of avoiding ACA-related penalties.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys, a couple more if I may. The franchise, the acquisitions of franchisees into company-owned stores, Greg, any quantification of impact of that to the extent you can comment? And then following up on that, what is the strategy going forward with regard to M&A and perhaps buying additional franchisees?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","So as we outlined back in the last quarter and then again on December, we had a unique opportunity this year to buy back a number of our franchise locations that at one point were actually company-run territories. We think that the total population of those is somewhere in the 600 office range. This past season we completed 341 store acquisitions. That was the old territories that we bought back. For the most part, we think that program is coming at the end of it and we go back to our normal level of independent acquisitions, which were in every season, and that while that ebbs and flows a little bit, we think it will be in line with historical experience.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Scott, I think this is a healthy piece for a franchisor to enable franchisees to have an exit strategy. In addition to some of the acquisitions we made, we are also working with some of our franchisees who are looking to buy other franchisees. So this is a pretty dynamic environment we think is going to ultimately lead to a healthier system.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, one final one, and I think I get it. Bill, you have a quote in the press release saying tax season challenging, impacted by changes and the timing of tax filings. And I think Greg may have answered it with regard to Canada. But I'm curious, should we read in any more to that? Is that what that comment was or were you alluding to something else? Thanks.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think that's consistent with what we're getting.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","There's one certainly does, Scott, and it's actually one of those kind of important details. It's just an industry thing, but this season there were a lot more balance due clients than we had seen in last several years. So this is a situation where many Americans had an amount due to the IRS. And we know from many years ago, and that's true they tend to wait later in the season to file. It's one of the reasons there was more of a backend load this year. As an operational statement, that obviously would \u2013 if we'd known that better in advance, we would have had better \u2013 sort of the way we marketed, in terms of timing, our labor models, and things like that. But in the grand schemed of things, it wasn't a huge issue, but it was one of those things that we've spent a lot of time talking about.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Understood, great. Thanks, I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks and good afternoon.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, George.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","So return volumes were impacted this year by EITC-related filings. Can you discuss what your expectations are for the behavioral shifts associated with EITC filers and if you expect stabilization, or if this is a structural issue where volumes will need to be made up for elsewhere?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think \u2013 and, Greg, if you want to add anything \u2013 there are a couple of components here. One is the shift of EITC filers from assisted to DIY that has occurred over the last six or seven years, which we think is driven in large part by the disparity and documentation requirements between having to file with a paid preparer and having to file yourself. The other piece is the increase in fraud or improper payments, whatever term you want to use, that we've seen occurring with EITC filers specifically. We continue to study this part. What I'm talking, going to Washington so frequently for is to look at ways to \u2013 this is not good for anybody to be having fraudulent return filed, having improper payments taken from the U.S. treasury. So I do think it is a combination of both of those issues, both of which can be solved with some commonsense solutions. I don't know, Greg, if there's anything you want to add to that.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Maybe I'll address the broader question you're asking as well, George. So, in the EITC form and the clients that use them, the rout is this is an area that has a traditional strength for H&R Block. We have a lot of experience with this type of client, we've got retail locations and a lot of them \u2013 the neighborhood that buys that way, this is a complicated format, it has very real consequences getting it wrong, and it has very real consequences being right as well. It just represents a very significant refund amount for those clients who are eligible.","The fact that there is a problem here is not something, in addition to the government strategy that Bill talked about, is not lost on Block, and we are spending a lot of time talking about other solutions, which for competitive reasons we're not going to get into right now. I will say that in December, you'll probably hear a more robust answer to this question.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's very helpful. And drilling deeper into the ACA impact, assuming that 25% of your clients were impacted by the ACA this year, how much of an additional mix benefit do you estimate you would have seen on a percentage basis?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Do you want to...","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not going get into hypothetical numbers here for you. What we do know is that Block has the best position in the tax industry to take our clients through this challenging time this year and the years to come here. The Block client in himself is twice as likely to be impacted by the ACA. We don't think that as a general idea is going to change much. I think that many people for the first time began to realize that their taxes and healthcare decisions are related, and we believe that Block has the best position to take advantage of this. Mark, do you have a comment?","Mark Ciaramitaro - Vice President-Health Care","Probably, George, it will be good to mention that next year, we believe that things are going to \u2013 kind of the ante is going to be upped even more when we have penalties increasing. But one of the big substantial changes next year is we expect IRS compliance to increase, and because, really, everyone who has received any kind of coverage is going to have to provide that verification through a 1095-A, 1095-B, or 1095-C. So we do think the combination of increased enrollment, increased penalties, and really this verification process is going to increase the number of filers impacted by ACA going forward.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. And you mentioned that about 2.4% mix impact is attributable to a combined combination of the EITC, the 1040EZ, and the ACA. Is it possible to split out that 2.4% between those three components?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","So we said that roughly two-thirds of the loss is more on the EITC and one-third is the EZ. Now, offsetting that, of course, was we had a very successful mid-season promotion, the 50% off promotion that was really targeted between the first peak and the second peak, so we called that trough in the industry. And that a very successful program, and we found that we're able to attract a lot of high-value clients for the first year, but we understand that a high number of those will be retained for year two, three, and beyond.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. And then lastly, digital is doing well in both sales and monetization. Can you discuss what production and marketing initiatives over the next 12 to 18 months you have in place to help drive the same share gains from digital?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","George, we're not going to talk specifically about the future, but I will let Jason address generally that the journey we've been on, which I think has been quite successful. He's done a remarkable job leading that business. Why don't you talk in general terms about what we've been trying to do?","Jason L. Houseworth - President-U.S. Tax Product Strategy and Development","Sure. As you said, George, our goal every year to outpace the industry in digital growth and improve our average revenue per user. And our results this year, plus 8% unit growth, plus 12% revenue growth, they really demonstrate a strong execution by our product team, delivering on what has been a multiyear product redesign. It was really started out as a journey just to make our product responsive, but what we've seen along the way is product innovation. And highlighted this year was our Refund Reveal feature, and I'm not going to give away a lot of where we're going, but I think that that's really a great example of what I've called intelligence-as-a-service and what we're going to continue to see as features which really help the user not only understand how they get the most refund back with H&R Block but also how the software really helps make the process a lot easier as they do their taxes.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, a couple related questions. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the fact that the regulator hasn't approved, or doesn't seem to have any merits for not approving the bank sale. It sounds like you're maybe implying that there's other factors at hand here. And if that's the case, and even if it's not the case, and the regulator's going to take an unknown period of time to approved this, doesn't that make this the new normal? And if it is the new normal and even in consideration of everything that you talked in terms of volumes and unit accounting, how do you generate earnings growth on a sustainable basis going forward without a bank sale? How \u2013 units in assisted, regardless of accounting decline, is that sustainable for you to be able to generate earnings growth for a long period of time with declining units within assisted especially where this year, you've seen it drag down your Tax Plus product as well?","And then on margins, you've talked about a range in the past. You're still at the high end of that range with less revenue growth, and again the inability to buy back shares. Wouldn't you want to stretch that margin target upwards in order to generate sustainable earnings per share gains even without the ability to get rid of the bank?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, there is a lot there. Again, also thank you for that. Let me take the beginning part and make sure that we're clear in terms of what we're saying on the bank update. And then, Greg, I think if you want to take in general, and I'll pipe in if there's something I want to add. I don't think we wanted to indicate anything other than there is no information at this time. And while we're frustrated by the pace of the project, we don't see any reason why this wouldn't \u2013 transaction would not be approved on its merits.","Now, so there's no signaling, there's no, nothing of \u2013 and this seems to be taking a long. That is from our perspective, and probably many people would be with the same way. I'm not sure the regulator does. And for those of you who would deal with other banks and this whole industry, things are taking a long time in terms of any kind of deals that are being approved. I don't want to speak for the regulators, but I don't think they think this is \u2013 I think they feel they're being thorough and complete as they approach this transaction.","So while it's frustrating, while I would have thought we would have had an answer by now, there is nothing \u2013 and hopefully, we've gotten this through -there's nothing to indicate that anything other than that this will move forward. However, the timing is something that is still in the hands of the regulators, and I think from their perspective, and again I can't speak for them and I don't think they're going to speak about this, I think the timing is consistent with some of the ways they look at other deals.","Now, as for what the implications of that are \u2013 and again, I think every one of us also want to be very clear, we are not going to change our mind, if you will. We do not want to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company any further, and our intention is to exit holding \u2013 owning our own bank. So in terms of share counts and things like that, we'll get to that at the appropriate time, but our intent has never wavered on this. This is a particular transaction we believe it will be approved, but that is not going to waver. Now as for the long-term growth, let me turn that over to Greg.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","And so the broader point that you're making really is about the investment thesis, and what I would say is that we continue to believe very strongly that our investment thesis remains true. Specifically, the growth levers that we've got, international growth or digital growth, our Tax Plus strategy, we believe is on a favorable tailwind from this business. We've had a good story on pricing. We've had a good story on mix. The unit count has been disappointing, but we are narrowing down the issue. And actually, if you sort of neutralize just this past season for EITC and EZ, we actually grew, and that's exactly what we wanted to do.","Importantly, and something that we've talked about before is \u2013 and that's why I've gotten this in my prepared remarks is that all units are not created equal. In fact if we looked at the lifetime value, there is a major discrepancy between a sort of more sophisticated tax return client and one that has a more simple return. So as an example, our decision to get rid of EZ was the right decision then, and we continue to believe it was the right decision. We gave up a lot of units, but the overall client experience for those clients that are left are better. We're going to have a deeper relationship with them, and they're higher-value clients from a financial perspective.","The EITC solution is one that we're working on. There's multiple solutions that we're talking about. We've talked about a couple of them publicly. We've got a couple other ideas there. That's one that we will be addressing more formally as we get into the next tax season. But overall, we very much \u2013 the investment thesis around a growth company remains solid here.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Let me just follow up on one aspect to your \u2013 it's great to hear that your resolved about not wanting to be in the bank charter business is unchanged. Is there not a possibility for you to unwind the bank without having to sell it, and therefore not have to go through the same regulatory approval cycle? Is that not a possibility that you would have if this process was to keep going on or was to end with an unfavorable ruling?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","The important point number one is what Bill said, is we're going to get out of this business. That's just something we've committed to. We will get it figured out. It's been frustrating, but we believe that the transaction we've entered into with BofI and talked about with all you many times is the way to go. As a hypothetical, in the event that doesn't work out, what is the next backup? There is a way to separate the going-forward bank support that this company needs to continue to sell Tax Plus products, which we're very committed to, and the actual formality involved with having a bank balance sheet. So effectively, we want to still be in the business of offering bank products, and we'll need a partner bank to do that. So think of that as one transaction.","We do have a legacy bank. We've got deposits. We've got liabilities, other liabilities. We've got assets that require a bank charter CD to find a home for those. So that would have to be a second step of that transaction. And frankly, it's really the second part that's really the hang-up in terms of getting that taken care of because whoever buys those will need to get approval from their regulator. But clearly, if you keep it small and go to a much larger bank, it makes it a little bit easier. So these are all considerations that we've got. But really, just to finish up my response to your question, the plan that we have with BofI is the right plan we believe, on its merits, will be approved.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Very good, thank you very much.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Gil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, hi, guys. On the bank sale, at the end of April on their earnings, BofI said that they believed a positive resolution would happen relatively soon. Do you share their timing optimism at all?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm out of the forecasting business. I think what we share and we continue to work very closely with BofI. We're committed to them. I think they're a terrific partner. We think the deal is going to be approved. But as for timing, we've been wrong a couple times on this. That's why I'm out of the timing business.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","You have to keep in the mind that we could be optimistic, they could be optimistic, but we're not the ones making the decision here; it's up to the regulator. So I think it's our position on this; it's just better not to comment. Greg and the both of you guys can do what they want to do. But I don't think there is a difference of opinion overall, it's really just how we want to represent a decision that the regulator has to make.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Greg, as an answer to the last question, you talked about potentially winding down or restructuring the transaction. As it stands, if I remember correctly, you estimated it would be about \u2013 the sale to BofI, the dilution will be about $0.07 to $0.09 a year. If you were to go down plan B, any help in how to think about the ongoing dilution?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Just to be clear, I talked about it as a hypothetical. I didn't say whether there's any plan to restructure by any means. And I guess the specific answer to your question is the best estimate I could give you is in line with what we currently understand, the $0.07 to $0.09. But it would clearly be a reflection of \u2013 if there was feedback from a regulator, a different party may have a different viewpoint, we may structure it differently, but I couldn't answer those questions specifically right now. So I'd say $0.07 to $0.09 is still the right number.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and then just a final question for me. So your survey work had suggested that 25% of your filers would be impacted by ACA. It came in at 16%. You obviously invested some money both one-time and then ongoing in terms of ACA. Have you thought at all about right-sizing the investment? You were very good at driving efficiencies a few years ago. I'm just wondering if you think you're going to do something some more now.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, Thomas, we're obviously looking, starting our planning for 2016 and we'll take a look at that. I do think the investment we made in training, in marketing, that really established us certainly from the research we've gotten back as the people to turn to when it comes to this issue. I think our people were very well prepared, handled all of the simple and complex areas of this tax law change. I think our feedback on our marketing efforts was very strong. So it was an investment. I think that we've established that. Therefore, do we have to spend at that same level? Probably not, but we're not prepared at this point to get into specifics going forward. You'll obviously hear more about that in December.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","But just to be clear, that is not a reflection. We continue to be very bullish about the ACA in our business. Reduction in investment is really just a reflection of the one-year startup costs going away theoretically.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And also I think all the feedback we got, which I think shows that that investment was worthwhile.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Thomas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First off, I just wanted to touch on the decline attributable to the EZ clients. Do you have any sense as to how these clients may react next year? Do you foresee any of the carryover impact you saw this year into next, or do you believe that we've worked through most of that decline?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","So we think that most of the impact of the decision has been worked through the system at this point. So it's really going to be a mostly a nonissue for us last year. And just as a reminder, we ran this free EZ promotion for several years. It had a life. We did a lot of financial assessment of the value of those clients, retention of those clients, propensity to buy new products. We believe that the program had run its life. We terminated the product. Of course, there was that one-year benefit because we started charging for it again, but we lost a lot of units. There was a bit of an echo effect this year. But to be clear, our research and our belief is that a lot of those clients that left us are extremely price-sensitive and all they'll do is continue to shop around. They're not loyal to any particular company. So any company that's declaring victory over capturing a bunch of those units I think is a little bit misguided in what the real value of those clients are, unless they keep their prices at the low end.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, got it. And sorry to belabor this point, but the 25% of your clients being impacted that you talked about at the Analyst Day versus 16% you saw, do you still think the true number is 25%? Was the result this year just impacted by really no control around documentation? I'm just wondering if you still believe the 25% figure is the accurate one or if it sits closer to the 16%.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll take first one, and then, Mark, you should add your perspective. I do think it is. I think it's a combination of not only the documentation requirements that will enhance next year, but also this year the number of people who are going to be enrolled in the exchanges, coupled with I think a greater awareness that this is something that you have to comply with. But go ahead, Mark.","Mark Ciaramitaro - Vice President-Health Care","I think the Supreme Court ruling notwithstanding that really, if you look at that the drivers of volume going forward \u2013 Bill already mentioned them \u2013 compliance is a big factor. We think that that obviously explained one of the big area of the shortfall this year, just the doubling of enrollment and the continuing climb in enrollment. If you look at the CBO estimates eventually climbing close to $20 million, we'll have a significant impact on the number of people impacted by ACA. So we absolutely believe over the long run that we'll be in that 20% to 25% range.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that if you go back to our statements, we believed all along, and we didn't \u2013 we kept hedging on the first year. We weren't sure where it was going to land. Okay, so now we have, if you will, a baseline. But we have felt all along with this would take a few years to really unfold, and we'll see if that's true. But we do believe it will be.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, got it. And I'm not sure if I missed this, but another one on ACA. I realize there was a lot of confusion and delay in mailing out the forms from the IRS. But did the sort of profile of the clients that were ACA-impacted \u2013 could you discuss how many of those were assisted versus DIY? Was there any share shift from those clients that were H&R Block clients last year? Just hoping to better understand what the dynamics are between assisted and DIY as it relates to the ACA-impacted population.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What I would say, and then Mark, correct me if I don't \u2013 or, augment this. The impact was about the same between both assisted and DIY. There was not much of a shift either way, I think primarily because as people walked into using their filing methods, and the many, many people, a high, high percentage in this industry stay within their filing method, there's some degree of switching. But I think that contributed to that, so there was not a material shift and the impact was about the same whether you sought assistance of did it yourself.","Mark Ciaramitaro - Vice President-Health Care","I think, I slightly it's slightly higher on the assisted side, Bill, because of the client mix there, but agree we did not see any significant evidence of shifting going forward. That doesn't mean that as complexity increases with more people have into go through the reconciliation process and with it facing the refund impacts of that that we aren't going to see the potential for some shifting going forward. What we have learned this year is that when people do see refund impacts, and we do see delays in issuing of forms and corrected forms, that that does have the potential to alter both filing behavior timing and method. But we didn't see substantial impacts this year.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, got it, and one final one from me. If you could, just help us with what retention rates look like in DIY and assisted, and in the latter, particularly for the, say, the non-EZ filers, and how that might have compared to your branded retail competitors?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You want to take that or...?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","We were actually very big with our retention rates overall on the assisted side. They crept up. It wasn't quite at point, but a little bit shy of that. So all things being equally \u2013 which included, by the way, the issues we've talked about, so that's actually a very good result. And then, Jason, you want to talk about DIY?","Jason L. Houseworth - President-U.S. Tax Product Strategy and Development","On the online side, although I still think we have a lot of room for growth, in online, we were up about 200 basis points and in desktop software, we were up about a 160 basis points.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. That's all from me. Thanks a lot.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Anj.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you so much. I apologize for going back to the bank, but just a couple of quick follow-up questions. If the deal does go through, can you just remind us what steps are needed and the timeline for any potential capital return?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Happy to. So upon receiving regulatory approval, what would happen is at that point, we would have what I would call mechanical closed process with BofI. The steps themselves, they're really administrative in nature. We don't have, for example financing contingences and things like that. The amount of time, there's like client notices, there's like articles of incorporation you'd have to change, there are some bid transfers that have to go through, and just very mechanical things. That would be somewhere between 30 to 45 days.","Our preference is typically to try to close the transaction at the end of a month. It just makes all the accounting easier. So that might just have to factor in. But 30 days 45 days would take to close the transaction, and we would think effectively \u2013 effectively means not precisely, but effectively, at the same point, we would then no longer be deemed as a savings and loan holding company, so call that concurrent, as it were. And then at that point, we'd wash our hands, BofI would then be responsible for our tax products going forward that are bank-related, and we'd look forward to a successful tax season with them really running the engine for us. That would be how the process works.","Jeff M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then again, after that is there any issue in terms of timing for you being able to return capital to shareholders?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we mean there's obvious considerations. We have historical blackout periods and things like that. But these are things that we well understand. And our intent would be, of course, just given the timeline that we've already gone through, to be fairly quick and expeditious in getting information back to the shareholder base about what our plans and thinking would be. So I'd say it's fairly much when we close, we get up and start talking people more publicly what our plans and thinking are.","Jeff M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's great. And then if the deal does not happen, do the restrictions on the share repurchase and any increase in dividends, are they still in force?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","So we are a savings and loan holding company at the parent company level, and we're actually regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank. That's the parent company regulated; the bank itself is regulated by the OCC. So we fall, as a parent company, under all the capital requirements and things that the bank holding companies typically are. We have been in a period now for two years effectively where we've been building capital to meet those requirements. We don't believe that there's any issues with the pace of which we're doing that. So that's one thing I just sort of set aside. Then, of course, when the bank transaction completes, at that point we start with a $1 billion number we mentioned earlier, and then any potential incremental debt we may want to raise and then of course it also has impacted go forward capital policy at that point.","Jeff M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then if I could just focus back on the core business, I know it's still too early to look at fiscal year 2016 and with the caveat you gave us regarding just looking at volume growth. But with that being said, is there any reason that we should not expect the industry volume growth to increase 1% to 2% next year, as you thought might line have occurred in 2015?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff, that's a great question that obviously we're contemplating right now. We were surprised this year that the unit account was under 1%. So we're studying that, and I'm not trying to kick the can down the road, but I guess I am to December. We'll look at that. You would not \u2013 there is no obvious reason why it wouldn't \u2013 it's been pretty consistent for 50-plus years, pretty much in line with nonfarm employment. But, we've got to study what \u2013 when we get the full information, which frankly, from an IRS perspective, we really don't get until the fall, that we can really understand why we're short this year. So more to come, but I think your supposition is not a bad one. But we were surprised this year with the growth in employment and everything that it didn't, even to some extent go towards the higher end to that 1% to 2% range.","Jeff M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, fair enough. And just a couple of quick modeling questions for fiscal year 2016. What tax work should we be using and what should we be modeling for both capital spending in any potential franchise or purchases? Thanks.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","I think we can certainly get in a more detail conversation offline. But in general, I'd say that at this point, we have had great success in the tax rate this year with 34.5% in line with last year. A lot of reasons for that were especial one-off type things, and now we've had a couple of good years there. So I'm pretty happy with that. But what we said is the core base tax rate for the company continues to be the 38% to 39% range. At some point in the near future, we'll give you a better indicator what we think that will be long-term, but for now I keep it there. And then as we've said, consistently we think the right CapEx level for this company is really between 3% and 4% of revenues. It's been little higher than that and trended toward to the high end, really, as we've made up a few years \u2013 several years ago that we're under spent. But we think we'll revert back to the 3% to 4%. That's the best guidance, I can give you.","Jeff M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right, great. And any potential franchiser purchases built in?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Nothing, just like we've seen this year, would be my position right now.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But we will continue on that path, as Greg said, in terms of we're in discussions right now that usually occurs after the tax season, it takes a while. So we don't really have anything to report except we will probably proceed in that matter again, but as Greg said, not to the level that we did this past year.","Jeff M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, got it. Thank you so much.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates. Your line is open.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Thank you. So following up on couple of things that's been discussed, one, ACA could you give us the cost that you incurred this year for ACA? And secondly, regarding the balance due increase, you'd think \u2013 or maybe I should say, I would think that would be beneficial to Block, beneficial to assisted, probably detrimental to do it yourself and maybe and certainly suggest that the economy is improving. So we have that unknown factor, but going forward it \u2013 what does more balance due suggest to you?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's an interesting question, Mike. Does that \u2013 one of the answers here, Jason's commented would the balance do impact \u2013 I can't see a reason why it would impact do-it-yourself versus assisted. But maybe I'm missing the point there, because I think it's a matter of \u2013 no matter how you filed, the balance due what was higher this year for a variety of reasons. In terms of this specific cost, we're not going to break out specifically what it costs. Obviously, you can see in our some of our numbers we did increase marketing, we did increase training, and we felt it was an important investment. We think it was a good investment. But we're not going to breakout anything specifically.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","I can break the costs in three buckets for you, and Bill mentioned a couple of them. The marketing costs, for sure, which had included merchandising and store merchandising signs and things like that, that may be a season-to-season type of thing. It may not go up or may not go down, because we continue to be very bullish about ACA. The second bucket is really all the changes we had to make to our systems, programming changes that required a fair amount of hours, and that cost money. Those for the most part are one-time in nature. We're not going to have at a same level this coming season and beyond. And then third is really the training, and there was, as you could imagine a big blip upfront is to get people up to speed on that law itself, the changes. But that's fairly durable now, so most of that would go away next year. We are not going to, as Bill said, quantify specifically, but these are not immaterial amounts of money that are in the non-recurring buckets.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Getting back to the balance due, I would expect that Block would generally do better than the retail firms. On the other hand, maybe the CPAs take market share. Do you have some thoughts regarding...","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jason, you want to give a perspective on that?","Jason L. Houseworth - President-U.S. Tax Product Strategy and Development","I think when we talk about complexity change, complexity is perceived. So if I have a balance due change and ultimately I feel like because of that, I'm now more complex, then that's something that I think, getting back to your original question, Michael, I mean that something that I could understand. But as far as how we approach the CPAs and the independents, I mean, not just on balance due but in every aspect, I mean we think about this as how do we create a superior experience. And that's something that we are certainly designed for as we look forward to next year and beyond.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","I will say that \u2013 we mentioned it briefly but I'll repeat it. The 50% off promotion worked out really well from our perspective, and it was probably somewhat because of the balance due clients. People saw that and felt it may be a good chance to come talk to us. And so we sort of saw those intersection points quite clearly.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's Q&A session.

Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Colby, and good afternoon, everyone.","Earlier today we announced our results for the fiscal 2016 third quarter, which ended January 31. As a reminder, due to the highly seasonal nature of our business, a majority of our revenues and all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during the fiscal fourth quarter, and thus fiscal third quarter financial results are not indicative of expected performance for the full year.","We are just half way through the tax season with millions of tax returns we have to prepare. And so far, we have seen broad sweeping changes affecting the tax industry from what is really a transitional year for both the industry and H&R Block. Some of the changes we've seen include: aggressive and numerous fraud prevention measures implemented at both the Federal and state levels; a decline in early season tax filings indicating a real delay to the season, possibly due to the overall impact of fraud, the Affordable Care Act and other industry factors; the continued evolution of the DIY category as a result of significant changes in pricing and client acquisition strategies; and the reintroduction of the refund anticipation loan into the assisted category. Although it will take the availability of complete season results to fully understand the effects of these changes, I'd like to spend some time today talking about what we believe each of these could mean at the industry level and how they are impacting H&R Block. Then I'll address the current season results to-date. Finally, Greg Macfarlane, our CFO, will walk you through the quarter's financial results.","Let's start our detailed look at the industry by first talking about the progress made this season at the Federal and state levels in the battle against tax fraud. As we have discussed for several years, fraud continues to heavily impact the tax preparation industry. This season, however, is not merely a continuation of the same story that we've seen the past few years. We are now seeing significant changes implemented at both the Federal and state levels to combat fraud, and we are very pleased with the progress being made. Although there is still much to be done, positive momentum is building.","At the Federal level, we have seen refund processing slow noticeably from prior years, which we believe is an indication of the implementation of additional fraud filters. For example, in 2015, the IRS had processed and refunded $66 billion in tax refunds by February 6th. This year, that number had dropped 11% to $59 billion. And the average time for taxpayers to receive their refund has increased from 10 days last year to 13 days this year.","Finally, our data shows that larger Federal refunds are taking longer to process than smaller refunds, which may be another indication of stronger fraud prevention measures. Additionally, state governments are not waiting for the Federal government to fix this problem. This season, we have seen initiatives in dozens of states designed to reduce fraud. For example, 14 states implemented W-2 matching to ensure taxpayers' reported earnings on their tax returns equals that reported by their employer on W-2s. 18 states now require some type of identification quiz to validate and receive a refund. 17 states are using an identity theft indicator on state returns. And we even saw Maryland shut down one competitor's ability to e-file state returns from several of its franchisee locations due to suspicious returns.","This is also the first year that increased security measures are required from tax software providers as a result of the Security Summit, a public\/private partnership between the IRS, state Departments of Revenue and industry leaders. Providers have implemented stronger security protocols and now require additional online filer authentication methods.","Additionally, tax preparation companies implemented better fraud monitoring processes, are required to report suspicious activity leads to the IRS in a timely manner and some have increased their security infrastructure to better protect taxpayers' personal information. H&R Block has been doing most of this for years, but it is good for the industry that other tax providers are now required to follow the same processes. We applaud all of these new efforts and know that more changes on the horizon. Federal W-2 matching and further enhancement of information technology security protocols at both the Federal and state levels are forthcoming.","Despite all these efforts however, fraud remains a huge issue for this industry and our country, and there's still much more work to be done. This is evidenced by the magnitude of fraud being perpetuated year after year. We have discussed these numbers before, but they are so staggering they are worth repeating. The Treasury Department estimates that there are $14 billion to $17 billion in improper earned income tax credit payments and at least $5 billion in tax identity theft losses annually. We continue to advocate for EITC form parity, stronger DIY measures and minimum standards for tax return preparers. Such measures, combined with the steps already taken and those planned for next year, are needed to ensure that tax refunds are delivered to those that deserve them.","And while it's widely accepted that the level of fraud in the industry is significant, we don't have clarity on how fraudulent returns impact return counts as reported by the IRS. Additionally, it's not clear what our competitors are including in their return counts which makes it difficult to understand changes in filings year-over-year. We hope to have more clarity on fraud and its effect on the industry, but it's likely that such information will become available more slowly than we would all like.","Despite the uncertainty related to fraud, there has been a decline in the number of tax returns filed in the early season, indicating a shift from the first half of the season to the second half. The latest numbers from the IRS show that tax returns received as of February 26 continue to be down 0.4%. There are several possible reasons for this delay, including fraudulent activity and related efforts to reduce fraud, refunds taking longer to process, an increase in the number of balance due returns, and the Affordable Care Act. What is not clear, however, is how much of the reduction in tax returns is due to taxpayers taking longer to file their taxes as opposed to a true reduction in returns being filed this year due to effective fraud filters at the IRS.","It's worth spending some additional time on one of the possible causes for this delay that I just mentioned, the Affordable Care Act. The ACA continues to influence consumer tax filing behaviors. Last year was the first time many taxpayers truly felt the impact of the ACA on their tax returns. This year, the ACA should affect even more taxpayers for a number of reasons.","First, increased marketplace enrollment means that more people will have to reconcile their insurance subsidies with their tax returns. Next, this is the first year that the IRS will be able to confirm that taxpayers have private insurance through the issuance of Forms 1095-B and 1095-C. This may make taxpayers reluctant to just check the box on their tax returns given that the IRS will eventually be validating their claims. That said, the deadline for issuance of these forms has been delayed until March 31, which may cause confusion for some. Finally, the penalties for non-compliance have more than doubled, potentially costing taxpayers an estimated $500 per return versus approximately $200 last year. It's clear that there are a lot of moving pieces around the ACA which may be contributing to the delay this season. Of course, we won't have a full understanding of its impact until season's end.","Let me shift gears now and talk about the DIY category. This category is also undergoing change, primarily due to the category leader's decision to focus on driving volume in low-lifetime value, price-sensitive filers. This tactic centers around offering products for free and creating movement in the DIY category, placing pressure on other competitors in this space. From an overall industry perspective, the early season results reported by the IRS indicate a share shift to DIY. This shift is consistent with early season results in prior years and will likely moderate as the season continues.","Finally, this year has marked the reintroduction of refund anticipation loans in the industry. These loans are being offered by our branded assisted competitors as well as independent tax preparers in varying forms. These low dollar loans are not widely promoted and generally offer interest-free rates. It's hard to quantify the impact of these products on the industry or our business, but we are watching this development closely.","With that overview of the industry, let's now shift our focus to H&R Block and why this is a year of transition for our company. First, as many of you recall, in August, we were able to successfully divest H&R Block Bank and transition three of our core financial products to our bank partner. We are pleased to say that the transition has gone well and has been seamless from a client service perspective.","In addition to the operational changes, there were also changes to our financials as a result of the bank divestiture which we discussed at the Investor Conference in December. Greg will review these changes again later, but I wanted to provide a quick reminder that the divestiture impacted both the economics of the business as well as the presentation of certain items on the income statement, diluting earnings and giving our financials a different look from previous years.","We are also moving forward with our new capital structure. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 12 million shares. This brings total repurchases for the fiscal year to 19% of outstanding shares. In fact, considering both share repurchases and dividends, we have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2016 alone.","Finally, we continue to innovate to ensure we are delivering exceptional value to our clients. We are in the second year of our newest product, Tax Identity Shield, which provides real help to taxpayers facing the unwelcome threat of tax identity theft.","And we launched a new brand, Block Advisors, focused on delivering tax planning and small business services to those clients that have year-round tax and business needs. Our new brand is up and running with over 280 offices throughout the country, staffed with expert tax advisors ready to assist clients with complex tax situations. As we said at our Investor Conference, this is a long-term play for us but we're pleased with the progress made this year.","With this overview on the season and our business, let's now talk about our third quarter results. As I mentioned earlier, it has been a slow start to the tax season. We are seeing the impact of delayed filings on our volumes and our revenues. Although assisted volume has declined compared to last year, the results are more positive from a share perspective. And as we said in December, it will take time to turn the early season client loss around, but we are taking steps in the right direction.","For the clients that we have served this season, we have seen positive increases in both price and form mix. Clients with more complex tax preparation needs continue to see H&R Block as a trusted expert to help them navigate through their complex tax situations. And our products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. Despite the early season decline in volume, we are pleased with overall product attach rates which Greg will cover later.","In conclusion, this is a year of change for both the tax preparation industry and H&R Block. Macro factors such as fraud and the ACA continue to impact the industry, causing filing and refund delays. Although the first half of the tax season has been slower than expected, we are anticipating a stronger second half. As is often the case, this will again be a tax season where results can't be measured until the tax return filing deadline has passed. We look forward to sharing those results at the conclusion of the season.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to review the financial results.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody.","First, it's important that I reiterate what Bill mentioned earlier. Because of the seasonality of our business, the majority of our revenues in all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during our fiscal fourth quarter, and as such, fiscal third quarter financial results are not necessarily indicative of expected performance for the full year.","Third quarter revenues were $475 million, down 6.8% from the prior year. As we discussed at the Investor Conference, we consider four components when evaluating revenue: volume, price, mix and attach rate. I'd like to take a moment to discuss each of these a little bit further.","From a volume perspective, we came into the season expecting industry-wide returns to increase 1% to 2%. As of February 26, total industry returns actually decreased 0.4% compared to last year. As Bill discussed, this represents a possible industry-wide shift of approximately 2 million clients out of the first peak of the season and into the second half. Similar to industry statistics, H&R Block has also experienced lower volume in the first half of the season.","As of February 28, we were down 6% in total returns. The decline in early season returns doesn't come as a complete surprise as we have communicated that this is a significant challenge, and solutions will take time to yield results. And although we are disappointed with this decline, we have seen an improvement from the share loss in our assisted business when comparing mid-season results from this year to last year.","With that perspective in volume, let's talk about the progress we're seeing on the other three components of revenue: price, mix and product attach. In terms of price and mix, both continue to be a positive story for us. We have once again been able to achieve reasonable prices increases this year and are also pleased with our form mix as volume declines continue to be concentrated in lower value forms. We are, again, running our half-off promotion for new clients through March 31, which was very successful last year. This promotion is designed to attract more complex, higher value returns at a time when our offices historically have had available capacity, and we anticipated further improving the overall mix for the season.","Finally, our Tax Plus products continue to positively contribute to overall results. Although sales are closely related to volumes, we are pleased with our overall product attach rate. Specifically, our refund transfer attach in DIY has grown, following enhancement to the interview flow within our software product. Additionally, Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield attach rates continue to increase. Peace of Mind provides a tremendous value to our client considering its low cost, and Tax Identity Shield is an example of smart innovation, the right product at the right time. As a reminder, revenue from these two products is deferred, and as such, only a small portion is recognized in the year of sale.","In addition to the factors just discussed, revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which we expect to result in a 1% reduction in overall revenue for the full year. The revenue decline is also part due to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. As a reminder, the bank divestiture impacts our financial results in a couple of different ways. First, the economics paid to our bank partner result in lower revenues and increased expenses and, as such, is dilutive to earnings.","Second, because we are no longer a bank holding company, there are certain accounting classification changes that negatively impact revenues. On a full-year basis, these changes are expected to result in a 1% decline in revenue and a 1 point drop in EBITDA margin, consistent with the guidance provided at our Investor Conference in December.","Operating expenses increased $10 million or 1.7% from the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to acquired businesses, as well as an increase in marketing expense. Although the acquisitions of independents and franchisees add expense to our income statement, it's important to remember that these transactions are accretive from an earnings perspective.","Interest expense increased to $24 million, primarily as a result of the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt into September of 2015. Given all these factors, net loss from continuing operations was $79 million or $0.34 per share compared to a net loss of $35 million or $0.13 per share in fiscal 2015.","As Bill mentioned earlier, this is a transition year for us. So heading into the year, we anticipated a drop of EBITDA margin percentage due to the impacts of the bank divestiture and the acquisitions of our franchisees. For the full fiscal year, we are now targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin slightly below the 29% to 30% we shared at the Investor Conference, but still within our overall guidance of 28% to 32%. This is primarily due to the current year decline in returns in our assisted business. Our long-term EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged at 28% to 32%.","Turning to discontinued operations. There were positive developments during the fiscal third quarter as Sand Canyon was able to enter into settlement agreements with certain counterparties related to representation and warranty obligations. The settlement of these claims is an ongoing process that began eight years ago. During this time, the Sand Canyon management team has been diligently focused on bringing the representation and warranty contingency to its conclusion. Although the wind-down of Sand Canyon is expected to take time, this quarter's activity represents strong movement towards the resolution of its obligation.","This quarter's settlement amounts were fully covered by prior accruals. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation of warranty claims decreased $89 million to $65 million as of January 31st. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong in any potential veil piercing arguments.","Turning to our balance sheet. Certain balances are substantially different compared to the prior year due to the divesture of H&R Block Bank. During the second quarter, cash balances and certain liabilities, including all the bank's deposit liabilities, were transferred to our bank partner. Additionally, the available for sale securities held to meet regulatory requirements were liquidated.","We did retain our mortgage loans held for investment and will continue to evaluate options for this portfolio. For additional information regarding these transactions, refer to previous 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC during the last calendar year. The increase in long-term debt is due to the issuance of $1 billion of senior notes in September of 2015. Additionally, due to GAAP requirement, borrowings under the committed line of credit, which totaled $1.1 billion at January 31, are also recorded as long-term debt.","This did not reflect our intent regarding repayment of such outstanding amount, as the current balance in the line of credit is anticipated to be paid off by the end of the fiscal year. It is merely a reflection of the fact that the line of credit agreement runs longer than one year. As a reminder, we did not utilize any commercial paper borrowings this tax season, instead relying on the line of credit for our funding needs.","Finally, as mentioned by Bill, during the quarter, we continued our practice of returning capital to you, our shareholders. We repurchased and retired approximately 12 million shares of common stock at an aggregate price of $392 million and at an average price of $32.72. A quick side note, because I know a lot of you ask about this, some of these share repurchases were executed during the tax season. As of January 31, approximately 224 million shares were outstanding. These repurchases are an affirmation of our confidence in the future of H&R Block and our desire to create value for our shareholders. All together, we have bought back 19% of outstanding shares for a total of $1.9 billion since the beginning of this fiscal year.","I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill for closing comments.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Greg.","We've seen a lot of change in the tax industry over the past couple of months, but as I say every year, there's also a lot tax season left, and we are focused on delivering a stronger second half.","We are now ready to open the call for questions. So let me turn it back to Kyle.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Gil Luria from Wedbush. Your line is open.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. So very helpful commentary on why the tax season got pushed out for in its entirety. But can you help us bridge the 3% decline in the assisted category for the IRS numbers as of the most recent update and the 12% decline that you had in your assisted business year-to-date and how much of that is the refund anticipation loan? And can we really call it that if they're not charging interest if they're just pushing out the payment for the filing?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Gil. I'll take the first part. Apples to apples, because in our press release, we did update volume through February 28 which matches up reasonably well to the February 26 minus 3% and our volumes is not down 12%, it's down 7.9%.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","I apologize for it, yes, 7.9%","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. It's all right.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","And to the second part of your question, Gil, and actually I thank you for asking because it's a good clarification. So, the refund anticipation loan is a product that many of you may be familiar with. Historically, it was a loan \u2013 there was an interest rate, there was origination fees. It was a profit center for tax origination companies. That's not necessarily within the market now. As a technical matter, it's still considered under IRS definition to be a RAL why we call it that.","But you're right, it's an interest-free loan that costs \u2013 that are incurred because they are very real cost to the loan itself including bad debt. There's money to be borrowed to lend out, et cetera. That is I guess the best way to think about that is in our cost of acquisition, or marketing cost that will be incurred by the tax preparation companies that they really are not able to pass on directly to the consumer itself.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","So, let me ask for the right numbers this time. How do we bridge the gap between the minus 3.6% from the IRS and the minus 7.9% that you had?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, in other words, why are we below what the industry is, is that what your question is, essentially?","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yes.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. As we've said for the past couple of years, we have had an early season client decline that really was a combination of two factors. One, we made a decision to get out of the free EZ game. That has hurt our early season client. And then the EITC migration from the assisted segment to digital due to the disparity in documentation requirements continues to make that a tougher piece for us.","So, the real reason is we have chosen strategically to do that. We've also said that this will take a few years to turn this decline. We do believe we have been doing better than last year, but at this point, there's a lot of tax season to go. The numbers are what they are.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Hi, Bill. Hey, Greg. Bill, as you look at this season, it seems like it started similar to last year. Would you think that as the season ends, you would see similar results where the back half of your season really improves, yet because of the negative volume count so far on the assisted side, you're not able to make it up so you kind of \u2013 will have a similar trend to last year?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's hard to say, Kartik. The last two years have been \u2013 again to the point of basically the end of February, you have overall, no matter what form you use, the number of returns is down, which has been odd for us. We believe we will have a stronger second half, but at this point, we're trying to execute day by day. But we believe that \u2013 the second half is usually where we really pick things up. So, yes, we believe that that's going to improve, but every season is different. And we just have to keep grinding.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","And importantly, and we said this in the prepared remarks, but there are effectively 2 million Americans that have not yet filed that this time last year would have filed, and actually when we sort of get into the details of who those people are, they're going to be disproportionately ACA, they'll be disproportionately kind of client sets that we do a lot of business with historically. So we do have, as Bill said, a good history of really doing well in the second half, and I think even better sort of set up for this year given the profile.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And then just finally, Bill \u2013 I'm not sure if you said this in your prepared remarks, but at least it was in the press release, you said early season loss will take time. And when you say take time as in, do you think that this can improve next tax season or it's going to take a couple of tax seasons for this to wash out and as you execute more and \u2013 for it to improve?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't want to necessarily get into forecasting the next season or whatever, but I do think, we have said that this is going to take a little bit of time, but at this point, I'm not ready to talk about next season or the season after that.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","But Kartik, to be clear, it's already improving. From two years ago to last year, we saw an improvement. From last year to this year in the first half, we see an improvement. It's not improved in that we're not at a point where we feel comfortable that we're taking share. So that's really, I think, the question you're asking. And I think, Bill, that's...","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think that's fair.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","... what the answer is going to say (29:46). It's going to take time because ultimately this is an issue that's got multiple layers to it. It deals with very, very deep value, price\/value type of discussions, but these are things that we're working on and we see progress thus far.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. So just on your leverage, at your Investor Day, you said that as of October 31, you were at 2.2 times to 2.5 times, and you felt investment-grade was 2.5 times to 3 times . Can you just update us on where you are now, and how to think about the significant cash flow that's going to be coming in in the fourth quarter and how you're thinking about future buybacks? Thanks.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Thomas. So you're correct. We had \u2013 back when we announced our capital plan in the fall time, had indicated our ongoing commitment to investment grade. We quantified what that means from a debt-to-EBITDA. So an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA was somewhere between 2.5 times to 3 times. And we had indicated back in December that we'd be in the low 2-ish range.","Generally speaking, when you sort of annualize it out, that's kind of where we are still at this point in time. We did raise $1 billion back in the fall. That was included in those numbers, which obviously would imply there's additional capacity there. But as a prospective statement, and I think you know the answer here, we are going to create shareholder value opportunistically. And so at the point at which the board decides in which the right way to move forward is, then we'd be able to execute that plan, and then after the fact, typically, we'd then share it. The fall time announcement was unusual in that we gave a proactive view, but our practice will, going forward, be more after-the-fact communication.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. I didn't expect you to give any guidance on \u2013 I know where you stand there. And then just in terms of \u2013 last season, at this point, kind of end of February, you were tracking down I think it was 8.7% on the assisted side. You ended down 4.6%. Last year it was weird where the season started, your declines kind of accelerated in mid-season. This time, it seems like your \u2013 the declines are just improving. And so based off of that negative 4.5% you saw last season, can you give us some kind of sense of if you think this year will be better or worse than that?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We're not going to give forward-looking guidance like that, Thomas. Sorry.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I thought it was worth a shot. I'll ask one more question; this isn't a joke.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. A make-up question. Go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","This isn't a joke. What do you think would happen to your business if Donald Trump becomes president? Thank you.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no, I know. And I've been asked this in interviews. I don't know. I think that any president will have to work with 535 members of Congress. As I've said repeatedly, we are in favor of ways to simplify the tax code. We believe we have ideas around that because we have to train all these people. I've been quoted as saying, which is true, there are five different definitions of a child in the tax code. It's 74,000 pages long.","So, I do think that there are ways that we can aid in any effort to simplify, but the fundamental issue is the tax return is the fundamental way that the Federal government runs its social program. So whether that's the Affordable Care Act or the earning income tax credit or childcare, dependent care, all of these various refundable credits are run through the tax return and those take awhile to figure out how you would administer them and whether they were even \u2013 there's been talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act and then \u2013 but there's also been talk about deducting premiums for healthcare which is not what is on there now.","So we have to wait until we see obviously who's elected, what the makeup of the Congress is. Right now, believe me, I'm all in on this tax season. And any president would take office as the tax season would be already underway. But we stand ready to \u2013 and I spend enough time in Washington. We stand ready to work with whoever. So, we'll figure out where that goes.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, I just wanted to follow up on some of the earlier answers and questions. Bill, you mentioned that there's been an improvement in sort of the share loss that you've seen this year versus last year. So, could you just talk about what efforts you guys are putting underway that are sort of mitigating the share loss?","And the sort of follow-up to that is I think you mentioned that there's a free EZ impact, if you could just clear that out for me. I think we had been under the assumption that the free EZ impact should have been lapped this year and there shouldn't be any impact this year. So if you could just touch on those points, I'd appreciate it.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think part of the commentary on the free EZ is you have seen in the early season the shift to digital that the Absolute Zero promotion has done. So I do think that there is a lot of free conversation that goes out there. So I think that has had an impact. I'm not sure if I remember the other part of the question.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","It's really in terms of the programs we've done around share loss. So just to be clear, the sort of the ripple, the second year impact of free EZ, that happened as far as we can tell. But you saw different creative from us this year. Some of the products that we made, detailed changes that we felt would be more perfect for these target audiences. We've done some in-store distributions or in-store merchandising is different. Some of the training's been different for the tax professionals themselves. There's been changes to some compensation programs. These are things that \u2013 this is why we sort of get into this \u2013 many, many things that have to be looked at to solve this. Of course, we've been tackling a lot of those and there will be more to come.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And for my second question, just on ACA, any early indications how the behavior of ACA impacted filers is trending the season? Are you seeing any \u2013 the higher penalties drive any shift in the behavior, just overall any differences that you'd call out on ACA behavior this year versus last?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think this season is showing some unusual filing patterns. So I don't think we have a good sense for it yet. We do believe that part of the delay to the season is due to the delays in these \u2013 the 1095-Bs and 1095-Cs going out late. So we have seen fewer clients and we expect to \u2013 but as Greg said, there's still 2 million filers to come. So we have to wait and see how the season plays out. So frankly it's a little hard to read right now.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Everything we talked about in December with you, which is you all probably painfully remember, we did a lot of detail on ACA, still true from our viewpoint. I actually \u2013 to me, that's just me speaking, I find it somewhat encouraging that there is a delay in the season because if part of it, which I think is reasonable, is ACA, that means people's behaviors are reflecting the realities of ACA. Now how that plays out still to be determined and as we've said and we'll continue to say this is a multiple year opportunity for us, but the best time to ask that question will really be at the end of the season, from our perspective.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, got it. And a quick follow-up on ACA, last one from me. It seems we've seen some ACA enrollment forecast getting lower this year. How are you guys feeling about that 20% to 25% ACA impacted filer number longer term? Are you still sort of confident in that or any changes to that effect longer term? Thanks.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have not, at this point, updated that again. We want to see where things land. But at this point, we're holding to that but we'll see how things play out. As we've said, we're in a multiyear journey with this and we'll adjust if need be depending upon where enrollments land and what the impact this season is. But at this point, we're holding to that belief.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good afternoon. First question, guys. Obviously, you were pursuing early season volume this year via the ad campaign that we saw with the $1 million a day giveaway. I'm curious what type of impact did you feel that had and does that come in to any part of this EBITDA margin revision where you're saying you're still be above 28%, but slightly below the 29% level this year. So, it's a two-part question. Really, how you feel about the ad campaign and if there's any impact on the margin. And Greg, if you could share on the margin what the main components are maybe in rank order? Thank you.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll take the first part. I think we felt very good about the program. I know it created a tremendous amount of in-store excitement. I was able to give a couple of checks out to winners and it was very emotional that we were able to \u2013 part of it is obviously $1,000 and part of it was just people feeling like I won something and you heard that echo. We were even getting thank-you notes, which is very unusual for a tax preparation company.","So we did have higher marketing expense in the third quarter in January. But with regard to the EBITDA margin, I'll turn it over to Greg, we don't break out specifically what \u2013 essentially, I think what we said is with the lower volume at this point, we wanted to alert you to, we're probably on the lower end here, but I'll turn that over to Greg.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So we've been very consistent. We've said to you all that 28% to 32% is the range for us in the short term and the medium term here. I think you also know for those of you that's followed the story here for several years, we can change the margin when we want to. It was not long ago, frankly, we're at 26% EBITDA margin and we've been able to move it up. We've also been clear that our goal is not EBITDA margin as such; our goal is to get the revenue line moving. We've been making cost effort decisions constantly but we are reinvesting that, in fact, somewhat disproportionately into the top line, and that's kind of what we've been doing.","The slight revision to our margin is more just to kind of tighten it up in my viewpoint, and the main driver there, of course, is just the volume pressure that we're seeing because mostly the other factors that we look at are actually pretty good. So, we'll obviously be able to provide a more detailed reconciliation at the end of the tax season.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. That's a good segue to my second question. I was catching in the press release and in the commentary some glimpses of silver lining with regard to revenue per return. You all mentioned Peace of Mind, your ID theft product. And this is a two-parter again. I'm curious what you're seeing thus far as kind of a revenue per return asset versus the volume results we've seen. I know you're not going to give exact numbers, but anecdotally, if you could just share a little bit more.","And the second part of the question, Greg, is you mentioned revenue deferral from one \u2013 from beyond April, from one fiscal year to the other. Is that going to have a meaningful magnitude this year, do you believe, from what you've seen in the early season? Thank you.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So on the first part of your question, Scott, your analytical silver lining insight is correct. We are seeing some positive movement across our entire business and revenue per user. At this point, we don't want to \u2013 we've seen some positive on the attached piece, as Greg indicated. But again, we got to let the full season play out. We'll have full disclosure on all that, but we are seeing some positives on that.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So on the other question which is the nuts and bolts of the way we account for things and, Scott, I know you this, but for everyone else's benefit, if you go into our stores, you buy our products, which you should all buy our products \u2013 the Tax Identity Shield is a great product, by the way.","But last year, we bundled that product with the Peace of Mind product. This year, they're sold separately as well as in a bundle. But you'll be able to see the Tax Identity Shield product is $30 for the year for the individual, the Peace of Mind is $35-ish. And we collect the cash from the client upfront, but the way it gets accounted is the Tax Identity Shield pretty much is zero in the year it's sold. It's all recognized in the following year for the most part. And the Peace of Mind is spread over really a three-year period with very little in the first year.","So as attach rates have been going up, as the units we've been selling have been going up, there's sort of an embedded accounting gain that will be realized in the next few years after that. So that's just accounting. As I said, we collect the cash.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I'll hop back in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman from Millman Research. Your line is open.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Well, thank you. Sort of following up on some things. RALs were around last year, and so this year, maybe some of the amounts have increased but it's not new, so not sure why it affected you maybe more this year.","So, I assumed that the $1,000 promotion was your answer to RALs and while you talked about people excited, not clear if it had much impact on your numbers. When we look at the numbers, we see that from the beginning of the year, these IRS numbers have shown nice increases each week from the beginning until this latest statistics, I guess today's statistics.","And we've also seen good strength in do-it-yourself. Kind of curious no one's asked, now you started the year up about 5% and now you're down in do-it-yourself when TurboTax was going strong in January as well, so not sure what the change is there.","And then in terms of refunds, started off the year down 11% but in the first week, I think the IRS released its money. And so, basically, it's been kind of flat or maybe refunds down 2% now. So, a lot of, I guess sort of out-of-line type of commentary, but maybe you can give us some more flavor and more detail as to why some of these things seem to be different for you.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Greg, why don't you take that?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think, Mike, if I got it right, you've got four questions there. So we'll try to tackle each one for you, and if we've missed it, just let us know. But the first one, I think just factually I'm going to disagree with your statement on RALs.","So there were RALs in the market last year. There were RALs the year before. These were sort of private, specific to state, quite small in nature. Last tax season, there was really only one provider that had RALs, and they had an okay experience with that. We're very familiar with the details there. This season, you see both the other large branded competitors have them, as well as multiple providers that are also putting it through the independent channel, which, as we all know, is 40% of the revenue part of this market. So the number of distribution points for RALs this year is a lot larger than it was last year. And we're saying it's a factor. We're not saying it's a large factor. We're just saying it's a factor. But just to make sure we get the facts straight on that one.","And then the next one, I think was the $1,000, is that our response. Do you want to do that one, Bill?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I wouldn't say it was a response. It was the approach we took for the early season clients. So I wouldn't say it was in response to the RAL.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","And the next question was really about DIY trends, and we have Jason here. Do you want to talk about that, Jason?","Jason L. Houseworth - President, U.S. Tax Product Strategy and Development","Sure. Thanks for your question, Michael. I think our results really reflect our strategy for the season which is, we want to grow by attracting high-value clients at a rate that's faster than the category. And similar to last year, we started out slow compared to the rest of the digital industry. But I'm really pleased with how we're serving these higher-value clients through our DIY products. We have NPS and our revenue per user that are both up, tax season to date, and from my perspective, there's a lot of season left, and the second half really holds the majority of these types of clients.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","And then lastly was really just about the refund volume and velocity. You're correct in terms of the direction of that. There is, and we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, directional differences within the types of people receiving refunds. It has been a factor that we've been watching carefully this year. Really from our point of view, we're just pointing it out more than anything else, just for education's perspective.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Okay, thank you.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Did that get it, Mike? Okay.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you elaborate on your launch of Block Advisors and how effective that's been in driving mix towards a higher end and more complex demographic?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So we are now open, 286 locations around the country. We're very pleased with the opening. Obviously, first year, you want to make sure operationally you're getting all of that wired together. That's worked very well, our tax pros, the clients have come in. And effectively, two things: one, this is now the season where Block Advisors really starts to kick into gear, the more complex client, the second half client. And clearly there'll be a fairly large extensions group as we look to see clients who are year-round. And this is a long term play for us. So we're not going to break out any specifics around it. It's just, suffice it to say that I'm really pleased with the execution that has happened so far. But for the type of client that we're talking about, it's now starting to rev up for Block Advisors.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. That's helpful. And can you discuss what you're seeing in market share performance in your digital DIY business?","Jason L. Houseworth - President, U.S. Tax Product Strategy and Development","Sure. As I mentioned, George, we feel like we started out a little bit slow. I think that we have seen some shift move to the category leader as they really worked with Absolute Zero and price on the desktop side in order to get that share. I think that there's been more share that's gone to TaxACT and some of the smaller players, and that's really where we're at at about halfway through the season.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. And I guess circling back to the assisted side. How would you assess the risk that some of the volume declines you're seeing this quarter are market share driven rather than simply a timing element?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we've said this in the prepared remarks, but just to be clear, we've seen directionally continued improvement in our market share losses, so it's not a gain at this point, but from three years ago to two years ago, two years ago to last year and this year, so that loss is getting better. So we're okay with that. I wouldn't say that we're pleased because we're still losing.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good afternoon. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the price and the mix improvements. Is there anything that you could share in terms of color of where you're getting with these price increases and then some more color on where the mix improvements are? Thanks.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So one of the nice things about our industry is we have real pricing power. I think you're all intimately familiar with that, but we measured last 2015 (50:45) the assisted side, a 0.1 (50:47). We have worked very hard the last several years to really \u2013 to use pricing strategically, not opportunistically, not tactically. So we went into this tax season with a specific plan, a lot of nuances to it, but it's a way to really make sure that we hone our price\/value messaging to recognize the fact that we have this opportunity. And so, we've executed that quite smoothly and generated some real value. Historically, as you know, we've basically been raising prices double the rate of inflation. We'll give you more guidance on what we did this year at the end of the season.","And then, in terms of the mix, this is a very big issue for us. And we talk about units, units, units. This time of the year, that's the one thing we talk about. I always believe it's very misleading because the units themselves, there's vast differences in the value of those. And so, we recognize that in Block. We know the things that we do to help people. And we've had a really I think good story, where we continue to focus, of course, is the early season client. These are people where speed of refund matters. And you get sort of two types of people typically in the early season, the EZ, the most basic filer. And then, secondarily is the earned income credit filer, and we're more particularly focused on earned income credit. We'll be able to better digest and share the results at the end of the season, where that stands. But in total, so far this year, we're pleased with mix. As we look to the second half, we continue to believe that's a good driver of value for us.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. I appreciate the color. And in terms of industry trends or what you're seeing from your clients, is there anything that you could call out in terms of the difference of your client demographics, or any trends that you're looking at? Thanks.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. Henry, I think it's consistent with past year. I don't think there's been any particular demographic shift at this point.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Thanks for letting me back in. Greg, a quick housekeeping question. should we still be expecting 260 franchises to be bought back this year?","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I got a couple more. Greg with regard to \u2013 just first one will be an update on Sand Canyon and what has occurred this quarter. And it sounds like a partial employment agreement but maybe not complete. Just if you could elaborate to the extent you can. Thanks.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. In my mind, it's a good step-forward for the Sand Canyon team. As we talked about earlier, there was, in my mind, a material reduction in the representation of warranty reserve by about $89 million. So, we end up now with $65 million in the balance sheet for representation of warranty. The same kind of general words we've been using. It represents a small number of counterparties which the Sand Canyon management team are working through.","What you saw this quarter was resolution on a few of those \u2013 I'm not going to be too specific on the number but we're talking \u2013 in total, still just a handful. So it does, at the same time, keep in mind, represent years of effort to get there. Clearly because there's still a balance in that account means there's still some work to get done here but it is a very positive step-forward from our perspective.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Just a couple more. One is open-ended, Tax Plus, if you could please elaborate on the good and the bad. And you've already spoken a little bit to accounting changes there but anything else you feel you should highlight. And then, a quickie throw-on is, Greg, I think the guide for the year from the Investor Day for tax rate is 33% to 34%, a little off from that and this quarter from what we expected. Is that still a good number to use and was that just a timing thing?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I'll take the first one. There's a lot of good on the attached \u2013 we're very excited about the increases we're seeing on the Tax Identity Shield, which is a product that is just spot on for what happens in the industry today. I think we're also pleased with Peace of Mind continues to grow. We'll obviously give more color on this fully when the tax season is over. And regarding refund transfer, continue to be in line with history and consistent with the volume that we're seeing, but overall we think the Tax Plus strategy is working quite well. I'll turn it back to Greg for...","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So this is kind of the \u2013 you have to sort of reverse your logic a little bit. In those quarters, you lose money. You actually want your tax rate to be as high as possible but the guidance we provided at December that you outlined would be what we would continue to reinforce that. So as the year settles up, that would be the right range to think about for tax rate.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Jason, just a question for you on the digital side, I just want make sure I heard you correctly. Were you saying that even though right now unit count is negative, from a revenue standpoint, the revenue would be positive?","Jason L. Houseworth - President, U.S. Tax Product Strategy and Development","Well, just to clarify my comment, Kartik, what I said was that our average revenue per user is up. And so we're pleased with the way the online product is monetizing.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","But the answer to the question is yes.","Jason L. Houseworth - President, U.S. Tax Product Strategy and Development","Yes.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The answer's yes at this point. I think we're trying to be cautious, Kartik, as we go through the end of the season, and obviously like Intuit ourselves, a lot of money is made in the digital space, just like the assisted space as you get into mid-March and go to the finish line. So we're not guiding anybody do anything but that's where we're at.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And I know maybe basis points, that's not that big of a number, but any thoughts, Bill, on the difference between company owned and franchise operations, why the difference? Was there anything you saw within the numbers that you could point to as this is why there is a difference?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not really, Kartik. We look at this \u2013 I don't have a good answer for you other than I think our franchisees do heck of a job, and I think they're doing marginally better than the company side, which is driving the company side crazy because they're sort of competitive with each other. But there's nothing of note with that 70 basis point difference.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","To me, this is an example why I'm always very cautious on units because, as you know, a lot of our franchisees are more rural in nature. Our companies are more city and suburbs. And when you actually neutralize for sort of the mix within that, you find that the performance is actually pretty similar. And the big picture in terms of things that we matter running businesses, the company stores over time have shown their ability to sell the Tax Plus products at a much higher rate, thereby generating more value for the clients and also value for the company. And so that's \u2013 when we said we think we managed the stores a little bit better, that's the main reason that we see differential over time.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And then, Greg, just to make sure I understand it, this is more a housekeeping deal, but diluted share count you're expecting for the year, any difference? I know you bought back $392 million worth of shares, and for you guys, it's a little complicated to count the diluted shares. So, I just want to make sure.","Gregory J. Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","The math on how to calculate the weighted average shares is a bit more complicated than it should be, but that's that way the GAAP works, and I think I know you know that. So, we've given you where the share count was at the end of the third quarter. You can roll forward the math, and using one, two and three quarter actuals, you'll have to take a position because we're not going to give you an idea what the fourth quarter number is going to look like. But mathematically speaking, it's not going to be much different just because of the way it works from a weighted perspective. So I don't know if that's helpful or not, but certainly, that's kind of my answer.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Appreciate it.","William C.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. Colby Brown, you may begin your conference.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Joanna. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2014 results. Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Jason Houseworth, President, Global Digital and Product Management, will be available during the Q&A session.","In connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconcile the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures and the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.","Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Cobb","Thanks, Colby, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced our financial results for fiscal year 2014. I am very pleased with our results this year. We entered this season with a strong plan to achieve our Tax Plus objectives and we executed very well.","In fiscal 2014, we enhanced our service levels while improving return mix and increased attached rates on our best-in-class financial services products. We successfully launched the first year of our digital product redesign enhancing the client experience.","We continue to educate our clients on the upcoming changes resulting from Healthcare Reform and gained some key learnings from our healthcare initiatives that will serve us well going into 2015 and beyond. And most importantly, we served our clients better than ever.","The result of these efforts was that we grew revenue, expanded margins and improved our customer satisfaction, while also continuing to invest in our business. I will provide a greater level detail on our performance for the year, but before doing so, I would like to provide some overall context on the tax season.","As many of you know, there was a lot of noise in the market this year due to the delayed opening of e-file, our decision to eliminate the free federal 1040EZ promotion and aggressive pricing actions from our digital competitors.","Total IRS filings return to historical norms and exceeded our expectations, with returns up 1.4% from last year. The assisted category as a whole was essentially flat, while total digital returns increased nearly 6%.","There are few reasons for the difference in growth rates between the assisted and digital categories. First, we believe that our decision to discontinue the free 1040EZ promotion in virtually all markets, contributed to the growth in digital returns this year as low loyalty filers motivated solely by priced move to DIY methods where they could file for fee.","Second, the digital category continues to benefit from the migration of pen and paper filers though at a slower pace than in prior years.","And third, based on our experience this year and consistent with industry results for the past several years, we continue to believe there is an increase mix of digital returns filed with the earned income credit or EIC due to the inconsistent fraud prevention standards in filing returns containing this credit.","As a reminder, the EIC is one of the largest government social programs in the country and the IRS estimated that approximately $13 billion to $15 billion of improper payments were made to the EIC in 2013. This is obviously a significant issue for the U.S. Treasury Department and for the country.","In fact, under federal law very government agency is require to disclose their highest risk financial transactions and the EIC is the only risk noted on the consistent basis by the IRS.","Several years ago, the IRS took actions to address this concern that were not comprehensive, creating standards only for returns prepared by a paid tax professional. Thus current standards for filing a return with the EIC are different for assisted returns and DIY returns which have resulted in a shift from assisted to DIY over the past five years.","Importantly, the assisted category would have gain share during that time had there not been a shift in EIC filers. We have taken an industry leadership position against tax fraud and continue to advocate for consistent standards in both assisted and DIY tax returns in all respect and in particular, those that contain the EIC.","Until such parity standards are in placed, we believe the improper payment issue will persist and the industry will continue to see a shift in returns containing these credits from assisted to DIY.","With that overview on the industry, let\u2019s turn our performance for the year. We executed very well against our multi-year Tax Plus strategy in 2014. You recall from our conference call in March and our Investor Day in December that we are squarely focused on this strategy, which is centered on delivering value for our clients and driving higher revenues and profits through a balance of improve return mix and increased product attachments. Put simply, we served our clients better than ever and in the process drove profitable growth.","In retail we discontinued our free 1040EZ promotion in virtually all markets, which as anticipated contributed to a significant increase in revenues despite lower revenue counts -- lower return counts.","We also made changes to our pricing this year to be more strategic in how and when we provide discounts and what we charge for filing extensions. Despite these price increases, retention of non-EZ filers was essentially flat for the year continuing to outpace our branded retail competitors.","Another important element of our strategy was to improve how we serve our clients by making investments in our retail locations, technology and in our people. Specifically, we are nearing completion in our initiatives to update our offices and upgrade our retail tax preparation software.","These investments have enabled our tax professionals to serve our clients better which resulted in improve service metrics across the Board, with walkout and wait times down and satisfaction up.","In fact, our Net Promoter Score increased 2 points this year. These initiatives will require continued investments which we are committed to making in order to improve our value proposition.","From a marketing perspective, I\u2019m very pleased with our campaign this year which served as a reminder that taxes are complex and Americans leave over a billion dollars of refunds on table each year by not seeking professional assistance. Our simple message of Get Your Billion Back America resonated very well and it showed in our results.","In digital, we enhanced the user experience by customizing the product to each client in making it simpler to use. By better anticipating the needs of our clients and tailoring the user experience, we saw improved conversion and a substantial increase in product upgrades.","I\u2019m pleased that the multi-year effort that Jason Houseworth and his team have undertaken to redesign the online client experience has been successful. We will continue to invest in our digital products to customize and simplify our offerings which will result in better attention, conversion and monetization.","On the Tax Plus side, our strategy is working and I\u2019m very pleased that we increased the overall proportion of clients who use our financial products. We made specific changes to how we position our Peace of Mind warranty like product. We\u2019re successful at increasing the take rate on our refund transfer product and effectively manage the Emerald Advance program to drive increased profit this year.","We also continue to see improved usage metrics in our Emerald Prepaid Mastercard with reloader rates and average deposits higher in 2014. The net results of these efforts was an increase in revenues from our Tax Plus Financial Services products of 11% this year.","On the international front, we had solid seasons in Canada and Australia despite significant industry and macro challenges, including the extension of the Canadian tax season into May, considerable changes in the Australian tax law and the stronger U.S. dollar. Our teams did an outstanding job of working through these challenges, serving more clients overall and increasing revenues more than 5% on a local currency basis.","And finally, we made progress this year in our healthcare initiatives. We demonstrated our expertise by providing tax and healthcare review for our clients on the upcoming changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act. This effort to educate our clients over the past two seasons has positioned us as the trusted experts that our clients can rely on when navigating the intersection between taxes and healthcare.","We also successfully launched our partnership with GoHealth to provide health insured enrollment services to online and assisted platforms. Due to these efforts, we continue to learn about the needs of our clients and how we can better serve them in this area during the upcoming season and beyond.","Our goals this year were to continue positioning H&R Block as the expert in healthcare and taxes and to lay a foundation upon which we could build in future years. And we succeeded in these goals.","It\u2019s important to note that although the ACA begins to impact the tax event next year, it will take time for the healthcare and tax preparation industry to fully adapt to these changes and for the ultimate opportunity to unfold. Though 8 million people enrolled for these changes in 2014, the CVO has estimated that full adoption will occur over the next several years as individuals make decisions based on their perceived need for healthcare coverage, the overall cost and potential tax penalties associated with non-compliance.","That said, we know some of our clients will be significantly impacted by the Affordable Care Act and we believe they will naturally turn to their tax professional as a trusted source for help. We're working closely with the IRS and have our organization focus on integrating ACA related changes into our work streams in order to successfully serve our clients next season. We look forward to sharing with you our thoughts and plans regarding the ACA as the potential impact from this long-term opportunity becomes clear.","In conclusion, we made considerable progress in 2014 toward our long-term objectives and are well positioned for 2015 and beyond as we remain committed to our Tax Plus strategy. We anticipated that our strategy which focuses our resources on generating profitable growth would result in declines in unprofitable return count and unit market share this year.","The net result however is that we achieved exactly what we set out to do, deliver higher revenue and earnings by improving return mix, enhancing client service and increasing the rate at which clients take our best-in-class financial services products. Additionally, we made progress in our healthcare initiative this year, educating our clients, improving our value proposition and positioning H&R Block as the leader in taxes and healthcare. I'm excited about the future of H&R Block and look forward to a successful 2015.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss further details of our fiscal 2014 financial results.","Greg Macfarlane","Thanks Bill and good morning everybody. From financial perspective, we executed well, growing revenues and operating more productively which drove improved margins, earnings and cash flows for the year. Total revenue increased $118 million or 4% to over $3 billion and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5% to $1.67.","On a GAAP basis, our net income from continuing operations was up 7.5% to $500 million and our earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7.1% to a $1.81. EBITDA margins expanded one point to 31% with EBITDA increasing $66 million to $940 million.","On a quick side note, we report certain non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA which we find relevant in measuring our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures we use are based on well defined, consistent and published standards which you could find in our earnings release.","In our tax services segment, revenues increased to $121 million or over 4% to nearly $3 billion due to improved mix and changes to our pricing strategy in our assisted channel, increased Tax Plus Financial product revenues and product enhancement and improved monetization in our digital tax software.","The largest impact on total revenues came from an increase in U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties which grew 4% to $2.1 billion despite the overall decline in returns prepared. This increase is due to general price increases in an overall improvement in the mix of non-EZ client. Additionally, the decision to discontinue our free federal 1040 EZ promotion in virtually all markets and other changes in our pricing strategy related to discounts and tax return extension contributed to the increase.","Let me take a few moments to offer more details on each. Overall we had a general price increase of approximately 3% as well as an overall improvement in the mix of other non-EZ returns prepared. Next as many of you know, the decision to discontinue the free federal 1040 EZ promotion in virtually all markets impacted return count particularly related to less complicated return filed in the first half of the season.","Before coming into the season, we thoroughly analyzed the results of our free 1040 EZ promotions in prior years. I\u2019d like to provide some additional insight behind our thought process and our decision to discontinue the promotion.","First, we know our free EZ clients quite well and recognize that they have historically been more price sensitive and less loyal than other clients. Second, because these returns were prepared for free, this was volume in which we made little or no profit in prior years. Third, our analysis shows the majority of these clients were not likely to be eligible for an advanced tax credit in future years under the Affordable Care Act. As such, we did not believe the decision regarding the 1040 EZ promotion would have a significant impact on our efforts regarding health care reform opportunity.","Finally, by offering our service for free during one of the two busiest times of the year, we were essentially stressing our system, increasing wait times that may have deterred paying clients from completing their returns with us. The end result was that there were -- we were giving our service away for free to clients who were not loyal and who provided limited lifetime value to the detriment of our paying client.","Considering the support, expertise in Tax Plus financial services products provided for our clients, our 1040EZ offering is truly the best in the industry. So this year, we decided to charge tax preparation fees for 1040EZ returns at a fair price that is competitive within the industry. This decision also freed capacity in our tax offices allowing us to better serve our clients leading to improved Net Promoter Scores for the season. From a revenue standpoint, the decision to eliminate the 1040EZ promotion resulted in a one-time increase of over $30 million in 2014, despite the decline in return.","The final driver of increased tax preparation and royalty revenue came from targeted one-time changes to our pricing strategy for a limited number of clients who were receiving significant discounts that were not service break driven. Thus, discounts have served as a drag in our topline performance in prior years. We also began charging for extensions and for those clients who found extensions through us and then come back to file their tax return, this charge will be netted against their total tax preparation fees. Collectively, these and related decisions increased revenues by approximately $50 million this year.","Turning to Tax Plus, as Bill mentioned earlier, our strategy is working. Revenues related to Tax Plus financial products increased $44 million or 11% to $432 million, primarily due to pricing changes in the company\u2019s refund transfer offering, increased revenues in our Peace of Mind warranty like products, and increased usage and average deposits per card on our award winning Emerald Card product. Overall, a greater proportion of our clients are taking at least one financial product during the tax event and those taking two or more products increased as well.","With respect to our Emerald Card, while volumes were impacted by our decision to discontinue the free federal 1040EZ promotion, I am pleased that we were able to make significant progress in card usage. Average revenue per card increased 13% to $44, driven by double-digit increases in both reloader rates and deposits per card. Looking ahead, the Emerald Card continues to represent opportunity for us and they will continue our focus on driving more cards and more usage.","Turning to expenses; total tax segment expenses increased at a lower rate than revenues, up 2.9% to $2.1 billion. This increase was driven primarily by increased compensation and benefits, including variable wages resulting from higher tax prep fees, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and investment in growth initiatives such as the healthcare opportunity arriving from the Affordable Care Act. Importantly, we were able to offset this expense increases in other areas and I am pleased that we were able to drive margin expansion while continuing to make investments in the business.","In our corporate segment, our pretax loss improved by $20 million or 17% to $99 million. This improvement is primarily due to a nonrecurring gain from the sale of residual interest in mortgage loan securitizations that were owned by Sand Canyon Corporation. Corporate expenses declined by $7.6 million primarily due to lower interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 34.8% due to discrete tax adjustments related to tax settlements and adjustment of reserves taken on uncertain tax positions in prior years. Although we have now had two consecutive years of significant discrete benefits, we don\u2019t anticipate such benefit next year. Thus, our overall effective tax rate will likely increase but will be lower than pre-fiscal 2013 rates.","Looking at our overall financial position, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong. As of April 30th, total unrestricted cash was $2.2 billion and total outstanding debt was $906 million. Cash flows from operations continued to increase as we\u2019ve continued to focus on smart profitable business and operational efficiencies.","As mentioned on our call in April to discuss the exit of the bank, we expect to have considerable amount of excess capital on our balance sheet following the closing of the bank transaction, and it is the current sense of the Board and management to use this capital and also incur some incremental net debt to return capital to shareholders, such as through share repurchases following consummation of the transaction. In connection with incurring incremental net debt, there was also a current sense that there was value in maintaining investment grade metrics.","The excess capital is the result of several different actions. First, we have generated significant free cash flow net of dividend in each of the past two tax seasons. Second, as previously disclosed, upon the completion of the bank transaction, we will unlock capital that has been held at the bank, a portion of which will be immediately available. Third, there are still unused proceeds from the divestiture of RSM McGladrey. Finally, we have been efficiently managing our balance sheet over the past 24 months and through effective tax planning and other changes in our working capital needs, we freed additional capital. In total, we expect to have between $850 million and $1 billion of excess capital on the balance sheet once the bank transaction closes.","Regarding the bank transaction itself, all required applications have been submitted to each parties respective regulators. As part of its review, the regulator presents the transaction for public comment. The public comment period is now closed and no comments were submitted. This is an important milestone in the process and while we don\u2019t have additional updates to provide on the bank transaction or our specific capital structure plans, we continue to expect that the bank transaction will close in time for the next tax season. As always, we will provide update as appropriate.","Another important component of our capital allocation strategy I would like to discuss is the capital we invest back into the business. During the year, capital expenditures totaled $147 million or 5% of total revenues. This exceeded our previous guidance of 4% due to additional investments in apps upgrades and information systems which we felt were necessary due to under investment in these areas in prior years. As I mentioned earlier, we believe further investments back into the business are appropriate to enable us to execute on our Tax Plus strategy in the medium and long term. Thus, we expect capital expenditures in fiscal year 2015 to be between 4% to 5% of revenues, with the return to normal levels of around 3% to 4% of revenues thereafter.","Moving to discontinued operations, which include results of Sand Canyon, our net loss of $25 million was $6 million lower than the prior year. Sand Canyon continues to engage in settlement discussions with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its certain plans. Based on continued settlement discussions with these counterparties during the fourth quarter, Sand Canyon reported a provision of $25 million for potential losses related to its representation of warranty obligation bringing the total accrual at April 30th to $184 million.","As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operate as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments.","In conclusion from a financial perspective, we delivered an exceptional year of revenue growth and margin expansion and I am pleased that we continue to find ways to operate more efficiently and productively. We have an exciting few years ahead of us with substantial challenges taxpayers will face in dealing with an increasingly complex tax codes. We are confident in our ability to help our clients navigate through these changes and we will continue to make the appropriate investment to continue executing on our multiyear Tax Plus strategy.","I know we\u2019ve covered a lot in today\u2019s call. So with that, we are now ready for questions. Operator please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Gil Luria. Your line is open.","Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. You gave us a lot of great commentary about the market this year and what helped you drive the revenue increases. As you look to next year, you already gave us the hand that you think that as long as BIC is not handled at the digital level, there should be still some shift in volumes there. But in terms of the pricing actions that you took this year, is that -- did you come away from the season feeling that you\u2019ve now exercised that muscle or do you feel that you could go into next year and make some more moves like that and refine your pricing in some other places to get a similar kind of benefit?","Bill Cobb","The goal here is what I would say, first of all I\u2019m not going to talk about next year. We\u2019re still digesting this year running all our analytics and next year will be next year. We continue to work rigorously on the EIC issue and trying to get parity between the documentation requirements between the assisted and DIY. So again, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have much of the comment on any of those points except say that we have a lot of months between now and the next tax season. And we certainly have updates for you as we get toward Investor Day in December.","Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities","Fair enough. And then the excess capital of $850 million to $1 billion, does that include the ability to add leverage or is that just a calculation you went through of where you would be after a bank sale without taking on additional debt?","Greg Macfarlane","The $850 million to $1 billion number that we talked about earlier is just excess capital and is independent of any potential additional leverage that we may want to get into.","Gil Luria - Wedbush Securities","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Thomas Allen. Your line is open.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Hey good morning guys. Some housekeeping things, how many rack did you do this year? And then how -- why was Peace of Mind revenue up so much? And then if you could just talk a little bit about Emerald Advanced, revenue was down but bad debt was down, kind of -- what you do in terms of strategy there? Thanks.","Bill Cobb","I\u2019ll let Greg run through the numbers but we had a very considered strategy around as we talk about December on what we call Tax Plus. It was stamped on the head of every field leader, every office leader. Jason and his team in digital did a terrific job on that. And so Tax Plus really became a real operating approach for us throughout the company. So that\u2019s why you see the numbers that we talked about that contributed to the Peace of Mind.","With regard to Emerald Advanced, I think we just managed the overall process well in terms of our underwriting, our collections et cetera. So we\u2019re pleased with the effort there. And we think, we had a very controlled approach and had a successful season. Greg and Jason, anything you want to add?","Greg Macfarlane","Yeah. So this is specific question you asked Thomas but we did $5.5 million refund transfers this past season. And then I agree very much with what Bill said, Peace of Mind is a great product. This product has not received lot of attention here a lot for many years. And under our Tax Plus strategy, we did pay some attention to it and you got to see the kind of result perhaps from that, which I think is really good news.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","And then on the marketing front, you guys obviously had a very planned marketing campaign this year. I have no assumptions that you had used, spend less this year than you had last year? Do you think, this is sustainable or really that kind of one-time things going on there? Thanks.","Bill Cobb","I mean obviously when you have the kind of campaign we had, the awareness we generated in a very short amount of time and the consideration that everyone recognize that this is a H&R Block. And you got a lot of bank credit above there. Again, not going to comment on marketing strategy going forward or level of spending but I think we\u2019re pleased with the way the campaign was received, the way we bought our media, we bought it very efficiently. And overall I think it was a win all around.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Again, I\u2019m trying to squeeze two more quick ones in here. Just on the bank sale, once you do sell the bank, how do you plan to telegraph your capital return plan? Do you expected to just start executing on buyback, I know you have $858 million on your authorization or do you think you\u2019ll lay out a plan? And then second question is you announced in April a strategic alliance was Xero, can you just try and give us some more color on that? I don\u2019t think you guys have really talked about that. Thanks.","Bill Cobb","I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to use a telegraph Thomas but I will let Greg take those two questions.","Greg Macfarlane","Yeah. So I\u2019ll start with the bank first. I mean, its not real much new news here. I mean, I think it was good that the public commentary came and went. Really everything sits with the regulator right now and the regulators are plural should say. And they have a process, they follow. There is good communication going back and forth between them and us and DIY. But as I said in the prepared comment, we continue to believe that the best estimate is to have in this place for next tax season.","Ideally we\u2019d like to get it done as soon as possible but there is a process and time when it\u2019s going to have to workout here. There\u2019s always risk though when you\u2019re working with regulators. Their timelines are different. Their decisions may not we want but we still that\u2019s what we\u2019ve kind of our best estimate is. As things develop at the point which material things come up we would share those with you as we have that\u2019s our normal practice.","On the Xero comment or the Xero question, so Xero, if -- those who are on the phone who are not familiar with Xero -- Xero, you go to their website at xero.com, it\u2019s a great company and we have at Block have been in the business, services, small business, accounting business for a long time.","And it\u2019s not an area that received a lot of attention, it\u2019s not really that big and we have been thinking about what is kind of the next way to reinvigorate that and we began thinking about the software and the service offering that we provide to our clients and we found Xero and they really have developed, what they would describe a beautiful software and it would be software that we would use as part of our value proposition to our clients and new client. So it\u2019s a new venture. I would say that we are hopeful but it\u2019s going to take time to build into that, so I wouldn\u2019t get too excited by it in the short-term.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Okay. As I just elaborate on the first question. Once you -- the bank sale is done, how are you going to communicate to the street kind of your capital return plans?","Greg Macfarlane","Yeah. So, we haven\u2019t -- I mean, these are question that are always contingent on getting the approval from the regulator. So job wanted to get approval with the regulator. We\u2019re not sitting idly here at Block for that happen, but these are things that have to go between our Board of Directors and we have to think about it. But might kind of answer ultimately its going to be at the appropriate time we\u2019ll share those decisions and timelines with you.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kartik Mehta. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hey. Good morning, Bill and Greg. Greg, I think in your prepared remarks you said price increase of 3%. I\u2019m wondering is that 3% excluding the 1040EZ or is that 3% include the 1040EZ pricing change you had this year?","Greg Macfarlane","It\u2019s excluding Kartik.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","So excluding the 1040EZ do you have all other forms at 3% price increase and that does not include anything you would do on the rack side or any of the other Tax Plus products, correct?","Greg Macfarlane","Yeah. The 3% that we communicated would be really, think it as a base form increase, not anything with the products, the additional Tax Plus margin.","Bill Cobb","I think, Kartik, just to put a little bit more context on that. I think what Greg was trying to do in his scripts was really give you context for some of the operating decisions we took around freak and fore, we didn\u2019t raise prices 12% or in that neighborhood or 10%. We wanted to give you some color around the dimension of that, so that\u2019s why. But if you just wanted to \u201clook at what might be called general pricing that\u2019s what the 3% refers to.\u201d","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And Bill, what were your digital strategy next year be, if into it goes along with their half price date, like this year, I know you tested that a little bit? Would the strategy change it all, is your thought that you are going to continue on the same path that you did this year?","Bill Cobb","So, Jason, why don\u2019t we reveal our strategy for 2015 here on digital, and Kartik, you know we\u2019re not going to do that. But why don\u2019t I let Jason kind of give his perspective, which is I think always helpful. We\u2019re not going to get into next year, but I want him to talk a little bit about how we\u2019re viewing things.","Jason Houseworth","Thanks for your question, Kartik. This is Jason. So I\u2019ll remind you just how we started this season, which was a near one of the two-year redesign, which was a ground-up redesign focused on creating a Mobile First and personalized product experience and within this our focus was to figure how can we continue to improve conversion, improve retention and monetization our average revenue per user through an enhance value perception and customization that the redesign creates.","So, for this tax season, we really had a plan to begin to realize part of the benefits of this redesign and we executed this plan. We continue to improve our conversion and more importantly, as Bill noted, we saw substantial improvement in online monetization and that was specifically from gains in free-to-basic or free-to-paid upgrades delivering double-digit revenue growth for the digital business.","As far as pricing, we are always testing in order to figure out the right way to monetize and the right way to create an experience is going to improve our overall product and we can continue to do that and that will be factored into our product strategy as it always does.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","So, Bill, maybe, a question might be a little bit more bigger answer to or better answer to would be the Phoenix project, I know, you tested some stores in Phoenix with GoHealth. I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about how those went and maybe what you learned and if you be able to be expand on that?","Bill Cobb","Yeah. I\u2019ll let Jason way in, Mark Ciaramitaro, who many of you met at Investor Day runs our Healthcare business reporting to Jason, so Jason is very intimately involve with the Healthcare business also. So that\u2019s our enrollment service. We run three pilots last year. Phoenix was one of them kind of the in-store piece.","Again, not ready to comment on how we go forward. But suffice to say that, I think, we learned a lot. We certainly enroll thousands of people and I think our service, our user experience we got high marks from, in terms of this being a guided experience versus just going to the exchange.","There is a lot of things we\u2019re still unfolding in real time. So it was a little bit of a season lumpy really based on more external than ourselves. But we are very pleased with how our teams executed against that. I don\u2019t know if there is anything you want to add to that Jason.","Jason Houseworth","I think, what I would add, Bill, talked about trying to figure out. How we do we add a valuable service to our clients. But, specifically, we are trying to figure out what\u2019s the model that best fits into our overall business and we look at. We are really testing a number of factors like relevancy, various operational aspects and either our marketing approach and we feel like that we gain insights that we can really apply to our offerings in this tax season and we will discuss this in more detail in December, our Investor Day.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.","Bill Cobb","Thanks, Kartik.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thank you. Bill, you touched on pricing on the 3% figure? Could you give us some color as to, is that a normalized pricing number we should think about on a go forward basis. I know you mentioned you are going to be strategic about pricing? Just curious how we should think about that number on the go forward basis and is the portfolio pruning over or do you have more pruning to do as you look forward?","Bill Cobb","Sure. Let me take that, Greg, and if you want to add anything. In terms of, I think, we've indicated on, Greg, does a great job with our investment thesis, that generally we believe pricing actions into 2% to 3% range would be consistent with what investors could expect. So I think we are within that -- we are in the higher end of the range. This past year we have been on the lower end.","I still think that, Greg, I think you agree with that, probably, whole as a go forward and obviously, we will talk about that more. But I think that\u2019s consistent with what we have said going forward.","As far as additional pruning, I assume, you are talking from a corporate perspective. We are -- obviously, we have the bank deal which we have talked about and you are all very familiar with. But, no, I think, we have, the company we want to have. We have the strategy we want to have with Tax Plus. So this is our go forward.","We have got all of our field leaders in this week. We've been meeting with them. We are again way ahead of where we were last year in terms of planning. So Tax Plus, as I said earlier, stamped on everyone forehead and you know that\u2019s how we are going forward.","Greg Macfarlane","Let me just comment on, it was the pruning question that I wanted to kind of spoke a couple comment on. So, Bill, said, the main points, which is we in our industry enjoy low price elasticity, that\u2019s not changing. We know a lot of about that.","What we are trying to do is evolve pricing from, I think, what it\u2019s been historically at Block and at least in the last several years as a tactical weapon and make it more of strategic opportunity for us.","And so the things that we change this year were more about getting a system aligns to what we are trying to do more at a micro level and so those would be outputs which is in this case we are very positive in terms of revenue were good outcomes from that, but that wasn\u2019t the goal necessarily of the things, the changes that we made.","So we are going to continue to think strategically about pricing, knowing fundamentally that there is price elasticity in this business, but also fundamentally that we are going to be here another 60 years and we have to think about the client, what\u2019s the right thing for the client over their lifetime.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Right. And Greg, just a question on your investment grade comment, that there is value in investment grade? Could you maybe walk us through the rationale of how there is value for your business within investment grade? And you also said, we are not going to sit ideal for the bank sale, the close, we are going to continue to do work? Any conversations you\u2019ve had with the rating agencies and maybe talk about, how they're going to look at your business differently? Investment grade can mean a lot of different things in different businesses? So any color around those comments would be very helpful?","Greg Macfarlane","Yeah. Okay. So we do talk to the rating agencies on a regular basis. We've got good relationships established with Standard & Poor's and Moody's as you can expect and appreciate getting our 2014 financial results finalize is an important part of the discussion as we shape what\u2019s likely to be a busy 12 months ahead of us if our timelines hold up as it relates to the regulatory process and so on.","But that\u2019s really the extent of the conversations because really until we are kind of past the regulatory approval process and getting a closing process finalize it would be premature for us, I think to get too specific with the rating agencies.","In terms of the justification behind investment grade, what we\u2019ve said before, I am just going to say again is, we at Block over last several years in conjunction with the Board and a lot of external help have looked at all the consideration that most companies would look at and then the unique aspects of Block around seasonality in our history and the conclusion was that investment grade is the right place for us, but we haven't really gone much further than saying exactly what that means at this point in time, but as things develop we will update you at the appropriate time.","Bill Cobb","Hamzah, let me, add a little perspective on this and this is more if you will from my chair. Because, I think, there is a lot of talk around investment grade and I want to make sure everyone understands, what we are saying. We have been very clear that upon the completion of the bank progress.","We are looking at returning capital to shareholders as we have done, I am only going to talk about the time I have been here, we have done previously, when we raise the dividend 33% and bought back 12% of the shares.","So we want to have a return of capital. We indicated today that our excess capital expectations are approaching a $1 billion and as Greg mentioned earlier, we will take on incremental net debt beyond where we are today as part of that return process. What I tried to do is be very deliberate thoughtful, et cetera, an investment grade is obviously a decision any company faces. Our liquidity needs are real.","So I think shareholders are going to be very pleased as we go through this process, that the combination of incremental net debt plus excess -- the excess capital return will be very shareholder friendly or whatever term you want to use. And that, I think, that we can balance everything and I think it\u2019s very consistent with the approach I have tried to take with the company. And obviously we\u2019re going to be -- as Greg indicated earlier, we\u2019re planning on being here for 60 years or so. So we\u2019re going to manage this company with both an eye toward an event like that but also with an eye towards the long term.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate the color. Just one last question, I\u2019ll turn it over. The push out of the tax season in Canada or the extension, any idea how much revenue that has pushed out. I know Canada is not massive for you but any quantification of that? Thank you.","Greg Macfarlane","Glad you asked that because it was actually an interesting little wrinkle to this year but with the heart bleed security weakness that everyone is probably familiar with, the Canadian taxing authority, the CRA said essentially that we\u2019re going to shut down if that e-files would turn out to be five full days. And the message that was delivered to the tax payer in Canada was really received as were, kind of, there is no need to files your taxes until we tell you too.","And as a result of that decision, the CRA, the Canadian Revenue Authority extended the tax season for all intents and purposes extra five days. So it went from April 30th normally to May 5th. So we\u2019re actually calling it April 35th this year. And so that resulted in us having to keep our stores open longer five extra days, staffing them. We actually spend additional marketing money behind that. There were a lot of operational things that frankly the Canadian team really did a great job with. In terms of specifically quantifying that, we\u2019re not going to get to that level of the detail with you. It\u2019s not material and we don\u2019t dispose that level of detail.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Hi. Thanks. Good morning to everyone. Few questions, Bill, I\u2019d like to start off. This is a re-ask of off something we\u2019ve heard already but just your level of conviction on growing revenue going forward. Was that one-year strategy you\u2019ve touched on, what you think is an appropriate rate increase as we go forward. I think everyone is just kind of wondering, might be we see something where you go back and grab market share. So just trying to gauge the conviction on the multi-year strategy around that? Thanks.","Bill Cobb","Yeah. I mean, the answer I\u2019ll give you, we\u2019re not going to get into specifics but let me just try to answer your question specifically or from a strategic point of view. We ultimately want to grow revenue and that does include -- there are various ways you can grow revenue and its price and mix and unit volume et cetera and we will look at all of those leverage as we look to go forward.","But the emphasis on that we indicated this year that I talked about with our field leaders this year continues to be Tax Plus revenue growth. So that will be the focus as we go forward. And that is the emphasis we think we have best-in-class financial services products. So we\u2019re attaching those products to our clients, servicing them, providing those at value. It is an important part of our story. So I don\u2019t know if that specifically answers your question but yes we will be very focused on that again as we go forward.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. And then, one of you mentioned earlier in the presentation that the folks that were 1040 EZ that you changed pricing on this year are not really core ACA target. And I was just hoping if you could elaborate a little bit on that? And then second part of the question would be any discussion on what you\u2019re seeing in form creation for ACA that could -- any early insights into next year? So two-parter, thanks.","Bill Cobb","So let me take the first part and then Jason, do you want to talk about the form, situations with the forms. I think again we\u2019re learning about this. We still don\u2019t have a lot of data other than the 8 million enrollees number. We don't know how many people are staying in, paying et cetera. So there is still a lot that needs to happen there. Specifically the 1040 EZ, a number of very low-income people actually would not be subsidy eligible because they are medicated eligible and that puts them into in effect of different category.","So why you would think right away everybody would subsidy eligible, it gets a little tricky especially when it comes to the Medicaid aspect and then there were different states who handled Medicaid in different ways. So that's why it\u2019s not a simple 1040 EZ equals Affordable Care Act enrollees. It actually gets cut down pretty significantly from that.","So again the whole healthcare discussion, you heard us say this numerous times, I think we are well positioned. I think we understand this better than anybody but this opportunity is going to enfold over the next several years. Now specific to the forms, Jason, do you want to talk about broadly what\u2019s going on there?","Jason Houseworth","Sure. Thanks for your question, Scott. So the IRS hasn\u2019t released the final forms or instructions related to ACA. We do hope to get these details later this summer. What the IRS has shared with us and the industry is that first there will be a new reconciliation form, Form 8962 in order to reconcile the advanced tax credit. We also know that there will be a 1095 series of notices to taxpayers with the 1095 A from the healthcare marketplace, which is required to do a reconciliation and then 1095 B and C which are voluntary from employers and insurance companies, which means the client who may not receive a 1095 B or C will actually have to self attest for insurance coverage for their household.","And then finally, there will likely be a combined penalty and exemption worksheet. We think this will be 8965 that will be required to be e-filed with the return for people that have to calculate their penalty or qualify for an exemption. And we know many of the exemption reasons today but there will likely be more in the final instructions when the IRS provides the final version of this worksheet.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Appreciate that. A few more, if I may. On -- you guys outperformed your EBITDA margin versus last year. Your goal was to come in about the same. So congratulations on that, just curious your long term 32% is at the high end of the range and you\u2019re obviously trending well. Greg, an update if any on how you're feeling about that long term and in what shape or form would it come -- coming on expense management or more leveraging the top line? Thanks.","Greg Macfarlane","So we\u2019re likely to talk about this obviously and December has been kind of more of what we\u2019ve been doing last few years. But I think just the broad thought I would share with you is our objective is not to maximize margin percentage but is to maximize obviously revenue growth and then net income dollars at the end of it at acceptable levels of margin percentage. And so we\u2019ll continue to think about that.","But as also I shared, we shared with you and you can see in our numbers, we decided to increase the investment this year into the business. We did that last year too. Those were actually higher than we originally thought, which is actually a good thing because the investments we're making, I think, were smart for the medium and long-term but that can have a natural pressure going to next year. We\u2019re going to have the bank transaction ideally done, that\u2019s going to have impact on margin next year.","So we have to digest that plus other things. But in terms of our range, this point we\u2019ve guided historically 27% to 32%. We were 30% last year. We were above that this year. That\u2019s a good thing but we\u2019ve not -- we're not at this point prepared to change that range.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Okay. Thanks. Then two more, they are separate questions but just to sneak them in, one, love to hear about the Sand Canyon approval increase and how you\u2019re going on tolling agreement that sounds like an interesting update? And then last one, hopefully, you\u2019ll touch on a little bit but the comments on incremental net debt going forward, we\u2019d love to hear initial thought on shape or form of that net debt? Thank you.","Bill Cobb","I\u2019ll give those both over to Greg.","Greg Macfarlane","So Sand Canyon continues to be in discussion with the majority of its counterparties that have made rep and warranty claims. They operate those specifically with tolling arrangements which are certainly agreement to say let\u2019s put the clock, the statute of limitations on hold while we have productive conversation. And those conversations continue to develop and that\u2019s why the tolling arrangements continue to in place. And so I\u2019ve always viewed that as a good thing. The fact that the reserve was adjusted upward, I don\u2019t believe it was a huge number. It is an indication that there's progress being made in my view. So I thought it\u2019s a good step forward because I think while at least I can speak for management, the objective here is to help -- to really Sand Canyon to wind down its affairs in an orderly way and that\u2019s by the way going to -- will still take years at this point, but the fact they are able to continue to make forward progress is a good thing.","The second question is really on the incremental net debt, at this point we are not going to talk very specifically about that. We\u2019ve indicated that we\u2019re prepared to take incremental net debt. It will be involved the point at which the bank transaction is closed and then the point at which we have more information we will share that with you.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Okay, great. Thanks for taking on my questions.","Operator","The final question comes from Michael Millman. Your line is open.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Thank you. Maybe you can discuss some of the differences in terms of monetization or lack of monetization between the EZs and the free online and semifree online products that the industry has been using?","Bill Cobb","Yes. So the EZ client, we are talking very specifically Mike about the people that come to our stores that were under the promotion for free EZ. We have ran a program for three years and so we\u2019re able to track at a client level our experience with them and we\u2019ve modeled out their propensity to take additional products and ages and how long we think they will be in the system, retention rates, etcetera, etcetera. Some people we had spillover. They thought they were free EZ, they weren\u2019t. So we modeled all that out and we calculated lifetime values and we just found that the program was useful for point in time, but it was really declining pretty quickly.","I think we provided broader kind of thoughts on that specifically related to these were people coming in the first peak when the stores were quite busy and we just felt for a lot of reason, this was the right decision and it was very much the right decision. Now you compare that to what Jason does within the digital channel, it\u2019s just a different business model because the variable costs involved there are negligible. There is no service issues because they are doing it themselves, and that\u2019s something that Jason will take at length about AB testing and we\u2019ve just learned a lot over the years as our competitors have that these are offers that are compelling for people and it\u2019s something that\u2019s an important part of how we build our presence in the DIY space.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I see. And let me relate to that I suppose, could you talk about what your assisted and online retention rates were last year, how they changed, increased from previous year?","Bill Cobb","Do you want to talk about the DIY?","Greg Macfarlane","About DIY. So DIY was relatively flat. Overall, it\u2019s about 64%, software is substantially higher and online is a little bit lower.","Jason Houseworth","Yes. When it comes to retail, there was a slight decline driven almost entirely by free EZ discontinuation. But as I said with our customer SAT scores and our NPS which is frankly two of the biggest measures, we are looking at right now. And all the operating metrics Greg talked about earlier with walkouts down and wait times reduced, I am very pleased with how we -- our client service overall I think was outstanding.","Bill Cobb","We are very satisfied with the retention rates this season.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","When you look forward, you see that there is profitable growth online for (indiscernible) at this point, both that you received from paper and pencil has disappeared?","Bill Cobb","Yes, I mean, I think and Jason if you want to comment. I think we pride ourselves on a simple principal which is we want to serve clients the way that they want to be served. As we\u2019ve talked about a lot, there are people who -- about 60% of the world wants to have assistance and about 40% of the world wants to do it themselves. And as kind of the name synonymous with tax preparation, we want to be there to provide those services, however we want. So we are very pleased with our digital business. Jason and team have done a remarkable job. As we said, we have double-digit revenue increases. We have enhanced user experience metrics, I think the redesign which is only going to get better. It\u2019s terrific and our core business, our main business is the assisted retail business, we\u2019re really proud of that and we understand it well. And we\u2019ll continue to operate both businesses because our focus is on the client.","Jason Houseworth","I think the only additional color I would add, I mean, this is obviously a category that it\u2019s a fastest growing category within tax prep and the digital category grew about 6%. We grew revenue a lot more than that. But what we see shifting actually within digital is really the growth in mobile. And that was the primary reason why we stepped it at the redesign and looked to try to make our products something that is completely flexible upon different form factors, from a tablet to a smartphone etcetera. And this year, we saw the mobile access to our online product increase about a 165% which says we\u2019re well ahead of this curve even after beginning to last year and so we feel like we\u2019re well positioned as we look ahead to finish the redesign and really look to have nice gains in retention as we go into next year.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Is there a significant -- just to bring it up revenue per return on the mobile versus I guess desktop?","Bill Cobb","We don\u2019t break out the revenue between actually for digital at all but certainly not between desktop and online users. But one thing I would say is that when I talk about mobile, it\u2019s really hard to differentiate between a mobile user and an online user because really we see even what I would call a prototypical online client or one that acts in a browser also using a mobile device in some aspect of the tax preparation experience. So we\u2019re seeing this blending a kind of an omnichannel experience and that's why we redesigned our products and that\u2019s why we feel like we\u2019re well positioned going forward.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I guess, what I was asking and I guess, just to make sure is that thought that the mobile user was typically a simpler return and therefore a lower price return?","Bill Cobb","I won\u2019t say that Michael.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Thank you. Appreciate that.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Colby Brown","Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us today. That will conclude today\u2019s call.

[Operator Instructions]. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","William Cobb","Thank you, Colby, and good afternoon. We came into this season with a comprehensive and aggressive plan to change our planned trajectory and we delivered. I'm extremely pleased with our performance. We took market share in DIY and improved our assisted client trajectory and as a result, we outperformed the overall market. We accomplished this through promotions that were compelling, a new assisted client experience that resonated well and an enhanced DIY product that made filing easier than ever. And we achieved all of this while delivering outstanding financial results.","Our EBITDA increased 11% or $92 million to $904 million. The resulting EBITDA margin of 29.8% represents an over-300 basis point improvement from last year and our earnings per share was the highest in over a decade, increasing 28% to $1.96 per share.","I'm proud of what we have achieved which has given us great momentum heading into fiscal 2018. Our planning process is underway and we're laser-focused on our plan for next tax season.","So with that brief overview, here's what we'll cover today, first, I'll provide our perspectives on the industry in this unique tax season; next, we'll review our performance; then Tony will review our fiscal year financial results; and finally, I will speak in more detail about the leadership transition announced in May.","First, let's start by looking back at tax season 2017. Consistent with the past few years, the season started very slowly. What was different about this season, however, is that the industry never reached its expected growth with an IRS decline in returns of approximately 50 basis points compared to last year. This was unexpected as there have only been 4 times in the past 60-plus years in which overall tax returns declined following the year with employment growth.","While we don't yet have full clarity as to the reasons behind the decline, we do have some hypotheses which center on 4 key factors. First, efforts of the IRS Security Summit members and stronger control of the IRS have helped reduce vulnerabilities that cyber criminals have exploited in the past, resulting in fewer fraudulent returns, including incidents of tax identity theft. An example of this is the elimination of the IRS PIN for e-filed returns. In order for taxpayers to unlock and electronically sign a self-prepared tax return, they must now provide their prior year adjusted gross income which is more difficult for fraudsters to obtain.","Second, the PATH Act requirements may have also helped reduce fraudulent returns. Specifically, W-2s and 1099s were required to be submitted to the IRS on January 31 and the IRS held refund for returns containing the EITC and additional Child Tax Credit until February 15.","Third, renewal requirements for certain high-PIN filers may have caused some to miss the filing deadline. Additionally, undocumented immigrants who previously filed with an i-PIN may have been more reluctant to do so given the current political environment around immigration.","And finally, we saw a decrease in balance due returns which may simply be the late filings that will occur in the off-season or may be returns that may remain -- that will remain unfiled.","Not only do these factors result in lower-than-expected return volume for the industry, they also resulted in a much slower shift from assisted to DIY than in previous years. Though complete IRS data is not available, we estimate that the shift will be less than half of the 70 to 90 basis points seen in the industry in each of the past few years.","Now that we have discussed what happened in the industry, let's talk about our performance. In short, we delivered what we promised. We improved our client trajectory. And as I said earlier, I am very pleased with our results. In the assisted category, we saw a significant improvement over last season driven by successful promotions and our memorable marketing campaign, Get Your Taxes Won. We successfully launched Refund Advance, our interest-free, no-fee, early-season loan that bridges the gap for filers between the time they file their return and receive their refunds.","Given the provisions of the PATH Act, this product was especially relevant to those filers who face delays in receiving their refunds in the early part of the season.","We also reintroduced our free federal 1040EZ promotion, another offering that appealed to early-season filers. This successful relaunch was effectively timed, positioning us well against our competitors in what was an extremely competitive season.","Additionally, we enhanced our client service delivery model by redesigning the tax preparation process, centering around our partnership with IBM Watson. Client feedback has been very positive. In fact, we saw noticeable increases on key client service metrics as we demonstrated our ability to maximize clients' refunds in a new and engaging way. These efforts have translated to improved results. New client growth was the highest it has been in years. We dramatically improved the client trajectory in EITC clients, an area in which we've seen declines over the last several years. We saw an improvement in retention rate of nearly 2 points which is the best single-year improvement during my tenure. Our net average charge increased approximately 2% despite the pricing impact of the free EZ promotion and was attributable to better discount controls in our company offices and improved pricing in our franchise network.","And most importantly, in a category in which change typically happens slowly, we improved our client trajectory significantly with a 2.5% decline in return this fiscal year versus a nearly 6% decline last year. When placed in context of this year's decline in assisted IRS returns, this is terrific progress as we work toward our long term goal of client growth.","Now turning to our DIY business. This was a recheck year for us. We realigned our product lineup and pricing to effectively compete in the category and made significant enhancements to our product. And as I mentioned on our third quarter call, we didn't just want to compete in the category, we wanted to win. That's exactly what we did.","We aggressively went after clients and market share with our H&R Block More Zero promotion which was a more compelling offer than what we saw in many of our competitors. As anticipated, this resulted in a decrease in our net average charge. However, it drove tax filers to our online product, with new client growth increasing 28% and retention increasing over 350 basis points.","While H&R Block More Zero helped us increase client volume, so, too, did these significant improvements we made to our product. Among these improvements were enhanced import capabilities for current year tax forms and prior year tax returns. Our clients can now import their W-2 information by photo capture right from their phone. They can also drag and drop prior year returns which allows them to pre-populate over 90 fields of data in their tax return. By allowing filers to import prior year returns completed by competitors, we're removing the barriers of switching to H&R Block.","These efforts translated into meaningful progress in other key metrics. We improved our conversion rate 130 basis points. Data imports of prior year competitor returns increased over 120%. The number of clients who either started or finished their return using mobile devices increased 20% and awareness of our DIY product grew 2 points to 65% which shows progress but still represents a growth opportunity for us. The net result was that we got our DIY business back on track, growing online returns 6.8% and taking market share.","Now with that overview of the business, let me provide a couple of thoughts on our financial performance. On the top line, I am pleased we're able to keep revenues flat despite our pre-pricing promotions in both the assisted and DIY channels. Regarding expenses, we made significant changes coming into the year through cost-cutting measures that allowed us to invest in our business and improve our margin. We were able to exceed our cost-reduction goals across the board which resulted in better-than-expected financial results. As I mentioned earlier, we dramatically improved our EBITDA margin over 300 basis points to 29.8% and increased our EPS by 28% to $1.96, both outstanding results.","We achieved this while returning capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 14 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $317 million.","And I'm also pleased to announce that the board approved a significant increase in our quarterly dividend for the second year in a row.","Overall, these outstanding results reflect thoughtful execution of our strategy and the hard work of our team. Tony will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment.","So while we're very pleased with our operational and financial results for the year, we're already looking ahead to 2018 and beyond. We're well underway in our planning efforts for next year which began in earnest a few months ago. Our strong performance this year positions us well going into 2018, but we must continue to execute our strategy. So what can you expect next year? We will continue to aggressively go after client growth. We will continue to invest in innovative solutions designed to leverage our ability to serve our clients any way they want to be served. And we will continue to improve the value we provide to our clients and we'll effectively communicate that value.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Bill and good afternoon. Today, I'd like to talk about our fiscal 2017 results and how we performed against our expectations. I'll also discuss our approach to capital structure and provide some thoughts around our outlook for fiscal 2018.","Let me start with how we performed against the objectives that we outlined prior to the tax season. First, with respect to volume and price in our assisted business, we expected a significant improvement in client losses, along with a flat to slightly lower net average charge. We achieved our plan to change the client trajectory and delivered better-than-expected net average charge growth of approximately 2% due to better discounting discipline and improved franchise pricing.","In DIY, we anticipated an increase in client volumes due to H&R Block More Zero promotion and we achieved just that, increasing DIY online clients 6.8% and outpacing the industry. And while we anticipate a decline in our net average charge, it actually came in better than expected due to favorable mix and product attach.","From a bottom line perspective, we indicated in December that we anticipated a fiscal year EBITDA margin at the low end of the long term guidance range of 27% to 30%. More recently, we indicated an expected margin of approximately 28%. Given the significant changes we made to our core business this tax season, it is difficult to predict their ultimate impact on our results. That, combined with diligent expense management throughout the fiscal year, especially in the final months of the tax season which is when we see a significant amount of the fiscal year's expenses, helped us achieve a better-than-expected EBITDA margin at 29.8%. I'll provide more details on the drivers of this in a moment.","In summary, we achieved or exceeded all of our primary objectives. With that context, I'd now like to provide additional details on our key financial metrics, starting with the income statement. Revenues are relatively flat at just over $3 billion. Assisted tax preparation fees and royalty revenue increased due to an increase in our net average charge, partially offset by lower tax return volume.","In our DIY business, revenue declined as the pricing impact of H&R Block More Zero promotion was partially offset by the increase in return volume. ","From a product perspective, we were pleased with our overall attach rate which increased over the prior year. We successfully launched Refund Advance this year with approximately 1.1 million applications, an overall approval rate of approximately 78% and total funded loans of approximately $700 million.","The launch of Refund Advance also helped us drive an increase in the number of Emerald Cards issued this year, resulting in a 140 basis-point increase in our card attach rate. In total, we issued 1.9 million Emerald Cards in tax season 2017, producing revenue per card of $50.","As expected, Refund Transfer units declined slightly to 4.7 million from 4.8 million last year due to the free federal 1040EZ and H&R Block More Zero promotions. Refund Transfer remains a significant product for us, delivering $148 million of revenue in fiscal 2017.","We continue to be pleased with our Peace of Mind attach rates which came in slightly higher than last year at approximately 28%.","Turning to expenses. Operating expenses decreased 3.5% or $85 million from the prior year, primarily due to the cost-reduction measures we outlined at the end of the year. This decline in operating expenses are driven by, a $36 million decline in marketing expense; a $35 million decline in consulting expense, about half of which was attributable to onetime costs in fiscal '16 related to the bank divestiture and capital structure changes; and a $26 million decline in compensation expense.","Additionally, we lowered bad debt expense by $23 million due to an improvement in early season client volume. These expense savings were partially offset by our investment in Refund Advance which was approximately $30 million. This result was made possible by the hard work of our associates. When enacting cost-cutting measures of this magnitude, cooperation across the entire organization is needed to succeed. Everyone from our field management to our marketing team to those working at our corporate headquarters displayed diligence in managing expenses.","Some of the benefits from our cost-reduction efforts were reinvested into the business to fund promotions, product enhancements and the new client experience. The remaining savings helped improve the bottom line, driving an increase in our EBITDA of $92 million to $904 million and an EBITDA margin improvement of over 300 basis points.","Moving through the remainder of the income statement. Total interest expense for fiscal 2017 was $93 million. This represented an increase of $24 million from the prior year due primarily to the full year impact of long term debt issued in September 2015.","Our effective tax rate increased slightly to 33.1% mainly due to discrete items. While this result was better than our guidance, we continue to expect our long term effective tax rate to be approximately 34% to 36% which excludes the impact of unexpected discrete items and does not contemplate any impact related to potential corporate tax reform.","As a result of the items I just discussed, net income from continuing operations increased $37 million or 10% to $421 million and diluted earnings per share increased $0.43 or 28% to $1.96.","It's important to note that this outstanding result in EPS was driven not only by the increase in net income I just discussed, but also from share repurchases over the past two fiscal years. During fiscal year 2017, we repurchased 14 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $317 million which was partially funded by the sale of our mortgage loan portfolio during our third quarter. The average price paid was $22.61 per share which compares favorably to our current market price.","We currently have approximately $1.2 billion remaining of our $3.5 billion share repurchase authorization effective through June 2019. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to share repurchases.","In addition to share repurchases, I'm pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.24 per share. This represents a continuation of last year's catch-up for those years in which we were prevented from increasing the dividend while regulated as a savings and loan holding company.","We remain committed to paying quarterly dividends which we have done every quarter since becoming public -- becoming a public company over 50 years ago. And we're also committed to an annual review of the dividend after each fiscal year. Now any decisions regarding future dividends will depend on operating results, marketing conditions and capital needs, among other factors.","Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims was unchanged from the prior fiscal quarter at $4.5 million as of April 30. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil-piercing arguments.","As I mentioned earlier, we achieved or exceeded all of our primary objectives for the year and delivered better financial performance than expected. We intend to build on this momentum in 2018. We're still in our planning process. And consistent with last year, we will provide more specifics on our second quarter earnings call in December.","Before I hand it back over to Bill, I want to express my appreciation for everything he has done for me and this company. He is a passionate leader who is focused on winning and has taught me some invaluable lessons over the past 6 years. I will miss our daily interactions, but I know we'll stay in touch as he continues to follow H&R Block in the coming years. Thank you, Bill and best of luck. ","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Bill for some final comments.","William Cobb","Well, thank you, Tony. I appreciate those kind words and have so enjoyed working with you during my time here. The company is in really good hands with you as a CFO.","To recap, we delivered what we promised. We significantly changed the client trajectory. We came into the season with a comprehensive and aggressive plan and we executed. And we accomplished all of this while delivering extremely strong financials. I'm very proud of what we achieved this past season.","As you know, I will be leaving the company on July 31. The timing is right given our strong performance this season, the excellent financial results and the outstanding management team we have in place that can lead this great company in the years ahead.","As I mentioned before, the 2018 planning process is currently underway and I will see that process through during my remaining time at the company. We have great momentum coming out of fiscal 2017 and I'm genuinely excited about the plans we're developing for the upcoming tax season.","The CEO search is in process and the board is considering both internal and external candidates. The board and I have developed a smooth transition plan. And regardless of the timing of a permanent CEO being named, I'm confident the company will continue its positive momentum with Tom Gerke as our leader. Tom has been my right-hand man for the last 6 years. He's a trusted adviser and a key member of my leadership team and has been instrumental in this -- developing our strategy. Tom proudly serves as our General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer. Additionally, he has prior Fortune 500 CEO experience with Embarq Corporation and is Executive Vice Chairman of CenturyLink.","On a personal note, I can truly say it has been an honor and a privilege to lead this great company. Over the past 6 years, we have refocused on our core tax business and built a culture of doing the right thing. And we've adapt to our promise of delivering value for our shareholders by repurchasing over 1\/3 of shares outstanding and increasing the dividend 60% during my tenure. H&R Block is a strong company with an experienced, focused management team that I believe will deliver even better results in the future.","It has also been my pleasure interacting with and getting to know those of you in the investment community. I truly appreciate your insights and the value of your input during my tenure.","H&R Block is a great company and a great investment and I'm proud to be part of its legacy.","With that, we're now ready to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","So I guess my first question, Bill, it's been fun working with you. Why are you leaving?","William Cobb","Well, Tom, as you know, I came out of retirement 6 years ago and Block was not in great shape right then, obviously the fifth CEO in 5 years. I was coming off the Board. And at that time what I wanted to try to turn the company in the right direction and I think that's what we've done. It's been 6 years. This has been a great run. I love this company, but it's just time for me to turn it over. I left the company in good shape financially, et cetera. So it's just the right time for a new CEO to come and take it to the next level.","Thomas Allen","Okay. Well, I wish you the best of luck. And moving on to the numbers. I think the biggest surprise for everyone is likely going to be the margins. So I estimate it's about a $60 million delta between what you had thought after tax season and the actual margins. And so can we just talk about kind of what the makeup of that $60 million delta?","Tony Bowen","Yes, Tom, this is Tony. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in my opening comments, there's obviously a bunch of factors that drove the year-over-year performance. And if you look across the P&L, really, every category on the expense side is favorable. It obviously was a little bit more favorable than we even thought. We expected to come in north of 28% and then we ended up coming in closer to 30%, 29.8% from an EBITDA margin perspective. But there was really every category across the P&L from comp and benefits. We knew about the marketing reduction, but the management of our labor during tax season was phenomenal. Really, just management of expenses across the board, when you think about things like T&E, consulting expenses, just really every department in the company just did a phenomenal job this year and really took to heart our goal at the beginning of the year which is we have to be diligent on the expense side to give us flexibility to be aggressive to try to turn around the business and that's exactly what we've done. So we're pleased with the results. It's a little bit better than we expected, but we think it puts us in a really good place in FY '18 and beyond.","Thomas Allen","Great. And then just my last question. In Bill's prepared remarks, you talked about in 2018, you're going to continue to aggressively go after client growth. I mean, I think you guys -- your messaging is that you had a pretty good tax season this year where you were able to increase EBITDA, I think, 11%, but you still had a 3.5% decline in -- or a 2.5% decline in assisted volumes. So how are you thinking -- like is next year going to be a success if -- would a repeat of this year be a success for next year? Or do you really want to start going back to client growth?","William Cobb","Let me go first, Tom and then, Tony, if you want to add anything. I mean, I think Tony will comment more in December on -- as the team works through their plan for the year. I wouldn't hasten to add again, the industry decline here of really about 200 basis point difference. We were very surprised that the IRS declined 50 basis points. We all anticipated it was going to be 150 up or in that range. So that contributed also, the industry dynamics to the client decline. But I think one of the hardest things in any business is to change the client trajectory and that's what I'm most pleased about. We said coming into the year, for assisted, our goal was to change the client trajectory. We did that. And our goal was in DIY to grow share and we did that. And so I'm not going to comment on what the goals for next year are, but that'll come in December. But what I'm pleased about is we did exactly what we said we would do.","Tony Bowen","Yes, the only thing I would add, Bill, is in December, we talked about our expectations for both assisted and DIY. And at that time, we said we expected assisted to decline. Our goal for the year was to change the client trajectory. Obviously, coming off of 2016 where we had significant loss in assisted clients, we knew it would take a couple of years to turn that around. We made significant progress this year. But as I said from a guidance perspective, we didn't expect to basically be positive in assisted. And then you layer on what Bill said about the industry being really slow this year. I think overall, we're pleased with the results. We expect that could get even better next year. But as Bill said, we'll provide more clarity in December.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Bill, best wishes. The -- I guess, I'm curious for both of you guys, what do you anticipate with opportunity for expense savings going forward since, obviously, you were very effective in trimming this year? And the follow-on on that is what did the -- from the last question, what did the timing of the season allow for you to do at the end of the season to really be, I think, Tony you said, efficient with labor?","Tony Bowen","Yes. As far as expectation, obviously, this year, Scott, was a significant reset for us. If I take us back to what we started last March and April which was looking across the company for ways to reduce expense, give us flexibility to invest in turning the business around, that was really the start of it. And that being said, when you have a year when you take out as much expense as we did, that's obviously not going to recur every year. We do believe that most of the expense savings we took out this year, the vast majority is essentially run rate, so we're going to continue to get the benefit. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities to run more efficient, look for opportunities to reduce expense, but it clearly won't be at the level that we had in FY '17. It's just -- it's not possible. We went after things very aggressively and really did a phenomenal job of managing expenses. ","As far as the timing, our business is so seasonal. We do about 75% of our revenue in the fourth quarter. We do a little bit of less than 1\/2 of our expense comes in the fourth quarter. And our biggest day of the year is April 18 which was the last day of tax season this year. So any time it comes in that quickly, not only from a revenue perspective, but obviously, a lot of our expenses, especially on the compensation side, frankly, I wish we would've done a little bit better job of being able to forecast that. But at the end of the day, we're extremely pleased and we're just pleasantly surprised that we were able to manage the P&L as tightly as we were all season long.","Scott Schneeberger","Great. And then just -- I'm curious. Lessons learned with this first year of the Refund Advance loan. Obviously, it had some benefit to you, particularly given the PATH Act. What are some things, [indiscernible] which can be improved and thoughts for the coming year?","William Cobb","I'll go first and then, Tony, if you want to add anything. And I'm not going to go into specifics. But I think we did learn more about this client. I think we learned some things when it comes to the messaging side that I think we can improve as we go forward and we plan on doing. I think what we're very pleased about is that the pull for the product was very strong. The -- operationally, it worked really well. And this was a really nice year of one program of $700 million and almost 1 million people getting the loan. So I think we're pretty pleased with the start we're off to. And there are some lessons we'll apply around messaging and -- but operationally, it really was smooth. So I think we're very pleased about that. Tony, if there's anything else.","Tony Bowen","No. I mean, yes. I mean, it worked really well. I think there's always more upside and as our tax grows and as well as our clients see the product, if we decide to do it again for a second year, I think that will give us additional upside. But I think it just takes a little bit of soak time for a product like this to -- for our 70,000 tax professionals to get used to offering it. We had clients saying, wow, this seems too good to be true which it is not. And I think having it for a second year will -- we expect the take rate to go up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh","And I also wanted to congratulate Bill on the retirement. I wish you my best. So nice -- it's nice to see the good results for the fiscal year. And I think your results were largely above expectations on all metrics. So not to sound nitpicky, but Bill, you've spoken to weaker execution last tax season. I'm curious how you would rank your execution this year in light of [indiscernible] strong performance. Were there any areas that you would have liked to improve on this tax season? And how should we think about your approach in 2018? Would it be right to assume that you guys have now sort of found your rhythm?","William Cobb","Yes. I think on -- and thank you for your comments. I think -- and Carolyn Roscoe who leads our sales and service team. We instituted a big cultural change in the field around a sales culture and going out and we're a great operational company. We manage -- we do accurate tax returns. We do them efficiently. But bringing on the sales culture, we knew it was going to be a multi-year initiative. I think we've got off to a good start. Carolyn and her team spent a lot of time this time last season just trying to figure this thing out. She's off to a great start this off-season in terms of getting ahead of the curve on sales. So I hope for the sales and service team next year, in year two of the sales culture, if you will, to really do a nice job on that. I think our franchisees had a very good year this year. And as Tony remarked, I think we've got a great culture here of expense savings that are going to recur. So a lot of things are hitting. I think we can always do better certainly on -- in terms of gaining clients and servicing them. So we're a long way from satisfied, but this was important for us to get the trajectory change, get on firm financial footing and be able to grow from here.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay. That's helpful color. And then as a follow-up, one for Tony. The question on your margin performance. I guess, how should we be thinking about the sustainability of these in light of them being at the top end of your long term margin goals despite still seeing volume declines? I realize you're not going to give guidance at this juncture, but hoping you can give us any thoughts on whether anything was under-invested in. Did you under-spend anywhere that would cause margins to, say, perhaps revert back to the lower end or mid-end of that range going forward? Or is that range perhaps conservative?","Tony Bowen","Yes, you're right, we're not going to provide the changing outlook on the guidance range. I would say there's a couple of things that occurred this year that were onetime in nature. Those are fairly minor relative to the performance we had year-over-year, kind of in the $10 million to $15 million range. So there was a little bit of year-over-year headwind, but I think the vast majority are essentially in our baseline. We're still going through our FY '18 planning process. And as we kind of figure out what that looks like, we'll provide more clarity in December. But there was just, I hate to say -- keep saying the exact same thing over and over, but just phenomenal performance across the P&L. And frankly, you assume some things are going to go your way and some things maybe not. And this year, we just, from top to bottom, did a phenomenal job managing it. So we'll provide more clarity in December. But for the most part, this is essentially a new run rate for us from an expense perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta","Bill, I wanted to get your thoughts on why you think the shift from assisted to DIY this year was what it was and so much less than it has been the previous tax season.","William Cobb","Well, I think -- Kartik, I think this still has to be played out, but I'll give you my thoughts. I think the reduction in fraudulent returns that was a combination of the PATH Act being delayed and also all the work we've done on the industry really -- I think there were a lot of parts in the returns that were all coming through the digital channel and I think that, that slowdown was a major factor. I think the other thing was, frankly, some of the things that we did and some other independents and other branded assisted players did in terms of free -- our free EZ offering, certainly the Refund Advance, I think, slowed down the shift in that regard. So I think with the combination of good programming, good marketing and also the fraud controls kicking in and really taking a lot of fraudulent returns out of the system.","Kartik Mehta","And then, Bill, just staying on the DIY side a little bit. You had a good season this year on the DIY side. Do you think you need to get more aggressive next year to kind of maintain that shared momentum? Or do you think the programs you have in place will allow you to continue to get share?","William Cobb","It's a very clever way of asking me what we're going to do next year, Kartik, so I'm -- even on my last earnings call, I'm proud of you. But I think, obviously, we'll talk more about this in December as a company. Look, I'm really pleased with what we did last year. I'm not only pleased with the promotions, the pricing piece, but really Heather Watts and her team did a terrific job on the product. We talked about it in the script, the prior year imports, the increase in retention was really due to client experience enhancements. So I think in a highly competitive category where you have a dominant #1 who's obviously a very formidable competitor, we're pleased to be the clear #2 now. We're pleased with our efforts. We're going to have to do better if -- we all realize that. But again, specifically, we're not going to talk about what we're going to do. But knowing that TurboTax is always going to be formidable and we've got to be on our A game.","Kartik Mehta","And then just finally, Bill, you achieved about 2% of pricing this year. Do you think -- as we go forward, does this industry -- will it allow you to continue to get modest pricing like that? Or do you think there's anything changing that would make it difficult to get even that minimal amount of pricing?","William Cobb","Yes and I'll let Tony weigh in also. But I think, again, the pricing question always comes down to the mix and the mix of low-end offers. This is a very unique industry in the sense of you go from free returns all the way up to multiple thousand dollars\u2019 worth of returns for complex situations. I think, as Tony mentioned, we're very strategic in our pricing. We look at it at a really granular level, geography, client segment and the like. So I think we still believe that we have to be aggressive in marketing. I think free is here to stay. But I think that there are some smart moves that we can make certainly on product attach and other areas that will still enable us to get some yield out of the pricing side. It's always tough. I think it will not be any easier next year. But I feel confident that our overall revenue mix, that there will be some benefit that we'll get, if you will, from the pricing line. It's probably not the right word that we should use, but it's something, obviously, we spend a lot of time on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie.","Kayvan Rahbar","This is Kayvan Rahbar, filling in for Hamzah. I have a question on capital allocation. Can you just remind us again on what you guys are thinking in regards to your capital allocation, especially in regards to buybacks and then the current leverage on the balance sheet versus your target range?","William Cobb","Yes. So last year, we repurchased about 300 million -- $320 million worth of shares. If you look over the last couple of years, it's north of $2 billion. So obviously, we've been very focused on share repurchase over the last couple of years. We don't provide guidance on specific plans to the upcoming year. But obviously, we're committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase and that will remain constant in the long term as well. As far as from a leverage perspective, we're happy with where the balance sheet sits today. We aren\u2019t planning to issue any additional long term debt at this point. We're pleased -- we think, given the performance we had this year from an EBITDA perspective, it gives us some additional flexibility, but we have no plans of issuing an additional benefit soon.","Kayvan Rahbar","And then, if I could just give one more follow-up question. On the digital side, can you talk about what inning we're in terms of artificial intelligence and other machine learning from a technology side positively impacting your product? Are we beginning in the mills?","Tony Bowen","Yes. I'll let Bill add on. I think we're at the early innings. I know TurboTax has talked about they're using artificial intelligence in their product. I think artificial intelligence just broadly is still in the early innings and obviously has a long way to go. So we're trying to think about ways we can provide the best tax outcome for our customers, in our DIY products. Obviously, all of our competitors are trying to do the same. But specifically, I think we're definitely in the early innings.","William Cobb","Yes. And I think we're very pleased with our partnership with IBM Watson which we have in the assisted channel. I think what it -- the excitement it brought to the retail experience for our clients, what it did for the tax pros, the combination of our really well-trained experienced tax pros, in combination with Watson and it's only going to get better. We're committed to this. Most companies are committed to this in the long term. So I think we see it as a weapon as we go forward to try to get the best outcome for our clients. That's why our marketing line is Get Your Taxes Won and that's what we want to continue to promise to our clients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Silber","Just wanted to get back to the discussion about EBITDA margins again. I'm not sure if it was last December or the December beforehand when you reduced your long term margin target. What would it take for you to see or be comfortable enough to raise that back again either where it was before and I think it was 28% to 32% or some other number? Are there any strategic or secular changes in the business that would prevent you from doing that?","Tony Bowen","Yes. And I think, Jeff, one of the key drivers is we pull our plan together for this year, what our expectations, not only from an expense perspective, but obviously, revenue and client volume is a key driver in that. We did reduce it to 27% to 30% this last fall. So you're right in this -- for most -- right before the most recent tax season. It was 20% to 32% before that. If you go back to last year's performance, we were slightly below 28%. So we were kind of outside of the range, if you will. In FY '16, I think it was high 27s. That's why I felt it was appropriate to change it to 27% to 30%. And obviously, we did better than we thought we were going to do this year. But as far as longer term, I mean, it's really going to be driven by client volume and then just identifying additional opportunities to reduce spend to become more efficient and we'll try to provide additional clarity to that question in December.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, fair enough. And I missed some of the beginning comments when you talked about the Refund Advance program. Did the costs from your perspective -- I think you had guided initially to $32 to $36 per loan. Did it come in line with that range?","Tony Bowen","It did. We ended up doing less than we originally thought, though. Based on the amount of capacity that we had, we did about $700 million in loans. And I think that was just year 1 of the program, it was difficult to predict the ultimate volume. And that was a benefit to us from an EBITDA perspective. Obviously, that was an expense we didn't have to pay. But yet, we still drove in a lot of clients and overall, really successful program for us. So that was part of the benefit, if you will, from an EBITDA margin perspective, but still got a lot of the benefit on the client side as far as offering a valuable product that drove in volume in their offices.","Jeffrey Silber","Great. And just a quick follow-up, did you talk at all about what type of clients took this? Were these new clients, existing clients, what kind of combination?","William Cobb","Took the Refund Advance?","Jeffrey Silber","Yes, please.","William Cobb","Yes. This is our strongest new client performance in a lot of years and I think what we're especially pleased by was the amount of EITC returns we did which has been a problem area for us in the last few years and that we were able to regain our footing with EITC clients. So it was the early-season client, obviously, that's when we had it out there, but it was a combination of new clients and EITC clients. And as I said earlier, our retention rates improved by almost 2 points on the assisted side. So that was a help, too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman from Millman Research.","Michael Millman","So following up on a theme here is this year's fiscal '17 was helped by, as you pointed out, very heavy promotions with the cost of that basically seems offset by cost savings. So related to that, typically, you see diminishing returns from promotions as they continue. So kind of interested in whether you expect additional promotions. And if so how are you really likely to fund it? And secondly, I mean, this is probably going to sound kind of negative, but I kind of wonder why, with the upward momentum that you're leaving before the end of your contract, just when you may be breaking through the positive territory, I'm kind of curious as to why also Greg and Jason have left recently.","William Cobb","Yes. So let me start with the -- on the promotional side. I think, Mike, I think your comment is very fair that the task with promotions is always to either introduce new ones or certainly refresh the ones that you used. And that -- we're well aware of the challenges associated with that. And our plans are underway and we're very mindful of that. But our goal every tax season is to be impactful and that will be the same for this year. I'm not going to comment whether there are going to be new ones or not. We'll talk more about that, as Tony indicated a couple of times, more in December. So that's with regard to that. With regard to me, I think the contract was really just an employment agreement that really was about -- to me, it's kind of one of those things you put in the drawer.","I came here six years ago when the company really was kind of going sideways and really needed, I think, a jolt of leadership and came out of retirement at that time as I've been with eBay for a number of years. And I fell in love with the company. I thought it was great. I really enjoyed the job, enjoyed the associates, enjoyed the tax pros, all the elements of it. And -- but it's a grind. It's a lot of work. So I just thought it was time to leave it. There was going to be a certain point where it was time to go. My youngest just graduated from high school. He's headed off to Notre Dame and it was just one of those -- it was a very personal decision for me. But I will -- also wanted -- I was not going to leave this company in a bad position. I promised the board that. I originally signed a five-year deal. I -- on that level, I actually stayed an extra year. So it's just the right time.","There's nothing to read into it or anything else. I leave on good terms. We have a very smooth transition in hand. And so for me, it was a personal decision that this was the right time. And I think it's going to be a great time to hand this off to a CEO who I believe will have -- will choose a great CEO and they can take it to the next level. With regard to Greg and Jason, who I worked with for virtually the entire time I was here, who I'm a big fans of both of them, they -- we had long talks about their careers and it really, for them, also was a personal decision. They certainly were in good standing with the board, with myself and everyone else, but they both are very talented guys. They're in a stage in their career where they wanted to go do something differently. The great thing about it is we have a strong bench here and we were able to fill Jason's job a few years ago, when he was running digital, with Heather Watts who's been outstanding in his role; Tony took over for Greg; Kathy Collins running Marketing who's very experienced; Karen has been here 17 years, is just doing a great job on the sales and service side; Kip Knight; Alan Lowden's a terrific technology leader; and then, of course, there's Tom who we appoint to take over as the Interim CEO.","So it's a real experienced management team. There's depth to it. And so we've been able to absorb these changes, I think, in a way where the new person can come in and work with this experienced team and really feel great about going forward here. But I know Greg and Jason are friends of the company. I saw them recently and they're going to be great in all their endeavors.","Operator","As there are no further questions at this time, I would return the call to Mr. Colby Brown.","Colby Brown","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] My name is Rose, and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's broadcast. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Derek Drysdale, Vice President of Investor Relations. Go ahead, sir.","Derek Drysdale","Thank you, Rose, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fiscal 2013 third quarter results. Joining me on the call are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Other members of our senior management team will be available during the Q&A session. They include Jason Houseworth, President of U.S. Client Services; Amy McAnarney, President of U.S. Retail Client Services; and Susan Ehrlich, President of Financial Services.","In conjunction with this call, we have posted today's press release and slide presentation on the Investor Relations website at www.hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix of today's slide presentation.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2012 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill.","William C. Cobb","Thanks, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we released our U.S. tax return volume through February 28, as well as our fiscal 2013 third quarter earnings ended January 31. Obviously, there is a lot of noise this tax season. But we want you to walk away with 3 key points.","First, the entire tax industry has experienced unprecedented delays this season, which has created near impossible comparisons to last year's results through January 31 and February 28. We believe that industry-wide tax filings are running about 2 weeks behind the comparable period last year, and we expect that it will take the balance of the season for the industry to fully normalize. That said, the great thing about our business is that taxpayers must file by April 15. We continue to believe that industry filings this tax season will grow in line with historical levels of approximately 1% to 2%.","Second, we entered this season with a very thoughtful plan. And while we've had to make some adjustments due to these delays and competitive factors, I'm pleased with our execution to date. We noticed that many competitors substantially increased their marketing in December and January. We were pleased that in the light of the delays, our marketing was better timed. As I assess our marketing efforts so far this season, I believe our Chief Marketing Officer, Robert Turtledove, and his team have done an outstanding job. Everywhere I go, people compliment us on our new ad campaign, which focuses on the expertise of our Tax Professionals. While it's still early in the season, we believe we're outperforming the market thus far in both the Assisted and Digital categories. That said, there's obviously a lot of execution remaining until the industry fully normalizes by April 15.","And finally, in order for us to be a successful -- to be successful and drive long-term shareholder value, we must have a vision and clear goals to strengthen our overall industry position in fiscal 2013 and beyond. We've made good progress toward these goals, and this season's performance to date is in line with our long-term vision for the company.","Now with that summary, I'd like to take a few minutes to provide our analysis of the U.S. tax industry through February 28. As you know, the IRS typically begins accepting tax returns by mid-January. Heading into 2013, the IRS had originally planned to open its e-file system on January 22. So we already expected the season to be delayed by approximately 1 week. Then the delay was further exacerbated by 3 factors. First, significant tax legislation was signed into law in early January, which prompted the IRS to subsequently move its opening of e-file to January 30, just before the end of our fiscal third quarter. Second, the IRS and a number of states and other taxing jurisdictions did not begin accepting certain forms until this month. Third, we believe that the media coverage on the so-called fiscal cliff tax legislation and the associated e-file and form delays has led to changes in the timing of taxpayer filing patterns this season. We believe all these factors combined have led to industry-wide tax filings running about 2 weeks behind the comparable period last year.","Turning to our volume results through February 28, it's clear that these delays had a temporary impact on both our Assisted and Digital channels. However, our analysis of industry data gives us confidence that we are on track with our plans for fiscal 2013. While our U.S. tax return volume fell nearly 6% through February 28, we're currently outpacing the overall industry, which we estimate was down approximately 8% on a comparable date-to-date basis. The temporary impact of these delays has been more pronounced in our Assisted business. This is especially true among complex Form 1040 filers, who often wait longer to file than Form 1040EZ or Form 1040 A filers.","It's also important to note that our Assisted volume has not been materially impacted by our decision to exit Sears last fall. We're pleased that the clients we previously served in Sears locations are being retained at levels consistent with our expectations.","In the Digital category, Intuit, our largest branded competitor, released their tax volumes through February 16, about 2 weeks ago. Intuit reported its online filings fell 6% through February 16, while our online returns were down 2% on a comparable day-to-day basis. From January 30 through February 16, Intuit grew 32%, while our online returns were up 44%. As of February 28, our total online returns grew more than 5% fiscal year-to-date.","In desktop, total filings fell 11% through February 28. It's important to highlight that the desktop category is in a slow secular decline, and we made a strategic decision to target more profitable clients by exiting certain retailers. Excluding these units, our desktop returns would have been down about 4%.","And finally, our Free File Alliance returns were down 16% as of February 28. Overall, our mix of Digital clients continues to improve, which should position us well going forward as we continue to gain momentum in this category.","In conclusion, I like the way we're executing, and we're currently outpacing our competition in both our Assisted and Digital channels. However, the industry will not formally normalize until the end of the season, and there are still over 60 million taxpayers who have to file by April 15. We have a lot of work to do between now and then, but I believe we're well positioned to execute on our plans for this fiscal year. We look forward to sharing our second half tax volume results with you in late April.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss our third quarter financial results.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. Given the seasonality of our business and the fact that nearly all of our revenue and earnings come in the fourth quarter, our third quarter results generally don't provide a lot of color on our performance. This is especially true this year, as the unprecedented delay to the start of this tax season led to a material shift of business from our third quarter to our fourth quarter. Therefore, we do not believe our third quarter results are indicative of the results we expect to achieve this fiscal year. Our previously announced cost reduction initiatives remain on track, and we continue to believe it will deliver significant earnings and market expansion in fiscal 2013.","Fiscal year-to-date through the third quarter, we've realized $172 million of total expense savings. It's important to note, however, that our third quarter and year-to-date expenses are obscured due to the volume-driven variable expense shifts this year that did not occur last year. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter variable expenses, primarily Tax Professional compensation, to increase compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Despite this shift, we continue to expect our cost reduction initiatives will generate $85 million to $100 million of pretax earnings in fiscal 2013.","For the third quarter, total revenues were lower by 29% to $472 million, as the IRS opened its e-file system on January 30, just before the end of our fiscal third quarter. For accounting purposes, we recognize the revenue and associated expenses from a completed tax return once the return has been accepted by the IRS. As a result, we deferred $15 million of revenues to our fourth quarter, as the IRS did not accept returns that contain forms such as the Education Credit, as well as a number of other specific forms, before our third quarter end on January 31. Our third quarter adjusted net loss from continuing operations was $60 million or $0.22 per share compared to breakeven in the prior year.","In our Tax Services segment, revenues were lower by $191 million or 29% due to the delayed start of the tax season and a $15 million revenue deferral that I had mentioned earlier. The segment's pretax loss of $64 million compares to a pretax income of $32 million in the prior year. Lower revenues resulting from the delays were partially offset by our cost reduction initiatives and lower variable compensation costs.","In Corporate, our pretax loss improved by 2% to $32 million. Corporate expenses declined by $1 million, primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from last quarter's refinancing of our senior notes. Corporate revenues declined $1 million due to lower interest income from H&R Block Bank's shrinking mortgage loan portfolio.","Our third quarter financial statements also reflect the impact of a settlement with the IRS, which provides a closure on substantially all outstanding issues in our 1999 through 2007 tax returns. The settlement resulted in a $43 million income tax benefit. This benefit includes the recognition of federal tax and interest receivables not previously recorded, as well as the release of federal and state income tax reserves. As I mentioned in our investor conference last December, we are continuing to explore ways to lower our effective tax rate over the long term. We'll provide more detail once our review is complete and we have more definitive information to share.","Turning to Sand Canyon. Third quarter representation and warranty-related claims remained low at $16 million, although future claim activity could vary considerably from quarter-to-quarter. Importantly, Sand Canyon reached a settlement with AIG during the third quarter, with the settlement payment charged against Sand Canyon's accrual for representation and warranty claims. With the exception of disclosures we were required to make in our Form 10-Q that will be filed later today, terms of the agreement are confidential. Sand Canyon's accrual for representation and warranty-related liabilities totaled $119 million at January 31, 2013.","Turning to H&R Block Bank. I realize that many of you are interested in an update as we continue to explore strategic alternatives. About all I can say at this point is that we're working closely with our partners at Goldman Sachs and First Annapolis, and we're pleased by the progress we've made over the past couple of months.","Before we turn the call over for questions, I'd like to make an announcement. Over the next couple of weeks, Derek Drysdale will be transitioning into a new role at H&R Block as Vice President of Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis. As many of you know, Derek has proven to be a great asset over the past 6 years in Investor Relations. We're excited to have an executive of Derek's caliber moving into this new role, where he'll have the opportunity to continue working closely with me, Bill and the Board of Directors.","I'm also pleased that Colby Brown has been named Derek's successor as Vice President of Investor Relations. Colby has been with H&R Block for 3 years and has previously served in several key roles in finance. Previous to H&R Block, Colby had a successful career in finance with White [ph]  Pharmaceuticals. I believe Colby's finance background and institutional knowledge of H&R Block will serve him well in Investor Relations and I know Colby is very excited to meet many of you at our roadshows later this summer.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Derek for our closing remarks.","Derek Drysdale","Thank you, Greg. Over the past 6 years, I've thoroughly enjoyed having the opportunity to work so closely with our analysts and investors. I value all the relationships we have established, and I will certainly miss our daily interactions. That said, I'm very excited to lead our corporate financial planning and analysis team and I'd like to thank Greg and Bill for allowing me this opportunity. Although my involvement in Investor Relations will diminish over the coming weeks, I will be available for calls later tonight and tomorrow. I also look forward to seeing many of you next week at the Credit Suisse Global Services Conference in Scottsdale, and then in Boston on March 20. Colby will join me on both trips, and I look forward to making the introductions. So I hope you'll join both me and Greg in congratulating Colby. I know he'll do a great job and that you'll really enjoy working with both Colby and Ryan Sands going forward.","With that, we are now ready for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Mr. Drysdale, your first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Bill, can you talk about what type of pricing you are getting so far in the tax season and maybe how that compares to your long-term goals?","William C. Cobb","Kartik, the -- we're not going to talk about pricing today. I mean, it's been a season with a lot of discontinuities. It is a full seasonal business. A lot of the pricing is mix-related. I will say that we put together a what -- we described it as a thoughtful plan, and that included pricing. And I'm pleased that we're executing that plan in line with our expectations.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Bill, can you tell -- talk a little bit about the Emerald Card business? Obviously, you didn't have the free RACs this year to -- as an incentive for people to take the Emerald Card. Maybe where you stand in terms of how the Emerald Card is doing and in light of your expectations for the business as well?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I'm going to let Susan comment on that in a second. I will say that with the start of the season being pushed to July 30 -- January 30, excuse me, there's not a lot of data to share with you. But I'll let Susan comment on how Emerald Card is going.","Susan P. Ehrlich","Kartik, thanks for the question. As we talked about at Investor Day, a big part of what we were doing with Emerald Card this year was a focus on product enhancements, with the cash rewards, with the redevelopment of our online banking platform and the mobile app. And really the focus has been on growing year-round use of the card. I would say that what we've seen so far this season, we're pleased with the early indicators around things like online enrollment and the mobile app downloads. But I think this is going to be a continuing effort.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question, Bill. As you look at this tax season and how it's shaping up, what are your expectations for the Digital market in terms of the entire -- growth for the entire market?","William C. Cobb","Yes, and I'll -- and, Jason, if you want to add any comments. I think we said this back in the -- back at Investor Day. We do think it's mid-single-digit circa 5% growing market for this year as the market continues to really source its volume from the decline in pen and paper. So we still think that's about the size of what Digital will be. But, Jason, I don't know if you have anything to add.","Jason Houseworth","Yes, Kartik, I would say the same thing I said in December, which is we believe with the pen and paper forecast that we think the Digital category will grow roughly 5% to 6%. And I think that that's even with what I would call a lot of early-season spending by some of our competitors in marketing. And I'd just say that we felt like ours was better timed, and I'm pleased with our early performance in the category.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","You've mentioned, hey, there's still a lot of tax season left to go. With the fiscal cliff-related delays, when do you think we hit that year-over-year inflection point? Is it something in mid-March? Is it the end of March? Or what's your view on that because apparently we're not there yet?","William C. Cobb","Yes, we're not there yet. And it's -- that probably data point keeps bouncing around, but I wouldn't look for anything this month. I think it'll be sometime next month, but I'm not spending a lot of time trying to figure out that. We're just trying to service our clients right now and do every tax return that we can.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. The -- Appreciate the commentary on how you're progressing through the season and giving us the February 15 split on how Digital is progressing. Is that, Bill, your response I assume just now was for the whole tax industry. Specifically to Digital, do you say -- would it be the same answer or might we see an inflection point sooner in relation to that category?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I was talking about the tax industry in total. And, Jason, if you want to add anything, I mean I think I would note that our primary business, the way we look at the Digital business is online, and to the end of February our number of returns was up 5%. But, Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","Jason Houseworth","No, I think that at this point, it's really a question of when exactly. But what we know is it'll be April 15 at the end of the year.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. A couple more if I can, jumping around. You alluded to a strong Sears retention level at what you had anticipated. Do you care to share that level? And just a question relating to that, how would the season year-to-date have looked, if you can cut it this way, without having closed 200 Block stores and moved out of Sears?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I -- let me answer the second question. I'm not sure I got the first one or if somebody else did. We had an initiative, and we've been executing against it, called \"leave no client behind.\" And to date, we believe we are executing well against retaining the clients, which were in our, what we call, moved offices because we didn't leave, these are our clients. Obviously in Sears, these are our clients. We've been very aggressive with outreach, and I think we've been very successful to date on retaining those clients at the levels in line with our expectations. I'm not sure I caught the first half. And then, Greg, do you want to try?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","I can. It's about Sears specifically. So we've had historical experience in closing Sears locations down. This year, obviously we closed the rest of them. And so we've used our historical experience and we went store by store and looked at what we thought would happen and put specific plans in place. Have executed a lot of that, and I can, by the way, tell you I've been to a number of Sears locations, our former locations, and what we've done in each market. And I think we've been basically in line with our expectations and quite pleased with where we're at.","William C. Cobb","Yes. We have no regrets over the decision to exit Sears.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Excellent. And the latter part, Bill, of that question was, if you can cut it this way, year-to-date tax returns prepared through February 28, down 5.8%. It was getting at how -- what would that have been if you haven't adjusted for Sears? But I have -- but if you don't have any idea, I mean you covered that part of the question pretty well.","William C. Cobb","Yes, I mean I think we're looking at everything relative to the -- our estimates of where the industry is at. And we believe that in both Assisted and Digital, we are, to date, outperforming both channels, but there's a long way to go.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Excellent. And then lastly, you guys outperformed what I was expecting in -- just in the January quarter on the revenue line, but a little lighter relative to what I was expecting on the income line. And, Greg, I think you were touching on that in the prepared remarks. But how, with your maintained guidance of $85 million to $100 million of cost coming out, was it simply just the timing and the light quarter of revenue getting pushed into the fourth quarter and we'll see a much more defined benefit from the cost savings? If you could just speak to it a little bit more.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","I think this is a new record. It's like question #8 that I finally get asked a question, so thank you, Scott, for giving me the [indiscernible]. Well, in the quarter, we had a -- I mean, the main thing here is we had a dramatically late opening here, and that's affected not just the revenue line but the expense line. When you look at the amount of costs that we'll be shifting in the fourth quarter that are variable in nature, primarily being the Tax Pro compensation, but there's some other variable expenses, those will come back in, as the revenue will. When you isolate that -- those items, what you'll see, from my perspective, is exactly the kind of track record you'd expect to see to deliver the $85 million to $100 million. So I'm comfortable at the end of the third quarter where we ended up on expenses.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And while I have you and if I can sneak one more in, it was quite a low number of mortgage putbacks, new mortgage putbacks in the quarter, which was quite a number. With the AIG settlement, that didn't change the loan-loss reserve. I didn't go back and look where it was last time. Was there a change in the loan-loss reserve or no change and now we have that behind us, correct?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So the AIG settlement is confidential, so I really can't comment on that unfortunately. The settlement was booked through the representation and warranty reserve, I mentioned that. And there was changes in the representation and warranty reserve, which you can see in the 10-Q here shortly.","Operator","Your next question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you give us some more color on how certain consumer tax expenses are trending, both in the third quarter and then kind of season to date? So simply interested in comp and benefit -- comp and benefits, occupancy, marketing and bad debt, especially given the expansion of Emerald Advances here?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Thomas, I'll start maybe -- and I'm sorry, you may have to repeat some of the line items you're looking for. But relevant to bad debt, the way our model works is we'll originate a loan, the Emerald Advance loan, in the preseason. That loan will reopen [ph] , and at end of the third quarter, at that point, we're really not yet into the collection season. So we will just be booking an estimated reserve at that point in time. So that's mechanically how it works. What I'll point out, however, is we made a lot of changes both to the underwriting model this season, as well as the collection practices that are in place. And based on some of the early season, and this is getting back to summer and fall time for us, those collection procedures were in place and I was actually quite pleased with their results. So it's too early to talk about sort of the trend for bad debt, but I think generally speaking that we've got a good program in place and looking forward. Do you want to comment on that, Susan?","Susan P. Ehrlich","Yes, I was just going to add, Tom, just on the -- your question about what happened on the expenditure, the variable expenses associated with booking those loans since we started earlier. I think this year as well, we were very focused on ensuring that we had efficiency in the program in that regard, too. So we opened in offices where we knew we would see the kind of volume for applications, and we worked very closely with retail client services to ensure that we made improvements on productivity there, too.","William C. Cobb","And I guess I would just add, Thomas, not to speak to any specific line item. But I think you'll see that in virtually every case, the expense controls we put in place in the project runway initiative, we're in -- below year ago in virtually every measure. And I think Greg pointed out that on the variable compensation around Tax Pros, some of that will come back in the fourth quarter as we do more volume.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","I could talk about occupancy too, because you mentioned that one. As part of our cost reduction initiatives that came out last season, we targeted a number of locations for closure. We've executed that successfully. We -- and this was mentioned earlier, we leave no client behind. Just because we closed the location doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to service those clients, and we've been very good at moving those clients to the closest location that's convenient to them. We also took that opportunity to renegotiate a number of leases that -- because of the way the commercial market was, and those were successfully executed. We didn't get into specific line items in terms of how we're going to expect these $85 million to $100 million to come into the income statement. But it's specific to occupancy and -- well, it's specific to all line items, they're all delivering what we expected them to do.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then in terms of RACs, I don't think you guys have touched on it yet. How is that trending season to date, both on the pricing side and the volume side?","William C. Cobb","Well, I'll talk to the pricing side. We're -- we've charged for all the RACs that we have done this year. There is no free RAC. With regard to volume, we're not disclosing that because obviously, we're only 2 days into the season. So that is -- most of the deduct to your fees volume is going to be in the fourth quarter.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then final question, if I can fit it in. I think everyone is interested in the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act. Do you guys have any thoughts or can you give any numbers around how it could expand the number of filers or increase pricing for you in the future?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I don't think, Thomas, we're ready yet to talk about volume or pricing or the business model itself. We've been studying this market. We're deeply involved in it. I do think the tax and health care review we have done so far this year has been very well received by clients. They appreciate us taking the time to inform them of the upcoming changes, which is -- really starts with being triggered by the 2012 tax return. I think that as we go forward, this is getting -- it appears to be that complexity will be the order of the day here. Complex tax laws generally are good for our Assisted business. But again, as I've said many times, the great thing about our business model is we are here to serve clients the way that they want to be served since we have every form of business, and we use the term anywhere, anyway, anytime. So I think we're well positioned to take advantage of whatever happens in the Affordable Care Act. There's still a lot of initiatives. There's still a lot to hear from HHS and the IRS, so I have to do a \"stay tuned\" on this one.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Turner of Compass Point.","Evan Hutto","This is Evan Hutto on for Mike. I just wanted to follow up on the health care. I know it's still a little premature to talk about health care reform and what it'll mean for the business, but just a few questions. In 2007, when Massachusetts instituted the health care reform, can you talk about the impact it had on your business then?","William C. Cobb","Yes, that was well before my time and I think anybody else in this room. So I'm not sure I could speak to the impact it had back then. I think that -- a couple of points on Massachusetts, and I don't pretend for a second to be deep on this issue. But obviously, the demographics in Massachusetts are different. You have a wealthier state. You have a state that actually had a relatively low percentage of uninsured population. It was, I think, only in the mid -- 5% or 6% range. The comparable number I have seen in the U.S. is approaching 20%, in the 18% to 20% range. It's a different law. It's a different approach. So I don't think that there is, frankly, a lot to learn from Massachusetts, because this is unique with all the various exchanges, some of which are going to be state, some of which are in state. They're going to be done via what they're calling a federal exchange. So we're not spending a lot of time looking back on Massachusetts. We're trying to manage through what are the complexities of this law and how best can we serve our clients as it impacts them.","Evan Hutto","Okay, that's helpful. And I know you guys don't usually give color around buybacks, but is there any reason to believe that you guys won't be in the market buying back more stock until the bank transaction is completed? Is there any reason why you guys didn't repurchase anything in Q2?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So we don't provide forward-looking guidance, to answer your first part of your question, on pretty much most matters. So -- and then our track record, however, historically, has been very favorable to shareholders. We've done a great job of buying back shares historically. And as you just saw, we've also just announced our quarterly dividend here, which we're quite proud of.","Evan Hutto","Okay. And my last one, if I could. How -- tightened due diligence requirements on e-tic filers, how has that impacted the overall number of filings or is it still too early based on the delays?","William C. Cobb","I'm not sure I heard you correctly. Did anyone -- could you repeat the question?","Evan Hutto","Yes. On the e-tic filers, the earned income tax credit filers?","William C. Cobb","Oh, okay. And the question is?","Evan Hutto","I just wondered, the additional due diligence requirements that were instituted this year, I was wondering how that impacted your overall number of filers.","William C. Cobb","We haven't seen anything. There is additional data, the extra page as it's called. We haven't seen anything of note. Amy, I don't know if there's anything you want to comment on. But I don't think -- that hasn't come up, and I think our Tax Professionals have done a nice job handling their clients with that.","Amy McAnarney","The only thing that I would add is that, it's just with any regulation and adherence to the IRS, it's just -- it's part of what we do, so we have not seen really any impact at all to serving our clients.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Some more on the ACA. Do you think that the -- what we learned from the Bush rebate program will give some indication of what ACA may mean in terms of volume? Also regarding ACA, on your program, on your review program, are you seeing better retention from those people who use the program? Are you seeing new clients from that program as well? And then to change the subject a little bit, can you give us some indication of whether you think you can make up what you lost in the third quarter and the fourth quarter? I would assume that you had inefficiencies in the third quarter and I assume you'd have some inefficiencies when we get this end of -- or mid-April crunch as people have rushed to file. And then finally, the last year EZ returns were up about 25%. Are you seeing anything like that this year?","William C. Cobb","Any other questions, Mike or -- but let me try the first 4. So on the ESA, the Economic Stimulus Act from the Bush administration. We thought about this, whether that's a proxy for what may happen in the Affordable Care Act. I don't think -- that was a one-timer. It was one-time way for individuals to get money from the government. This is so different because a tax return filed in 2012, which indicates whether you have eligibility for a subsidy, for an exchange that's opening in October of 2013, which has impact for the insurance you're going to take on in 2014 and then has to be to trued-up in 2015. I mean, it is just -- the Economic Stimulus Act was a one-timer. It was a benefit to the industry. I think that in the long run, this is going to add a lot of new filers, I don't know. I think it is going to be a slow ramp, though. Our research is quite clear. People are very confused about this act, so that's kind of the first area. I think with regard to retention, you asked about with regard to health care. This is the first year we're doing a health care review, so we won't see that in any numbers, that we'll see that next year. But I do think it has certainly been something that, as we print off that health care review for people, that they've been very appreciative, our clients. It -- we believe it has driven new filers into our offices, so we think that has been a good thing. And with regard to EZ, we won't comment about specific forms at this point. I think what I would do, Greg, is maybe turn it over to you to talk about -- Mike was asking about third quarter inefficiencies and fourth quarter inefficiencies. As I turn it over to you, though, I will say that I think Amy's team did a terrific job with the change in season on -- obviously, we had a lot of clients come in the door in the last 2 days of January, and certainly into the first week. I think they handled it beautifully, and I expect them to do the same at the end of the season. But why don't you speak to any of the financial implications of that?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes. So we spent a lot of time looking at various models. The good thing about Block is we've been doing this for a long time and we know how to do labor modeling. We understand how the cost structure works. We understand how to actually roll that down into the field. So as we had leading information and realtime information, we were able to adjust pretty quickly. There were some inefficiencies, I think that's a fair statement, but they were not material. So I wouldn't get too worried about it from your perspective. As it relates to the fourth quarter, there are a lot people who still have to get their taxes done, and we're looking forward to serving them. And I think that we'll be fine coming out of the season.","Operator","You have a question from Adam Liebhoff of Loomis, Sayles.","Adam Liebhoff","Let me offer my congratulations to Derek and Colby. Just one question really. I wonder what sort of share gain is implied by the 7.8% decline at retail? And I suppose said another way, do you guys have any sense for the overall market for retail returns, how that market trended, I guess through Feb 8 -- 28?","William C. Cobb","Yes, Adam, and then if Jason wants to augment my comment. We're not going to talk about share gain. It's a full season business, we'll obviously have full information as we get toward final season results. So I'm not going to speak to any share gain nor do we have good insight into the mix between Assisted and Digital other than our own estimates. But, Jason, do you want to...","Jason Houseworth","Yes, Adam, this is Jason Houseworth. I think the problem at this point is that the IRS hasn't made any data public that would show the split between Assisted and Digital filers. And until they do that, it's very hard to tell. The down 8% number was our estimate. And really beyond that, we're not able to get a read on the Assisted to Digital breakout.","William C. Cobb","And that was for the total business, the 8%.","Jason Houseworth","That's right.","Operator","You have a question from Sandy Mehta of Value Investment.","Sandy Mehta","The stock has had a very good move from the December Analyst Day, from $18 to $26 here almost, in the aftermarket. Just a couple of questions. On the sale of the bank, I know you cannot comment much, but is there -- can you give us some color in terms of timing. Is there still an expectation of -- likely in the next couple of quarters? And the negotiations and what you're seeing, are you comfortable in terms of the revenue sharing of profits and products that are within the bank? Is that -- does that appear to be in line with the expectations?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","We announced, earlier in the fall time, our decision to find a way to exit the bank. To be really clear with everyone, I'm going to say this every time I get this question. Financial services are a very important part of our future at Block. We think it's a very important way to add value to our clients and an important way to add value to our shareholders and that commitment we're delivering through the season. Let me give you some highlights earlier today and at the end of the season we'll be able to talk more about that. Since we made that announcement about the bank back in the fall time, we've engaged both Goldman Sachs and First Annapolis as our advisors, and we've been methodically working through a process to find out what the right option is for H&R Block. Our objective is, number one, to get the right deal. And number two, is to do it as expeditiously as possible. And the problem is when you're in the middle of these things, it's hard to provide real-time updates. But suffice to say, we've had good response out there and we're moving quickly along here. I'm really not going to give you any idea what the timing looks like, though.","Sandy Mehta","Okay. And can you give us an update on buyback activity? And many of us have expectations for sizable buybacks going forward, given the stock has moved to a more reasonable level than previously. Is it fair to expect that probably we'll see more dividend increases than buybacks going forward?","William C. Cobb","So let me go first and then, Greg, you should certainly weigh in. I would remind everybody that for the fiscal year-to-date, we have bought back 8% of the stock on top of 4% last year. So I'm pleased with our -- the performance we've had on returning capital this year. We also, as Greg mentioned, we just announced our 202nd consecutive quarterly dividend. But I'll let Greg speak to anything beyond that.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","We have a philosophy at Block about being shareholder-friendly. We've been able to deliver that historically. We don't provide forward-looking guidance however. So we'll find out what the future looks like. Our thinking about share buyback is really a 2-part question that we need to be able to answer. The first is, do we have the cash available from our capital allocation waterfall. And then the second thing we have to do is do we like the price the stock is trading at. And that's also a number that we're not going to provide. We don't think that's in the interest of the shareholder base to talk about what point of the market we're going to be in at this point in time. But we just end that point back to the point that Bill mentioned, which is our philosophy is to be shareholder-friendly.","Operator","You have a question from Steve O'Brien from Jefferies.","Steven J O'Brien - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Regarding -- I know you're not talking about pricing directly, but I was wondering if you see potential for the late filing season to result in some ASP lift, given kind of normal end-of-season price increases we normally see in the Digital DIY market.","William C. Cobb","Yes. I'm not going to signal the competitors what our plans are coming up. This is a business that you have to manage very closely as there are seasons within seasons and there are time frames, and mix obviously plays into that. But we're not unaware of where you're going with that question, Steve. And I just would again say let us play out the season and then you'll have full insight into it.","Steven J O'Brien - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I could on another topic regarding the retail strategic exits. Could you provide a little bit more color around like what portion of the channel that was for H&R Block? I mean how do you come to that down 4% figure versus the true reported figure? And should we think of that as a same-store sales number or something like that? Just any color or metrics around that you could provide would be great.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Well, there is no true reported number at this point because the IRS has not released anything publicly. We obviously have our -- a lot of historical data and contacts and try to figure out how we're doing. But we've released what we think is decent progress to date, but the reality is there's a lot of tax season to go here still, and that's probably the better time to talk about share and...","William C. Cobb","Were you talking about office closings, office moves?","Jason Houseworth","Desktop returns.","Steven J O'Brien - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was talking about the desktop, the retail channel [indiscernible] on it.","William C. Cobb","Desktop -- oh, I'm sorry. We...","Gregory J. Macfarlane","I misunderstood your question.","William C. Cobb","I misunderstood. Jason is the only who got it, so he gets to answer it.","Jason Houseworth","Thanks, Steve, I appreciate your question. Well, in desktop, where we sell our Block software, this year we targeted more profitable clients in what we see as a declining channel. And our focus this season, it really remains on growing online and, within that, mobile units. And as Bill mentioned, if you take out the strategic exits that we made, we'd only be down 4% as of February 28. And that was really what we meant to do this season.","Steven J O'Brien - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great, and understood there. I mean was it 1\/4 of your retail presence or is there any kind of -- just so I can try to get my arms around how big the exit was in terms of getting to the 4% number versus the reported number.","William C. Cobb","No. I mean I think the plan -- I mean, we obviously still have a very viable business. We did over 1.2 million returns through February 28. This was certain -- a couple of retailers that we just thought the ask was egregious, and we decided to focus our money and our desire for space and our merchandising on certain retailers. So that -- it was not a wholesale shift. This is a segment of the market that is in a secular decline. We think that the highest growth, highest profit area is online. That's where we've really staked our claim. We've -- and Jason and his team have had a very successful 2.5 years, and we have a season yet to complete. But this is still a fair amount of returns for us. Jason, do you have anything you want to add?","Jason Houseworth","The only other color I would add, Steve, is just that in this channel, unlike online, we really deal retailer by retailer. And so again next year, we'll look at each specific deal on a valuated basis on the profitability we can make there.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Hughes of Ascend.","Unknown Analyst","It's actually James Hellman [ph]  calling in for him. Quick question on the bank sale. How do you think about what you're going to be giving up in terms of revenue from your financial services products to the new bank JV partner versus how much you're going to keep? I imagine the more you give up to the bank partner, the more the value of the bank will be, the more -- the higher percentage of the revenues you want to keep, the lower the value of the bank.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Okay. So I'm going to provide some guidelines to how we think about this, and I shared this really back at the Investor Day as well for you all. Our objective is obviously the ongoing business here, not really a present value goal that we have in mind here. However, having said that, it's going to come down to a function of what -- which partner or partnership model we decide to go with. And because that deal, we have to figure out exactly what that looks like and then therefore the economics it would be. It's hard for us to speculate on that. What I have said about the overall economics, and you have to go product by product, you've got 3 main products: Emerald Card, the Emerald Advance and then the refund transfer. We have to think of the refund transfer, as it's fairly administrative in nature, we don't see a lot of risk in that product, and therefore, we don't believe we have to give up a lot of the economics. On the Emerald Card, it's a prepaid reloadable general purpose card. Again, we don't think there's a lot of risk, mostly with the partner what we'll be doing is administrative. And then it's really on the Emerald Advance, the lending product, where we probably have to talk about it a bit more -- about what the bank's responsibilities are and understand that. So -- but that's the smallest of the 3 products from a revenue perspective. So that's kind of where we're at in terms of what I can provide you from commentary.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And one other question, just would be thinking about ACA. For better or worse, many of your customers walk into the office, they do think of you pretty closely akin to the IRS itself. How do you manage the process so that there is not backlash against H&R Block for charging additional cost for a complexity, or even if you're not charging for ACA, that it's just a more complex, more cumbersome process? And then on the other hand, how do you deal with potential political blowback from trying to make money off of ACA when it's known that it's going to be something that at least the Democratic administration wants to go smoothly and be a big win for everyone?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I think -- if Amy wants to weigh in. So our clients -- listen, we don't have a political agenda here. Let me be crystal clear on this and crystal clear on this when I go to Capitol Hill. The Affordable Care Act was put into law. We're here to interpret the law. We do not -- our Political Action Committee gives equally to the both sides of the House and the Senate. We are not political activists in any way. This is the law of the land. Our job is to inform our clients of the potential eligibility for a subsidy. If they are eligible, we give them an indication of, based on the silver level of coverage that is currently the only pricing mechanism we know of with the Affordable Care Act, what their monthly charge will be, and if they choose not to take health care, what their potential tax penalty will be. Our clients really appreciate this. We are not pushing people into health care. We are informing our clients of the choice that they have to make. So while you are always, in this politically toxic environment, going to get social media cry or whatever, it has been very minimal. And I think the receptivity from our tax and health care review is that our clients view us as on their side, and that is our principle. That's what this company was founded on 58 years ago, and that continues to be the principle today. We're only interpreting the law and trying to service our clients as best we can.","Operator","And your final question is from Anna Shtromberg of National Australia Bank.","Anna Shtromberg","I just wanted to understand your comfort level with investment grade ratings after you spin off the bank, because you have said in the past that you didn't really need to maintain investment grade, and I just wanted to get a refresh on that.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","I think that the bank and the investment grade are kind of independent, to be honest. The bank, as a regulated entity, holds capital. It's regulated by the OCC. We have extra -- we have a very well capitalized bank at this point that's safe and sound. We've been up and running for 6-plus years now and we feel very comfortable with that. When we obviously figure out what to do with the bank, we'll be relooking at, as we always do, everything. But the broader question about investment grade is we are an investment-grade company. We, based on our current capital structure, go into the tax season, the position where we do use the commercial paper markets to fund ourselves, and that obviously requires an investment grade rating. But having said that, there are other solutions out there and we always think about what the right solution is at this point in time. But as a factual statement, we have investment grade and even through this tax season.","Anna Shtromberg","Right. And just a final question, I don't know if you have or if someone's already asked the time frame on the bank spin-off and you had already answered it, so I apologize for that. But can you just repeat if you had already answered it. What is the time frame you're looking at for the bank spin-off?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes, so we're not providing guidance on what the time line looks like at this point.","Operator","We do have one more question from the line of Joe Janssen from Barrington Research.","Joseph D. Janssen - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just thought I'd sneak one in there. Bill, historically that 2\/28 filing number is a pretty useful data point. Given the delays, you commented that you believe you're about 2 weeks behind. Any thoughts as we move through March, when you think we're at a apples-to-apples comparison, you potentially could release some data points?","William C. Cobb","I think we're going to release at the end of the season. I think this has been such a strange season that we're going to wait till the end of the season. I think Scott or somebody had asked earlier about when I think it's going to normalize. I don't know. So I don't think -- in our opinion, this is a full season business, so we'll release tax volume results at the end of April.","Operator","And, Mr. Drysdale, do you have any closing remarks?","Derek Drysdale","We just want to thank everyone for joining us today, and we'll put out our next volume results through April 15, on -- during the week of April 23. And we look forward to talking to you on Investor Relations after this call. Thank you."],"3558":["H&R Block Inc.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2019 first quarter results.","On the call today are Jeff Jones, our President and CEO; and Tony Bowen, our CFO. We\u2019ve posted today\u2019s press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Additionally, a presentation for viewing is available via the webcast and will also be posted to the Investor Relations website after this call.

During Q&A, we ask the participants to limit themselves to one question with a follow-up after which they may choose to jump back into the queue.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you, Colby. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's been about a year since I joined H&R Block, and I'm even more excited about the future of this company. The tax industry continues to grow in both the assisted and DIY channels, and we\u2019re executing a strategy to take advantage of opportunities in each plus developing new products that digitally enable human help and care, so H&R Block is available to people in any way they choose.","Of course, all of this is backed by solid cash flow and a strong financial position, allowing us to effectively balance investing for the future, while continuing to opportunistically return capital to shareholders and create long-term value.","On today's call, I want to spend time framing the opportunities we see and provide additional context for our strategy regarding the structure and evolution of the tax industry, how we're positioning H&R Block to win, and the initiatives and investments we're making in fiscal 2019. Tony will provide details on our first quarter results, which were in line with expectations, as well as additional insight into our fiscal 2019 outlook.","Let's start by talking about the industry, and why we see opportunities in both the assisted and DIY categories. The tax prep industry has enjoyed a stable and steady growth over decades. Since 2005, the industry grew on average 1% per year with assisted growing at an annual rate of 0.3% and DIY at 2.1%, and more recently the assisted category has grown two out of the last three years.","This growth has led to an increase in overall industry revenue as well which currently stands at $21 billion. And while 56% of all filings are done with the help of a tax professional, the assisted category represents the vast majority of industry revenues at approximately 87%.","A common question I've heard over the past few months is why would consumers choose assisted when low-cost technology-enabled DIY solutions make it attractive to do taxes on your own? The answer is that we continue to see the primary driver in choosing a method to be a person\u2019s confidence with taxes much more so than the complexity of their situation, their comfort level with technology, their age, changes to tax laws, or the cost to file.","A proof point is that millions of consumers who use the tax prepare to file the 1040-EZ. These filers typically have a single W-2, no dependents or deductions, and few if any credits. Taxes cannot get any simpler, yet they still seek assistance because they want to know their taxes are done right and someone is standing behind them should questions arise.","Secondary to confidence in making a decision about tax preparation is convenience in costs. The definition of convenience varies for many consumers. Some may find it most convenient to stop by an office to have their taxes prepared in person while others may find it most convenient to do their taxes themselves from the comfort of home.","For all these reasons, we continue to see sustainable demand for both Assisted and DIY, and we're excited about the opportunities in both. To this point, much of what I've discussed is focused on the two filing methods that have defined the industry for the past several decades. This binary choice is evolving as consumer expectations change. While the past industry is early in its evolution to virtual, it creates opportunities for us which I'll discuss more in a minute.","To wrap up on the industry, I'd like to spend just a minute on the recent update to the tax code and how they may impact consumers. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous tax code changes and historically they have not resulted in major swings in filing behavior.","While tax rates are lower, we don't expect people to notice much of a difference when it comes to preparing their taxes even though, no longer itemized deductions will gather the same documents they have in the past and will provide the same information to determine whether to take the standard deduction.","Many filers who take the standard deduction also qualify for various credits and that process is largely unchanged. Of course, it's hard to predict exactly how consumers will react in the upcoming tax season, and whether this will cause a change from recent filing trends.","That said, our assessment of these changes combined with historical consumer filing behaviors lead us to believe there will not be significant changes in the patterns we've seen in recent years. For these reasons, we continue to believe that the overall industry will grow 1% to 2% for tax season 2019 with assisted return flat-to-slightly up and DIY returns up 2% to 3%. Clearly there's opportunity in this industry and given our 14% market share in both the Assisted and DIY categories, we have significant runway for growth.","I\u2019d now like to provide additional details on the overarching objectives guiding our work for 2019. Starting with the Assisted business, we are focused on improving the value we deliver including an investment in price, developing and delivering on a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block to consumers, and improving the quality and consistency of our service delivery in the tax office.","In our DIY business, we will continue to invest to improve the product and user experience. We will price at a level that is competitive and provides value to our clients. And we will continue to communicate this value, growing awareness, and compelling consumers to switch to H&R Block.","And in virtual, we will innovate it as an emerging space, leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. We currently offer multiple products that combine digital technology with the unmatched scale and expertise of our Tax Pro network to ensure taxpayers can access H&R Block whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance, or anything in between.","In our DIY product, clients have access to help through live chat while preparing their return. This is something we've offered for years and it is a great way to get a question answered by an expert.","Tax Pro Review is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from knowing that one of our highly trained experts has reviewed their source document as well as their entire return to identify all available credits and deductions. At the end of the process, our Tax Pro then sign and file the returns.","Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering, addresses the need of consumers who want assistance but don't want or have time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents through the secure MyBlock portal and work virtually with the tax pro-matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed and filed by H&R Block.","Through products like Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review, we continue to be the only company to either complete or fully review a taxpayer\u2019s return virtually and then sign it, reflecting our commitment to stand behind the work and our clients. We\u2019re excited about the future of virtual and this start to how we will innovate to serve more clients in more ways.","As we outlined on our June call, we are investing in three specific areas in fiscal 2019, price, technology, and operational excellence. With respect to price, the reductions we\u2019ve discussed will be targeted to assisted consumer segments where we believe we can win. The impact of these pricing reductions is reflected in our fiscal 2019 revenue outlook as a one-time reset. We\u2019ll share more about our plans for pricing as we get closer to the tax season.","With technology, we are making investments to modernize our platform to enable more innovation and greater agility and to reduce spend over time. There are four key areas of investment. First, we\u2019re building a new tax engine which will consolidate multiple systems, creating efficiencies and eliminating unnecessary and redundant work.","Second, we're investing in cross-channel capabilities to enable a seamless client experience across platforms, something that will be key as we innovate in virtual.","Third, we're migrating our physical data centers to the cloud which is more appropriate for the seasonality of our operating model and will allow us to be more agile and reduce cost.","And fourth, we\u2019re optimizing our data architecture and analytics platform to allow for faster and deeper insight in the trend in our business. These investments are key to ensuring we achieve our long term strategic objectives and will require elevated spend over the next several years.","With respect to operational excellence, we're focused on improving the quality and consistency of service delivery in our offices. This work ranges from better execution of standard operating procedures to enhancing and differentiating the new client experience.","For our overall retention rate of 73%, our new client retention is significantly lower. Taking steps to improve the experience for new clients in order to improve retention is crucial for future growth. This work is the foundation to achieve our overall objectives of growing clients, revenue, and earnings over the long term, all of which are necessary for a successful H&R Block.","These investments are critical, and we do not intend them to result in continued margin declines in future years as we expect them to be offset by the top line growth and operating efficiency. Specifically, our expectation for long term sustainable growth includes assisted client growth including increased new client retention, continued DIY market share gain, an industry-leading position in virtual, and revenue and earnings growth over time.","In summary, we're excited for the steps we're taking in 2019. We will continue to share more details as we approach the tax season and will update you on our progress.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our first quarter financial results and outlook.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone.","Before I get into the details of our Q1 results, as a reminder, we typically report our loss during the fiscal first quarter due to seasonality of our business. Therefore, first quarter results are not representative of our full-year performance.","Starting with revenues, we saw a year-over-year increase of $7 million or 5% to $145 million. That is primarily the result of timing of revenues related to our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products, partially offset by lower revenues and refund transfer.","Turning to our expense, total operating expenses increased $4 million or 1$ to $327 million, primarily due to increased compensation and consulting expenses, which were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and bad debt expense.","Also included in operating expenses repayments of $1 million related to our footprint optimization. The revenue increase show an improvement in pretax loss and continuing operations at $6 million or 3%.","Loss per share however increased $0.10 to $0.72 due to a lower effective tax rate which negatively impacts quarter with a seasonal loss. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was in line with our outlook at 25% compared to 38% in the prior year.","Turning to discontinued operations, there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.","Moving on to capital allocation, on our June call, we announced we are returning to opportunistic share repurchase and would at a minimum repurchase enough shares to offset dilution from equity grants.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million. The average purchase price is $23.27. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach going forward.","I\u2019d now like to provide some additional context from the fiscal 2019 outlook we discussed last quarter which reflected the investments to enable our strategic objectives. Overall, we continue to expect fiscal 2019 results to be in line with the outlook we provided in June.","As a reminder, we expect total revenues to $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%. All of the revenue outlook reduction is due to our investment in price partially offset by DIY, international and franchise buybacks and also represents approximately half of the change in EBITDA from fiscal 2018.","EBITDA was further impacted by the one-time costs related to our footprint optimization of $15 million to $20 million. The majority of this amount will be recognized in the second quarter. The remainder of the reduction in EBITDA is attributable to the technology investments mentioned by Jeff as well as inflationary increases in expenses.","While much of the focus has been around margin, the midpoint of our outlook results in earnings per share at levels comparable to fiscal 2017. Essentially we are investing a benefit of lower corporate taxes back into the business with the intent to grow revenue and earnings in fiscal 2020 and beyond.","In summary, our robust cash generation and healthy balance sheet have enabled us to make these strategic investments in our business which will position us to grow clients, revenue and earnings sustainably over time.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks Tony.","I hope the initial information we shared today provides more context regarding the industry where we're headed and our financial outlook. We're focused now on our plans for the year and look forward to sharing more with you as we get closer to tax season.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions. Ian?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","You've guided to a $170 million decline in EBITDA in 2019 year-over-year at the midpoint. A portion of that decline is attributable to one time in recurring investments. Can you discuss how spending is tracking with respect to branch closures, technology investments that you\u2019ve touched on earlier, and other operational enhancements?","Jeffrey Jones","I think, overall, obviously we\u2019re only one quarter end of the year, but so far, we\u2019re obviously tracking. I think the results we reported in Q1 were in line with our expectations. Specific to the footprint optimization, we had about $1 million of that that hit in Q1. The majority of the $15 million to $20 million will hit in Q2 possibly a little bit lingering onto Q3. But for the full year, we\u2019re definitely on track to meet our outlook.","George Tong","And then as a follow-up, can you provide some preliminary thoughts around what long-term EBITDA margins may be relative to the old target of 27% to 30%?","Tony Bowen","Sure. So, obviously, the outlook we provided of 24% to 26% is specific to 2019. As we grow clients, grow revenue, we do expect EBITDA margin to improve. We don\u2019t have a specific goal at this point of trying to get back to 30%. We believe that 30% was a level that didn\u2019t show necessary investment in the business to facilitate that growth. So it's not a goal that we have in the short term, but we do expect EBITDA margin to improve as we grow revenue and clients.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","So in terms of your guidance and specifically on the revenue guidance of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, you clarified on a call that that reflects the assumption that the assisted market will grow flat to 1% in fiscal 2019. Can you talk about kind of the sensitivity to that number and kind of what gives you more confidence? Obviously, the concern is that with update to the tax code, you could see some declines there and you obviously gave some color on why you don't think that that's going to happen, but it\u2019d be helpful to understand the sensitivity to that, and if there\u2019s any kind of conservatism baked in? Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Yes. Just to clarify, the one point, I think our guidance for the assisted category was flat to slightly up. Overall category up 1 to 2 and DIY up about 2 to 3. So consistent, Thomas, with what we saw during this most recent tax season. I don\u2019t know Jeff, if you want to add to the second question.","Jeffrey Jones","The only thing I would add is that, over the last couple of years we have seen improved performance in the assisted business, and between the combination of the adjustments we make in price, the way we're thinking about our value proposition and positioning, improving operational excellence and quality. Obviously, we need to continue to improve on the momentum we've been building in assisted, and ultimately get to growth with assisted clients, and that's how we're thinking about it over 2019 and beyond.","Thomas Allen","And then, one other -- in the press release, it was impressive that Tax Identity Shield generated $4.7 million of revenue in the quarter. That's obviously a new product for you, can you help us think about the outlook there? And also the cost of that, obviously, how should we think about the overall profitability of that business?","Tony Bowen","So, that product we launched a few years ago, we have been increasing the sales. The revenue that we recognized during the quarter was largely attributable to sales that happened during the tax season. We recognized those over a 5- to 12-month period, and we added some new product features during this most recent tax season, which allowed us to recognize it pretty evenly over the 12 months versus most of it occurring during the tax season, so that's driving the majority of the changes you see in the P&L, Thomas.","The profitability like a lot of our Tax Plus product is obviously a really good margin. We don't breakout the specific margin of that product versus the others, but obviously a really good margin and attributable to the overall business.","Operator","And our next question is from a line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta","Jeff, as you look at the business this year and with the changes happening in the tax code, will your digital marketing method need to change? You've had two consistent years of marketing methods that seems to have worked. And I was wondering with the changes happening, do you need to change that?","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks for the question. Obviously, we'll have a lot more to share about exactly how we're thinking about our marketing message and plans as we get into the Q2 call. But I think for now what I would say is when we did our strategic work, one of the things we realized was our marketing messages had not been helping to differentiate H&R Block.","We had largely been marketing the category messages, and over the last few months, we've been able to get much more clear on the points of our value proposition that help consumers rethink H&R Block and understand our differentiation.","A very simple example of that is when consumers understand that this is the brand that's available year around to help them that we don't close after tax season is over. As simple as that sounds, those are the kind of really specific proof points that will be part of our marketing message because we know what helps consumers to understand the ultimate value that we provide.","As we get closer to the season, we\u2019ll have a lot more details to share about how we're thinking about positioning and how our messaging will change more broadly.","Kartik Mehta","And do you anticipate any - maybe this is too early but for the tax season, the tax - is this part of the tax season being any different this year in terms of all the changes that are being put in place or would you anticipate kind of a normal start to the season?","Jeffrey Jones","I think at this point we're not expecting any material changes. Obviously, given the significant amount of change, the IRS is working through that detail now. We're working closely with them to make sure all of those changes are flipped into our software and our training. Assuming everything goes as planned I think we would start expecting them will start to the tax season but given how much work there is to do obviously a delay is possible.","Kartik Mehta","And then just a question, you talked about buying back about 4 million shares. Is that more than the dilution that would happen. And so, have you\u2019ve gone above that and I guess with the intention to continue returning capital to shareholders in that manner?","Jeffrey Jones","It's a good question. So, yes, in June, we shared the amount that we expect to buyback off at the leasing which is about 2 million shares, but the 4 million is above that. I think it does show the opportunistic repurchases we made during the quarter and that\u2019s our plan going forward as well.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","I'd like to start asking in Do-It-Yourself specifically, with the tax code changes and you guys did address your views on itemized standard, but in Do-It-Yourself specifically, I would think that this would affect the tier level a bit. I'm just curious how you think about it. You don\u2019t have to reveal your strategy individual, but how might this impact the industry in anything else you may want to elaborate as far as how the tiers your DIY offerings will be affected then?","Tony Bowen","It\u2019s a really good question. Obviously, with the standard deduction change as well as the other tax code change, I do think you got to almost go back to the drawing board in how you price your products. And you're obviously taking that into account in our assisted business and thinking through it in DIY as well.","But one thing that\u2019s a little bit unique for us is the fact that we had H&R Block were zero last year, which essentially was pre-itemized deductions for the majority of the tax seasons, so that isn't as a big of a headwind for us, because it\u2019s maybe for some providers in the space.","But I do think you're going to see quite a few changes come out of a number of competitors to take that into account. Because historically, you did cause triggers to occur when you selected different items including itemizing and you have to take that into account for this upcoming year, so not a big of a headwind for us, but something more definitely building to our plans.","Scott Schneeberger","My second, these four categories of spend in technology \u2013 I\u2019m a slow writer and I did not catch the fourth. But if you could just recap them? And then there\u2019s two specific questions I have, so I\u2019ll ask them upfront. One, could you specify when you recap them, which you expect to be one-time in nature in fiscal 2019 and which you expect to perpetuate? And then on item number 3, which I did catch, which was switching the data centers to the cloud, are you going to AWS, are you going to a sole provider, and is there an efficiency savings you anticipate from that item 3 specifically? Thanks. That\u2019s all for me.","Jeffrey Jones","So, if I cut all the - Scott, it\u2019s Jeff. The fourth point, in our words from the prepared remarks, were optimizing our data architecture and analytics platform, essentially meaning to build more robust capabilities to assess insight and make decisions in the business faster. So that\u2019s the fourth.","All four of these are things that we believe we have to invest in over the next several years, not one time in 2019. Coming out of that spend, obviously, we think we get business benefits and also run rate benefits. But each of the four have work happening over the next several years. And I\u2019m forgetting what the\u2026","Tony Bowen","The other question was about on the cloud side specifically. So we are moving on Microsoft Azure product. And that will provide savings once we complete that migration which will take a few years to get into place. The total of all of these spend which is a multiyear roadmap, we do expect to be able to deliver lower IT spend over that period. So, once we get to the end of the road map, three to four years out, we do expect overall technology is going to be lower than it was in FY 2018 for example.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari from the Macquarie.","Mario Cortellacci","This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. You've not given me much left to ask, but maybe you could walk us through how you see the competitive environment in the DIY side change with technology? Where your investments - I think you already covered that made on the tax side but are you completely indifferent to how - to the mix shifting more towards DIY versus Assisted? And maybe you can just kind of give us some color on that?","Jeffrey Jones","This is Jeff. I\u2019ll kick it off and Tony can join in with me. But I think first of all, in the DIY space one of the observations that I had in coming here and the team was already on this path is that we've been improving and focusing on the user experience, in simplifying how easy it is to import and switch to H&R Block over the last couple of years.","And the great evidence for me was our third-party reviews continue to get better and better of people understanding that we're building a very competitive product in the marketplace. And we believe we have to keep doing that. We also know we have a very competitive price and that value proposition is working because we're growing share. We understand we have about 65% awareness that we're even in the DIY space.","And so we'll continue to aggressively market really like a challenger brand but we are in the DIY business and we believe that we have a right to be very competitive there and you\u2019ll see us do that. But take one step back, what we're really starting to build is an ecosystem of help. And so, for those consumers that want complete help, they don't have confidence. We think our office should be the best solution for them; obviously, DIY on the other end.","But then the three current products in the middle of that continuum from live chat, to Tax Pro Review, that Tax Pro Go really represent our belief that we have to let our expertise available on the terms what our clients want. And while it's early in that virtual space we were still getting great feedback from consumers who were using the products.","And we're seeing new consumers come to H&R Block in our virtual products that weren't previously choosing another method. And so, that's why we're so excited about the entire ecosystem of being able to deliver for client.","Tony Bowen","And then, specific to your mix shift. I mean, obviously and we were focused on overall charge in the margin and we're able to deliver across segments. Assisted is obviously higher than DIY but we have a lot of DIY clients that actually have a higher charge and higher margin than some assisted clients.","But at the end of the day, we're focused on building the best experience that we can for any client and letting them choose the method that works best for them, and that's really how we're thinking about going forward.","Mario Cortellacci","And I know you guys are keeping your pricing strategy close to the vest for competitive purposes, but maybe you can walk us through how discussions are going so far? We know you're going to be lowering prices in assisted and maybe you can kind of give us an idea of what the DIY pricing could be? Or what that looks like versus competitors this year?","Tony Bowen","I mean, in assisted, we've obviously made a lot of progress this summer, more details to come. We\u2019re definitely going to be lowering price for targeted consumer on that side of the business. In DIY, obviously, we have to wait and see what some of the competitors will be doing. But, as Jeff said in his opening comments, our goal is to be competitively priced in that product. Making sure that we're building a great product, growing awareness, but we definitely want price to be a key attribute that helps clients use H&R Block.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital.","Jeff Silber","Just following up with the question - earlier question about some of the investment in the business. I think the question with the impact longer term, I'm just curious, are any of the investments you're making that\u2019s going to be helping you out in the current tax season?","Jeffrey Jones","Well, there is - yes, is the simple answer. We didn't highlight the natural investments we would make year-over-year in improving quality of delivery, in terms of the product improvements we're making in DIY. And those are things that we believe have the potential to impact the business this year.","The big investment in price, we believe is really - probably the most important revenue this year. And obviously, the way we\u2019ll communicate that, exactly how we change price. We feel, we\u2019ll be sharing later, but I think several things for this year and with price being at the top of the list.","Jeff Silber","And then, I know you had mentioned in terms of the timing of some of the cost, the onetime cost on the footprint. Where there any onetime cost that you incurred in the first quarter besides the small one you had mentioned earlier about the footprint?","Jeffrey Jones","Nothing that\u2019s material that we would call out. Obviously, always a small asset write-offs or something else but nothing that\u2019s material that would impact the overall results. I mean the fact that overall expenses only grew 1%. Obviously, we\u2019re pleased with how the quarter came out.","Jeff Silber","And again nothing else from a seasonal expectation out of the ordinary expect the $15 million to $20 million that you called out?","Jeffrey Jones","As far as the rest of the season, no.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Millman from Millman Research.","Michael Millman","I think I missed - did you say you expect EPS to be flat this year flat with last - with 2017? And cover a lot of things, could you comment on what you're doing with EZ? Is that still a free product? And then sort of longer term question, is all the work that you're doing so that people can do their taxes sitting at home going to leave some of those people say, Geez, if I could sit at home and ask question and I sit at home and just do it yourself, myself instead of spending $150, spend $50?","Tony Bowen","So, your first question I'll let Jeff definitely chime in on this was the earnings per share question. What we were alluding to Michael is, if you look at essentially the EPS consensus number and you take the midpoint of our outlook as well as our EBITDA margin and tax effect, it approximates FY 2017 EPS.","So, we're not providing the guidance we\u2019re just doing a reference point to say that it's in the zone of FY 2017 which is trying to highlight the point that we're essentially taking the corporate tax benefit that we received on a run rate basis and investing it back into the business and just trying to highlight that it's a broader story than just EBITDA margin because you have to go all the way to the bottom of the P&L.","Specific to EZ, obviously with the single 1040 that the IRS announced and has been working on changes, changes that a little bit. We'll share additional details on our second quarter calls for specific promotions and how we're thinking about it for the upcoming season.","But we definitely know that we need - promotions will be a key part of our portfolio and how we drive traffic. But obviously the 1040-EZ Form is being eliminated, so, some more changes to come there.","And then - sorry, Jeff's going to take. And then the third one, we hear question more about our tax preparers working from home or individual clients.","Michael Millman","My question is, are you training individuals to be able to do it more and more do it themselves because they don't have to come to the office. There's - I guess some of the questions answered this year so, next year they have less questions and on and on.","Jeffrey Jones","Michael, it\u2019s Jeff. So I\u2019ll start off. I mean, obviously, what we're talking about is just how consumer behavior shifts over time. And consumers' has had options to do taxes themselves at home for years already.","As it relates to method type, we believe we have to have competitive products however the consumer wants to be served which I why we'll invest in DIY. But we're also investing, insuring or capturing our fair share of growth in the Assisted business.","And when you just think about the debate that happens about simplicity or complexity, one of the things that we know over recent history is that the vast majority of taxpayers already take the standard deduction. And the vast majority of those taxpayers use assisted to get help.","So when you take everything into account, the history of method shift over time, tax changes over time, we see consumer from consumer research that our own research and third party research, we know consumers are confused about taxes going into the year.","So our belief is that in the near term, we don't see big shifts in method type. And over the longer term, we think we have to be positioned to serve clients however they want to be served. And that's why we're focused on this continuum of help from DIY to Assisted and products in between.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Howe from Barrington Research.","Chris Howe","Most of my questions have been taken, sitting in for Alex Paris. And I just had a question around just last tax season. Maybe some of the takeaways or learning that you had this would be kind of outside of the box, as far as the mobile and desktop offerings. Were there any findings, surprises, lost opportunities that perhaps could be filled through improved functionality at this upcoming tax season?","Jeffrey Jones","This is Jeff. I\u2019ll start off obviously with my first tax season here and so just to see things through some fresh eyes maybe I mean, on the positive side, again, seeing our performance in the DIY space and realizing this was a good product and a good value proposition and actively marketed, we could grow share, we need to do more of that. On the other side, I think one of our biggest opportunities is in new client retention.","It\u2019s clearly an area where our overall retention has moved several hundred basis points over the last few years, so we know we can improve it. But in client retention is just a lot lower and so we're focusing on plans this year to how to really attack those new clients to come to us for the first time. We know that we can get it back at second and third year they become much stickier and so that's an example of something that I just thought this year that I know we have to be able to improve.","Chris Howe","You answered two of my questions with that response. Thank you for that. And you probably already highlighted this but I just wanted to make sure. as far as your marketing mix and I'm guessing that will be sharing more when you provide further guidance into the future. But how would you assess your mix for digital versus television and how can you - what are some plans that are maybe in place moving forward to optimize and leverage your marketing spend?","Jeffrey Jones","So as it relates to the mix, I shared when I first arrived that I saw more opportunity for us to get kind of far more granular in terms of how we thought about acquisition of clients, engagement of clients, retention of clients what I would broadly put in the category of performance marketing and CRM. Television still plays a role for the business. It will continue to play a role for the business.","But when you think about channel performance and cost per acquisition and just getting more and more focused on some of those metrics, we've brought in a new CMO who\u2019s been working hard getting ready for the season to ensure we have those kind of capabilities.","So, again a lot more as we get into the Q2 call on positioning and overall messaging, but I think what we're really focused now is on how we get out a very customer first level in terms of acquisition and performance marketing.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions. I'll now turn it back to the presenters.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks everyone for joining us. This concludes today's call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude H&R Block's first quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2015 results. Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO; Jason Houseworth, President-Global Digital & Product Management; and Mark Ciaramitaro, Vice President, Health Care will be available during the Q&A session.","In connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website, at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws.

H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Colby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we announced our results for the fiscal 2015 third quarter, which ended January 31. The IRS opened e-file earlier this January than it did last year, which allowed us to recognize additional revenue in the third quarter compared to last year's quarter. Of course, because of the seasonality of our business, our third quarter results are not indicative of our expected full-year performance.","Greg will provide more details on our fiscal third quarter later during this call. As has become the norm in our industry, the tax season is off to an interesting start. We entered this season with the Affordable Care Act featured prominently in the news. This soon gave way to market disruptions in the DIY category, due to pricing actions taken by our competitor.","Finally, industry-wide DIY tax fraud, which we have been discussing for some time, became a key focus this season. With our top competitor in the DIY space, saying they're seeing as much as a 3,700% increase in DIY fraud related to tax refunds in some states.","I'd like to spend the next several minutes talking about what we've seen in the industry this year, specifically focusing on the Affordable Care Act and fraud, and then I'll provide some thoughts on our performance.","Let's start with the ACA, which represents the largest change in the U.S. tax code in decades. Our clients are feeling the impact and they have a lot of questions and at times are confused. Many have been required to complete additional forms or worksheets.","As we released on February 24, our analysis shows that 52% of those that obtained health insurance via the state or federal marketplaces underestimated their annual income and are having their refunds reduced by an average of 17% or $530. Conversely, roughly a third overestimated their income and are having their refunds increased by $365 on average. Overall, the average impact has been a refund reduction of 8% or $141.","Our analysis further shows that the penalty for uninsured filers is averaging $172 or almost double the $95 penalty many taxpayers anticipated. Consumer behavior will likely shift in future years as the penalties for non-compliance continue to climb, motivating more people to purchase insurance through exchanges.","Early data from the Department of Health and Human Services indicates that over 11 million people signed up for healthcare insurance through the exchanges this year and increased from seven million enrollees the year before. This is an area, in which we have a great opportunity to assist our clients with their needs and we believe this opportunity will continue to grow over the next several years.","Specific to this tax season, the proportion of our clients who have been directly impacted by the ACA has thus far been lower than our expectations. We entered this year expecting the ACA to impact the first half of the season at a greater rate, but we are now seeing results that suggest ACA impacted clients will be more evenly distributed throughout the season and possibly more heavily-weighted toward the second half.","This is in part due to the delays in forms mailings by the federal and state exchanges, which is likely pushing filings from the early part of the season to the later part. In fact, the HHS announced in late February that 90% to 95% of marketplace participants who had received incorrect 1095-A forms had yet to file their taxes.","I'd like to provide one final thought related to the ACA. I'd be remiss, if I didn't mention the tireless efforts of our associates in tax pros who are providing best-in-class service to our clients impacted by these changes. We've invested over 600,000 hours of ACA-related training for our tax professionals and it's showing in the quality service we're providing.","Based on our channel checks, we are distinguishing ourselves as the ACA experts in the tax preparation industry. And while there's still lot of season left, we're pleased with our efforts to-date and we will continue to help our clients navigate the tax complexity introduced by this law.","I'd now like to take some time to talk about an issue that has finally received a lot of attention this season, tax fraud. As I noted in my open letter published in The New York Times on February 17, fraud in our industry continues to be a significant and growing concern to which no taxpayer is immune, government agencies put the total annual tax identity theft losses at greater than $5 billion, with nearly two million suspected identity theft incidents in 2013; that's up from just 440,000 incidents in 2010, which represents an increase of over 350% or 1.5 million in just three years. And what was once an issue focused at the federal level has now extended into the state level, as evidenced by our largest competitor having to shut down their state e-filings during the height of the DIY tax season to evaluate state level fraud exposure.","Another problem cited by the Treasury Department is improper Earned Income Tax Credit payments, which totaled $16 billion and $19 billion annually, up from estimates of $13 billion to $15 billion. Inconsistent EITC return standards have moved the issue out of the assisted tax space and into the DIY channel contributing to a material change in EITC taxpayer behaviors, which I will discuss later.","Fraud is not a new issue for the industry and H&R Block has been at the forefront of the battle against fraud for years. We have collaborated with the EITC software development work group at the IRS since early 2013 to develop fraud screening parity between assisted and digital tax prep.","Last year, we brought together tax policy and consumer advocate thought leaders at a forum in Washington, D.C. to discuss this very problem and to announce the findings of our survey regarding consumer awareness and attitudes toward tax fraud.","I have testified before the Senate Finance Committee and met with numerous members of both the House and Senate regarding EITC and the need for professional standards for tax preparers. Our efforts are producing results.","Late last year on December 16, Congress directed the Treasury Department to implement consistent requirements across all tax preparation methods for taxpayers applying for credit such as the EITC. Now Treasury needs to implement the requirements in time for tax season 2016, which I'll address shortly.","I have issued a call to action to the IRS and my colleagues within the tax preparation industry to come together to create solutions to these problems. Recently, IRS Commissioner Koskinen announced that he will convene a meeting to facilitate this discussion. There are both long-term and short-term solutions to consider, but two immediate actions should be taken to minimize the potential for fraud.","First, there must be minimum federal competency standards for all tax preparers. As you've heard me say before, all 50 states imposed licensing requirements for cutting hair, but currently there are no federal standards on competency applicable to all paid tax preparers and only four states have such standards. This isn't about simply creating another category of professionals; it's about empowering and protecting the 60% of consumers who get help with their taxes every year.","Second, we need to address this $16 billion to $19 billion of annual improper payments related to the Earned Income Tax Credit. Having different standards for different methods of tax return preparation is encouraging fraudulent behavior in the DIY channel.","Since 2008, when the inconsistent standards came into play, there has been a 14-point increase in the proportion of EITC filers using do-it-yourself preparation methods from 28% then to 42% in 2014. During this same period, the broader markets filing patterns did not change materially.","Considering that 20% of all tax returns include the EITC, a shift of this magnitude has a significant impact on improper payments in the overall industry. This move from assisted to DIY allows the taxpayer to avoid having to answer up to 27 additional questions on a separate tax form to determine EITC eligibility.","Additionally, assisted tax preparers are now personally liable for properly completing the additional EITC form. This has resulted in fraudulent tax preparers acting as ghost writers, by completing taxes for their clients on a DIY platform without the preparer signing the return.","As I mentioned earlier on December 16, Congress directed the Treasury Department to implement consistent standards for these credits by saying the following.","\"In an effort to reduce intentional fraud and filing errors in refundable credit programs intended to help taxpayers, the Department of the Treasury is directed to ensure that the same questions are being asked of taxpayers whether they are preparing their returns with a paid tax preparer or via do-it-yourself methods such as paper forms, preparation software, or online preparation tools. Implementing uniform questions for refundable credit filers is a common sense step that will help alleviate confusion over eligibility and better establish qualifications for these credits.\" That sounds pretty clear to me. We agree with Congress that this is common sense.","In contrast, the largest competitor in the DIY space has said that consistent standards present taxpayers with \"compliance burden.\" It is both ridiculous and self-serving to suggest that requiring consistent fraud screens, to fix the $16 billion to $19 billion problem is too great of a burden to bear. It is also ridiculous that one group of taxpayers should have to answer a series of up to 27 questions to obtain the credit, while another group is not held to the same standard. This is crucial to protect the people eligible for the credit and to prevent fraudsters from abusing the system at the expense of those that needed most.","As these consistent standards have yet to be implemented by the Treasury Department, we will continue to advocate for such standards, and for Treasury to develop and implement a plan in time for tax season 2016.","As I said earlier, we've been leading the fight against tax fraud for some time. And it's clear that taxpayers are ready for change, as 93% of those surveyed by H&R Block are willing to do more to help combat fraud. Additionally, as long as tax fraud is allowed to persist, it will be difficult to get a true read on the overall industry and as such, its impact on our results.","H&R Block will continue to lead the charge against tax return fraud, and I urge my fellow industry leaders to join me in this fight. Our message has been and is clear. As an industry, we need to do the right thing.","Given that industry overview, I'd now like to talk about our early season results. To be clear, I am disappointed in our first half assisted volume. While we do not anticipate fully making up this loss of assisted returns and share in the second half of the season, we have reason to look forward to a stronger second half.","Filing patterns within our client base, as well as changes within the industry, suggest we are seeing a shift in the timing of our business. Consistent with the past two years, our assisted filers are moving out of the traditional first peak and shifting toward a more delayed filing schedule. Part of this is likely due to the speed of refund processing by the IRS and state governments. While it used to take months to receive your refund after filing your taxes, you may now receive your money in as little as eight days. Additionally, part of this is likely due to delays related to the ACA that I mentioned earlier.","Despite this shift, we continue to experience success in our Tax Plus strategy to drive revenue through improved monetization and product attach. By focusing on the optimal return mix with strong product attach rates, we are seeing positive financial results despite a significant decline in assisted unit counts to-date.","Unit count is not the sole determinant of success in this industry. We have learned over the years that giving away our product to drive client count without regard for profitability doesn't work. There is a significant portion of taxpayers who are solely motivated by cost and thus are not loyal. This means that monetizing these clients in the long run often doesn't happen, no matter which channel, assisted or DIY, they use to prepare their taxes.","In addition to the timing shift, the lower assisted volume stems from our decision to discontinue unprofitable promotions in prior years and the migration to DIY as a result of fraud. Consistent with last year, assisted return to clients have been greater in lower value returns, as we continue to focus our efforts on those returns that contribute most significantly to the bottom line.","Our 50% off promotion is targeting just those types of returns, as it is designed to attract more complex, higher value returns at a time when our offices historically have had available capacity.","On the digital side, I'm very pleased with all aspects of our business, our product performance, the client experience, our pricing, our marketing campaigns, and our results. Revenues are up, and we have increased unit sales from the prior year in both our desktop and online products. Our multi-year effort to enhance our product and improve the client experience is yielding positive results. Providing our clients with a fully responsive personalized experience is driving an improvement in client satisfaction, which ultimately translates to the top line.","Online e-files are up 7.2%, and desktop is up 5%, as we are benefiting from competitors' pricing decisions and from well-targeted promotions. Overall unit growth for digital is up 6.7% from last year; and even more importantly, our mix of paid versus free returns has dramatically improved.","Our Tax Plus products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. Our newest product, Tax Identity Shield, is an innovative product that offers our clients tax identity theft protection and support. Given the significant increase in tax identity theft, it is a timely offering that provides our customers the added comfort of knowing that they have protection and support, and is an example of H&R Block's innovation and knowledge of the tax industry. And for the second consecutive year, our Emerald Card has been rated as one of the top three prepaid debit cards in the market by a leading consumer advocacy publication.","To summarize, we've invested more than anyone in this industry in the ACA, we continue to lead the charge in the fight against tax fraud, and I believe our value proposition is the best in the industry.","Considering all the factors I've discussed today, we won't have a full understanding of the tax season until after April 15. The season so far has been challenging, but we have reason to look forward to a stronger second half. We intend to stay fully focused on serving our clients however they want to be served, whether by coming to our offices to get assistance from our experienced tax professionals or through our best-in-class digital offerings.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss the fiscal third quarter financial results.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. As a reminder, given the seasonality of our business and the fact that the significant majority of our revenue and all of our earnings come in the fourth quarter, our third quarter results generally are not indicative of the results we expect to achieve for the full-year.","As Bill mentioned, the IRS opened e-file earlier this year than in 2014. Because we recognized tax preparation fees when completed returns are filed with the IRS, we recognized an additional 11 days in revenue in the third quarter fiscal 2015.","Overall, revenues for the quarter were $509 million, representing an increase of $309 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Net loss from continuing operations was $35 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $213 million, or $0.78 per share, in the prior year.","For the full fiscal year, we continue to target adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 30%. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity. Cash and customer banking deposit balances were significantly higher at the end of the third quarter this year due to the earlier funding of refunds by the IRS.","The total unrestricted cash balance was $1.3 billion and total outstanding debt was $1.1 billion, which includes $591 million in commercial paper borrowings. And as a reminder, we repaid a $400 million note in October 2014, leaving us with $500 million in senior notes as of January 31. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 to be at the lower end of the range provided at our Investor Day in December of 35.5% to 36.5%.","Turning to our segment results; tax services revenues increased $309 million to $503 million as a result of the earlier e-filing opening date. Consistent with expectations, total operating expenses increased $62 million to $571 million. The increase is due to variable costs associated with tax return preparation, expenses related to acquired franchise operations, increased training costs related to both the ACA and our new tax preparation software and increased marketing. Additionally, depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the franchise buybacks we discussed at our Investor Conference on December the 9.","As a reminder, we stated that we were looking to reacquire a portion of the 650 offices sold to franchises several years ago. This fiscal year, we purchased 341 of those locations for approximately $100 million. In addition, we have spent approximately $12 million in other acquisitions, primarily of independent tax preparers.","Going forward, we will continue to evaluate potential franchise buybacks and independent targets. However, we do not expect the overall mix of company run versus franchise locations to change materially. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization expenses of $160 million to $170 million for the fiscal year 2015. Including this is amortization expense related to these acquisitions of $14 million with an annualized rate of $19 million for the fiscal year 2016.","In our corporate segment, our pre-tax loss decreased $10 million to $15 million, mainly due to decreased interest expense as a result of the repayment of the $400 million note in October of 2014, reduced legal and consulting fees also contributed to reduction in expenses.","Turning to discontinued operations; the net loss from discontinued operations was $2 million. During the third quarter, Sand Canyon entered into a settlement agreement with the counterparty related to its representation and warranty obligations. The settlement amount was fully covered by prior accrual and was paid in the fiscal third quarter. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses relating to representation and warranty claims totaled $144 million, as of January 31.","Sand Canyon continues to engage in constructive settlement discussions with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claim. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing argument.","Lastly, turning to H&R Block Bank, we continue to work with BofI and our regulators and believe in its merit this transaction should be approved. We will continue to provide updates as we make progress.","We've covered a lot in today's call, so we'll now turn it over to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, Greg and Bill.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","If you look at the early season, Bill, is there any reason that you can come up with why maybe your volumes are falling behind the IRS numbers? Have you come across something that you think is the primary catalyst for this?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we said, I think, in the press release, we do think there is a delay. The IRS released some numbers earlier today; and with the overall industry, total returns is down 0.6%, at the same time last year it was up 1.4%. So, you have right there just year-on-year a two-point shift.","And we're seeing this certainly in our offices, where it seems like clients are coming in later, whether it's form delays or whatever. The ACA confusion, form delays, form errors has also contributed this. I think we have had a carry-over effect from a retention spiral from kind of getting away from the free EZ, we had an impact last year, I think, there is a carry-over impact this year.","And frankly, so, I spent a long time on this, until EITC filers are generally early season filers, until we get consistent standards that shift, that migration away from paid preparers, having to answer 27 questions and verify a bunch of information, open season is going to contribute to that shift.","So, I don't have one thing that is contributed to it, I mean, obviously, as I said in my comments, I'm disappointed, but there are some factors that I think point to, if you will, beyond our control, but we are working very hard. And I do think we have a lot of reasons to have a positive outlook for the remainder of this season.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","And I do want to add a caution onto that statement. I think it's very misleading and difficult, and I shared this with you all before. I think the unit count numbers can be misunderstood pretty easily, mix matters very much in this industry. And so, we're as much focused on units as we are mix. And also there's still a lot of season to go here. So, the IRS headline today is three of five filers still have to file for the rest of the year. So, those are my thoughts as well.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And so, I know this is difficult this time around, because of what happened last year with the delay in filing, but looking at the revenue mix you talked about last year and trying to normalize revenue this year versus last year, you have been very good about getting pricing and obviously that ancillary products have helped you there.","And if I did my math right, it seems like it could be \u2013 pricing is probably in the high single-digits, maybe even low double-digits. Is that accurate? And would you be able to sustain that type of pricing, because of mix and ancillary products are going into the rest of the tax season?","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","So, I'm not going to obviously comment on your math, Kartik, what we have said generally, as we know we got pricing power in this industry and we would typically say that somewhere north of the rate of inflation, there's no reason to not think that's true for us this year.","The other thing specifically for 2015 tax season for 2014 is the implementation of ACA. So, part of our pricing strategy going into this season, obviously had to include the value and the costs that we're incurring for our clients to deliver the service and we're going to charge for that this year. And so far, we've been very pleased with the results there. Other than that, we're not going to give specific pricing thoughts until really post season.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, just one last question, Bill. I think I just want to make sure I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks. Did you say that because of where you are in terms of client count, it would be difficult to make that up? So, therefore, difficult to get the kind of flat or positive client count? Or do you think that's still possible since we have a significant amount of the tax season still left?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. What I said was I think it'll be difficult to fully recover that number of clients, I do think we will. I think there are a lot of our clients still to come in, I think that's consistent with what we've seen in the past, where generally we'll start-off softer than others in the beginning of the year. But, in terms of whether we are able to crawl all the way back, I don't think we'll be able to do that, but I think we're going to have a much stronger second half.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Perfect. Thank you very much.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Kartik.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So, what proportion of your customers ended up having to, so far year-to-date, season-to-date, have had to either fill out a new form because of the Affordable Care Act? Or have to move up from a more simple form to a more complicated form, because of the changes to healthcare this year?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, I don't think, Gil, we're going to give specific numbers on forms et cetera. I would say that what Mark had talked about at Investor Day, we anticipated about 25% of our clients would be impacted. The numbers we have seen so far indicate that we are under that number.","At this point in the season as Greg just cautioned, I think we are waiting to see this all play out, because of some of the externalities that you've heard about; but in terms of any form shifts, we're not going to get into that right now. But, Mark, is there anything you want add to that?","Mark Ciaramitaro - Vice President, Health Care","Well. I will say as we anticipated, many of our clients and consumers, in general, are really feeling the full effects of the Affordable Care Act this year and we're seeing that obviously have some impact on their filing behavior we believe and they're confronting a new level of complexity.","And as Bill mentioned, some of those clients are actually seeing surprises in terms of their refund behavior or the refund effects, but we've always said this is a long-term proposition. We believe, many clients will be impacted this year. They are on the learning curve. Many more clients would be impacted next year, frankly, on the basis of the enrollment numbers we've seen. So, we're going to see the rest of this year play out, but this is really a long-term impact that would just \u2013 at the front end I've seen.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't think we've talked about that before, I think Greg has continually cautioned against this. Next year, you won't just be able to self-attest if you have insurance, so there are changes that are coming.","And when you go into something like this, where the intersection of something like the Affordable Care Act with taxes seems so counter-intuitive to so many consumers and the awareness was low. We're seeing a little bit of that play out. I think if things get more comfortable, they might be in more, if you will, normal patterns; but right now, I'm not sure I could predict what a normal pattern is anymore on the assisted side. So, we'll see how this plays out.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And then, in terms of fraud, which has really taken off this year. And as you pointed out, it sounds like it's less of an issue for you than some of your competitors. What are you doing in terms of the specific measures? Are you introducing multifactor authentication? Do you plan to do that? Do you plan to maintain the bundling of state and federal to prevent state filing-specific fraud? How are you handling, what you're seeing from your competitors in terms of your policies and technology for handling fraud?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'm going to let Jason get in there. I would say one thing Gil is that for any CEO, this is a paramount importance, the whole area of cyber security, we're fighting against a number of bad guys here, this has been of high concern. I think we've talked about this frankly, I think, I said at our Investor Day, we're kind of a lone voice here although, there are a lot more voices here. But, why don't we talk about the specifics that we do, Jason if you could take that?","Jason L. Houseworth - President-Global Digital & Product Management","Sure. Thanks, Gil. So, what I would say first is that Intuit is really late joining this conversation, we had a number of fraud filters in place for multiple years. First, we have multifactor authentication within our log-in process and that's been in place since 2011.","Our password strength for our online accounts has some of the strongest requirements in the industry and we do not allow unlinked returns to be filed to states. That is to say that we actually require an accepted federal e-file before we even send or file the state return. And, as we previously indicated, our internal fraud monitoring team has not seen any unusual fraud activity this tax season.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And, we think that ultimately those points are really key. I think what happened this year was, by not waiting until the federal return was accepted by the IRS, which has the strongest fraud filters. It's hard for any individual state to match the power of the IRS. So, that's why we had put this policy in-place that we wanted an accepted return by the IRS before we have filed the statement. I think that's where the fraudsters crack the code.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Hi, guys. So, at your Investor Day, you stated that you expected industry-assisted volumes to grow 0% to 1% and digital to grow 4% to 5%. Could you just update us on your thinking now? Thanks.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think we're trying to figure that out, frankly, Thomas. I do think that the digital number, the number that came out today, which will probably fall over time, but it was roughly 6% for the total digital business; paper returns, according to today's numbers, were down 13%. And right now, assisted is down 4.4%; that will improve over time, that's been the history here.","We still believe that the overall industry will grow 1.5% or in that range. But, when you're down 0.6% and you're more than 40% of the way through, you're a little bit questioning that. But, we believe that, with the delay \u2013 all the stuff that's happened, generally people still have to file in this industry, and I believe it's going to be a much stronger second half.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, can you just touch on the competitive environment? You wrote about it in your prepared remarks and obviously, there's been a lot of talk around pricing adjustments and marketing. So, can you talk about how you feel the environment is?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's always very competitive out there. There is a lot of factors in the industry; obviously, on the digital side, the launch of the free product by Turbo, going after the low end, hadn't \u2013 drove there. The number of filings they had, I don't know if we ever fully figured out how of many those were due to that and due to fraud.","I think we had a very competitive offering, certainly the digital phase with the program Jason put together with the 999 program, certainly, we were really pleased with the marketing there. We're really pleased with how that new product is working.","On the assisted side, there were some things done in terms of some cash giveaways, and then add that to the price that were done out there. (36:19) We're still trying to assess the impact on that. And some RAL behavior that we'll have to see how that all plays out. So, it's been a highly competitive start to the season, coupled with delays for \u2013 consumer delays. So, it's a little hard to read and that's why, we'll say this 14 more times, probably, on this call. We got to wait and see how everything plays out.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just a short question on specifics of your business. So you guys talked about how you bought a number of franchisees. But then, when we look at your return volumes, your franchisee volumes are better than your company-owned stores. Why is that?","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","The table that we released actually adjusts for that factor in there. So, we've reclassified what would have been franchise last year into company to make it more apples-to-apples, Thomas.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. And so, well, that explains most of it. But, should we expect the franchisees to outperform the company-owned stores through the season, after adjusted, or not?","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Historically, we're never (37:31) pretty close on both of them...","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","We have no reason to believe that's not true this year.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys. It's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. I just had a question on the legislation to potentially give the IRS authority to regulate preparers. Have you heard any progress on that front? And with the recent news of fraud and some of the attention there, has that shifted maybe some of the regulatory momentum to more standardized requirements for DIY versus assisted? Any comments that you have there? Thanks.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, here is what I would say. Obviously, you got two different issues, the EITC issue, Congress has already directed the Treasury Department to implement the consistent standards, it's a matter of the Treasury Department doing it. In terms of return preparer, that has to go the other way, which is Congress has to now initiate that as a law. We are working hard at that.","I think frankly, there is a lot of talk. We're certainly, with our government relations team, working very closely with a lot of aspects of government that the tax fraud that has come up here. The amount of dollars that are being doled out in losses and improper payments. I think that there are certainly a lot more awareness around this, which we hope will add to the effort around finally getting competency standards nationally. We're very active at the federal level. We're also working at the state level to try to increase the number of states who require competency and licensing.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","And importantly this season, two states have now introduced return preparer standards, New York State being the primary one of those, and there is several other states that we would think are likely to have them in place for next year.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thanks. And if I could tack one on, on the pricing side. I know there's been some confusion around ACA forms, but from what you've seen so far, are you seeing, based on your expectations or what you're planning for, are you still seeing any pricing lift from ACA overall, in general? Thanks.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","So, just as a matter of policy, don't talk at form level pricing, it's just not something we do. Having said that, we did, going into this season, spend a lot of time and a lot of money getting our people ready, and our systems ready, to help our clients through this very difficult transaction. And we've added value to their lives, and we're going to charge for that.","So certainly we've got our pricing strategy around ACA, it really is going to be dependent on your situation frankly, what price you'll pay, and it's a bit more complex than just a simple number, but the kind of takeaway I would say thus far is, we're actually very pleased with the price value equation and so are our clients.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good afternoon. Greg, I'm going to follow on that one. I know you don't speak specifically on forms, but it sounds like you are pleased with what you're seeing, particularly in mix, I'd say, across the board. Were there any significant rate increases, excluding ACA from the conversation, this year, year-over-year, on any forms in the store front area?","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","The way we price is really based on bundle experiences. And so, a bundle would be a typical client experience that covers a large number of people from one year to the next. So, the reason I'm sharing that with you is, there'll always be unfortunately some exceptions where a person's circumstances are so unique that they get caught up in just the way that bundle gets priced out.","But, in general, we have been very thoughtful about price sticker shock. If someone, for example, went from a 1040EZ, because they have ACA forms would automatically have to go to a 1040A or 1040 form type. That was something that we certainly factored in, because we obviously are looking to have a long-term relationship, not a one-year relationship with these clients.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. Bill, one for you. This is going to be, I think, the first that you mentioned; you're going to get this 13 more times. And I already know the answer, but I'm asking it nonetheless. There are multiple reasons that you listed in the press release and then you added on this call, fraud as a potential reason that we saw more DIY as opposed to assisted in the early part of the season.","My question specifically is, of the \u2013 I count five or six reasons that you put out there vocally or in print. I know what the answer is, it's too early to tell. But, in your personal opinion, what would you rank as the top three ideally in descending order, if possible?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think, all right, I'll take a shot at it. I'll answer your answer and say we're going to wait and see. However, I do think that the delay, the stats the IRS put out today. And as I said there clearly appears to be a shift of consumer behavior, later in the season. So, when you have a two-point swing year-over-year that certainly speaks to delay.","I think the second piece is, there is really two fraud issues broadly. There is all the DIY fraud, I spoke about earlier. There's also, with the IRS saying things like their budget cutbacks, they can't do as many audits, we continue to see and as we've been very active in the A&D space, the amount of fraud done by independents is startling and that's why the return preparer is so important, because we think that getting people who have to take a competency exam and be licensed and sign the return is critically important.","And then the third piece I'd say is, around all the externalities around ACA. Now that is not the quantitative answer that you might \u2013 but if you just ask my opinion, I would say those are the three.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks, And I appreciate that. And that is what I was looking for. One follow-up on point two that you just mentioned, you are trailing the IRS, the industry year-to-date on professionally prepared, and obviously, there's a lot of ground to make up. You just mentioned that you're seeing a lot of fraud in professionally prepared among the mom and pops. Is that something that you think will be a pressure in the back half, where you may not narrow the gap of yourself and the industry or even turn it to the other side? Or is that more of an early season phenomena that will dissipate here in the back half?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Generally, it's been an early \u2013 the history, it's been an early season impact, but we'll have to wait and see.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","A lot of it's surrounding Earned Income Credit filers and they tend to be early season filers.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a couple of more, if I can, going around in other areas. You put out a press release with regard to Canada looking more aggressive with your do-it-yourself product. I'm curious since your strategy last year and continue this year at least in the U.S. is to pursue revenue, and that's the primary focus and all the entails, it feels like you're taking almost a counter strategy in Canada, just curious so, what the thinking is there? Thanks.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Each country that we operate in, has a unique strategy, of course, tied to the overall company mission here, but Canada situation is much different than the U.S. There, we had no presence to speak of in the DIY space at all. And Intuit is the largest market participant there. And we think that's going to have to change and we're prepared to be in that for many years to think what we want to do is win our fair share and we're prepared to spend the money to get there.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And the follow-up there, it looks like I can't come to any way that you're going to be monetizing with perhaps a cross-sell or anything that strategy this year. And I think your answer also suggests, it's longer term. Is that true? It's not a this-year impact, it's more down the line?","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","It was a multi-year strategy that we've embarked upon and we're prepared to, as I said, funded during that timeframe, but I will just tell you in the grand scheme of thing, it's not a material number for most shareholders.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. And then, battening up cleanup, I want to sneak one or two more in. The $50 million reduction in the loan loss reserve, and clearly there was some settlement, but clearly there's an existing amount on the loan loss reserve in Sand Canyon, so it's not all settled. Greg, can you share a little bit more about what occurred, why it wasn't a complete settlement? It sounds very productive and good. Kind of curious, why partial?","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Just to clarify, I know you have this, Scott, but these are reserves for representation and warranty claims, not loan losses as such. But, in the last quarter, third quarter of this fiscal year, Sand Canyon did enter into a specific settlement agreement with the counterparty and that was fully reserved for. And the reserve itself moved down by $50 million, which was a fairly material number and was paid out during that quarter. So, I think that's good progress.","The reserve itself is also supported by other claimants that Sand Canyon is engaged in having productive conversations. I know that many people would like to get better clarity and the timeline. But, the reality is, that these are still process and it just takes time, but our board continue to be consistent that there's forward progress being made here, getting this one resolved, I think, is an indication that there is a progress.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And then lastly, looking to slip it in. The Bank, really, not much discussed on this call. I don't know that you're going to share much more. But, is there a level two deeper open question that you care to share with us at this point? Thanks.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","On the bank, transaction?","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean, the transaction that we got with BofI as a good transaction for BofI it's a good transaction for H&R Block, it's been with the regular now for a year plus. We believe on the merits and the structure of the transaction will be approved.","For us, we really just have to get it approved and implement it for next tax season. So, we got a fair amount of time to work with right now. Obviously, if we can get it approved well before that, that would be excellent and closed. But, our position remains the same, that we think it will be approved and it's really up to this regulator ultimately, though.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Any increase, decrease in communication with regulator? Anything that you would share outside or...","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Both ourselves and BofI have regular conversations with the regulators and normal course business. And, of course, as we have appropriate questions come in, as relates to this transaction, we would respond to those thoroughly and quickly as we can, we can see it in a position where we're really just waiting for the most part at this point for resolution, but there has been no change in the frequency or type of questions that we've seen in the last several months.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for taking all my questions, guys.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thanks for sneaking me in here. Just a couple of quick questions. On the competitive dynamics touched upon earlier in your prepared remarks, and not being able to fill that hole in assisted versus the IRS filings, do you have a sense whether these filers have gone to other preparers or are they going to DIY? Do you have a sense of where they're going to?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the overall assisted business, the latest numbers from the IRS is down 4.5% season-to-date. So, obviously, the whole area of assisted is suffering, we're a little worse than that, but there seems to be assisted. Digital is not in line in terms of their growth rate with what we had talked about. I have reason to believe that the points I was making in my prepared remarks is that the EITC migration will get higher until Treasury implements the directive from Congress next year.","And the EITC filer on the DIY basis has a free lane, I think, that point shift is going to go higher than 42%, but we'll have to see how that plays out. So, I think, in that sense, yes, there would be a shift. I think, overall, we think that when the season is done, the assisted to digital shift will be more in line with what has been the past couple of seasons, which is primarily due to this EITC issue.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And I'm not sure if you touched upon this earlier, but I was wondering if you can comment on some of your strategies this season, enticing users of other preparers or software to switch to Block at half the cost or no cost? How does this fit with your strategy last year to cut out low-margin filers and what's the response been to these strategies this season?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let me take the assisted side. And then, Jason, if you want to speak to the promotion, we've done with DIY. I think, we had a plan before we started this season that during the mid-February to mid-March timeframe, when we generally have available capacity, we wanted to be aggressive with trying to bring in new clients with our 50% off promotion. We're right in the middle of that right now. We'll see how that plays out. But that was a considered strategy really from a capacity basis and in terms of trying to drive against picking up more clients. So, that was the idea behind the assisted side. As far as DIY goes, Jason, why don't you talk about the overall integrated plan we put together.","Jason L. Houseworth - President-Global Digital & Product Management","Sure. Well, first, in desktop, we saw an opportunity to give very dissatisfied TurboTax clients, the opportunity to try our product; and by doing so, we felt like that they would recognize the best value in tax software. Really, we call this switch to Block, which offered TurboTax clients who sent us a copy of their receipt, free H&R Block Deluxe software. We're very pleased with the response of this; but more importantly, we're pleased with our desktop share performance in the early season. We estimate we've taken about three points in market share in desktop. And even though, our results today in e-file is desktop up 5%, our unit sales are up much stronger than that. And again, this is a really nice high-value client and one that we are actively attracting.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. And one for Greg. I just wanted to make sure, I wasn't clear on this. Are there more franchise purchases coming this year? Or have you bought all the ones that you're expecting to for 2015?","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think, the vast majority of them we completed this season, there may be some small changes next year, but for the material part we've done in 2015.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And one final one, if you can answer this I'd appreciate it. Just wondering, we saw the dates in the merger agreement get revised further out. I believe it's now June 30. Wondering, if there's any rhyme or reason as to how you choose those dates? Why isn't it May 30 or July 31?","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","So, there is rhyme and there is reason for sure. The answer is that we view those dates, I mean, of course, between BofI and ourselves to make sure we're in agreement, but we've also used them as a way to help have a conversation with the regulator.","So, from a broadest perspective, I wouldn't get too concerned about them. As you've already seen we can whip BofI's agreement and move them as we need to, but we do think those are a good timelines to work towards and helps us again have that conversation with the regulator.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Your line is open.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Thank you. Can you tell us what share of the ACA business you did, or have done, to-date?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mike. I'm going to let the season play out before we get into anything like that. And I don't think we really \u2013 I'm not even sure how we would get that number. But, we'll obviously give you a full readout at the end of the season.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I guess what I was looking at is, whether you're getting more than your average share of the total market?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Unclear at this point. As I said, we are under the number that we anticipated for the early season; but beyond that, I wouldn't hazard a guess, I think we'll have a better feel for that at the end of the season.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","What we do know, Mike, is that the average H&R Block client is twice as likely to be impacted by the ACA than the average American, simply because of the customer profile that we serve is the people that this is really targeted towards. So, ultimately, we're going to have more market share just because of that. But, within that standard, the question really is going to be answered better at the end of the season, as Bill said.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that the one concern we have is, frankly, in the digital space. And do you want to talk about that Jason, specifically?","Jason L. Houseworth - President-Global Digital & Product Management","Sure. Well, I think it's important to point out that we actually don't have the same experience in our tax software, right. As a company, we feel it's critical to create and file an accurate tax return. And there is a big difference in how our tax software versus the TurboTax works, specifically when you're talking about the Affordable Care Act. With H&R Block tax software, we require the filer to input his or her 1095-A in order to file.","By contrast, TurboTax does not require this, which would mean that it may be easier to actually file the return using TurboTax. But, the return's not going to be accurate; and in fact, it will actually put the return directly into IRS special processing, which means that the taxpayer can file, they'll get an accepted return, but then they're going to get a mail \u2013 snail mail from the IRS \u2013 which will require eight weeks to 12 weeks of additional time, and an amended return, in order to then complete their return.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Maybe you've just explained a question I was going to ask. It seems surprising that, for the erroneous 1095s, that only \u2013 less than 10% of them had already been filed by mid-February.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark?","Mark Ciaramitaro - Vice President, Health Care","So, this is Mark. Mike, this is a little bit different answer. What Jason was speaking to were people that enrolled in the marketplace and need to reconcile using a Form 8962, and those folks need to use a 1095-A. What you're speaking to is another issue that was recently announced by HHS that indicated that they had corrected 1095-As. In other words, the federal marketplace and some other state-based marketplaces, including California, had put out notices that indicated that the 1095s they had sent out were incorrect.","And I think, following that, HHS indicated that 90% to 95% of those folks hadn't yet filed. And so, the vast majority of the folks that have to reconcile, which are virtually all the people that are enrolled in the marketplace last year, still have yet to file, I think that's the information there. But, those folks are either going to have to amend their returns, if they use the incorrect 1095-A, or they're waiting to receive their corrected 1095-As, and that's, we think, contributing a little bit to the delays we're seeing.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I guess the question is, you would have thought that they would be lower income, they would tend to file earlier than average?","Mark Ciaramitaro - Vice President, Health Care","Well, I think, as Bill already mentioned in his comments, we originally thought that we would see a higher percentage of ACA-impacted clients, but it's turning out that we are probably going to see those clients spread throughout the tax season instead.","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, again, I hate to sound the way this is going to sound. We have to let this play out, but in consumer behavior, any time you have a new service, a new initiative that was instituted by the government, you got to wait and see how it plays out. That was our anticipation, it has not played out that way. We do still believe, with the form errors that Mark just talked about, in general, that more ACA people will be coming in over the last six weeks.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Maybe I missed something you said. Looking at the revenues, you seem to be (58:57) up about four times for returns that are not quite up that much. Am I missing some arithmetic here?","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Are you talking about the third quarter results, Mike?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Third quarter.","Gregory Macfarlane - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think you got to be very careful looking at our third quarter financial results and extrapolating at this point. This was simply timing, e-file being open another 11 days. We had a lot of returns last year that we had completed, but we were unable to file them and \u2013 because e-file was only open for one day in January last year and even then, we had a limited number we could get in the door, so you do have that discrepancy. And so, I really would be cautious in drawing too many conclusions from those comparisons.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I see. And then a question, over the last several years, we've seen, at least on IRS numbers, that assisted has either been flattish, up \u2013 almost de minimis increases. Where's this going in the future?","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Mike, here is the \u2013 this is why I am spending an awful lot of time on this. If the government does not make moves to combat tax fraud, some of the things that we've done that Jason outlined earlier, equalizing the standards on EITC, because that's been a significant shift, having competency exams and background checks and everything else on return preparers, I think still (1:00:29) is going to struggle, because the \u2013 and it has really come to the forefront this year how bad the fraud is in this industry. And it's something that we as \u2013 and that's why I'm saying, I'm glad to hear Commissioner Koskinen is going to convene a group. I think we, as industry leaders, have to come together to protect the American public. But there have to be some changes. These are huge numbers, and consumers are suffering for this, when they get a notice that their tax return has been filed and they haven't filed it yet.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Appreciate it. Thank you very much for your...","William C. Cobb - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Thank you.","I'd now turn to turn the call over to Mr. Colby Brown, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Ian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2018 third quarter results. On the call today are Jeff Jones, our President and CEO and Tony Bowen, our CFO.","We've posted today\u2019s press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we\u2019ll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I will remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the Securities Laws.

During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up after which they may choose to jump back into the queue.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you, Colby. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us.","We're off to a strong start to the tax season and I am very pleased with our results. Before I jump into the details, let me outline the areas we'll cover on today's call. First, I'll give a brief update on our long term strategy work; next, I'll provide our perspectives on what we're seeing in the industry, followed by our mid-season results, then we'll talk about our expectations for the second half of the season and finally Tony will review our third quarter financial results and outlook for the fiscal year.","First let me provide a few thoughts on our strategy. As we discussed on our Q2 earnings call in December, we're talking a fresh look at our long-term strategy. While we don't have specifics to share today, I can tell you that I challenged the team to go deeper than we had in the past and to think differently about our business and their delivery.","This work will allow us to make informed decisions about ways to continue to improve our assisted and DIY business and to position us for long-term sustainable growth. We expect to provide an update in late fall.","Turning to the overall industry performance, the latest result from the IRS show decline in returns of 0.4% on a day-to-day basis till February 23. While better than last year, these results are fairly consistent with what we've seen in years prior, as it is typical to see year-over-year declines on a day-to-day basis at this point in the season.","Consistent with prior years, industry results till February show a shift from assisted to DIY. Early season filers are more likely to change tax preparation methods, so the shift in the early season is typically greater and then moderates in the second half. Last year the season ended within an assisted to DIY shift of approximately 40 basis points, which is about half of what the industry experienced the previous few years.","At this point in the season, we're seeing a shift consistent with last year. Based on the early season results, we continue to expect total federal fillings to increase approximately 1% this tax season with industry assisted volumes flat to slightly up than the remainder of the growth coming from DIY.","Turning to our performance, our goal for the season was to build our momentum for last year, continuing to improve the client trajectory. We brought a more client-centric approach to everything we do, which is focused on three areas; one, improving operational excellence, two, new products and partnerships and three, marketing and promotions that drive demand for the H&R Block brand.","In the Assisted business, we outpace the industry in the first half on the strength of our promotions and improved execution. We again offered Refund Advance in three federal 1040EZ. This is the second year for these two promotions, which attract new clients and help us improve retention.","Refund Advance is an interest-free loan that is especially relevant to early season filers who face delays in receiving their refunds due to the tax act. This has been an extremely competitive season for Refund Advance with multiple tax prep providers including H&R Block offering larger loan than in previous years.","Given our strong offer and execution, our results were positive and we stabilized EITC clients for the second year in a row, an area of significant historical client declines.","While promotions don't drives filers to H&R Block, we must exceed their expectations in the office. Our clients are now more engaged in the process and our tax pros are providing more value-added expertise including our people like new enhancement, which utilizes machine learning to provide occupation-specific advice for Schedule C filers.","Additionally, we're offering our clients personalized assessment of the future impact of the new tax laws. The many variables in this new law make it difficult for taxpayers to know how they are ultimately affected.","Our clients will learn, if they were to pay more or less under the new tax law and then determine how to appropriately adjust the withholding. This is a great example of how our nearly 80,000 tax pros offer value to our clients and provide the personalized advice, so many of them need.","Collectively these efforts have translated into positive assisted results driven by increased retention. Client volume is in line with our expectations and we achieved early season share gains in the overall assisted category with IRS assisted e-files down 3.2% on a day-to-day basis this February 23 and comparable H&R Block volume down just 2.1%. And while, we're pleased with these results, we do expect our performance to moderate in the second half.","Turning to DIY, this year marks the second season for our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free. We also strengthened our partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most.","Additionally, we continue to make enhancements with improved drag and drop and further capture capability, making it easier than ever to switch to our product and pre-populate information from tax forms and we're seeing positive results with our new online products for self-employed filers.","These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY driven by new clients. Till February 23, IRS DIY e-files increased 2.4% on a day-to-day basis and comparable H&R Block volume increased 6.2%.","Now I'd like to provide an update on virtual tax, which includes redesign tax per review and our new product Tax Pro Go. These innovative products have been designed to meet evolving consumer needs and begin to represent the range of ways taxpayers can count on H&R Block whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between.","We watch Tax Pro Review, an improved version of an innovative product previously called Best of Both. This is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from the peace of mind of knowing that one of our highly trained experts has identified all available credits and deductions and has also reviewed their return for accuracy.","We also did a soft launch of Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering. This product recons the needs of consumer who want assistance, but don't want or have time to visit one of our offices. Clients did upfront pricing, upload their documents through the secure MyBlock portal and work virtually with one of our tax pros to have their taxes seamlessly prepared.","The focus on Tax Pro Go this year has been to understand the client experience in order to optimize the product going forward. Initial feedback on both products has been positive. We're forming a more comprehensive view of the types of filer who are attracted to these products and while in order to update a meaning volume with this season, our learnings will assist us in enhancing these products over time.","Now that I've covered early season results, I'd like to discuss our plans for the second half of the season. Last week, we brought back the half off promotion as we look to drive more new clients to the H&R Block brand. Additionally, in order to deliver more value, we're partnering with LendingTree to provide our clients easy access to information that can help them improve their credit and financial help. And in the DIY space, we continue to optimize our product to drive conversion and deliver an exceptional client experience.","In summary, we are pleased with our results so far. Our focus on operational excellence, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotions is driving results and we remain laser-focused on execution for the second half of the season.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results and outlook.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our results at the midpoint of this tax season. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations and we're on track to achieve the financial outlook we provided in December.","Before I get into the details, as a reminder we typically report a loss during the fiscal third quarter due to seasonality of our business. Therefore, third quarter results are not representative of our full-year performance.","Starting with revenues, we saw year-over-year increase of $37 million or 8% to $488 million. This is primarily the result of an increase in total U.S. client volumes of 4% through January 31 and planned inflationary increases in net average charge in our [safety] business.","Turning to expense, total operating expenses increased $9 million or 2% to $586 million primarily due to increased compensation cost, which were partially offset by the timing of marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in compensation is due to variable labor related to revenue increases in the U.S. as well as planned conversion of higher cost contractors to lower cost full-time associates.","As Jeff mentioned, we saw positive results in refund advance this season. In the program ended on February 28, applications for refund advance totaled $1.2 million a 14% increase over last year and while the average loan amount increased 40% due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier, we were able to maintain the cost per loan at approximately the same level of last year.","Moving through the remainder of the income statement, we saw interest expense decrease $1 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. Putting this all together, pretax loss from continuing operations improved by $30 million.","However, loss per share increased $0.67 from $0.49 to $1.16 solely due to changes in the company's effective tax rate, resulting from the recently enacted federal tax legislation. The negative impact from these corporate tax rate changes was anticipated and is unique to our fiscal third quarter as the impact will be favorable on a fiscal year basis.","We now expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 6% to 9%, which is an update to the range provided in our previously filed 8K in January. For fiscal '19 and beyond, our effective tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 25% range.","As a reminder, we don't anticipate any impact to our core business in fiscal '18 from the recent changes to individual taxes. We will offer more clarity on the potential impact of these changes on our core business when we provide our fiscal '19 outlook in December.","Turning to discontinued operations in Sand Canyon Corporation made settlement payments of $4.5 million in the quarter, which were previously accrued and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal '16. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on forms 10K and 10Q and other SEC filings.","As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil-piercing arguments.","I'd now like to provide thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal '18. Overall, we expect results to be in line with the outlook we provided in December. In Assisted, we continue to expect improvement in our client trajectory driven by our promotional offers and client experience enhancements.","We are on track to deliver moderate, inflationary price increases as outlined in December. In DIY, we anticipate growth in client volumes with net average charge consistent with fiscal '17. The net result is that we continue to expect overall revenue to increase modestly this year.","Considering the revenue projection and the impact of inflationary cost and investments, we continue to expect EBITDA margin at the high end of the 27% to 30% range. With respect to capital allocation, consistent with the message we shared on our Q2 call regarding share repurchases, we did not repurchase any shares in Q3. No significant share repurchases are planned for the remainder of fiscal '18.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jim.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks Tony. In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this season as we outperformed the industry and are delivering for our clients in both Assisted and DIY channels. While we expect our future result to moderate in the second half, we are keenly focused on executing our plans for the remainder of the season. We look forward to sharing more when we report our full-year results in June.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Ian?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Hey, just to start off, if we could have a clarification Jeff or Tony, if you could just rehash the 2.23% versus 2.28% IRS versus HRB performance in Assisted and DIY and also any commentary on what we might expect to see from the industry results at the end of this week when IRS reports it and I have a follow up please.","Tony Bowen","Yes so, going back to Jeff's opening comments, in the Assisted category, the IRS assisted e-files are down 3.2% and our business was down 2.1% and then in DIY IRS is down 2.4%, or excuse me, increased 2.4% and we increased 6.2% and those are both day-to-day through February 23.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks Tony. Just following up, it looks like you guys were strong out of the gate, a lot obviously throughout February and congratulations for that, January looks very strong as well and it was a little later start to the season this year versus past. So, if you guys could comment please on what you attribute to that initial strong start be it marketing the products, just a little bit more honing the feel for that immediate strong start, thanks?","Jeffrey Jones","Hey Scott, it's Jeff, so I'll kick this off and Tony may add in as well. So, I think starting in early January, our network was open and ready for business despite the delay in e-file open date and we did come out strong early season with great promotions and so we see that play itself out and changing the trajectory of EITC clients as an example, refund events.","We came in this year with a higher loan tier than we had in the past and so as I travel around the country, I also saw just really solid execution in the offices. So, I think the combination of those things did really help us get off to a good start in the assisted business.","Tony Bowen","Yeah and just to add to that Scott, I think the refund advance product definitely pulls clients in earlier than we saw last year. I think having that product for two years in a row, we're seeing prior clients take advantage of it and it's obviously driving new clients that really a lot of benefit is coming from retention lift and just clients coming in earlier.","So then knowing that we have the product for the second year, tax growth fee income that we're offering, I think definitely got us off to a strong start early.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. In your comments, you talked about expectations for some moderation in the second half of tax season. I am specifically focused on Assisted, but if you want to talk about DIY that will be fine as well. But is Assisted solely because you're not offering refund advance in the second half of the season or is there anything else we need to understand?","Jeffrey Jones","Hi Jeff this is Jeff Jones. I'll do the same and let Tony chime in as well. So obviously feel really good about how we started the season. In DIY I think, what I'd say is we expect to see the continued positive momentum as we move through the season. When we look at our second half performance, last year we kind of consider what we're seeing the last couple weeks in terms of assisted performance.","Even when we factor in the 50% of promotion that we just launched last week, we factor all that in. We see our results moderating as we move through the balance of the season. Obviously, we are about halfway through, so there is still a lot of business to come. But based on what we know, that\u2019s really our best estimate.","Tony Bowen","I don't think I have a lot more to add. As Jeff said, I think we got a lot of tax season to go, so we're trying to forecast a fairly small range here. But if you look at the second half of our performance last year, even though it improved from the first half, we were still down settling claims and we also lost little bit of share.","And while we add 50% off running this year in March which we didn't have last year, we do think that we will get back a little bit of a gain we're seeing in the early part of the tax season on the assisted side.","Jeff Silber","Okay. And just to clarify few things in terms of the promotions that are available now, refund advance is no longer available is that correct? And if you can just describe the half-off promotion, is this just for specific clients?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, so refund advance and Free 1040EZ promotion both ended on February 28. So those are done. 15% off is essentially client pay half of whatever they paid last year at a competitor. So, they bring in their receipt from an independent for example and we will do their taxes for half.","And really, it's a trial offer to get him into the store to experience our tax pros, experience our expertise and it's only available to new clients.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Millman from Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman","Thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about the RAs, to what extent was existing, I think you mentioned it broadly and what was new number that new and could you do the same thing for Free EZs in particular how much were free EZs this year, how many? And what kind of repeat business did you get? What kind of upgrade did you get for last year\u2019s free EZs business? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Michael, take this offline, your RA question, I think what was especially new this year was the new loan amount, the higher loan tier of $3,000. So, this year we offered $500, $750, $1,250 and then $3,000. We saw increases in applications and loans -- but we did as awareness grows about this product and clients understand its value, that really is interest free, no fees, quick access to funds, all that value proposition that it will continue to be a solid product for us.","And whether it was on national advertising or in local office execution, I just think we did a really nice job of executing in all channels to make sure that value was clear to our clients.","Tony Bowen","And just to add to that, I think specific Michael your question about and to drive new clients or priors. I think I will talk about old programs together, both Refund Advance and for EZ, really did a nice job of lifting prior clients. They obviously brought in new clients, but we were a little disappointed with the volume of new clients we saw from those two programs and I think it's still an opportunity for us when you think about how we get better in out years specifically focused on new clients.","As far as how many have we upgraded and that detail that we don\u2019t want to share at this point. But programs that were all did a nice job of bringing in clients, but like I said more skewed towards prior clients than new.","Michael Millman","Could you give us rough idea of the size of the Free EZ program last year and this year?","Tony Bowen","Yeah, we are not sharing by form at this point Michael.","Michael Millman","Can we assume it was bigger or smaller this year than last year?","Tony Bowen","Well, I think you said for Free EZ, so for Free EZ, we are not going to share the specifics because I think that provides much information from a competitive perspective.","Michael Millman","Okay. Thank you. I tried.","Operator","And our next question is line of Alex Paris from Barrington Research.","Chris Howard","Good afternoon. This is Chris Howard filling in for Alex Paris. I had a question in regard to the increase of 6.2% you saw in DIY, as it relates to the additional partnerships that you announced last quarter. How are those partnerships been going versus your internal expectations?","And I guess, what is the structure of these partnerships? Is it possible to, I guess from my knowledge push it to a multi-year agreement or is that something that comes up for rebid or proposal each tax season?","Jeffrey Jones","Chris, its Jeff. I will take this off, so I think overall in the DIY business, I think to keep it very simple what we're seeing is a very good product at a great value and we're starting to tell people about it. And not to oversimplify it, but I think those three things are helping us drive a lot of DIY growth.","Now in the partnerships, Amazon and Wal-Mart were two partnerships that we announced this year and we\u2019re not going to break out individual customer channel performance, but in both cases, we're seeing improvements in the units sold.","And I think we believe it represents a way that we can just continue to bring the H&R Block brand to more consumers than all the places where they shop. So, we feel good about those partnerships and the DIY business overall, we feel good about its performance.","And specific to your question about structure, we've had long term relationships with both Amazon and Wal-Mart. But typically, you negotiate those each year as they determine what products they want to promote in their various stores on online sites.","Chris Howard","Okay. That's helpful. And then one last question in regard to Review and Go, you mentioned that Go has had a soft launch and it'll be more of a material contributor later on. Are there any trends that you're seeing that you would be able to share or perhaps attach rates in regard to these new offerings?","Jeffrey Jones","No. I think both of those products, we love the role they play in the portfolio. It's starting to fill in the gaps between all Assisted business and DIY, therefore fundamentally, about providing help and leveraging our tax pros to do that. So, we think we're incredibly well positioned to provide that kind of service versus our competition.","Tax Pro Review, it's a redesigned product from Best of Both. Tax Pro Go brand new. Tax Pro Review we are marketing. Tax Pro Go we're not. And in both cases, we're really trying to understand more about the kind of clients that we attract and more about the user experience, just trying to keep it as easy as possible for people to engage with us on whatever terms they choose to engage.","So not large volume contributors this year, but really important products in the portfolio and we're getting some very positive learning that I expect us to integrate and improve for what we do next.","Chris Howard","Thank you for the color.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. This is [indiscernible] filling in for Hamzah. Could you walk us through, how we should think about your pricing strategy and your current customer retention rates versus targets?","Jeff Jones","Yeah, I think our pricing strategy obviously very different in Assisted and DIY. You're probably asking more about Assisted. We went into the year expecting inflationary modest price increases and that's exactly what we're delivering.","I think over the last couple of years, we tried to be much more targeted in our pricing approach and that includes not only the price, but the value we're delivering. Refund Advance for example, the additional value we're delivering to that early season client who wants a refund quickly and no cost, no fee loan and there's definitely been a change in trajectory for those clients, but we know we got to be nimble from a pricing perspective.","We got to figure out places where we're not bringing enough new clients from incremental clients and think about how do we adjust our pricing model going forward and its definitely living, breathing thing, but we feel good that we made significant progress over the last couple of years a change in our client trajectory.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you and just one and I'll turn it over. Could you update us on any changes that you might be seeing from a competitive dynamic perspective and in the DIY side?","Jeffrey Jones","Generally, we feel like we're well positioned relative to the market leader in DIY. As I mentioned earlier we have a really good product. We're starting to see more and more third-party review celebrating our DIY product. We got a very competitive value proposition in price versus TurboTax and we're starting to tell that story.","So relative to TurboTax that's how we assess it. I think beyond that it's kind of hard to tell for sure at this stage who else might be doing what, but what I'm most excited about for us is that we continue to improve the product and we're seeing good results from network.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, I'm showing there's no other audio questions. I'll now turn it back to Mr. Colby Brown.","Colby Brown","Okay. Thanks again, everyone for joining us. This concludes today's call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the H&R Block third quarter earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.

My name is Mariana, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the H&R Block First Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Colby Brown, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Mariana. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2017 first quarter results. On the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Tony Bowen, our CFO.","In connection with this call, we have posted today\u2019s press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we\u2019ll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We\u2019ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I will remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management\u2019s expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up, after which they may choose to jump back in the queue.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Cobb","Thank you, Colby, and good afternoon.","Earlier today, we announced results for our fiscal 2017 first quarter, which ended July 31st. As a reminder, given the highly seasonal nature of our business, the first quarter is not indicative of our performance for the full year. To put it in perspective, first quarter results typically represent less than 5% of our annual revenues and less than 15% of our annual expenses. Tony will walk you through the first quarter results in greater detail shortly, but overall they were in line with our expectations.","Our financial results varied from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the increased interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt last September. With that context on the quarter, I\u2019ll now spend a few minutes providing an update on our preparations for the upcoming tax season.","As I shared during our call in June, our focus for tax season 2017 is to arrest the client decline, and I can assure you that the entire Company is laser-focused on achieving this goal. To understand the drivers behind the client loss, we\u2019ve analyzed data from the 2016 tax season. This work confirmed that we maintained relatively stable retention rates year-over-year and that our challenge remained attracting new clients. With greater competition, both from aggressive offers in the industry and an increase in the number of independent tax preparers, our value proposition struggled to resonate with new clients.","With a better understanding of the issue, we then evaluated all aspects of the business, products; promotions; pricing; marketing; service delivery; operational processes, everything. We have spent this summer developing a multifaceted plan to appeal to new clients. What we have developed for tax season 2017 will result in an H&R Block that will look very different from what you\u2019ve seen in the past several years. We will be aggressively going after clients in both the assisted and the DIY categories. We will have compelling product offers and an improved client experience that we believe clients will value. And we will make sure the marketing message appropriately communicates that value. Our marketing campaign will be fundamentally different from last year. Also, we\u2019re making progress on our cost reduction efforts, but given the nature of our business, we don\u2019t expect to realize majority of those benefits until later in the fiscal year. And as we discussed in June, we intend to use a substantial portion of the savings to fund our operational objectives for the upcoming tax season.","While I look forward to delivering a strong 2017 tax season, we will not sacrifice the long-term health of the business to achieve short term success. Rather, the changes we\u2019re implementing will further strengthen our overall value proposition. We remain a strong Company with a history of delivering for our shareholders and I look forward to continuing this practice going forward. I\u2019m excited about the future of H&R Block and the opportunity to demonstrate strong performance for our clients and for our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tony to review the quarter\u2019s financial results.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Bill and good afternoon everyone.","As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results represent a small percentage of our annual revenues and expenses, and are not representative of our full year performance. With that as a backdrop, I\u2019d like to provide additional context on the quarter.","Revenues decreased $12.5 million to a $125 million, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. This included the reclassification of mortgage portfolio interest income to other income, the loss of investment income from available for sale securities, and lower Emerald Card revenues, resulting from payments to our third bank partner. Lower U.S. tax return volume and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and our international businesses also negatively impacted revenues.","Turning to expenses, total operating expenses decreased $2 million to $310 million, primarily due to cost reduction efforts which were partially offset by occupancy cost and amortization expense related for franchise acquisitions in the prior year. Not included in operating expenses is interest expense, which increased $13 million from the prior year due to the issuance of long-term debt in September of 2015.","Pretax loss increased $16 million to $203.5 million. The increase in pretax loss was driven by the increased interest expense and changes related to the divestiture of the Bank. Excluding these two items, pretax loss would have improved $3 million compared to the prior year. Notwithstanding the changes discussed, EBITDA loss increased just $2.5 million to a $141 million and again was entirely due to the Bank divestiture.","Income taxes were less favorable during the quarter due to the discreet tax benefits we recognized during Q1 of the prior year. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be in the 35% to 36% range.","Finally, our loss per share increased $0.20 to $0.55; approximately half of this increase was due to the reduction in share count which will be accretive on a full year basis, but negatively impact those quarters in which we have a net loss. The remainder of the change in loss per share was due to the increase in pretax loss mentioned earlier.","Turning to discontinued operations, Sand Canyon\u2019s representation in warranty accrual decreased $40 million from the prior quarter to $26 million as a result of the settlement with the counterparty. The settlement was fully covered by existing accruals. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate bell pushing [ph] arguments.","Turning to our capital structure, we repurchased an additional 2 million shares during our first quarter at an aggregate price of $48.6 million, bringing total repurchases under the current $3.5 billion authorization to over $2 billion. There are number of factors that impact our share repurchase decisions including our financial position, market conditions, blackout periods and operational considerations. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and going forward will continue to be opportunistic at our approach.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Bill for some closing comments.","Bill Cobb","Thanks Tony. Before we move to Q&A, I\u2019d like to address one other item. Historically, we\u2019ve held an investor conference in the December in conjunction with the release of our second quarter results. Given our stated objectives of arresting the client decline and the work it will take to get there, it\u2019s imperative that the management team stay focused on executing against this goal. Additionally, we will not reveal the majority of changes we are implementing in advance of the tax season given the industry\u2019s competitive environment. Thus, we will not be holding an investor conference this year. That said, we will include guidance on a select number of financial metrics during our second quarter call in December. This is the right decision. It is substantial that we remain focused on flawlessly executing our plan for the upcoming tax season and it also saves us the money, which is always a good thing.","With that, we are now ready for questions. Mariana?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. I really do understand the competitive nature of your business and your reluctance to give us a little bit more color about some of the changes. But,, is there anything you can tell us at a high level, why this next tax season will look different than the last one?","Bill Cobb","Well, I think, Jeff, what I\u2019ve said is, we\u2019re going to be more much aggressive on both the assisted and DIY channels in our offers; we\u2019re going to be moving forward with some client experience enhancements. And again, for competitive reasons, I\u2019m not going to go into the details of that, but you\u2019re going to see a very good H&R Block in tax season 2017.","Jeff Silber","Okay. And just continuing on the same, I know you talked a little bit about the change in the EITC refund policy from next year. I just was wondering, if you\u2019ve had a little bit more time to study that and what impact it might have on your business next year? Thanks.","Bill Cobb","Do you mean the CapEx?","Jeff Silber","Yes, please.","Bill Cobb","So the CapEx, I mean refunds will be delayed on certain credits like EITC and childcare credits until February 15th. We\u2019re still studying that what the impact of that is. Obviously, I think it\u2019ll have a disruptive effect on the tax industry, and we\u2019re going to obviously be looking for initiatives to take advantage of that and support our clients during that timeframe.","Jeff Silber","All right. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thanks so much.","Bill Cobb","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gil Luria with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Gil Luria","Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask, if you could provide us a little more detail on the cost reductions that you\u2019ve taken. Have you quantified how many full time equivalents have been reduced and on what base? You have such a variance in terms of the seasonal account. Have you completed those measures? At this point in time, I understand you\u2019re saying that they won\u2019t really kick in until tax season and then even than a lot of it\u2019s going to be reinvested. But have those been completed at this point?","Tony Bowen","Hi Gil, thanks for the question. I think your are cutting out a little bit. I think you\u2019re asking about how many positions we reduced as part of the cost reduction that went through about last April. So, we did reduce by about 250 full time positions both at our corporate office as wells in our fields. So, those are essentially behind us. We did do a number of other cost reduction efforts, which you\u2019re seeing farther benefit in Q1, but there was a couple of numbers going against this. We had some amortization, as well as some additional rents that we\u2019re paying on behalf of our franchise buybacks from deals we did last year that now are impacting us in Q1. We also have some payments that we\u2019re making to our bank partner as part of that transaction. So, those are all potentially moving in the wrong direction. And despite that we did reduce our operating expenses about $2 million during Q1.","So, the other point to add on though is, there are some of the cost reduction efforts that are going to be more impactful during the tax season. We\u2019re still deciding which of those cost reductions we\u2019re going to be reinvesting in the business. But given the nature of -- 75% of our revenue and a significant amount of our expense comes in Q4, there is going to be a delay to some of our cost reductions.","Bill Cobb","I think the only thing I\u2019d add to what Tony said, Gil, is that the way the expenses are rolling out, and obviously with the oddity of our highly, highly seasonal business, the expense plan or the actuals in Q1 were in line with our expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks, good afternoon. I\u2019m following up on Gil\u2019s question. Tony, you quoted in the press release, expenses are down slightly this quarter, the majority to occur after the first quarter. And Gil framed this question on most of its going to probably come in the tax season. I\u2019m just curious, might we see a bigger improvement in the fiscal second quarter or we wait until tax season, and maybe a little bit more color around those headwinds you outlined in the first quarter, how they might impact second quarter? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Yes, I think -- thanks Scott for the question. I think we\u2019re going to see a continuation of some of those headwinds, the rents that we\u2019re now picking up for the buybacks we did last year, franchise buybacks that is, as well as some increased amortization expense as well as just an ongoing payment to our bank partner which, part of that -- and that mainly impacts us more during the first quarter as far as the bank partner relationship because you remember, we closed that transaction during August of last year. So, we\u2019re going to essentially have that year over year variant behind us after we move out of Q1; we still have about a month in Q2 but most of it will be behind us. So, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a much different story on the cost line in Q2 because we still are going to have the increased rent and a few other things that are essentially headwinds. So, most of that will still impact us during the tax season.","Bill Cobb","And the other thing is Scott with our business as you know, you\u2019ve covered us - the industry for a number of years, as the IRS wins or when the e-file date is et cetera, January can look a little funky. So, it\u2019s all about our complete fiscal year and seeing how that nets out. We have said that we will have a lower expense line on marketing; where that falls relative to last year, I\u2019m not going to try to manage the Q3 earnings; we\u2019re trying to manage through our full fiscal year. So, that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult for us to really comment on the quarterly piece except to say that as we have looked at Q1, as we look at Q2 to Tony\u2019s point, then we head into Q3 when things can be more determined by externalities, that\u2019s why it gets difficult on a quarterly basis to really give you a really specific answer.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay, thanks. And then for the follow-up, obviously a positive development here for Sand Canyon. Could you guys please elaborate on what that settlement was? And obviously there\u2019s a remaining reserve, so what exists out there and just update on where the tolling agreements are? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Scott, this is Tony. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the progress the Sand Canyon\u2019s team\u2019s made. They did have a positive settlement during the quarter. We don\u2019t speak specific to the counterpart that they did settle with but it was a $40 million settlement, as I mentioned in my opening comments. So, they still have about $26 million remaining under the representation and warranty accrual. That being said, there are some other contingent liabilities that are as you see disclosed in our 10-K, do a good job of outlining what those are. So, I would just refer you to those. We still think this is going to be a measured in a matter of years, not months. It\u2019s going to take some time to wind down. They are making great progress but it\u2019s just one of those things that\u2019s still going to take some time.","Scott Schneeberger","And if I could just clarify that, Tony, I was under the impression that there was one large group with which tolling agreements were occurring and that was everybody, and it looks like something just got settled. So, is it kind of piecemeal or bunch of groups or is that we have to check the K or not something you can elaborate on?","Tony Bowen","Yes. Scotto, we don\u2019t want to talk about specific settlements, unless you\u2019re exactly what you\u2019re referring to. But, it has been great progress, but it\u2019s still going to take some time to wind down.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Good afternoon. I wanted to get your perspective on what you expect for overall industry growth in terms of tax returns for next year?","Bill Cobb","Kartik, at this point -- and as we get closer to tax reason, we may refine this. But at this point, we expect the continuation of the trends we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years. I think we\u2019re anticipating total industry growth between 1% and 2%. It does seem that filing happens later rather than earlier. I think DIY will grow faster than assisted. I think DIY will be in the 4% or so range; assisted in the 0% or 1% increase range. So, I think right now in terms of our planning, we\u2019re anticipating it being in line with the past couple of years.","Kartik Mehta","And Tony, I just wanted to get your thoughts on margins, as we\u2019ve looked to this year, you talked about cost cuts; you\u2019ve talked about being aggressive just going after clients. I am wondering, how does that translate to EBITDA margins for this year and I guess either growth or contraction?","Tony Bowen","Kartik, so, we\u2019re going to share more information on our Q2 call as Bill mentioned, so we\u2019re not going to talk specific about it. At this time, we\u2019re still sticking to our long-term guidance of 28% to 32% for EBITDA margin, but we\u2019re going to share more information on our Q2 call.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Your line is open.","Michael Millman","Thank you. When we look out I guess first half of the tax season, second half of the tax season, should we be looking for the Company to decelerate their declines or in fact be able to put up some increases in one of those periods? And so, related to that, is there a focus more on volume or more on revenues? Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Yes. I will start off Michael and then Bill can add on. I would say, our main focus is on arresting the decline. Obviously growth is the ultimate goal. But coming off the year, we just had in both the assisted and the DIY channel, our main kind of step one, if you will, is arresting the decline. Obviously we\u2019re hoping for growth but not necessarily targeting that at this point. So, that\u2019s -- and what was your second question, Michael?","Michael Millman","And so, just on that, would that be true for both the first half where you do have a lot of new tax payers and the second half as well and you have existing, more existing? So, maybe just go there and get back to the second half -- the second question.","Bill Cobb","Yes, with regard to the first half, second half, I don\u2019t think we are in a position yet to comment on the split or where that will land. I think Tony laid it out well that the goal here, we can\u2019t afford to have another year where we\u2019re down almost a million clients. So, job one is to arrest to the decline and that\u2019s where our focus is.","Michael Millman","So, that may answer the second question, which was is the focus more on volumes than on revenues?","Bill Cobb","I think sometimes that said an artificial construct but clearly we have to be focused on the client numbers. So, I\u2019m not going to comment more specifically than that but just said our primary focus is to arrest the client decline.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Adrian Paz","Hi. This is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. Given the industry\u2019s increasing use of RIA like products, what is your position on offering particularly [ph] RAL products? And if you could perhaps provide some color on where you are in discussions with the potential bank partners?","Bill Cobb","I\u2019m not sure I heard the second part\u2026","Adrian Paz","I just want to see if you were having discussions with potential bank partners on offering the RAL like products.","Bill Cobb","Okay. So, now I understand. So obviously, with the expansion in RALs that were offered last tax season, our estimates are that they\u2019re over 1 million of them offered, primarily through the independent channels. So, we\u2019ve certainly taken a look at that. We\u2019re continuing to look at that. Whether we will have one or not, it\u2019s certainly something that we are not ready to comment on this year. We would be in a position where we would always partner on this. I\u2019m not going to say what we\u2019ve done with regard to any discussions with partners but as I\u2019ve said, in terms of having an aggressive tax season, in our mind everything is on the table and at the appropriate time we will reveal what our plans are.","Adrian Paz","And just one more, now having reflect on the 2016 tax season, can you discuss how your thoughts have evolved on the ACA impact and why it can really materialize in 2016 and what your thoughts for 2017 for the ACA?","Bill Cobb","Yes. As I said on the Q4 call, I mean, we are surprised that the impact was not growing in tax season 2015; every indicator was that it would be but it didn\u2019t happen. The number of people in exchanges again this year has gone up. The IRS now has all the 1095 forms that everyone had to file last year. So, everything is set up for increase in terms of the impact on the tax season. But, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. I still believe that over time, this will be a net benefit to a company like H&R Block but hard to say what it will be in 2017, given that we are surprised. But all the indicators would show that the impact will be higher in 2017.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","Colby Brown","All right. Thanks Mariana and thanks everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Derek Drysdale, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Derek Drysdale","Thank you, Diane. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Jeff Brown, our CFO, will review our third quarter results, as well as our fiscal year-to-date interim U.S. tax results through February 28. Phil Mazzini, our President of Retail Tax Services, and Jason Houseworth, our President of Digital Tax Services, will be available to participate during the Q&A session.","I'd like to remind everyone that today's remarks will include forward-looking statements as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. ","Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2011 as well as our other SEC filings.","H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.","William C. Cobb","Thanks, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. At December's Investor Conference, we outlined our strategy to better position ourselves for long-term growth. Our top priority heading into this season was to serve more clients through aggressive marketing and promotional efforts, as well as initiatives to improve our clients' service and retention. With the first half of the tax season now behind us, I'm pleased that these decisions have worked, and we are executing well against our long-term strategy.","Through February 28, we've served nearly 700,000 more U.S. clients, a 5.1% increase from the prior year. From our analysis, it is clear that we are gaining share in all digital categories: online, software and the Free File Alliance.  In the assisted category, the external data is still murky at this point, which I'll explain in a moment. ","The conclusion we believe you should walk away with, however, is that we are growing clients, which is our #1 stated goal.","That said, there are still millions of tax returns yet to be filed, and we are committed to finishing the season strong to further improve our position.","Now looking at the industry as a whole, the first half of this tax season was highly competitive as we expected. In recent years, we've continued to see the first peak of the tax season shift well into February. Additionally, congressional tax code changes passed in December of 2010 caused a delay at the IRS in processing Schedule A forms prior to February 14 last year. Since we serve a significantly lower mix of Schedule A clients in the industry as a whole, the effect of last year's delay is almost certainly -- is almost entirely normalized in our return volumes at the end of February. However, it may take the balance of March for total filings to normalize for the rest of the industry.","Some industry observers have estimated that IRS returns are up about 5% through February after factoring in the ongoing decline in pen and paper. We believe most of this growth is due to timing from the industry normalizing Schedule A filers from March last year into February of this year. ","Ultimately, we believe that the best indicator of IRS growth is nonfarm employment, which was up 1.3% at the end of December. As a result, we anticipate that total IRS filings will grow about 1.5% for this tax season.","Now with that overview, let's turn to our assisted tax business. At the Investor Conference, we committed to an aggressive growth plan to drive traffic and accelerate trial in the first half of the tax season and to retain the millions of new clients we attracted last year. ","Our targeted value offerings, such as free 1040EZ, free RAC and free Second Look, required a material investment in national advertising, which we committed to in December. These initiatives are both current and long-term investments designed to build our brand strength, client acquisition and retention, as well as our overall competitiveness. That said, now I'd like to review our performance against each of these growth initiatives, starting with the free 1040EZ.","I am pleased that the EZ program is continuing to exceed our expectations in its second year. This initiative is all about targeting 18 to 24-year-olds so they can experience the benefits of an H&R Block tax professional.","Once clients experience our expertise and begin forming relationships with our tax professionals, we are confident that they will return to us as their lives become more complex. In the short term, this program is essentially revenue neutral for us because in most cases clients pay for a state return or another product like our Peace of Mind guarantee, or they trade up to a different form.","As we said last year, retaining EZ clients will be the longer-term determinant of the program's success as our research indicates that within 3 years, 55% of these clients file a more complex return. ","I am pleased that our retention to date on last year's new EZ clients is up 500 basis points. Also, the monetization of this program is strong as more than 25% of last year's EZ clients have already migrated to a more complex form.","We believe this targeted initiative is exceeding our expectations because of our financial strength, scale and ability to aggressively message this offer. This is a powerful program that is providing a pipeline of new filers to the H&R Block brand for future years, allowing us to further monetize these clients as they transition to more complex returns.","Next, we offered free Refund Anticipation Checks, or RACs, to clients who deposited their refund on an H&R Block Emerald prepaid MasterCard. This promotion, which expired on February 4, was a bold step that helped level the playing field among competitors who had a Refund Anticipation Loan, or RAL, offering this season. ","Having a competitive product was important because 55% of clients in the first half of the season elect to obtain their refunds through a settlement product compared to 14% in the second half.","With competitors aggressively marketing RALs this year, we believe that offering free RACs was the right decision. This promotion helped us retain early-season clients at similar rates to last year. ","Overall, we issued 2.6 million Emerald Cards, a 22% increase in total Emerald Cards over last year.","Next, our Second Look program is designed to attract clients from our competitors by providing clients a risk-free trial to experience the expertise of our tax professionals. We often find money for people who prepare their own returns and later amend their return with us. We benefit from the revenue gained on that filing and the referrals and loyalty that the program creates.","In the first half of the season, we set out to complete more Second Looks. In fact, through February 28, Second Look reviews are up more than 100% compared to last year, and the number of returns generated from this program grew nearly 50%. Perhaps most importantly, our new client retention rate improves by 10 percentage points when they benefit from a Second Look. Clearly, this program brings new clients into our offices and retains them at considerably higher rates.","We currently have Second Look rallies taking place across the country, where company and franchise offices are dedicating one week to promote and perform Second Look reviews. ","In Indiana, we just recently performed more than 3,700 reviews in one week alone, saving clients more than $1.4 million. This is one great example of our efforts to grow the number of returns generated from this program in March and April when we see clients with more complex returns.","And finally, we are making good progress against our service initiatives. As you know, getting clients in the door is only part of the equation. The long-term success of our client acquisition programs ultimately rests upon our ability to serve our clients well, so they leave our offices feeling confident they received top-notch expertise at a fair price and refer their family and friends to us. By focusing on innovative ways to better serve our clients, we retain more clients and build a larger pipeline of future clients.","Although we have a number of metrics we use to measure our success, client satisfaction and retention ultimately serve as our benchmarks.","Through February 28, client satisfaction is up more than 400 basis points. When looking at retention, it's important to note that we historically retain new clients at lower rates. Given our new client growth of 19% last year, we expected retention to be down in the first half of the season. ","Overall, we are very pleased that our retail retention improved nearly 40 basis points to February 28. These metrics are typically good leading indicators, so our performance to date gives us confidence that we are well positioned to grow clients in the second half and in the years ahead.","Now turning to Digital. We continue to view this segment as an important on-ramp to our assisted Tax Services and a complement to our overall suite of tax solutions that serve clients anyway, anyhow and anywhere they want to be served. ","This year's marketing investment helped substantially increase awareness of our H&R Block At Home products. Our mid-season analysis shows a 13-point increase in awareness compared to last year. We still have a lot of opportunity to improve in this area, but we are pleased by these results today. We also simplified our products, made big improvements to our website and introduced mobile and tablet tax-preparation solutions.","Within the Online category, we have continued to see strong demand for our products, growing 20% through February 28. This represents 2 consecutive years of strong early-season growth. We've also improved monetization through a better paid federal product mix and have seen online RACs grow significantly.","Additionally, our retention and Net Promoter Scores are up 150 and 400 basis points, respectively, demonstrating sustained improvement in 2 of our most important metrics.","In the Free File Alliance, a category which we believe industry-wide -- a category in which we believe industry-wide returns have slightly declined this year, we grew 11% by adding our offer to additional state Department of Revenue sites. ","Finally, due to strong promotions and an enhanced display presence, we are essentially flat in software despite the negative industry trend in this category.","We are pleased to have gained share in all 3 of our Digital categories through February 28. We are also pleased with the launch of our mobile initiatives. Our tablet, iPhone and Android tax-preparation apps, as well as our Block Live, Block mobile retail companion app and Emerald Card mobile banking apps are all now live. Year-to-date we've seen over 350,000 cumulative downloads with 90% of our mobile customers being new to H&R Block. Regardless of how clients enter our brand, we know that we have a significantly higher chance to retain them if and when they switch their method of filing. ","Overall in Digital, I am pleased we are meeting the primary objective for the season that we shared in December, to outpace TurboTax in total digital category growth, based on Intuit's volume release through February 18.","Now I'd like to take a moment to talk about Block Live, which launched in January. As a reminder, Block Live is a web-based service that provides virtualized access to real-time assisted tax preparation. Block Live is very different from our competitors' advice or phone-a-friend program that's offered from one of their 700 people. As expected with most new products, the adoption rate on Block Live has been slow to date, but the actual user experience is working beyond our expectations.","We believe Block Live is well ahead of the curve. We are excited about this innovation as it represents a new distribution channel for us, and it allows us to serve clients the way they want to be served. This is a long-term play, which we are fully committed to build upon going forward.","Before I conclude, I'd like to address our capital structure. During the second quarter, we repurchased more than 4% of our outstanding shares. In December, we increased our annual dividend by 33% to $0.80 per share. ","Today, I am pleased to announce another positive step with an amendment to our committed line of credit, or CLOC, which lowers our minimum equity covenant by $150 million to $500 million. This amendment allows us more flexibility to return capital to shareholders going forward.","We remain focused on executing against our long-term capital allocation strategy that we shared in December. Demonstrating sound capital stewardship and returning value to shareholders remains a top priority. Please keep in mind that our CLOC expires in July of 2013, and we'll continue to address our long-term capital structure during negotiations with our banks in the next fiscal year.","I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Brown to discuss our third quarter results.","Jeffrey  T. Brown","Thank you, Bill. As many of you know, the third quarter represents only a small portion of the tax season, and so quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the results we expect for the entire fiscal year.","Earlier today, we announced a $0.01 loss from continuing operations, and that compared to a $0.04 loss a year ago.","Looking at segment results. Revenues in Tax Services fell by $17 million or 2.5% to $656 million. Tax-preparation fees and related revenues increased 10% during the quarter or approximately $49 million, primarily due to growth in total returns prepared.","Increases in tax-prep revenues were offset primarily by a decline of approximately $70 million in financial product revenues. ","Let me take a minute to review the primary changes in our financial product revenue.","[Audio Gap] ","by 22%, but resulted in a decline of $30 million in quarterly RAC revenues. ","Another factor contributing to the decline in these revenues was our decision to tighten underwriting relating to our Emerald Advance product. Although this change led to a $16 million decline in revenues, associated credit losses fell by $37 million.","Emerald Card revenues were down $7 million, primarily due to IRS delays in processing tax refunds during the quarter. ","And finally, our results last year included approximately $16 million of nonrecurring revenue from our terminated RAL contract.","The segment\u2019s pretax income improved to $32 million compared to $4 million a year ago. This improvement was primarily due to the lower credit losses I mentioned earlier and the decline in impairment and litigation-related charges, which were partially offset by declining revenues and a $20 million incremental investment in marketing.","In corporate, our pretax loss of $33 million compared to a prior-year loss of $30 million. ","Our net principal balance of mortgage loans held for investment at H&R Block Bank continues to wind down, declining by nearly $20 million from the prior quarter to about $430 million at January 31. ","A shrinking loan portfolio, in moderation of delinquency and loss rates, continues to result in reduced loss provisions at our bank. In fact, year-to-date loss provisions have fallen $7 million compared with the same period last year.","As we look at our overall financial position, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong as we enter our most profitable quarter. Approximately $231 million of commercial paper borrowings that were on the balance sheet at January 31 were fully repaid in February. I would also note that $600 million of debt maturing in 2013 is now classified as current beginning this quarter, due to its contractual maturity.","And finally, at January 31, 230 million shares were outstanding.","Turning to discontinued operations, we reported net income of $200,000 for the quarter compared with a net loss of nearly $2 million a year ago. Current quarter results included a discrete tax benefit from the sale of RSM, which was offset by litigation charges taken in the quarter. Let me briefly review each of those items.","First, the sale of RSM in late November resulted in a gain for tax purposes. At closing, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $20 million from the utilization of capital loss carry forwards. After accounting for the tax benefit received during the third quarter, our net after-tax loss on the sale of RSM was $37 million. This tax benefit was offset by after-tax charges related to litigation.","Sand Canyon has been working with the staff of the FCC in connection with an investigation of matters related to certain residential mortgage-backed securities transactions. Sand Canyon has offered to resolve this matter with the payment of approximately $28 million and has recorded a pretax charge and established a liability for that amount this quarter. ","Although we believe that this matter can be resolved on satisfactory terms, any resolution would require approval by the SEC and the U.S. district court, neither of which has been or can be assured of being obtained.","New claims for alleged breaches of reps and warranties in the principal amount of $35 million were received by Sand Canyon during the third quarter. At January 31, total claims of $399 million remain subject to review. Sand Canyon completed a review of prior claims during the quarter with an approximate principal balance of $220 million, and claims found to be valid had estimated losses totaling $1.2 million.","As payments related to these valid claims remained pending at January 31, the accrual for representation and warranty liabilities remained unchanged from the prior quarter at $143 million. ","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill for closing remarks.","William C. Cobb","Thanks, Jeff. As I reflect on my past 10 months as CEO, we have sharpened our strategy, taken steps to resolve outstanding litigation and shed noncore assets such as RSM McGladrey, McGladrey Capital Markets and EXPRESSTAX, which have negatively impacted our margins over the years. More importantly, they detracted focus away from our core Tax Services.","Today, we are running a much better business, and we are squarely focused on serving more clients. I am pleased by our total U.S. return growth of more than 5% through February 28. We are executing well, and our growth initiatives are performing to expectation. We like our current position, and we believe we will continue that momentum in the second half of the quarter.","And with that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Derek Drysdale","Diane, before we get started in the Q&A, I just want to make one correction. Earlier in our scripted remarks, we said there were 230 million shares outstanding at quarter end. That number is actually 293 million.","Operator","Your first question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","We've heard discussions about how taxpayers are showing less urgency. And in that connection, I was wondering if you could discuss whether you're seeing some switching between -- because of that or related to that between retail and digital. And I was also curious regarding the IRS numbers that you referred to that the Digital were up substantially and would be affected by the same Schedule A\u2019s. So maybe you could discuss a little bit more what you think is going on with those IRS numbers.","William C. Cobb","So why don't I let -- Jason, why don't you comment on this? And then I think, Phil, maybe you should also lend your perspective.","Jason Houseworth","Mike, this is Jason Houseworth. The first thing I want to say is that within H&R Block as a brand, we've seen no material changes in the year-over-year migration between our Digital business and our assisted business. And I think it's important to note that from our perspective, that's 22 million filers. So we don't see anything that's really different from what we've seen in past years as far as movement within H&R Block. I would say that with no IRS data out there, it's really difficult to get a sense of the broader market. But I'll also let Phil comment.","Philip L. Mazzini","Mike, I think just as a general comment, whenever we see IRS data, remember, that it's e-file data and not everyone on the assisted side is e-filing yet. There's an adoption curve. H&R Block has e-filed for years, 100%, so it tends to understate -- or overstate performance and understate our performance and so\u2026","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Could you -- this year, the IRS required over 10 filings to go digital, do you -- to go e-file. Do you think that, that's had a major effect on why the e-file was up something like 7% on the latest IRS numbers?","Philip L. Mazzini","I would say that we're not -- we don't have enough information to really comment on that, Mike, yet.","William C. Cobb","Mike, I think -- this is Bill. I think the other piece is let\u2019s let the tax season play out. Some of the numbers that are out there would be -- have growth rates that would not have been seen since the end of World War II, if you've taken -- except for maybe the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. I mean, I think the point is that I made in the script was I think in the end, category growth should be around 1.5%, which has been our estimate, been others' estimate. It reflects what nonfarm employment was at the end of December. So I think we're managing to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Bill, I wanted to get your thoughts on pricing for the year. What has the competitive landscape been? And have you been able to garner pricing maybe both at a corporate level and a franchise level?","William C. Cobb","Phil, why don't -- you want to take the how it's -- why don't we take Jason on Digital and Phil on Assisted, and then I'll offer any perspective.","Philip L. Mazzini","Kartik, I'm sorry, can you just be specific on what the question is? I don't -- it seems like a broad question. Can you just repeat it?","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Sure. At your retail tax stores at the corporate level, what kind of pricing increases have you seen? And then at the franchisees, what kind of price increases have they pushed through at the retail store level? And then on Jason's side, I was just wondering maybe what he's seen in terms of mix that\u2019s resulted in a price increase or decrease for the Digital business.","Philip L. Mazzini","Okay. I think on our side -- I'll just comment on we're at knock [ph] end of the year -- end of the quarter. And I think we're roughly flat. And as we get to the end of the year, I don't think -- I think we'll be probably slightly better than that. I don't have a lot of information on competitive pricing. We continue to look at it, but there's nothing major, I think, going on.","William C. Cobb","Jason?","Jason Houseworth","Yes. Kartik, this is Jason. We didn't have a pricing increase this season in online. But what I would say at mid-season is that we're very happy with the product mix and how it's turned out this year, and especially the added product taxes we've seen, specifically our RACs. And that was really given the focus that my team had on looking at the product and specifically the monetization pages within the product, and we feel like that those tactics had borne fruit.","William C. Cobb","Kartik, I would just add that, as you know, our #1 stated goal is to grow clients. And pricing is just one of the levers we use to try to drive toward that goal.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","That's fair. Jason, just -- I know this is a tough question, but based on your internal analysis, what do you think the software category or Digital category is growing at so far this year?","Jason Houseworth","Well I think that, as frustrating as it is for all of us, I'd like to be able to give you a bigger picture of that or a clearer picture of that. I think that we don't have IRS data. What I can tell you is that we report on day to day, on a day-to-day basis. And on a day-to-day basis, our comparable numbers as of 2\/18 outpace Turbo in all 3 digital categories. That's online, software and FFA. And given that we weren't in mobile or we had 0 mobile units last year, we did it as well in mobile. So I think we're really pleased with that. And the one thing I would point you to is I think that -- related to online and the online segment only, there was on Monday an article by comScore that I think had -- what we think is a fairly accurate overview of the online segment through 2\/18.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And Bill, just a final question. Obviously, you have additional flexibility now with the covenant renegotiation. Any thoughts on how you might return that capital back to shareholders? Will it be a share buyback, maybe a dividend increase or onetime dividend? Any thoughts on that, Bill?","William C. Cobb","Yes. I think, Kartik -- and I'll try to answer this, but I'll give you somewhat of a non-answer, if you will. I've been on the job 9 or 10 months. Effectively, our board -- and it's a relatively new board with a majority of us being very new, some of us being only 6 months or so. I'm really pleased with the steps we have taken in terms of buying back the shares that we did in Q2 by raising the dividend, by amending the covenant. So I think we're making great strides as a company in terms of capital stewardship. I think the board and I are working very closely on this. I think we'll have more to say on this at year end in June. But at this point, it would be premature to comment further. But be aware that obviously this is a topic we are discussing very closely with our board of directors.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger. Please state your company name, sir.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","It's Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Following up on that last question, were there any stock buybacks in the quarter?","Jeffrey  T. Brown","There weren't any, Scott. No stock buybacks in the third quarter.","William C. Cobb","Scott, we didn't get the amendment done until just a few days ago, which is why we're announcing it now. So as of Jan 31, we didn't have the amendment done, and that is the time when we get closest to hitting -- obviously, we didn't come close to it. But we have a buffer, and I think, Jeff, we were at about $800 million in equity?","Jeffrey  T. Brown","Right. We finished the quarter at about $800 million in equity, and that would have been against, at that time, Scott, the $650 million equity covenant.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And now that you've reduced the covenant $150 million, a few questions on that. Why not remove the covenant altogether? Why did that not occur? And then why no announcement of any type of financial commitment to buybacks going forward at this time?","William C. Cobb","So let me try both of those, as I think this was a very positive step that -- I appreciate our bankers coming forward and agreeing with us that a lower covenant was appropriate. So as I said, I'm pleased with that step, and as I just said to Kartik, I think we're making really positive steps in capital stewardship. So I feel good about where we are, and we will -- we are working with our board. We're considering a number of options, and we'll have more to say about this in June.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes. So no commitment to any way of how the large amount of cash proceeds from RSM are going to be handled at this point?","William C. Cobb","So I'll say it again. We're in the middle of a tax season. So we have to complete the tax season. We then have to close our books for the year. And I have a 6-month board. I\u2019m a 9-month CEO. We are working through that. But we will be discussing this in June with all of you.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. More positively, Jeff, on validity, am I calculating that right on the 220 that you assessed in the quarter of put-backs? It looks like that was only a 1% rate. Is my math accurate?","Jeffrey  T. Brown","You're right, Scott. We did have a very low validity rate this quarter. I don't know that I'd read anything extraordinary into that. I think claim volumes can go up quarter-to-quarter. Validity rates can sometimes fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I would tend to look at kind of our longer-term trend, which in recent quarters, has been high single-digit validity rates. That's probably where I would tend to focus.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And it's true that those -- though, that 220 that you would have reviewed was from that -- the sizable amount from the prior quarter, correct?","Jeffrey  T. Brown","They would have been principally from the Q2 claims. It might have included a little bit of carryover from the first quarter, but principally from the new claim volume in Q2.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","The Emerald Card level of -- it was nice growth. I think it was 22% year-over-year, up to 2.6. I recall a different target at Investor Day. Could you just clarify the difference between the 2 and the longer-term plans for Emerald card overall?","William C. Cobb","Scott, I think that's a great question. Let me just go back for a second. The Emerald Card, we do have high hopes for this. We think we've done a good job. We're pleased that we're moving in the right direction. Obviously, the Emerald Cards were a beneficiary from the free-RAC program, and we have Susan Ehrlich on board right now. She's building her team out. And so I think all -- it's all green lights on that, and stay tuned for more to come. I think with regard to whether we hit -- we had a pretty big goal out there. We're going to come short of that. But again, the most important point of what we're trying to do in the first half of the season was to be able to offer the free RAC program and be able to use that against what competitors are doing and what ultimately maybe the last season of RALs. So I think that we're -- that was our first priority was around the competitive arena. But when you look at the take-up on Emerald Cards through Q3, these are the highest numbers we've ever done in history. We're at 2.6 million. So while we may have shot higher, I'm really pleased to say that we have 22% more out there, and I'm looking for Susan and Kathy Barney and the team to continue to drive us north in that whole area.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'm going to sneak one more in. Just on some of the new initiatives. On the 350,000 downloads on mobile tablet, that sounds good. I'm curious, I think the term used was downloads. I'm curious, is there a conversion number? And I think you said 90% of that was new to Block people. So that sounds great. But just wondering how many went through. Were there any tech issues in the process? And then, Bill, I think you Block Live ahead of the curve. I was just wondering if you could give kind of what measures you're using and what your benchmark was.","William C. Cobb","Okay. Jason, why don't you take the first half? And I'll talk about Block Live.","Jason Houseworth","Okay. Scott, this is Jason. So yes, the 350,000 number was our downloads across all of our apps. And what we said was that when we've seen people file, that 9 out of 10 are new H&R Block customers, and that's what we're excited about. We're glad that we're in a channel where we can serve people any way that they want to be served. And then we're finding new -- ways to reach new customers that we weren't doing before. I think we're still learning in mobile. I think that we have some things that I think we\u2019ve improved over the course of the season, particularly in regards to our OCR capabilities. But if we're not there, we don't have any chance to really improve. So I think that we\u2019ve made a solid first step. And I think that the season has really allowed us to use [ph] our mobile product suite even better.","William C. Cobb","Now with regard to Block Live, and Phil, feel free to jump in on some of the operational aspects or your perspective on this. When I said well ahead of the curve, obviously, we're faced with Intuit coming out with their 700 people. We felt that Block Live was a much better experience because it is a web-based service. It provides virtualized access. It's realtime assisted tax-preparation. So when I was talking about well ahead, I think it's in terms of being on trend, being ahead of the time, being a platform, a service platform that we can build upon going forward. And our real intention this year was twofold. One, to make sure that the people who did use it, the user experience was a positive one, and I think we're pleased on that. And the other was to operationalize this, and why don't I let Phil comment on that?","Philip L. Mazzini","Okay. I'll just reiterate the goal was to launch a virtual product, and I think we've done that successfully. We're creating a very good user experience. Behavior -- consumer behavior in this category changes -- it doesn't change real quickly. But we're very pleased to have this product out there. From an operations standpoint, the people involved in this launch have done a great job. And when you -- I visited a number of tax offices this year that have the Block Live in them, and I can tell you there's a lot of enthusiasm around the product, around the offering. And I think what I see in the future is that this will be another way that we can serve all of our clients in the way they want to be served. And I think most people or the people in our network are very excited about that as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vishnu Lekraj with MorningStar.","Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up here on pricing again, if you guys can repeat this for me. For the retail branches, Phil, you said that pricing is going to be slightly up this year, correct? Or you expect that?","Philip L. Mazzini","Yes. We expect it to be slightly up this year. Correct.","Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then, Jason, you said your online returns are going to be kind of down this year, correct?","Jason Houseworth","I didn't say that. I said in online we've seen a favorable product mix, and we've had stronger product attaches with regards to RACs.","Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Got you. All right. As far as your growth here over the first half of the season for the retail operations, it looks like about 2% for total retail. How should we think about this for the second half in terms of year-over-year growth? And if you can characterize it in terms of an acceleration or not.","William C. Cobb","Phil, you want to take that?","Philip L. Mazzini","Yes, I will. I'll just say that we're very excited about the second half. In the last few seasons, we've seen satisfaction improved in the second half. And we\u2019ve had relatively good performance in our second half. So we're excited about it. We look forward to working hard through the season. We're very focused on our Second Look offering, which -- it doesn't just drive people in for the product itself. But it says a lot about the expertise in our offices, and we're excited about it, and we think we'll have a solid second half.","William C. Cobb","I would just add, Vishnu, obviously this is my first tax season, looking at it on a day-to-day basis. And unfortunately, with some of the unfortunate delays that came from the IRS and the way it affected our clients, with clients being -- getting their refunds later and obviously with this being -- with much of our target the biggest financial event of the year, I think it was unfortunate for those clients, the delays. But I'm really proud of the system, how well they've handled this. I think, and everyone has told me, I mean this is an operational machine, and this is one of the best years, I've been told, in terms of operational readiness. So we are, I think, well positioned. There's nothing that should inhibit us, but we are well set up. Phil and his team have done a great job. So I'm really looking forward to the second half of the year. And I think that the IRS thing was unfortunate. It affected our clients. But I'm really excited about the way our teams are ready.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","It looks like on your retention rate, could you maybe confirm -- I wanted to make sure I got these right. There was a bunch of numbers thrown out there. It looks like your retention rate through -- these would all be through the end of February. Total retention rate was up 40 basis points?","Jeffrey  T. Brown","Correct.","William C. Cobb","It's correct.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","And then on the 1040EZ, plus 5%? And new clients...","William C. Cobb","500 basis points. 500 basis points, and that was taking, Mike, last year's new EZ clients relative to our historical level, and that's up 500 basis points.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then new -- I guess retention of new clients from last year was up 10%. Is that right?","William C. Cobb","So that was only on Second Looks.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","On Second Looks. Okay. Could you talk about then maybe just overall new client growth and then also how that relates to kind of what you set out in your Investor Day of targeting those really first 3 segments, maybe how your success has been there relative to your expectations?","William C. Cobb","I'll let Phil comment on this. We're not breaking out segment growth or anything like that at this point. But I'll let Phil comment on generally how we feel to where things are going.","Philip L. Mazzini","Yes. I think what I would say here is that our new client growth last year was extremely strong, and you have to keep that in mind. And we're very proud of that. And as we go forward, we're very pleased with our new client generation this year as well. If you look at our base last year and the year before, it's a good way to think about how we're growing new clients. And we feel very good about our new client generation in the first half. And as we move forward, I think we'll continue to feel good about how we've closed out the season.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So at your December Investor Day, you outlined that you plan to invest $50 million to $65 million this year on marketing, product development and client growth promotions. Can you give us an update on if that's still the right goal and also what percentage of that you think you've incurred already, especially with you guys coming short with Emerald Card conversions?","Jeffrey  T. Brown","Thomas, this is Jeff. So yes, we still plan to and, in fact, have executed the investments that we talked about in our Investor Day conference. Just a reminder that we frame that as investments in the aggregate of about $60 million to $65 million, and they were principally focused on media spend, the free RAC promotion, as well as the launch of some of our new products, mobile and Block Live this year. Most of that investment was really focused on early-season growth targets, both in our Emerald Cards, as well as tax clients. And so I think you're seeing substantially all of that investment in the first quarter results.","William C. Cobb","And I would also add one thing, Thomas. I think we're kind of facing 2 -- as we looked at the season, and it has really played out this way, we're sort of facing 2, what we believe, if you will, were competitive onslaughts. One was we anticipated and all the signaling from Intuit was that TurboTax was going to come out and spend very aggressively not only on their 700 folks, but also in media, and that has played out. They have been very aggressive on the media line, as have we. Their spending level is probably, as a percentage, even higher than ours. And then we're also up against the RAL issue with some of our -- with a number of independents and some of the branded retail competitors. So we were working against 2 arenas. And they also were, as Jeff has outlined, primarily going to be early-season initiatives. I mean, I think anybody who was watching television from December 26 through January 31, during the [indiscernible] the tax wars were kind of -- there were plenty of ads on the air from everybody, including other digital competitors, et cetera, and Jackson Hewitt. So there was a lot of noise in the category. I think we were very effective in being there, being ready, not being left behind. But to your overall point, I think Jeff's laid out the majority of that increment, if you will, is behind us.","Jeffrey  T. Brown","And I think I'll just add, at the same time, we feel good -- without getting specific, we feel good about our investment levels in the second half.","Jason Houseworth","And Thomas, this is Jason Houseworth. With our investment from a marketing perspective in Digital, I think Bill made the point in his remarks, but year-over-year, we're up 13% on our awareness, even with all the noise that he mentioned. And that -- in one year, that's a big jump, as well as seeing, what I mentioned, as far as product improvements yielding retention and monetization are really product mix and attach improvements.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And as the -- I don't think the 10-Q is out yet. Can you give us a sense of how much advertising spend was up this quarter and then what your expectations are for the fourth quarter, given the investment was mostly in the third quarter? And as that's a short question, can I also ask, have you seen any positive signs where to increase usage of the Emerald Card? And anything that gives you guys confidence that people will continue to use it post the end of tax season?","William C. Cobb","Jeff, why don't you take the first part?","Jeffrey  T. Brown","Sure. Thomas, so I would just say that we did file our 10-Q late this afternoon, so I'm sure it's not available for you to see yet or you haven't had a chance, but it will be available for you to see tomorrow. And relative to the increased level in media spend, I did comment in the prepared remarks that within the first quarter, our media spend was $20 million higher than third quarter last year.","William C. Cobb","Third quarter to third quarter.","Jeffrey  T. Brown","Third quarter to third quarter.","William C. Cobb","You meant third quarter to third quarter. Okay. Now Thomas, with regard to the Emerald Card, with some of the catching up that the IRS needs to do on refunds, it's still early yet to see the impact. I will say that I think the team has really done a nice job. We had never done a direct mail campaign. We're welcoming people to the card. I think we've got some plans in place. But I look for this to be -- to only grow for us over the coming years. So too early to tell yet on attach rates and year-round usage as we embark into the season. But I think, again, we're more prepared, and I think we're moving in the right direction.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The 10-Q literally just hit my e-mail.","Jeffrey  T. Brown","There you go.","William C. Cobb","Did I give the right answer, Thomas?","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then if I could fit in another one quickly. Can you remind us about the economics around the Second Look program? And then how much of your fourth quarter growth last year came from it?","William C. Cobb","I'll let Phil -- we're not going to -- I don't think we disclose any specifics around Second Looks. But I'll let Phil comment.","Philip L. Mazzini","The Second Look program goes beyond -- what I would say -- I want to simplify this. It is twofold. We can -- it's an invitation to try our service and to get connected to one of our expert tax professionals, and that -- it's very effective at doing that. It's a very easy way to invite someone in, a risk-free way. And it's worked very effectively. I think beyond that, we do use it in our advertising, of course. And it's not just about the Second Look itself, it's about what it means and what our experts are able to determine about tax returns generally.","William C. Cobb","I'd say a couple of other things in addition to what Phil just outlined, Thomas. And one of these is probably hard to measure. But we're really proud of the Second Look program. What the folks did in Indiana a couple of weeks ago, I mean, that fired the whole building here up and the team. And saving clients almost $1.5 million says something about the character of the company and the brand. Now specific to the business itself, we've put a big effort on this. It was more of a second-half initiative last year. We did these rallies this year. And for our reviews to be up 100% and then to get out of that the number of returns generated growing nearly 50%, that not only is meaningful to us from a brand and a satisfaction for all of us who work here. But I mean, that's real business growth, and with the client retention rate up 10 points, this is a big important deal to us as a company.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Derek Drysdale","All right, everyone, thank you for joining us.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2018 second quarter results. On the call today are Jeff Jones, our President and CEO and Tony Bowen, our CFO.","We posted today\u2019s press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com.

Some of the figures that we\u2019ll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis.

During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up after which they may choose to jump back into the queue.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Colby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019m really delighted to be here with you all this morning. It\u2019s been a busy first few months, and I\u2019ve been immersing myself in the business, which has only reinforced my decision to join this great company.","H&R Block is a trusted brand that at its core is about helping people. And while much of what I\u2019ve learned will help inform our long-term strategy my number one priority is delivering a successful tax season 2018. We\u2019re excited and we\u2019re ready for the season to begin.","Today, I\u2019d like to provide some insight on what attracted me to H&R Block, my approach to the business and the planning process we are kicking off to take a fresh look at our long-term strategy. Given that our primary focus is delivering a strong tax season, I\u2019ll spend the majority of my time discussing key elements of our seasonal plan. I\u2019ll then provide our perspective on tax legislation and what it means for H&R Block. Tony will then walk you through our second quarter results, as well as our financial outlook for fiscal 2018.","So let me begin by talking a little bit about what attracted me to H&R Block. As I mentioned, this is a trusted brand with even greater potential. H&R Block\u2019s existence is based on something that truly matters, helping our clients during one of the most important financial transactions of the year.","Our client relationships are grounded in expertise and emphasis something that\u2019s rarely seen in other businesses. I\u2019ve spent the past 60 days immersing myself in the business, including better understanding our capabilities. I\u2019ve visited nearly a dozen offices in the U.S. and Canada. I\u2019ve met with nearly 70 franchisees and I\u2019ve hosted client focus groups in key cities. I spent time one-on-one with each Board member, and I\u2019ve been working closely with the senior leadership team reviewing our operational plans for the upcoming season.","Let me walk you through some of my initial observations. We have built a tremendous amount of trust with our clients. Based on a long history of doing everything we can to help our clients get the best outcome and knowing we stand behind them should questions arise.","While we have this great base and trust with our clients, there is more we can do to be better at anticipating and exceeding our client needs. This client centric-approach is what I will bring to everything we do. And though we\u2019re trusted, we aren\u2019t as relevant as we need to be to today\u2019s consumer. We aren\u2019t viewed as a modern brand with the capabilities of delivering our products and services to clients in all the ways they want to be served.","My initial observations are that we have opportunities to deliver this relevance by improving our tax preparation service delivery, modernizing our client acquisition methods and investing in our core capabilities. Relevance translates to client growth and retention, the keys to sustainable growth.","Additionally, we have been extremely impatient, starting initiatives and then stopping them after one season. We can be even more client-centric in developing new products and programs and more patient and willing to iterate and improve on what we learned. These observations will help inform the development of our long-term strategy. Important to any strategy is knowing where we want to go and the Board and I are aligned that the key to our success is determining a path to sustainable growth.","We\u2019ve begun work on establishing a strategic framework that includes making ongoing improvements to the business by focusing on what matters most our relationship with our clients and taking a multi-year approach. We cannot continue to focus only on the upcoming tax season.","Another way of thinking about this approach is that, we must exhibit both urgency and patience. Urgency in coming to the right strategy that best meets the needs of our clients and patience to execute consistently year-over-year to learn and to adjust. We have tried a lot of things in the past and there are opportunities to be better. We will take the lessons learned from our past strategies, but our approach will be different.","We will be more focused than ever on our clients and understanding how they want to interact with us and ensuring, we\u2019re well-positioned to innovate as the overall tax preparation market continues to evolve. There will obviously be more to come on this and we\u2019ll be working over the next six to 12 months to develop the winning multi-year strategy and we\u2019ll share more details at a later date.","For now, I would like to talk about our top priority delivering accessible successful tax season 2018. Our primary objective this season remains unchanged to continue improving our client trajectory. To achieve this objective, we\u2019re focused on three areas: operational excellence, new products and partnerships, and compelling marketing and promotions.","The order of these three is very intentional, as operational excellence must be the foundation for everything we do, especially in how we deliver our tax products and services. We made great strides last year with significant client experience improvements. Our assistance to clients are now more engaged in the process and we\u2019re demonstrating our expertise in more tangible ways.","In our DIY offerings, we made it simpler to import your prior year return and current year tax forms through drag and drop and photo capture, and we have much more planned for the upcoming season. But it\u2019s not just about making improvements. The key to our success will be exceeding our clients\u2019 expectations and executing flawlessly.","Next, we\u2019re launching a number of new products in partnerships this season. For the in-office assisted experience, our clients and tax pros will benefit from our enhanced client experience, including the expertise of Watson. Watson\u2019s augmented intelligence combined with our internal data analytics assist our tax pros in identifying every deduction and every credit available for our clients.","Additionally, this year, we had a new enhancement called People Like Me for our client to itemize deductions or have business income on Schedule C. If a client is a pet groomer, a flight attendant, or police officer, or one of a 120 other professions, they will receive occupation specific advice during the tax preparation process.","We believe this tailored advice, which complements our tax pros expertise will be incredibly valuable in these filings. These innovations in our assisted business continue to be backed by an industry-leading suite of value-added products, including Emerald Card, Tax Identity Shield and Peace of Mind.","In DIY, we\u2019ve made additional user experience enhancements, building upon the improvements made last year. The first significant change is in our importing capabilities. Last year, our product was able to import more forms than anyone else in the industry. This year, approximately 98% of our client source documents can be digitally imported via drag and drop or photo capture. This represent an increase of 28 points over last year.","In mobile, we\u2019re making improvement for the user experience to enable simpler engagement, enhance personalization and ultimately improve conversion.","And finally, we\u2019re providing proactive occupation-based help to ensure our client gets every deduction in credit available. In addition to all these enhancements, we have introduced a new online product for self-employed filers addressing the growing need of this segment. And I\u2019m excited to announce that we\u2019re partnering with Stride, an industry-leading provider of software and services for self-employed individuals.","By bringing together the capabilities of our two brands, we will enable those who are self-employed easily track their expenses, import them into our digital tax products and file their taxes. There are two additional partnerships in the DIY space and I\u2019d like to highlight Amazon and Walmart, as we\u2019ve enhanced our relationship with both.","At Amazon, we\u2019ve secured better product placement and promotional offerings. Additionally, our full range of tax products and services will be promoted on Amazon, including our new product, H&R Block Tax Pro Go, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. And we\u2019re also thrilled to be the exclusive tax software brand sold by Walmart this year, further exposing our products and services to a broad group of consumers. These are two significant partnerships for us, as we\u2019re bringing H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent most.","While we\u2019re pleased with the progress being made in both the assisted and DIY channels, we know that we\u2019re changing consumer behaviors. We need to do more and serve our clients in all the ways they want.","As tax preparation evolves, consumers are looking for new ways to get help. To that end, we\u2019ve developed two new products that combined the empowerment of our digital offering with our industry-leading tax expertise. The first product is called Tax Pro Review, an improved version of an innovative product we have previously offered called Best of Both.","Clients begin their tax return online. And if they want help, they\u2019re seamlessly matched with one of our tax pros. When the return is complete, the tax pro will then start review, sign and e-file the return. This is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from the Peace of Mind of knowing that one of our highly trained experts has identified all applicable credit to deduction and has also reviewed their return for accuracy.","The second product is a unique and completely new way for clients to interact with our brands called H&R Block Tax Pro Go. This product addresses the needs of a large number of consumers who want assistance, but don\u2019t want or has the time to visit one of our offices or to start their taxes themselves within DIY product. We know that while approximately 50% of taxpayers want assistance, not all when it go to an office to get help.","H&R Block Tax Pro Go clients will know their price upfront, upload their documents through the secure MyBlock portal and we will work virtually with one of our tax pros to ensure they get every applicable credit and deduction. We\u2019re bringing all the expertise and service our clients want directly to them.","The innovative products have been designed to meet evolving consumer needs and begin to represent a range of ways consumers can count on H&R Block, whether they need a little help or complete in-person assistance continuing to position us as the expert in the tax industry. In addition to the exciting product lineup we\u2019re offering this season, we will also offer compelling promotions to drive demand for the H&R Block brand.","Let\u2019s start with Refund Advance, our interest-free early season loan. We\u2019re excited that it was added a $3,000 loan level in addition to the loan amount offered last season. We believe this will be one of the most competitive loan amounts offered, providing our clients early access to an even greater amount of their refund, in most cases on the same day in which they file their taxes.","Also in assisted, we will again offer the three federal 1040EZ program. Having competitive free offer in the market is key to attracting new clients. Similarly in DIY, we\u2019re bringing back H&R Block More Zero, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population this file both our federal and state taxes for free. Those three federal 1040EZ and H&R Block More Zero are proven new client drivers that offer the opportunity for us to showcase the value of our products and services. All of these products, partnerships and promotions will be backed by a strong integrated marketing campaign.","Last year\u2019s introduction of the Get Your Taxes Won Campaign highlighted the power of pairing H&R Block tax pros with IBM Watson to achieve the optimal outcome for every client, as well as the innovative capabilities of our DIY offering. The campaign featuring Jon Hamm was highly motivated in consumers and we\u2019ll continue with new creative executions into 2018.","Before handling the call \u2013 handing the call over to Tony, I would like to talk for a few minutes about tax legislation, something that\u2019s obviously been getting a lot of attention. It\u2019s difficult to predict what the ultimate outcome will be, but something will likely be passed for the 2018 calendar year, impacting tax season 2019. However, some aspects could be made retroactive to 2017. Obviously, we\u2019re monitoring these developments very closely.","Changes to the tax code are nothing new. Since our founding in 1955, there have been 33 significant changes. Through all of these modifications, taxpayers continue to seek assistance. Taxes will likely change for millions of Americans, but the underlying value of helping people will not. In fact, for those taxpayers trying to understand what the new tax law means for them or in-person network of nearly 80,000 tax pros, we\u2019ll continue to provide tremendous value.","One of the key components of the proposed legislation is the increase in the standard deduction. This change does not impact the majority of the filers, as approximately 70% currently change the standard deduction, and that number is even higher for H&R Block clients.","And while much attention has been given to the increase in the standard deduction, many taxpayers will still be required to file multiple forms and worksheets for various sources of income and credits that are not going away. For example, the proposed 14-line postcard tax return includes refundable credits, something we know taxpayers who want to help with to ensure they\u2019re getting all the credits to which they\u2019re entitled.","Millions of filers claim credit such as the Child Tax Credit and EITC, all of which will require several pages of forms to determine eligibility and amount due. Additionally, the millions of Americans who own a small business or a self-employed will still be required to file additional forms to report their income. Many of these filers need assistance in determining, which expenses they can deduct to minimize their tax liability.","And finally, all the changes we\u2019ve discussed deployed as federal taxes and did not directly change the various state tax laws. Of course, to this point, I\u2019ve always read individual tax list. The proposed lower corporate tax rate is enacted. We\u2019ll have a positive impact on our cash flow and bottom line, given we\u2019re primarily a domestic business with historical effective tax rate in the mid-30% range.","So no matter what changes are ultimately made. I\u2019m convinced the value of H&R Block remains our ability to help. It\u2019s our job to adjust to the changing tax code and help our clients get all the credits and all the deductions they deserve, who know all the ways they want to interact with us. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll continue to do.","In summary, we\u2019re excited about the upcoming tax season. We believe we\u2019ll continue to improve the client trajectory through operational excellence, new products and partnerships and compelling marketing and promotions.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Tony to discuss the second quarter financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2018.","Tony Bowen","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Jeff. We\u2019re excited to have you here. As a reminder, due to seasonality of our business, second quarter results are not representative of our full-year performance. To put it into perspective, second quarter results typically represent less than 5% of our annual revenues and approximately 15% of our annual expenses. That said, our results were in line with our expectations.","With that as a backdrop, I would like to provide additional context on the quarter. Revenues increased $10 million, or 7% to $141 million, primarily due to increased international tax preparation fees, positive fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and favorable preseason results in the U.S.","Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses increased $18 million, or 5% to $357 million, due to compensation and occupancy costs. Compensation and cost increased due to the variable labor related to revenue increases in the U.S. and Australia, as well as planned conversion of high cost contract labor to lower cost full-time associates.","Additionally, a portion of the increase in both compensation and occupancy cost was driven by prior year acquisitions of franchisees and inflationary increases. It\u2019s important to note that the percentage increase in total operating expenses is influenced by the relatively low base. As I shared, the second quarter typically represents approximately 15% of our annual expenses.","I\u2019ll provide thoughts on our fiscal year outlook later, but can say that this year, this quarter\u2019s operating expense increase of 5% does not reflect our expectation for the full-year. Compared to the prior year, we saw interest expense decreased $1 million due to lower draws on our line of credit. The quarter\u2019s effective income tax rate was relatively unchanged from the prior year, as higher discrete tax benefits were offset by a lower base rate, both of which are beneficial from a full-year perspective.","Finally, loss per share increased $0.04 from $0.67 to $0.71 per share. Approximately, half of the increase was due to the reduction in share count, which will be accretive on a full-year basis, but negatively impact those quarters with a loss.","Turning to discontinued operations, there were no material changes in estimated contingent losses related to Sand Canyon Corporation. For additional information, please refer to disclosures in the company\u2019s reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC filings. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operates a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil-piercing arguments.","With that summary of the quarter, I\u2019d now like to provide our outlook for the upcoming tax season and fiscal year. Starting with the tax industry after a unique tax season 2017, we anticipate industry volumes to return to more historical growth levels, with overall returns growing around 1% in tax season 2018. We anticipate industry-assisted volumes to be flat to slightly up, with most of the growth coming in DIY.","Turning to our assisted business, after taking a significant step forward last year, we expect continued improvement in our client trajectory this tax season. This improvement will be driven by our free EZ promotion and our improved Refund Advance offerings, as well as our client experience enhancements.","Regarding product, we expect to continue moderate inflationary price increases, understand that we cannot be too aggressive on price and expect to improve the client trajectory at the same time. In DIY, we expect client growth on the strength of our product improvements, our compelling offers in the marketplace and the enhanced partnerships that Jeff discussed.","Our net average charge in DIY is expected to be consistent with fiscal 2017, which represented a reset for us, given the introduction of the H&R Block More Zero promotion. The net result of these changes is that, we expect overall revenue to increase modestly in fiscal 2018.","Turning to EBITDA margin. Last year, we came in at the upper-end of our 27% to 30% range. Considering our revenue projection, continued productivity initiatives and the impact of inflationary cost and investments, we expect fiscal 2018 EBITDA to also be at the high-end of the 27% to 30% range.","I\u2019ll now provide thoughts on the other areas of the financial statements. As for capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximate 3% of revenues, or $95 million to $100 million in fiscal 2018. With respect to acquisitions, our franchise repurchase activity will continue to moderate, while our purchases of independent locations will likely be consistent with prior year levels. Both franchise repurchases and independent acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our current trading multiple and as such are accretive to earnings.","We anticipate closing out the year having repurchased approximately 100 franchise locations and adding approximately 45 independent locations to our network for a total capital investment of approximately $40 million.","Moving to deprecation and amortization, given the level of franchise repurchases and capital expenditures in prior years, D&A will be consistent with last year. We expect fiscal 2018 to be the high watermark for D&A at $180 million to $185 million. In general, approximately two-thirds of our D&A is CapEx-related, while the remaining one-third is related to acquisitions.","As for the tax rate, we expect both our fiscal 2018, the effective tax rate and long-term base rate to be in the 33% to 35% range. Note that this range does not consider any implication to corporate tax legislation, which we would expect to be positive for the company.","I\u2019ll now take a moment to talk about some of the specific elements of our capital structure. With regard to liquidity, I\u2019m pleased that we were able to extend the maturity date of our $2 billion line of credit, an additional year to September 2022. Specific to fiscal 2018, we expect total interest expense to be $85 million to $90 million.","In regards to capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. At the top of the list is maintaining adequate liquidity for operational needs to account for our seasonal business. We then will make disciplined investments back into the business that we will \u2013 that we believe deliver value to our clients and drive sustainable growth. We didn\u2019t pay dividends and have returned excess capital through share repurchases. These priorities are grounded in our intent to maintain investment grade credit rating metrics.","As Jeff mentioned earlier, we have just begun the work on our long-term strategy and capital allocation will be an important consideration in this effort. Because of this, we have not made any share repurchases so far this fiscal year and do not expect any significant share repurchases for the remainder of the fiscal year.","As a result, we expect average fully diluted shares of approximately 209 million to 211 million for the full fiscal year 2018. As a reminder, we repurchased $2.3 billion worth of shares, representing approximately 26% of our shares outstanding over the past two fiscal years. Additionally, we\u2019ve increased the dividend consecutively the past two fiscal years, returning nearly $400 million.","In closing, I want to emphasize that we have a strong history of returning capital to shareholders and continue to believe that dividend and share repurchases are key levers in our capital allocation strategy. We\u2019re ready for the upcoming tax season and look forward to delivering strong results this fiscal year.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Tony. I want to reiterate how excited I\u2019m to be here and how ready we are for the tax season to begin. We have plans in place to deliver compelling value for our clients, and we\u2019ll continue to be aggressive in the market through new partnerships and products and compelling promotions that resonate with consumers all backed by a strong integrated marketing campaigns. And we will deliver this to operational excellence as the foundation beneath it all. We look forward to sharing more when we report our third quarter results.","And with that, we\u2019ll open the line for questions. Tanya?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] So our first question comes from the line of Anjeneya Singh with Credit Suisse.","Anjeneya Singh","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, and welcome, Jeff, excited about having you at the helm at H&R Block. So a question on Tax Pro Go. I was interested to hear that offering. Is this more reactive on your end and driven by client feedback, or is this more proactive on your end as you\u2019re targeting in unmet need? And if this were to gain scale, any thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about your store footprint going forward? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones","Anj, great to meet you as well. So let me add a couple of comments and then I\u2019ll let Tony give some more detail prior to my arrival. This was absolutely a product that was in development and I was thrilled to see within development, because it was completely based on consumer need. And I think as we have done more and more to understand discrete consumer segment, this is a really great opportunity for a consumer that really wants a lot of help but for some reason, they can\u2019t or they don\u2019t want to visit a national office.","And so getting more and more clear on understanding that segment will happen over time as we launch and iterate on this product, but it was absolutely driven by consumer need in our segmentation.","Tony Bowen","Yes, just to add to that, Anj, we\u2019re not looking at this is a way to reduce our store footprint, obviously, in the short-term, given this is just the initial launch of the product. We\u2019re a long way from having that discussion. It will be delivered with the tax pros that sit in our retail locations and essentially utilizing excess capacity that we have across our nearly 80,000 tax professionals. But it\u2019s still way too early to talk about any impact on our footprint.","Anjeneya Singh","Okay. Okay, got it. And as a second question, one for Tony, I realize you probably don\u2019t want to get too granular on the margin guidance, but I want to take a crack at the question anyway. So it seems like, consensus is modeling your margins compressing 80 bps year-over-year. And I think, as a base case scenario, when you folks have talked about the $15 million of one-time benefits in 2017, it would imply a 50-ish basis point drag year-over-year. So as we look at your guidance, could you talk about, what are the productivity initiatives, if you can elaborate on those that give you confidence on comparable margins year-over-year?","Tony Bowen","Yes. So there\u2019s obviously a lot that goes into it. We did have the $15 million benefit in 2017, Anj, you mentioned that won\u2019t recur in 2018. We also have some normal inflationary increases that are going to roll in this year. We\u2019ve got the additional locations that we\u2019ve added due to franchise buybacks.","I\u2019m not going to comment specifically on some of the various productivity initiatives. To be honest, it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s no one thing that we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s just continuing to monitor our expenses closely to try to drive that. But also the margin is benefited by the fact that we expect to grow revenue, which I highlighted as well. We do expect modest revenue growth and that obviously provide some margin relief as well. So overall, we feel good about where it\u2019s rolling up, and obviously expecting at the high-end of the range this year.","Anjeneya Singh","Okay. Thanks so much.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Anj.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta","Hey, good morning. Jeff, I wanted to ask you just about client count, you talked about modest core improvement. And does that imply that you can get to a flat number this year, or do you think it will be just improvement from last year and will take a little while to kind of get to flat and then grow?","Jeffrey Jones","Again, I will kind of tee up some comments on what I\u2019m seeing and let Tony comment more if he wants to. But I think, our goal in the assisted business is continue to improve on the client trajectory and ultimately, we want to see that turn and grow, but not for this year. I think, the growth in clients we expect to continue to come from the DIY business.","When I talked earlier about some of my observations, I think, when I talked about relevance and having a relevant value proposition that work as it relates to our long-term strategy the goal ultimately has to become sustainable growth and we will ultimately expect that to be in clients.","Tony Bowen","I don\u2019t have a lot more to add. I do think, overall, clients, Kartik, should grow really driven by DIY, but we\u2019re not commenting specifically on where we think assisted will land other than it\u2019s going to be better than the trajectory and the performance we had last year.","Kartik Mehta","And then, Tony, on tax reform from a corporate standpoint, at least, on the proposals that are out there right now, what type of benefit do you \u2013 and still would you anticipate for Block?","Tony Bowen","Yes. So, as you know Kartik, we\u2019re in the mid-30% range today, that includes both federal and state. So really on the federal side, the proposal is reducing it down to 20%. We\u2019re still working through the exact impact. There\u2019s obviously a lot of complexity. And reality is, it\u2019s still being debated. It\u2019s in conference right now between the Senate and the House.","So, I\u2019ve got the team hard at work, but we\u2019re still cracking the numbers. And I think, regardless, it\u2019s probably going to change before it comes to final law, if you will. So more to share at the appropriate time, but will definitely get a benefit, given our federal rate is closer to 30% than it is at 20%. But exactly, what the impact is, whether or not you\u2019re going to be able to deduct state taxes against your federal, et cetera, there\u2019s still a lot of open questions that are still to be determined.","Kartik Mehta","Thanks, Tony, I appreciate it.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Kartik.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Hey, good morning, and welcome, Jeff. So first on assisted volumes. if you were to split off assisted volumes between client retention and new additions could you just remind us how last year went? How do you think this is going to go?","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Thomas. So we did get an increase in retention last year by about 2 points. We also were able to grow the new clients last year as well. This year, we think it\u2019s going to be improvements, probably going to come more on the new client side.","I mean, we would love to see an improvement in retention. Again, we got a pretty good increase last year. It\u2019s not going as an expectation. We think it\u2019s possible that it could go up, but it\u2019s not a base expectation. So most of the improvement is going to come from continuing to bring in more new clients in 2018 versus what we had in 2017.","Thomas Allen","Helpful, thanks. And then just thinking about capital return, obviously, it\u2019s not the most efficient thing to just have cash sit on your balance sheet and you should be generating a lot of cash this year. So like could we may be expect to catch up on the lack of buyback this year and next year, or I mean, how are you thinking about that?","Jeffrey Jones","Thomas, this is Jeff. Let me just tee it up real quick and I\u2019ll let Tony jump in. Capital allocation is obviously very important part of our long-term strategy. And with the CEO transition in my arrival, we did not make any share repurchases during the quarter. And honestly, we felt that was prudent just considering we\u2019re about to embark on a fresh long-term look at our strategy. But I like Tony to comment more and more just how we\u2019re thinking about it.","Tony Bowen","Yes, I mean, Thomas, obviously, we still have the cash. We didn\u2019t do anything else with it. So to your point, there obviously could be a catch up. But I think, to Jeff\u2019s point, we really want to keep our options open. And until we know exactly where we\u2019re going, what required investments we\u2019re going to need to make back into the business we just felt that it was prudent to give us some x amount of flexibility, as we approach this new strategic work.","Thomas Allen","Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Thomas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. I wanted to talk about some of your marketing plans for this year. I\u2019m just curious in the message that you\u2019re going to be giving out. Are you going to be focusing more on the DIY product than you have in the past?","Jeffrey Jones","Good morning. It\u2019s Jeff Jones. Yes, we will be more aggressively marketing DIY product this year than we have in the past.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Any color on that? I mean, I guess, part of the criticism in the past is that a lot of people were not even aware or maybe less aware of the fact that you had a DIY product. So any color on that would be great?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, and I think you just hit on it. I have the same reaction, as I assessed my options to join the company. When I arrived, I was thrilled to see the team had their own understanding of that as well. And they were well underway of developing mass advertising to make sure people knew it not only we were in the business, but we have a really compelling product and we were proud for people to use it. So you will see us be more present and communicate more about our DIY products in general.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. And then I have \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.","Tony Bowen","But Jeff, the only thing I was going to add is, obviously, the Tax Pro Review, we view as DIY offering, where you\u2019ve got obviously the option for help if you need it. So that would be a key part of our marketing plan this year, as well as it\u2019s essentially relaunching that product.","Jeff Silber","Great. And that\u2019s actually segmented to my follow-up. In terms of Tax Pro Review and a Tax Pro Go product, can you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy for both of those?","Jeffrey Jones","Sure. Given that they\u2019re delivered virtually, it gives us a lot of flexibility to try various prices. But in general, the pricing will be specifically between DIY-assisted. But we will be testing various price points as we try to assess consumer demand on a go-forward basis.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good morning. Just following-up on the last side of a question. With regard to marketing, what do you view for year-over-year as far as spend? Is that something that\u2019s going to be relatively flattish or might we see that go up on an absolute basis?","Jeffrey Jones","Good morning. It\u2019s Jeff. We\u2019re not going to comment on the exact levels of spending. But as I came in and assessed, both the level of investment and the way that investment was being directed, I feel very good about our plans since we\u2019ve been.","Tony Bowen","Yes. And Scott, the one thing I would add obviously, the marketing investment has contemplated in the EBITDA margin outlook that I discussed it earlier.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay, thanks. And then on \u2013 with regard to some of the products, the \u2013 did I hear correct, Tony, the Refund Advance loan will go up to $3,000 this year. Could you elaborate on where you think the competition will be, and how you might market around that as a differentiator? Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Yes, we\u2019ve seen a few different things in the marketplace, Scott. We\u2019ve seen $2,000 loans, $1,500 loans. I think, there was one that was similar to our $3,000 loan tier, and we are adding an additional loans tier. So we\u2019re be essentially 4 tiers, 500, 750, 1,250 and then 3,000. Obviously, we went out pretty big with the message last year. We expect to do that again this year. It was an effective campaign for us.","We think, there\u2019s still a lot of gas left in the tank. While we did \u2013 do a good job of getting the message out, I think, there\u2019s still a lot of potential clients who don\u2019t know about the offer. So this year having a larger loan amount continuing to pound the drum for a second-year in a row, tax professionals getting more comfortable, clients becoming less skeptical. I think, last year was a little bit of too good to be true.","But the fact that we actually did what we said we were going to do and clients were walking out of the office with up to \u2013 last year up to $1,250 loaded on their card, in some cases before they got in their car was a really good client experience. So we\u2019re pretty excited about the increase this year and definitely something we think is going to help us drive new clients into our offices.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. And just one more quick follow-up on something you said on the last question. The \u2013 for the new Tax Pro Review, in your press release, you had said between [59.99 and 89.99] [ph] and just how you respond to that prior question. Is that going to be fluid throughout the year? And might we see something outside of that range, or is it going to be in that range? Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Yes, I think, those prices are essentially viewed as almost I can attach to the DIY product. But I think, we will be testing various price points just to understand is there more demand at different levels within the DIY flow, but that is the base price that we\u2019re going to market with.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay. Thanks very much.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.","Mario Cortellacci","Hi, good morning. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Any updates on your thought process around monetizing your store base when you\u2019re not in tax season? I know you had a Block Advisors initiative, so wanted to see if there are any updates there?","Jeffrey Jones","Good morning, Mario, it\u2019s Jeff. So, I think, as we take a big step back and trying to figure out our ultimate path to sustainable growth. One of the things that I committed to do, which is a very objective, very methodical approach, taking nothing for granted and looking at any asset we have in the possibility of monetization. We\u2019re obviously just getting started on that. And so, it\u2019s too early to say now what those ideas may be. But I think, I owe to us to look at every possible option and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll do.","Mario Cortellacci","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Could you also give us a sense of how much room there is for you to buy more franchises in your system? And what are your returns looks like for those so far?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes. There\u2019s definitely additional franchise repurchase opportunities. As I said in my opening comments, we expect the volume to continue to decline. We repurchased about three years ago over 300 offices and it\u2019s been on a decline. We expect about 100 offices this year. So we\u2019ll continue to do a level of them, but I would expect that number to continue to moderate a lot of what we repurchased our larger operators who have been in the system for 20, 30-plus years and we\u2019re looking to essentially retire and exit.","So that those who have already been repurchased it, but opportunities will continue to come up. But it\u2019s not our goal to repurchase all franchise locations at this point, it\u2019s more just on an opportunistic basis in areas that make sense for us to operate.","As far as the return, we\u2019re rough about in the specific ROI. But I will tell you that the level that we\u2019re repurchasing these at are EBITDA multiples, that\u2019s well below what we\u2019re trading at as a public company. So it\u2019s accretive to earning. It\u2019s a positive return, and they\u2019re fairly seamless to integrate, given they\u2019re essentially operating like a normal company store.","Mario Cortellacci","Thank you so much, and good luck, Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Mario.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates.","Michael Millman","Thank you. Could you talk about how your tax for go pro compares with TurboTax\u2019s live, focusing to be sort of heading to sort of a collision? And secondly, on your RAs, do you expect that to continue to be offered with no additional cost to the taxpayer?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes. So the first one, Michael, so we view tax pro go is different than tax pro live as, at least, we understand it, I believe tax pro live is more of a DIY offer that then you can upgrade, if you need assistance, which is more comparable to our Tax Pro Review, which was previously Best of Both that we\u2019ve had in the marketplace for a number of years.","Tax pro go is what we view is more of a full-assisted experience. You upload the documents. You get a pricing upfront, tax pro in office has completed and then essentially you communicate virtually back and forth and approve and pay, et cetera. So it\u2019s more of a full-assisted experience versus the DIY upgrade product, that it more Tax Pro Review we have that as well.","When the refund advance, I actually didn\u2019t catch the end of that question. Oh, sorry. Yes, no, there definitely is no cost to the taxpayer. We\u2019ll continue to be a free product. Obviously, last year, we didn\u2019t change the pricing on those clients either. So it\u2019s really \u2013 we\u2019re viewing it as a marketing tool to drive new clients into our offices.","Michael Millman","Thank you. Excellent.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Tanya. Thanks again everyone for joining us, and this will conclude today\u2019s call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

As many of you know, I transitioned into the Investor Relation role last quarter and have enjoyed getting to know many of you. I look forward to working with you over the coming months.","Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Other members of our senior management team will be available during the Q&A session.","In connection with this call, we have posted today's press release and slide presentation on the Investor Relations website at www.hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release and in the Appendix of today's slide presentation.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws.

Cobb","Thanks, Colby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we announced our results for fiscal year 2013, which ended April 30. As many of you know, this was a challenging season for the industry as a whole, and while we're continuing to analyze some of the details, there are 3 important takeaways from the season.","First, the challenges faced by the U.S. tax industry this year were unprecedented, resulting from late tax legislation, filing delays and an overall decrease in returns filed with the IRS. I'm proud that as an organization, we showed a tremendous ability to adapt to this unique environment and to execute on our plans in the U.S. Globally, I'm pleased that we again served more than 25 million clients worldwide. As the leader in the tax industry for over 58 years, H&R Block has become the largest tax preparer in the world, and our unmatched presence and expertise gives us an advantage as we look to 2014 and beyond.","Second, although we executed well on many of our initiatives this tax season, we have room for improvement. Difficult decisions were made this tax season, with a focus on growing the business profitably. And we delivered better financial results in fiscal 2013, achieving our margin expansion goals. I'm also pleased that we grew and took share from Intuit for the third consecutive year in the digital online category, which is the largest and fastest-growing category for do-it-yourself filers.","And finally, though there's still plenty of work ahead, we remain confident in our long-term strategy to be a global year-round tax-plus company. We continue to see growth opportunities in digital, financial services and international. And while some of these opportunities may take a few years to develop, I am optimistic about our ability to expand our business profitably and serve our clients better. In our core Assisted category, the value our tax professionals provide is only getting stronger as changes in legislation and economic conditions continue to add complexity to Americans' tax situations. The percentage of filers who choose to seek assistance has remained at close to 60% for the last 12 years, and growth in the digital do-it-yourself category continues to moderate as a number of pen-and-paper filers declines.","Our strong industry position and financial strength continues to give us a competitive edge as we look to 2014 and beyond.","With that summary, I'd like to take a few minutes to provide our thoughts on the U.S. tax industry. As I mentioned earlier, this was a challenging tax season for the entire industry as significant legislative changes in early January prompted the IRS to delay the opening of e-file to January 30. Additionally, certain forms issued by federal, state and various other taxing jurisdictions were unable to be filed as late as early March. With little time to react to these changes, these delays presented challenges to our industry to update systems and plan for operational needs throughout the season. Similarly, the delays confused and frustrated many taxpayers and significantly impacted the timing of filings during the season.","You will remember from our previous earnings call in March, we expected that these delays would impact the timing of filings, but that ultimately, the season would normalize to historical growth rates of 1% to 2% by the end of April. Nonfarm employment, which has historically been the best leading indicator for tax filing growth, was up 1.7% in calendar year 2012. Based on this indicator and other information we had at that time, we had little reason to believe that growth levels this year would be different than average historical levels.","Instead, at season's end, IRS returns were down approximately 1%, a result no one was expecting.","So what drove the decline and does this mean we've set a new expectation for future growth in IRS filings? At this point, we're still analyzing IRS and other industry data to understand many of the details. And it's likely going to take a few months before we have a complete picture of the 2013 tax season. There are, however, a few possible factors that we can point to.","First, the delays I mentioned earlier may have created confusion for certain taxpayers or a delayed sense of urgency to file for others. The IRS has not reported extensions yet, but it's possible there could be more return files in the upcoming off-season than in years past. We also know that taxpayers on average received lower refunds this year, and that more tax returns had tax balances due. It's hard to say whether this changed taxpayer obligations, but nonetheless, it may have created less incentive for some Americans to file by the middle of April.","Finally, the IRS has applied more rigorous procedures in processing returns in an effort to curb inaccurate or fraudulent filings. Certain credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, also known as the EITC, are rightfully receiving considerable focus. According to the IRS, the rate of improper EITC payments has remained high and had estimate that the EITC improper payment rate was 21% to 25% in 2012, which equates to $12 billion to $14 billion of improper payments.","To address this, the IRS has become more vigilant in processing the 27 million returns that contain the EITC, evidenced by additional due diligence requirements put into place in 2012 for paid preparers who prepare returns with EITC claims, as well as a number of other changes. Additionally, Congress increased penalties for preparers who file fraudulent EITC forms, and the IRS has begun aggressively assessing these penalties.","We believe that these efforts have contributed to the decrease of the number of EITC filings as a percent of total IRS filings over the past 2 years.","Reducing fraud through such targeted efforts by the IRS and Congress benefits the country, our clients and our company. In particular, reducing the abuse of the EITC protects the benefit for all citizens, including our clients who legitimately qualify for it. We expect the IRS and Congress to continue focusing on ways to reduce fraud, and we fully support their efforts in applying consistent rigor for all returns filed.","That said, considering long-term trends in IRS filings, there isn't enough evidence to suggest this was anything more than just an abnormal season. The IRS' annual growth in tax filings of 1% to 2% is supported by 50 years of data. And as such, this year's results do not cause us to change our expectations for future tax filing growth.","Taxes are here to stay, and I'm confident that H&R Block will continue to play a significant role in improving and simplifying our clients' lives.","With that context, let's turn to our performance for the year. Our estimates on market share are largely unchanged from our end-of-season volume results announced in late April. Though we won't have final data from the IRS until the fall, we estimate that total returns at the IRS were down about 1%, and our preliminary analysis suggest that we maintained our share of the overall U.S. market.","At the end of last year, we talked with you about our client and market share gains, which are important, given the challenging competitive environment we are in after discontinuing our RAL offering. I also explain, however, that to grow the business long term, we would have to rationalize our cost structure, invest prudently to grow the business and focus on a better balance of client acquisition and profitability. In line with that long-term strategy, there are a number of decisions we made to improve the overall profitability on returns filed with the company this year.","First, in Assisted, we shortened the timeframe for our Free Federal 1040EZ promotion and made various other systematic changes to optimize the rebate and referral programs in our offices.","In digital, we exited certain unprofitable desktop software retailers and focused on optimizing our online offerings. Excluding the impact of these efforts, total desktop returns would have been down about 4% compared to the 7% we reported.","In financial services, we discontinued the Free Refund Anticipation Check, or Free RAC promotion, which resulted in revenue growth, though it did negatively impact the number of Emerald Cards issued.","And in Canada and Australia, similar to our U.S. strategy, we enhanced our promotional offerings to focus on high-value clients, and were able to exceed our revenue growth expectations in these markets.","Heading into the season, we knew these actions would create headwinds for client count, but as you know, not all clients generate the same economics for our business. While our past focus on client volume and related market share gains was necessary for competitive reasons, we are in a new stage of growth for this business, with a focus on improving mix and profits over time. It's important that we balance our initiatives to gain market share with the associated cost. And the actions we took in fiscal 2013 do just that, positioning us well for long-term sustainable growth.","With these actions in mind, let's take a look at our overall 2013 performance in each market category.","In Assisted, the number of returns prepared by the company declined just under 3%. We believe the overall Assisted category was down about 1% in filings, and that we lost approximately 30 basis points of share. We obviously would have liked to perform better here. However, as I mentioned earlier, it's not just about increasing clients, it's about growing the business profitably. In the off-season, we'll be evaluating a number of things to continue our focus on driving a better mix of high-value clients. We'll also be taking a look at how we can continue integrating our adjacent financial products and deliver more value for our clients year round.","That said, we set aggressive targets in client satisfaction and exceeded those targets, and we continue to retain clients at a significantly higher rate than our nationally branded Assisted competitors. Service must remain at the core of what we do, and metrics like these are usually good indicators of future health of our business.","It's also important to note that our Assisted volume was not materially impacted by our decision to exit Sears. We're pleased that the clients we previously served in Sears locations were retained at levels in line with our expectations.","Now consistent with our focus on growing profitably, we've also decided not to renew our relationship with Wal-Mart in the United States. At the end of the day, this was an economic and operational decision for us. Unfortunately, results in this channel did not meet our expectations, and we're confident that we can serve our clients better in our other 10,000-plus convenient neighborhood locations. We have offices minutes away from most Americans, and our tax professionals have lasting relationships with our clients. Importantly, we do not expect our decision to exit Wal-Mart locations to have a material impact on our results going forward.","Turning to the do-it-yourself category. Total H&R Block At Home returns increased 232,000 over last year. In the key online category, returns grew approximately 11%, leading to a 50-basis-point gain in online share. Our marketing strategy was well designed and executed, and we believe our investments were better timed and more efficient than our competitors. Overall, the increase in online returns was offset slightly by the decline in desktop filings and Free File Alliance returns. Our mix of do-it-yourself clients continued to improve, which positions us well going forward as we continue to gain momentum in this category.","In financial services, the discontinuation of our Free RAC promotion did result in an increase in fees earned from RACs, offset by lower RAC volume. However, it also resulted in the issuance of fewer Emerald Cards, with 2.5 million cards issued and $8.7 billion in total deposits. While we issued fewer cards compared to last year, this still represents a 9% increase over 2011, the last comparable year in which we similarly did not offer the Free RAC promotion. Though we've seen strong initial progress in efforts launched this year to increase card usage, we realize this was the first season for many of these initiatives. And it's going to take time before we can assess our true performance in this area.","Finally, on the international front, I'm very pleased that we're continuing to see solid growth as revenues grew 7% to $249 million. Canada and Australia have strong management teams and have executed well to drive consistent profitable growth over the past few years. We remain under-penetrated in these markets when compared to the U.S., and I'm excited about the opportunities to broaden our global presence.","Overall, we are making progress in our long-term strategy, and this year provided important lessons that we'll take into the off-season as we prepare for next year. Facing an array of challenges, our tax professionals and other associates remain focused on serving our clients, and they went the extra mile to finish the year strong. I want to thank all of our tax professionals, our other associates and our franchisees for demonstrating the strong values that truly set H&R Block apart.","Now I'll talk for a few minutes about where we're headed in 2014 and beyond. But before doing so, I want to turn it over for Greg to discuss our financial results for fiscal 2013.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. From a financial perspective, considering the challenges that we faced this year, I believe we executed well and pleased that we continue to drive our strategy. Importantly, we exceeded our goals related to our cost-reduction initiatives, which contributed to significant earnings and margin expansion in fiscal 2013.","For the year, pretax earnings increased $126 million to $702 million. A large part of this was driven by exceeding our targeted cost-reduction initiatives, which contributed to a $118 million decline in total expenses compared to last year. The savings are primarily driven by lower compensation and occupancy expenses.","Our net income from continuing operations was up $119 million to $465 million. When considering these results together with share repurchases that occurred during fiscal 2013, we increased earnings per share from continuing operations 46% to $1.69. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 25% to $1.59. These non-GAAP results exclude after-tax adjustments of $28 million, or $0.10 per share, primarily related to a tax benefit received in the third quarter from settling outstanding issues in previously filed corporate tax returns. EBITDA of $874 million resulted in an increase in our EBITDA margin of 4 full points to 30%. Total revenues increased modestly to just over $2.9 billion.","While we would like to see better top line results in a normal year, I'm pleased, overall, that we remain disciplined and focused, achieving solid earnings growth.","In our Tax Services segment, revenues increased $16 million, or about 0.5%, due to these actions taken this year in line with our strategic focus to improve overall profitability. Specifically, higher RAC and digital revenues were partially offset by lower Assisted tax prep-up [ph] fees. The segment's pretax income of $821 million compares to a pretax income of $704 million in the prior year.","Let me take a moment to review the primary drivers for the year in greater detail. First, total expenses in Tax Services was down 5% to $2.1 billion, driven by our cost-reduction initiatives mentioned earlier.","Next, total Assisted tax prep fees and royalties were down 1%. Lower overall tax filings this year contributed to a 2.7% decline in the company's U.S. Assisted volumes, which was offset by a 1.7% increase in pricing, in line with the long-term outlook we shared with you in December.","Finally, in financial services, the discontinuation of our Free RAC promotion resulted in a $26 million increase in RAC revenue, which was partially offset by a decline in Emerald Card revenue. While core financial product revenues increased $21 million overall, we'll be reviewing ways to optimize these programs in 2014 as financial services remain a key part of our long-term strategy.","Turning to Corporate. Our pretax loss improved by 7% to $119 million. Corporate expenses declined by $12 million, largely due to lower interest expense resulting from the refinancing of our medium-term notes during fiscal year 2013. Additionally, we saw a decline in provisions related to our legacy mortgage loan portfolio, which is more seasoned and is experiencing lower delinquency rates.","As we look at our overall financial position, our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. As of April 30, total unrestricted cash was $1.7 billion, and total outstanding debt was $907 million.","And as of today, there are approximately 273 million shares outstanding compared to 292 million shares outstanding as of April 30 last year. As many of you recall, during fiscal 2013, the company repurchased and retired 21.3 million shares at an average price of $14.82 per share, or $315 million, representing an approximate 8% reduction in shares outstanding. We continue to evaluate share repurchases opportunistically, but we will not offer forward-looking guidance on share repurchase activities. The company has executed well on its repurchased strategy in the past due to our disciplined approach of buying shares at the right price.","Our effective tax rate of approximately 34% was 6 points lower than last year. This decrease was primarily driven by a $43 million tax benefit received in our fiscal third quarter, settling substantially all outstanding issues in our 1999 through 2007 tax returns with the IRS. While the decrease in our tax rate this year was largely driven by a onetime event, we are focused on lowering our effective tax rate for future years.","And finally, depreciation and amortization was $92 million in fiscal 2013, and our capital expenditures totaled $113 million or about 4% of revenue. We made specific investments this year but I think were necessary, given lower historical levels of spend, and we'll continue to make similar investments in 2014. Beyond 2014, we expect that capital expenditures will approximate 3% of revenues long term.","Turning to discontinued operations. We've reported a net loss of $31 million compared to a net loss of $80 million a year ago. The variance to the prior year is largely due to the loss on sale of RSM McGladrey in the prior year.","At Sand Canyon, fourth quarter representation and warranty-related claims remained low at $23 million, though future claim activity could vary considerably from quarter-to-quarter. For the year, Sand Canyon received $190 million of claims, of which $41 million remain subject to review at April 30. Total losses increased settlement payments amounted to $11 million in fiscal 2013.","This quarter continued a trend, in which Sand Canyon has experienced a decline in loan-level claims. Sand Canyon believes this decline in claim activity is attributable in part to the existence of tolling agreements entered into with certain counterparties from which Sand Canyon has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. The purpose of these tolling agreements was to engage in settlement discussions related to previously denied and potential future claims. Although Sand Canyon has not experienced anything that would indicate a significant increase in future claims, future claim activity may increase if current efforts to settle with these counterparties are not successful.","Based on initial settlement discussions with these counterparties during the fourth quarter and other considerations, Sand Canyon recorded a provision of $40 million for potential losses related to its representation and warranty obligations, bringing the total accrual at April 30 to $159 million. It's important to note that the provision is the result of the events that occurred in the fourth quarter and is not a reflection of an expected increase in future claim activity.","There are several points that are important to understand as we think about the provision recorded this quarter. First the provision is a reflection of a shift in the representation and warranty space for Sand Canyon. As revenue [ph] rates decline, certain counterparties are seeking remedies outside of a continued loan-level representation and warranty claim. These remedies may include bulk settlements for losses on previous claims that Sand Canyon deems invalid and potential future claims as discussed earlier. The rep and warrant landscape continues to evolve, and Sand Canyon believes that the movement away from loan-level claim activity is a positive development.","Second, Sand Canyon remains confident that it has strong defenses related to representation and warranty claims, including applicable statutes of limitations. Sand Canyon will, however, continue to have discussions with counterparties and will enter into settlements regarding previously denied and potential future claims when it believes it is in its best insurance to do so.","Third, Sand Canyon believes, based on its assessment of probable losses, that its accrual for representation and warranty obligations is adequate. It is important to note, however, that because of the nature of settlement discussion, it is possible that the accrual balance may fluctuate more in future quarters compared to previous quarters.","Finally, Sand Canyon is and has always been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments.","Overall, Sand Canyon believes this is a positive development as it works to wind down obligations related representation and warranties. Sand Canyon is now in settlement discussions with the counterparties that represent the majority of its historical claim volume. While Sand Canyon cannot be certain that settlements will be successfully negotiated, its accrual reflects the losses it believes are probable related to its representation and warranty obligations. There is the work ahead, but Sand Canyon continues to make important strides in its efforts to bring this loss contingency closer to its conclusion.","Turning now to a topic that I know many of you are interested in, H&R Block Bank. As a reminder, our 2 objectives for divesting H&R Block Bank have been and continue to be to stop being regulated as a savings and loans holding company and to find a partner or partners that will help us to continue to grow our financial services business. I'd like to share an update on there were at.","First, as it relates to our objective to find the right partner or partners to continue growing our business, this is a decision that will impact us for many years, and we continue to be very thoughtful and deliberate to find the best solution.","As I've said before, the goal is not a fast deal but the right deal. Since the fall time, when we announced our decision to exit the bank, we have received strong and varied interest from perspective partners, and that interest remains It's important to recognize this is not a typical retailer selling its card portfolio to a bank partner or a retail bank selling to another retail bank.","H&R Block Bank is a captive bank that provides unique tax-related products that any potential partner needs time to understand. Also, due to the seasonality of our business, it's wise for prospective partners to get actual 2013 tax season results to better understand the opportunity. I'm confident about our ability to come to a solution. But given these considerations, we are taking the appropriate amount of time to ensure we get the right deal done. We'll continue to share updates with you when it's appropriate to do so.","Next, in order to achieve our objective to stop being regulated as a savings and loan holding company, we effectively need to either sell or surrender the bank charter. Since announcing this process last fall, we have been exploring all options as it relates to exiting the charter. After looking at all options, we can share with you that regardless of how we structure the transaction, it is unlikely that we will generate any meaningful premium related to a sale of either the bank charter or the bank's assets and liabilities.","And finally, pertaining to these assets and liabilities, among the bank's assets is a legacy mortgage portfolio, which, as you may know, is held for regulatory purposes. This portfolio is seasoned and stable, now has moderate delinquencies and losses, is winding down fairly quickly and has a net book value of $339 million at April 30. We have examined in detail our options in selling all, part of or none of this portfolio. It is our conclusion right now that continuing to hold these assets at the time we exit the bank charter is the best economic decision. We will continue to evaluate the portfolio as it winds down. And based on market conditions, we may decide to sell all or some of this portfolio in the future.","Before handing the call back to Bill, I want to talk about the timing of our financial reporting. I'm sure many of you realize that we chose to have this year-end call earlier than in years past. This action was deliberately taken so that we can have more relevant and timely discussions with investors and analysts following the tax season. We are very focused on providing timely and accurate information to our shareholders and analysts, and we'll continue to evaluate ways to improve our communications.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","William C. Cobb","Thanks, Greg. As we look ahead, our strategy remains focused on being a global, year-round, tax-plus company. And our #1 purpose for this company is to look at our clients' lives through tax and find ways to help. One of the ways we are well positioned to help taxpayers is in their understanding of how health care reform will impact their lives.","As many of you know, the Affordable Care Act mandates that all Americans obtain health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty through their 2014 tax return. For those electing to receive subsidized coverage when the state and federally-operated insurance exchanges open in October, one is the easiest ways for them to verify their income during the enrollment process is by using their 2012 tax return. Those who receive subsidies will have a mandatory filing requirement in 2015 to report income earned during the calendar year 2014.","And we've performed a lot of analysis in this area, and our research suggests that Americans need help in understanding how the new law will impact their lives, their personal finances and their tax returns. We know that many are simply unaware of the resulting complexity that lies ahead.","Our job is to understand the law as it is written and help our clients comply with these new requirements as it relates to their tax return. We have not taken nor will we take any position on the law. We just want to help those who are impacted by it.","And our clients are among those most heavily impacted by -- affected by the new law, low-to-middle income Americans for whom the tax return represents one of the most significant financial events each year. Based on information we've gathered, we estimate that a greater proportion of our clients will be eligible for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act compared to the overall U.S. population.","While this may not be indicative of the choices they will make, it does indicate that many of our clients will face decisions regarding their health care coverage. We believe they will be looking for assistance in making some of these decisions.","Our clients have a tremendous amount of trust in us. And with the newly created intersection between health care and taxes, we have a unique opportunity to offer them unmatched service in meeting their needs in these 2 areas.","On the health care front, we're still analyzing the right long-term approach, but we've begun to invest in resources and technology that we expect will enable us to roll out a few initiatives this year that we believe will benefit our clients.","First, I'm excited that we're planning to launch a do-it-yourself tool on hrblock.com to help our clients across the country enroll into federal and state exchanges. We expect to partner with a third-party to provide simple and easy-to-use platform that provides helpful resources and facilitates the enrollment process.","Next, we'll continue to offer our tax and health care review in our offices. Our tax professionals will also refer our clients to the digital tools and resources I just mentioned.","Finally, we're also looking at running a pilot in one state, where properly licensed agents are on staff in our retail locations to offer our clients health care advice and subsequently processor enrollments.","Turning to taxes. There remain several elements of the law's implementation that are unknown at this point, which may have an impact on taxpayers' filing decisions.","First, we still haven't seen a form that helps us understand exactly how tax filings will be impacted by the new health care law. Our clients who receive subsidies will likely have significant changes in their tax return in 2015, and we expect there to be increased complexity in preparing their taxes.","Next, we don't have clarity on how several aspects of the law will be implemented. As an example, the cost of health care premiums on the exchanges and related subsidies remain unclear. Until we can better understand these and other related issues, we cannot know for certain how our clients' lives will be impacted and how we can best serve them at the tax event.","Finally, we can't say with certainty that the law will drive a significant amount of new filers into the market. There's simply no concrete way at this point to determine how many people will ultimately elect to receive subsidies, whether they were already filing taxes and, and how the new law impacts their future tax filing decisions.","So based on what we do know and believe, we think that any increase in filings will occur over several years as Americans increasingly adopt health coverage through the exchanges, and the associated tax penalties for noncompliance are gradually increased through 2016. In 2014, which is the first year of implementation, we do not expect a material amount of new filers into the market. In 2015, those who received subsidies will be required to file a tax return to reconcile any differences in their income and adjust subsequent tax obligations.","As I said earlier, Americans will need help with this, and I believe H&R Block is well suited to assist them in this process. With our size, scale and resources, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities associated with the ACA. We also think it adds a compelling value in our call-to-action with clients who we think will seek assistance and will be more likely to trust a long-standing brand, such as ours.","If we develop and execute the right strategy, this could have a positive effect on returning clients, do-it-yourself filers who switch to assisted and taxpayers who may have used other preparers in the past. The benefits to H&R Block, however, will take time to be fully realized. Although we are currently putting resources behind this, we do not expect the ACA to result in a significant benefit for us in the near term. Rules and tax forms are still being developed, and we'll have to adjust our operating model as the law is implemented. While we hope to provide as much value as possible for our clients, this law is introducing big changes to the health care market, and it will likely take us and other companies in this space more than just next year to figure it out.","After evaluating our initiatives at the end of fiscal 2014, we'll have a better idea of our long-term strategy in this space.","Now in conclusion. I like our competitive position, and I remain optimistic in our ability to grow the business profitably and ultimately to continue improving shareholder returns. This year, there were 4 key highlights regarding shareholder returns.","First, we increased our EBITDA 15% to $874 million, or 30% of revenues. Next, we returned $532 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Third, we increased earnings per share from continuing operations by 46% to $1.69, and finally, our stock outperformed the S&P 500 Index by 74 points, growing 89% for the year ended April 30.","I'm excited about where we're headed in digital, financial services and international. And in our core Assisted business, I feel that our capability is unmatched across the industry. The industry is changing, with the prospect of stricter regulation and increased complexity from possible legislative changes in the future. Our experience shows that new complex tax laws consistently drive the need for assistance, and we have been providing assistance to our clients in preparing their taxes for over 58 years.","We will share much more about our strategy and where we're headed in 2014 and beyond at our Investor Day, which will be hosted at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, December 11. So mark your calendars, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.","With that, we are now ready for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","A question for you on the pricing side of things. You said you achieved 1.7% pricing. Are you able to give us a little more breakdown on how much of that came from the franchise side and how much of it came from the corporate side?","William C. Cobb","No, I won't give you a breakdown. I would say it was similar, but I'm not going to go into the breakdown. I think it's better for us to really focus on the system average. A lot of this is due to mix. Our franchisees are primarily in more rural locations, so there are differences in pricing in terms of the amount. But I would look at it more as here's what the system did. Because a number of our franchisees do follow our lead on the pricing front, so I think the system number is sufficient.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Okay. So were your franchisees able to -- are you able to say, Bill, were the franchisees able to get a price increase?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I can say that.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Okay. And then you talked a little bit about the do-it-yourself tool on the health care side. Is there a revenue opportunity here for you, Bill, or is this some more about client retention, at least as you look at it today?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I think -- Kartik, let me say this. We obviously are doing this because we think there's going to be ultimately a business impact. I don't know at this point. But certainly, we're going to look at this as a commercial effort, whether that would be in the first year, how that would play itself out. As we get closer down the road, we'll probably have more to share with you on that. But clearly, I think as we would make an investment in that platform, we will be looking to monetize that at some point. But like I said, I don't want to go into it right now and, frankly, I don't know at this point as we make our plans, and as I stated, as we find out how this whole thing unfolds, how exactly that plays out.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question, Greg. You look at the cost savings this year obviously did better than expectation. How much of those cost savings will spill into FY '14? I'm assuming some of those, you've gotten halfway through the year. So just trying to figure out how much of that we should look for in FY '14 as well.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","About $15 million is a number that we've communicated to you before, and I feel comfortable that, that will flow into 2014. And I guess while we're talking about the expense results, I think it's worth noting, I know there were a lot of questions along the way about will this translate to bottom line. And we've shared with you today that we exceeded the $85 million to $100 million. And I mean, I've only been here for a year, so a lot of this was in play when I got here. But full compliments to Bill and the leadership team, frankly. And I think, hopefully, the rest of you believe it when we said it goes off the bottom line. You can see that now in the results.","William C. Cobb","Yes. And if I may just give a little plug also, we have a lot of our associates listening in. I mean, this was a top-to-bottom initiative, and there's a lot of people who have contributed. And I'm proud that we were able to deliver beyond what we had stated a year ago.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Greg, even though you exceeded your expectations by a decent amount, you still only expect about $15 million to kind of carry into FY '14.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","That really represents the annualization of cost decisions that were made in fiscal year 2013. Back in December, when we had our investor meeting with all of you, we talked about a concept more about targeting a 27% to 32% EBITDA margin range. We ended in the low 30s. We're not going to give specific guidance for this year. Our focus on expenses will continue forever, and we've got some good ideas. We've got some benefits coming in from last year. We're not going to give you specific numbers for this year. But I think, generally, in and around the margin percentages that we were at this year, plus or minus, is about where I expect it to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gil Luria.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So first of all, on the Affordable Care Act, just to confirm, you're saying you don't expect a volume increase for fiscal '14. In 49 of the states, the advice is all going to be complementary, so no material impact to fiscal '14. First of all, I want to make sure we got that right. But then the second part is the pilot in that one state, are we talking about your day-to-day tax advisors providing that type of advice, an additional person that specialized in this in the store? Are you going to try and to fit it into the navigator box that was designed into the Affordable Care Act, maybe go for some federal grants? Can you tell us a little bit about that pilot?","William C. Cobb","So let me answer your first question. As we sit here today and what we're trying to disclose in our -- in the comments I made earlier is there's a lot of unknowns at this point. So as we go forward, we've done a tremendous amount of research in this area. I think we're as close to this as anybody else in our industry. It's very hard to say at this point what the impact is, so that's what we're trying to convey to you that as it goes forward, there's still lots to play out here. With regard to the potential for a of pilot in one state, here's what I would say: it would be a situation where I'm not going to go into describing, but where you would come into a Block office and you would be able to enroll with the assistance of someone who would, in effect, be licensed to enable people to enroll. I'm not going to get into what box is being checked or whatever, but just the user experience is someone would come to a Block office and be able to enroll in an exchange.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then secondly, one of the key reasons, it seems like the overall tax funds this year were down. I think you discussed was the reduction in fraud or the attempts by the IRS to reduce fraud. Did you see this -- do you see evidence of this in the store? Did you have a report -- did your colleagues report from the stores that they had customers sit down and once they realized that the mechanism has changed for reporting some of those tax credits, get up and leave? Or is it the word-of-mouth among the fraudster community kept them out of the stores? Did you get any reports from the field that would indicate that?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I think, Gil, you're hitting -- I can't quantify it, but that's exactly the sentiment we got back, which is unfortunate. But I think this is one of the reasons why we do think it's important that the return preparer initiative, which is tied up in the courts right now, I think is important for the country. I think it's important for reputable tax preparers. We already comply with that because it's important for us with our brand and our reputation and our history that we provide accurate legal returns. But yes, your hitting on the qualitative feedback we received.","Gil B. Luria - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And finally, the Emerald Card, you grew that 9% on a 2-year stock. Have you also been able to get any uplift on the reload, on getting your employees and colleagues to get consumers to reload those cards, keep them longer? Has there been any level of success around that?","William C. Cobb","Yes, and Greg, if you want to add anything on this, we're not going to disclose specific numbers. But reloads are up, revenue per card is up, usage stats are up. This is building. In our view, we have a long way to go still. But the strides that Susan Ehrlich and her team made this year not only on enhancing the actual product, the value proposition around the product and the features, but also now as we start to become smarter about marketing and how we teach people how to use the card. The cards are now all personalized. We've made a lot of steps. So I'm very hopeful that as we go forward, this will continue to grow as we go on.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","The strategy for Emerald Card, Gil, remains the same. We want to get more cards issued, although we have a very large number right now; we're effectively the third largest general purpose reloadable debit card program in the United States. But more importantly, in my opinion, is the year-round usage. And we shared statistics with the community before, which shows the average revenue per card per Block comparative to Green Dot and NetSpend, and we have multiples of opportunities to increase that. And so Susan and her team have worked very hard in features and functions, education, incentives, communication plans. And all of you on the phone, it's a great product. I encourage you to get one yourself if you don't already have it. But that's really what the opportunity is. And we've obviously just been about 3 months\u2019 worth of vintage at this point, maybe 4 months of vintage. We can't -- we don't want to get into, what, with the month of June, at this point, already past our fiscal year. We saw some encouraging early results from the first 2 months. What I think we'll probably plan on doing this December when we have the next kind of major get-together, we'll talk a little bit more what our path looks like and some of the, I think, early results there.","William C. Cobb","And make sure you sign up for text alerts. It's my favorite feature.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","When you announced the potential bank sale, it seems like tax season was a limitation you wanted to keep the bank for the tax season. So just as we think ahead for timing, should we expect you to sell the bank by next tax season?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So yes, thanks, Thomas, for the question. We continue to work very diligently on finding the right partner or partners. We had a lot of complexities that have to be dealt with. We have spent a substantial amount of time in the last 6-plus months through this process. We continue to be encouraged by opportunities, but it will always come down to finding the right deal at the right time with the right partner or partners. And the point at which we reach there, we'll let you know. Having said that, we are very sensitive to the tax season. And we don't want to disrupt the client experience, the tax pro experience, which is essential to delivering successful Emerald Card, Emerald Advance and the refund transfer to the 3 main products here. So I think your question, the way I would interpret it is, we're not going to announce something in the middle of a season and move it would be kind of the way I'd think about that so.","William C. Cobb","Well, the other thing I would add, Greg, and you certainly know this very well, the principle is correct that the tax season must be executed, that our clients do not see a disruption, that this is seamless to them. We will also have to get regulatory approval as we go forward. So it's not a simple sale on a closing. There will be a regulatory aspect of this. At the appropriate time, we will share more on this obviously.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you start doing Emerald Advances, I think, around Thanksgiving. Does that mean that you would need to do something before then? And then if you add in the regulatory approvals too, does that mean you need to assign a couple of months before then to do it ahead of this tax season? Or can timing be pushed a little bit?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So you're correct that we opened up the Emerald Advance season this past year right before Black Friday, U.S. Thanksgiving. And that -- when you back up to the operational requirements of training, certifying, providing the materials to the offices, the system requirements, there is some operational lead time that's required from that. But in terms of specific, how do the timeline walk, I'm not prepared to talk about that right now.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then you talked about typical tax filing market growth of 1% to 2%. But just as we think about next year, you also talked about the potential that there were more extensions this year. From extensions, could we see market growth in fiscal '14 of 3%, 4%? Or should we think it's still probably pretty close to that 1% to 2%?","William C. Cobb","I hope you're right, Thomas. But extensions were up. I think a number of preparers have seen that. Obviously, we're working hard right now to translate those extensions into returns. It mystifies to some level what happened last year. I think that I go back to what I said earlier, the 50 years of data would indicate things would normalize. That's certainly our expectation. Folks probably talk about this more in December. But I think we believe things will normalize. But for conservative purposes, we might be thinking more in the 1% range. But we want to get the final numbers from the IRS in the next couple of months and take a look at that. But extensions, converting those extensions into returns could have an impact. But I don't think it would be anywhere close to the levels you just talked about.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, just on the RACs, can you give any color on or can you quantify the volume decline versus the revenue per unit increase? Did the delays have any impact? And I think it came in slightly below your expectations. What do you think drove that?","William C. Cobb","Yes, and, Greg, if you want to add anything, I think the -- we now have some doing the vacuum outside -- but I think, the season did have -- all the stuff that went on with the season did have a delay, did hurt us volume-wise. And I think we're looking hard at our user experience, the flow of our software. I mean, we're uncovering everything right now. To your point, we're disappointed that we didn't get up to the same level. Now clearly, we charged this year, so that was probably the biggest impact on the volume. But we want to hold ourselves to high standards, but I think that between charging for the project or the service and the convenience for the consumer and then also some of the disruption for the industry.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","The only thing I would add, Thomas, on that is the main -- I think the main miss, in my view, was really just the lower volume for the overall industry was the main driver. There were some price-mix-driven things behind that, but that was really a smaller part of the delta.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just following up on the last questions. It makes sense that with regard to a bank transaction, your counterparties would want to look in and see how the full year completed. And it sounds like there's some puts and takes there. But would you feel stronger now than prior to the tax season with regard to consummating [ph] something with the results you have? And I'll stop there.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Well, so back when we announced the deal, we hired Goldman Sachs and First Annapolis as advisors and ran a full process. And every step of the way, we've had strong and varied interest from a lot of different financial institutions, a lot of quality institutions. And so we've obviously worked through that list at this point in time, and we've worked down a fairly narrow list at this point in time. But my expectation about getting a consummated deal was the same then as it is now. Obviously, you're going to get distracted by the operational details and all that kind of fun stuff. But I know that there is -- these are great products, and we're a great company. We run them really well. We're proud of what we do from a compliance perspective, and all the banks that have gone through the process with us have all come back with very positive feedback. So I guess I don't have a difference of opinion about getting a deal done.","William C. Cobb","Yes. And I would just go back; I thought Greg laid it out very well in the script. I mean, if you could do this in a way that had perfection, if you will, you'd announce the deal April 17 and you move on. But this is a unique situation. It's a captive bank; you need tax-related products. Partners need to understand that. Given the seasonality, we have to run through that. In today's world, compliance -- I mean, there's a lot behind the scenes here. As Greg put it, it's not a retailer selling its card portfolio or a retail bank selling to another retail bank. Having said that, the teams have done some tremendous work. I think there has been great progress here, but we just aren't in a position yet to say -- we will not delay when we feel we're in a position that we have struck a deal.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And just following up on that, is there -- you mentioned in the prior question, the reloading of the card is up, and I imagine that would be important to track for a counterparty. Do you think there's more time needed for your counterparties to review? Or is it that -- you mentioned you have it narrowed down, so it sounds like a good positioning. But would there be something extracurricular that requires more time?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So I can't comment necessarily what the counterparties are wanting to see. So I can't specifically say it's Emerald Card usage. But at this point, I mean all the transactional details from '13 have been digested and shared as appropriate.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then you guys referred to the regulatory review period. Could you, one, just for all of us, give us a feel of what type of period, would that a 6 to 12 months, just a feeling? And also on your -- just your decision not to return capital during this period until you have a transaction, is that still the case?","William C. Cobb","So let me try the first half. I mean, Thomas, our business is the government. That's part of what we pride ourselves on is the ability to deal with government and regulators. I really don't see it that I could speculate. I think, hopefully, we'll position this well. The regulators will be pleased. We're taking steps to make this obvious to them with what we're trying to do, but I can't even remotely give you a date. Greg, do you want to take the second part of the question?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Well, just to be clear, we have returned capital during this time period when we paid quarterly dividends of $20-odd million per quarter, earlier in 2013 fiscal year, we bought back a substantial amount of shares that we talked about. In that entire time period, we were regulated. So we've been very clear that as a regulated entity, we have requirements with our regulators. But we have, during these pen [ph] periods, done capital reallocation to shareholders.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'll switch it up. And the -- with regard to the ACA, did you see -- Bill, I understood what you were saying for the 2014, '15 and '16 and how it's going to be a build. Do you see a complexity pricing opportunity as soon as fiscal '14? And then a follow-up on that one.","William C. Cobb","And again, Scott, I don't want to dodge here, I haven't seen the first form. I don't know whether it's a simple form, it's a complicated -- so I don't want to dodge your question. I think the point we're trying to make here is I think we've done a lot of research in this area. I think we're as close to this as anyone in our space. But it's unclear at this point, and there's still a lot of knowledge we need to get. Certainly, we're approaching this, that on a variety of fronts, we do think that there is a retention opportunity. Ultimately, we think there is a monetization opportunity, but I'm not trying -- I'm trying to be as open as we can be here. We just don't know at this point. But believe me, we're staying very close to this.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","That's fair, totally understandable. Following up on that, you mentioned the one state, could you let us know if that's a larger or small state? And is there the potential for more states with regard to the exchange process?","William C. Cobb","Do you mean by geography, population or...","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Any way you want will be fine.","William C. Cobb","If you want, all 50 of our states, Scott...","Gregory J. Macfarlane","And territories.","William C. Cobb","And territories. Yes, well, I mean, at the appropriate time, we'll talk -- I'm not going to talk about that for competitive reasons, obviously.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And I realize it's getting late. If I can sneak one more in, on the tolling agreements, Greg, could you just speak a little bit to more to that? I'll leave that as an open-end question, which is to help us better understand what may happen in future quarters and how the process is going [ph] over thinking?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So I believe this is a new record for H&R Block that it was question 31 or something, where we got to Sand Canyon, of the development. So the future is uncertain. I guess what I would say actually is for the accrual for representation and warranty reserves that is going to be reported here officially with the SEC shortly, what we've disclosed to you today, is the best estimate of that liability. So I can't -- what I did say is based on the methodology change, you may expect more volatility, but we'll have to wait and see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Several questions as well. On the EA, on the card, it looks like your bad debt was up, yet your fees cards were down. Talk about that a bit?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","I can, Mike. The bad debt always needs to be put in relationship to the revenue line when you're in financial services, specific to the Emerald Advance, which is where the majority of that sits. This past season, we continue to enhance the program. We had a longer time period. We invested more into the credit score remodels, better education. We had, I think, a better approach to the business. We also, as we've experimented with historically, opened it up to new clients, as well as prior clients. And really what you see that delta is just the change in sort of that profile of clients. But in my mind, it was a good decision. And when you look at the bottom line, we were okay with the results there.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","What extent did those new clients become clients of the tax business?","William C. Cobb","What proportion of the time does an Emerald Advance client turn into a -- or an Emerald Advance client turn into a tax-preparation client, is that the question, Mike?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Typically, this year, of the new clients.","Derek Drysdale","Yes, Mike, this is Derek. It's actually about 92% to 93% generally come back for tax preparation.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","And that was the case this year as well?","Derek Drysdale","I believe that's the case, yes. If not, we'll get back to you.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","In terms of revenue per return, if you will, could you talk about the percentage of Free EZs this year versus last, the increased pricing on the non-Free EZs than last?","William C. Cobb","So I think, Mike, we're going to stick by what we disclosed was the overall pricing was up 1.7%. We don't talk about specific number of returns from EZ. It's a promotional activity for us. It's been very effective for us. But I'm not going to get into the specific numbers. And as I spoke with Kartik earlier, the pricing, I would stick with the 1.7%.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","And then your focus on profitability, why aren't you pushing price in an industry that's been known for non-elasticity?","William C. Cobb","Yes, I think that as we've indicated last December, we made some very considered choices about pricing this year. We chose to reduce some prices, which were clear on our pricing boards. In other areas, we changed the pricing. We made some moves during the year. We really focused on our discounting. So it's a complex web here. And I think we're-- every year, we'll evaluate the economic situation, our situation. And so I would say that we certainly delivered slightly above what we had indicated in December. And as you obviously know from your years here that we're hard at work, trying to figure out what our plans are for next year. And we'll talk about that more in December.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","This year, the 3 brands looked like they kind of underperformed a bit. Who's taking that incremental share and why?","William C. Cobb","I'm sorry, which -- what brands are you talking about?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","I'm talking about Block, I'm talking Jackson Hewitt, and Liberty, if and when you make adjustments to their report.","William C. Cobb","Yes, again, I'm not going to comment on any competitor's situation. I think that overall, with the industry down, we're still trying to -- awaiting a full review, if you will, of where things went. But it's pretty obvious that the primary competition in this space is independents and CPAs. But again, with the overall industry down, it's hard for me to say at this point.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Can you give us an update on certification?","William C. Cobb","The return preparer certification?","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Yes, please.","William C. Cobb","I think it's an important area that we are in full support. I think any reputable tax preparer is. It is tied up in the courts right now. We believe this is important for Congress and the IRS and to work with the courts. I think this was a bad decision. I think it's completely misunderstood. But really, this should be something that -- given the importance of filing tax returns, given the situation the country has with debt, this is -- this doesn't make a lot of sense for this not to be part of our industry. But right now, it's tied up in the courts and, hopefully, a resolution will be had, so that everybody has to use the standards that H&R Block and others use.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Any guess on timing?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","We'd love to have it tomorrow, but we have no other estimate than that.","Derek Drysdale","And Mike, just for clarification, I mentioned 92%, the Emerald Advance clients return back for tax preparation, that was last year's rate. This year's rate was 91%, so it was down 1 point.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Colby R. Brown","Thank you. We appreciate your participation in the call, and we look forward to talking to you all soon. Thank you, Keisha.","Operator","You're welcome.

On behalf of the entire H&R Block management team, it's my pleasure to welcome all of you here today, as well as all those listening in on the webcast to our 2012 investor conference. Before we get started, we do have a few housekeeping items to get out of the way. First, earlier this morning, we released our fiscal second quarter results for 2013. Some of the figures in that release were presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to the press release. You can find both the release and the schedules on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. I'd also like to remind everyone that today's presentation and various comments made in connection with it will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws.","Such forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2012 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements. Now shortly after this morning's presentations conclude, we'll post the slides to our IR website.

And one last note, if you haven't found them already, which I'm sure most of you already have, the restrooms are also out the door, just to your right, past the registration table. So again, welcome, everyone. It's our pleasure to have you here today. We hope you enjoy the presentations. And with that, let's get started.","[Presentation]","William C. Cobb","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for attending our 2012 investor conference here in New York City. Our goal today is to ensure you leave here with a thorough understanding of how we see the industry, where we see opportunities going forward, how we plan to capitalize on those opportunities and ultimately, why we believe HRB is a good investment.","Now I've spent a lot of time thinking about the company, obviously, and the way I look at it is we are trying to restore H&R Block as a great company. It's been a great company for many years. It did lose its way for a while, and my goal and my management team's goal is to restore it to be a great company. In order to do that, we need to understand where we've been, where we are today and importantly, where we're heading.","And we have a great starting point, and that is the guidance I get on a regular basis from our co-founder, Henry Bloch, 90 years young, who every time he sees me, he says, \"Bill, the client always comes first. Focus on quality service, prepare error-free returns and clients will return again and again.\" His simple formula is the basis for everything you will see today. Now if we think about our journey that we're undertaking, and I've tried to capture this in a really simple way.","Phase 1 was when Mr. Bloch and his brother, Richard, ran the company in the early days and for many years thereafter. It was a family-run business, had a deep knowledge of the tax business, and everything was centered on the client. The company then moved into a phase in the 90s and early 2000s where outside management came in, where diversification was the watch word. H&R Block had a mortgage business, a broker-dealer business, an accounting firm. And, yes, a tax business. That was primarily an assisted business with some financial service, but it paid very little attention to digital.","Essentially, H&R Block was a holding company. Today, we moved the company to a much simpler approach. We are centered on tax preparation. We are a tax company that also offers financial services. And essentially, we are now an operating company. Where that leaves us is an operating company that is the largest tax preparer in the world. Over 12,000 offices worldwide, staffed by nearly 100,000 tax professionals. In the U.S., we prepare about 1 in every 6 tax returns.","We have 98% brand awareness. We're the only preparer capable of serving clients anywhere, any way and any time they choose. We offer complementary tax and financial services. For example, our Emerald Card is the third largest U.S. general-purpose reloadable debit card. And finally, we have a global footprint. We have well-established operations in Canada and Australia, and we just entered Brazil and India. So that is us and some.","Now what I thought I would do before we move forward is to look back over the last 12 months. We were able to make real progress in a number of areas. First, we grew clients and share. We outpaced our largest competitors in both assisted and digital. We have set the tone on improving service and the client experience. We grew the number of Emerald Cards issued and the deposits loaded on to those cards. We delivered on what I believe is a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. And sixth, we laid the foundation for significant EPS growth in fiscal year 2013 and beyond.","So let's take a look at each of these. Our top priority this past year was to grow clients. We served a record 25.6 million clients worldwide and just the last 2 years, we have grown the number of clients by 10%. We also increased our market share in the U.S. by over 30 basis points to 16.4%. We also outpaced our largest assisted competitors, taking share over the last 2 years from independents by over 100 basis points and improving our own share by 70 basis points. Similarly in digital, over the same time frame, we outpaced our largest digital competitors by taking share from both Intuit and TaxACT, while growing our own share by over 70 basis points.","Our third accomplishment was an important one, to set the tone on improving service and the client experience. We had a significant improvement in our key metrics. Assisted client satisfaction was up over 500 basis points to 87%. The digital Net Promoter Score was also up over 500 basis points, and awareness that we have a digital offering rose plus 11 points to 62%. And we continue to drive industry-leading innovation through platforms like Block Live and a number of mobile applications, meeting our expectation and also surpassing the expectations of some industry experts.","I'd like to show you a quote from a keen observer of the tax business, the CEO of Intuit, Mr. Brad Smith, who said on September 18 in Intuit's own Investor Day, \"H&R Block is a wonderful competitor. What I think they did really well last year is they were fantastic in terms of connecting with the hearts and minds in their marketing message. I thought they had an interesting set of new technologies, which they came out with.\" We thank you, Brad. And Mr. Turtledove, our Head of Marketing sends a special thanks to you for the shout out for his marketing efforts. Now fourth, we also grew the number of Emerald Cards we issued and how much money was loaded on to those cards. By the way, they're doing construction next door, so I'll try to shout over them.","Last year, we reached almost 3 million Emerald Cards issued, and we loaded almost $10 billion worth of deposits on to those cards. We also delivered on what I believe is a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. Since I became CEO in May of 2011, and if you count the dividend we announced that we will pay on January 2, we will have returned almost $900 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And finally, we have laid the foundation for significant EPS growth in fiscal year '13 by making some tough decisions.","We have rationalized our cost structure and refocused our organization on the client experience. Plus our efforts here will lead to an $85 million to $100 million increase in our earnings in fiscal year '13. We discontinued the free RAC initiative we will charge for this product this year. We resolved a lot of litigation, and we shed noncore assets like McGladrey and EXPRESSTAX. In the end, all of these company -- all of these efforts will lead to a company of higher margins, which Greg Macfarlane will speak to later. So that's looking back.","Now I want to look ahead, but I want to look ahead from the CEO's chair, if you will, not only in 2013 but beyond. And I want to talk to you about what I'm calling shifts in our business mindset that I'm driving throughout the system and throughout the company. Because this is a company that has done business a certain way for a very long time. And we do want to build on off that effort, but we also want to evolve our business model in the following ways: tax plus, global, year-round and consistent service quality. So let me tell you what I mean by each of these.","Tax plus. We are a company that is centered on tax preparation. That is what we're known for. That is what we're best-in-class at doing and we want to continue to do that legacy by being a client-centric company that continues to serve tens of millions of clients through tax-preparation. But we also want to have an emphasis on the services that we can provide to these clients. And you will hear Susan Ehrlich talk later this morning about the variety of ways that financial services and products can serve our client base. That's what we mean by tax plus.","Second, global. The company has been very U.S.-centric. We need to become a global player. And ironically, international is our fastest-growing business with $233 million in revenue in fiscal year '12. We have well-established international markets. Our largest is Canada where we had a 10% share in fiscal year '12, and where we grew returns by 6% and revenues by 10%. In Australia, where we just completed our tax season and announced our results earlier this morning, we grew returns by 8%, revenue by 11% and share to 5.9% in fiscal year '13. Those are '13 numbers.","We're also looking to expand our global footprint with small low-risk investments focused on profitable and sustainable client growth. The world is not ending, I don't believe, by the way. It's sort of with all the noise in the background.","Now earlier this year, we entered Brazil. Brazil has a total population -- I can just talk really loud so -- of 200 million people, and at this point, the total tax filers of 25 million. And this number of filers should double over the coming years. We also entered India with a total population of over 1 billion people. And a total tax filer base of 35 million. Now this number of filers is going to explode in size over the next 5 to 10 years. Now we'll continue to carefully evaluate additional expansion opportunities but do it in a way that is deliberate, focused and purposeful.","Next, year-round. Taxes have become a year-round focus. We increasingly need to provide tax support to our clients year-round, and you will hear from Jason Houseworth in a little while about an initiative we call My Account, which is going to enable people to access their tax information on a 24\/7 365-day basis. As we look to extend our financial products usage, we'll also need to be able to support products like our Emerald Card year-round. Plus, there is a tailwind coming, and that's the Affordable Care Act here in the United States, and the advice people are going to need year-round on this very confusing subject. Jason will expand on this in a few minutes. But this is not as substantial a shift as you may think.","Today, we already have about 45% of our offices in the U.S. open year-round. And we will build on that number, but we will do it deliberately by extending this season with products like Emerald Advance, which we launched 2 weeks earlier this year before Thanksgiving and before Black Friday. So stay tuned here.","And last, consistent service quality or what we're calling in the company, CSQ. CSQ is about our zeal for delivering consistent service quality in all of our products and services to give our clients more than they expect, anywhere, anyway and anytime they would like it. We need to drive CSQ in everything we do, whether it's Emerald Cards, mobile initiatives, online and digital offerings, and of course, at the tax desk in our 12,000 locations worldwide. So those are some of the shifts in our business mindset that we are driving.","But there are 2 other critical responsibilities that I believe a CEO must take on. First, setting the tone at the top. With a company that has had a revolving door of CEOs, this needed to be a deliberate and thoughtful exercise to determine what kind of company we wanted to be. We spent a lot of time on this effort, and I put my personal stamp on this. We have taken this message out to the system the last couple of months. It's on our badges. It's on our website. It's everywhere, and it's taking hold.","First of all, our purpose, the reason we get up in the morning. And the words we settled on were, we look at your life through tax and find ways to help. This was an important statement for us because I wanted this to be something only H&R Block could say. That's what we do at Block. We look at life through tax, and reflecting the humble ways of Henry Block, we simply find ways to help our clients. This purpose has resonated very well in our company.","Next, our vision. To be the leading global consumer tax company bringing tax and related solutions to clients year-round. You can see the shifts that I talked about earlier embedded in this vision. We are about tax, consumer tax. We're about global, and we want to bring tax and related solutions, or tax plus, to clients and we will do this year-round. That is our vision. So we now have our purpose that describes us, our vision that leads us. But we also wanted to define how we want to act our values, and we have settled on a very simple statement, we do the right thing. This is our bedrock for how we want to operate in our offices, our call centers, in our client support center in Kansas City, in India. Wherever we operate in the world, we want to be guided by this simple statement: we do the right thing. And what we do the right thing really means is we believe in our people, we take care of our clients and we deliver for you, our shareholders.","Now laying out these guideposts may be the most important thing I've done to date. I believe we have crafted these words appropriately, and I believe they truly reflect what and who we are at H&R Block. And finally, I now have the right leadership team in place here at Block. I have a set of executives I'm very proud of. They are a combination of people from the outside and people from within the company. And they are meshing beautifully as you will see throughout the day.","The first executives I will introduce are our functional leaders. Kush Saxena is our Chief Strategy Officer. He joined us 9 months ago from McKenzie right here in New York. He is a brilliant young strategist who has served multiple Fortune 500 companies in high-tech, financial services, retail and health care. He has led our strategy work, much of which you will hear about today.","Our Chief People Officer, Aileen Wilkins, is a veteran of H&R Block. Aileen leads the strategies that make the most of our talented associates, including workforce planning, talent management, organizational capabilities and company culture.","Tom Gerke, Chief Legal Officer, brings years of executive and legal experience to the company. He recently served as Executive Vice President for CenturyLink, President and CEO of Embarq, and General Counsel for Sprint. To have an attorney of Tom's stature join us is a huge plus for this company.","Next, our Chief Information Officer, Rich Agar. Rich runs all of our strategic technology and operational initiatives that support our retail and digital tax businesses. His background in business operations, Six Sigma and global enterprise technology has been instrumental in improving quality and operational excellence at H&R Block. Prior to that, Rich spent 23 years at GE.","And of course, many of you know our Chief Marketing Officer Robert Turtledove, who I've known for 25 years. I have tremendous faith in him as he leads our marketing efforts with brand, client acquisition, research and field marketing strategies and initiatives. And these leaders are complemented by people who are driving our businesses.","Jason Houseworth is President of U.S. Tax Services. Jason guides the strategy, planning and development of all forms of U.S. tax services. Leveraging client feedback and analytics, he and his team create the products, pricing and client experience for all assisted and do-it-yourself tax clients. Jason previously served as Senior Vice President of our digital tax solutions and was responsible for the product and technology strategy of H&R Block At Home online and software solutions.","Partnering with Jason is Amy McAnarney, who's our President of Retail Client Service, who is our longest tenured leader, 16 years with the company. Amy has the largest people job in the company, running all of our company offices and leading our franchise system, 90,000 people or so. She previously served as Senior Vice President of Operations Support and Franchise Development where she was responsible for strategy deployment, client experience development, operations support and the company's franchise network. Amy is an invaluable partner to me in leading our efforts here in the U.S.","Susan Ehrlich is President of Financial Services. She has had a long career in financial services and leads our strategy efforts to provide financial solutions to our clients. In addition to building on the success of H&R Block's Emerald suite of products, Susan leads many of the company's new initiatives, including Money Express and Emerald Card Mobile. She is the driver of our tax plus strategy.","And Kip Knight, who's a long-term colleague of mine, he serves as our international President, overseeing our offices in Canada, Australia, India and Brazil. Kip's 30-year career includes senior management and marketing positions with P&G, PepsiCo and eBay. He's a seasoned leader and I'm very pleased to have Kip on our H&R Block leadership team running our international business. So that's the team.","Oh yes, I forgot one. Probably the only person you really want to hear from today, our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Macfarlane, who joined us 6 months ago and who has really completed the team. Greg served as Executive Vice President and CFO for Ceridian Corporation and spent more than 14 years in senior leadership roles at GE. Many of you have met Greg, and I believe you will agree with me when I say he was a terrific hire for our company.","So our team is complete. They are committed to leading this company to new heights. Along with our 40-plus Vice Presidents who have deep experience with the company, with more than 300 years of combined experience at Block, our top 50 is a deep and talented leadership team.","So on today's agenda, you will first hear from Jason Houseworth, who will provide an overview of the tax industry, the company's recent performance and competitive advantage and how we will deliver the H&R Block client experience. Susan Ehrlich will then give you an overview of the financial services landscape, our financial products offering and update you on our H&R Block bank. And Greg Macfarlane will end the presentation portion of today with a summary of our Q2 results, why we think HRB is a good investment and conclude with the general market and H&R Block outlook. We will then conclude the day with a Q&A with the 4 of us, along with Amy, who will join us for that.","So I think we put together an interesting and informative agenda for you today. I'm going to go speak with the management at the Palace right now. If I do not return, I apparently have been jackhammered to death, but we're very glad you are here.","[Presentation]","Jason Houseworth","Good morning. I'm Jason Houseworth, and it's my job to drive continued growth in our tax services by creating best-in-class tax products and a great client experience for all current and future H&R Block U.S. tax clients, assisted and do-it-yourself. These products and services are delivered both through our digital channel, which we call DIY tax services, as well as our 11,000 retail locations, which are led by my colleague, Amy McAnarney.","This morning, I plan to provide you with an overview of the entire tax industry, along with Block's leading position within it, and then we'll look ahead to 2013 and beyond. I hope that when I'm done, you'll understand our position in the tax industry as the only business that can serve the entire population of all 145 million tax filers anywhere, anyway and anytime they choose, a business that has a strong fundamentals and innovation mindset and just as important, momentum as we move into the upcoming tax season. A business that is maniacally focused on creating a great and consistent client experience, a technology-enabled client experience, personalized to meet the unique needs and varying complexity of our clients, and how this focus on our client experience and delivering consistent service quality within it can drive real and sustainable growth to the bottom line and set up our tax plus offerings, which you'll hear more about from Susan Ehrlich after the break, assuming the whole building doesn't come down.","I'll start by taking you through our view of the tax preparation industry and where it's headed. U.S. tax filings chartered here since 1951 demonstrate a remarkably straight line of 1% to 2% annual growth, one so straight you could nearly take a ruler to draw over time, even though this charter have experienced a recession and great economic prosperity. This is an industry that has consistently demonstrated predictable growth.","William C. Cobb","Hey, Jason.","Jason Houseworth","Yes?","William C. Cobb","Let me give you an update. We're going to power through, all right? So bear with us with the slides. This is not the Palace, it's another building next door. We have all of the Palace working to get -- but they don't control this building. This is a total screw up by the hotel. Their head of security is over there. They at times work with them and move to the other side of the building. This is not the hotel. It's -- this is New York City. So we might take up our collection and make some payments in through New York style but anyway, I don't know what else to do except to just say we're just going to power through. And I really apologize, this is very unfortunate.","Jason Houseworth","So the IRS growth is highly correlated with non-farm employment and growth we believe will continue in the upcoming tax season with IRS returns expected to grow 1.5% to 2%. Within the tax industry, there are really 2 fundamentally different types of consumers or tax filers: assisted, which accounts for 60% of filers, and do-it-yourself or DIY, which accounts for 40%. This 60-40 split between assisted and DIY has not changed in the past decade and we don't anticipate material shifts in the next decade because this is a split between attitudes regarding how people want to consume tax-preparation.","Having been in many client focus groups with both types of these clients, I can tell you these are very distinct needs. The 60%, or the assisted clients, see their tax return as inherently complex, regardless of whether they are a 1040EZ, the simplest form, a 1040, filing multiple schedules, one of the more complex situation, whether they're a 22-year-old first-time filer or a 65-year-old retiree.","To assisted clients, taxes are scary. They don't understand why anyone would risk doing their own taxes and they value the time they get back, which on average is about 5 hours. Because of these reasons, assisted clients are relieved to delegate this task to a paid preparer. Now on the contrary, the 40% or DIY tax filers, they don't understand why anyone would want to have someone else do their taxes. They're confident doing it themselves, and they ultimately want control of the process. These DIY tax filers are subsegmented into digital filers, or those who use desktop software online and now mobile solutions, and also pen and paper filers, which have dramatically declined over the past 5 years as DIY users have shifted to digital methods.","So let's talk about the 60% or the 80 million assisted tax filers who are served by a highly fragmented market of independent CPAs and branded players like H&R Block. H&R Block has continued to develop our market share within the assisted segment to over 18%. This has come at the expense of the independent preparers who have lost over 100 basis points of share over the last 2 tax seasons, as the regulatory and financial product landscape has changed the equation for them.","An example of this is Amscot, a relatively large independent chain based out of Florida and commonly known from being a RAL shop. They did 56,000 returns in tax season '12, which was up 35%, up strongly over the prior tax season. And despite their growth, they've recently announced they're no longer doing tax returns. This may have been for a variety of reasons, but presumably their profitability changed over time. Taking advantage of this industry shift is an opportunity I'll talk about later in my presentation.","Now I'd like to discuss the 40% or the 54 million DIY filers. Of these, 46 million chose digital solutions in tax season '12. This growth has primarily come as pen and paper, the yellow portion of the bar chart, has declined dramatically from the 21 million filers it had 5 years ago to just 8 million today. H&R Block is a strong #2  in the digital market, gaining 70 basis points overall in digital share over the past 2 tax seasons, and primarily growing in the online segment at the direct expense of our primary competitor into its TurboTax, represented in blue on the bar chart.","I know you're all very interested to hear what we're planning or what's new for the upcoming tax season, but you're going to have to wait a little bit. First, I want to remind you why at H&R Block, we've led the tax industry for over 50 years by walking you through both our recent performance, as well as some of the key foundational blocks that make up our competitive advantage.","At H&R Block, we are the tax industry leader. This leadership is based on the fact that within the $19 billion tax industry, the assisted tax preparation market, while only accounting for 60% of tax filers, accounts for 90% of the revenues for the industry. If you did break down the share of this revenue by branded competitors, you could see that H&R Block generates more revenue than all of our branded competitors combined. This includes Intuit's TurboTax, other DIY competitors and branded retail competitors. And we've been picking up share and growing the number of tax filers who use both our assisted and our digital tax services.","But I'm going to start by talking about the number and share of assisted clients we've served over the past couple of years. This number has grown by more than 650,000 since 2010, while gaining in key operational metrics: client retention, satisfaction and efficiency of our operations.","As I mentioned in the beginning, we believe our business has strong fundamentals, beginning with key assisted client metrics. Not only do we have nearly universal awareness, but we're relevant. Brand consideration is highest in our youngest client segment, 18 to 24 year olds where it's 50% higher than the average taxpayer. And these clients follow through. They are nearly 30% of our new clients versus 16% of all IRS returns.","Additionally, our clients left more satisfied, following last tax season. Overall client satisfaction was up 5 points in 2012, and a key retention indicator, our client's intent to return based on a post-tax preparation survey, was up 3 points. But we know we can still get a lot better in our execution. We know that the #1 thing we can do to improve retention is to return clients to the same tax professional. But today, we only want -- we only have 51% of clients who do this. The data indicates clients who return to the same tax professional increased retention 5 points, which is obviously a big opportunity.","You'll hear me talk about this opportunity multiple times today. Additionally, we know we can do a better job at getting clients to set an appointment, given this is a key driver of the conversion funnel to ensure we take them out of the market early. And in digital, the fastest growing segment of the market, H&R Block has outpaced market growth, growing over 1.5 million clients since 2010 or 26% over that period. This includes outpacing the largest DIY competitors over the past two years, in particular, TurboTax.","When we think about measuring success in this category, it's hard not to use TurboTax as the ruler. Last year, at this investor conference, I said that I believe we will grow at a rate faster than TurboTax in the upcoming tax season and beyond, and we are. We grew faster in the rate of total digital growth, which you see here. And as a result, we saw segment share flow in the direction of H&R Block, 150 basis point shift in 2012. So this year, I'll say it again. We will grow faster than TurboTax in the upcoming tax season, building on the strong momentum of the last 2 years.","Why do I say this? Well, I'm going to explain this by answering the question a lot of you, a lot of the analysts asked me. Why is H&R Block outpacing the industry in digital growth? At the highest level, this is due to a combination of consumer demand combined with a more effective funnel or the conversion of that interest into completed units. And let me explain this by walking you through how we've improved the conversion of a consumer into a DIY client.","This conversion funnel shows the progress we've made since 2010 beginning with brand awareness. I've always said that we have a great product, a powerful piece of tax software that unfortunately, up until the last couple of years, only 1 and 2 consumers even knew about. This has been our #1 focus and the #1 reason why we've grown. Since 2012, we've added 12 points to our awareness, now approaching nearly 2 out of 3 users recognizing H&R Block At Home as an option for digital tax preparation.","Awareness has driven strong demand across both assisted and DIY clients as they visited hrblock.com. In the last 2 years, we've doubled traffic to the site, with last year more than 50 million unique visitors or just over 1\/3 of all U.S. taxpayers visiting hrblock.com. Visits lead to registrations. So we've updated our homepage, hrblock.com, in order to better convert a registration for our online product. But a registration only lasts if there is value in the experience. I think it's the product changes we've made to simplify and strengthen the recognition of the features or added value within the experience that's led to our biggest improvement.","We've moved Net Promoter Score or NPS, a measure of client loyalty, over 10 points in 2 years, a huge move. But honestly, one that still leaves us trailing into its reported numbers for TurboTax in both NPS and retention. We still have more work to do and more opportunity ahead of us. For our online product, the result of this focus on the funnel is a 53% cumulative gain in online clients over the last 2 years, and this excludes returns coming from the Free File Alliance, which are generated by irs.gov.","You'll notice here, there may be some dissymmetry in these numbers because of the difference in growth between registrations and completed units. This is correct. We've grown units faster than registrations because we've improved our product conversion. Though the total number of visitors registering hasn't increased, we're getting a greater percentage of that pool of registrations to actually complete a return. This conversion has improved 3 points since 2010, which produces a better yield on the users who show an initial interest in our product.","These improvements, at every level of the funnel through which we take consumers and move them to clients, are the result of a relentless focus on a great client experience. We are maniacally focused on the details, vigorously attacking every click and framing each feature to ensure that it adds value or it simplifies a tax preparation experience.","Today, I'll talk a lot about H&R Block's focus on our client experience, and it's because results like these demonstrate how small things can have a big impact. And know I'm pleased with this progress, we still only have 15% Online segment share. We know we have room to grow and, as I mentioned earlier, really to improve our customer satisfaction metrics. Therefore, we still view digital as a big opportunity at H&R Block.","As a tax industry leader, I now want to make sure that you understand how we have built the foundational blocks that are our competitive advantage and uniquely position us to be able to serve all 145 million tax clients, whether they're part of the 60% or the 40%. I'll begin with our tax professionals, who created an enormous amount of value for clients and shareholders, the scale of our operations and expertise, the history of innovation we brought to the tax industry, including the best-in-class products and services we've created for tax consumers and the power of our brand.","There are many reasons why our over 90,000 tax professionals are our core foundational block of our competitive advantage, but the most compelling reason is the material difference we see in client retention. The simple fact is that H&R Block has the best client retention in the retail industry, and this is directly related to the number and the depth of expertise of our tax pros. Our tax professionals are better trained and stay around longer, which leads to more satisfied clients than anyone else in the industry.","At H&R Block, we attract and retain the industry's best tax pros. You see here the growth and retention, by tenure, of the tax professional, which overall, for company-owned tax professionals, has improved 9 points to 78% in the last few years. Now, let me debunk a myth some of you may have about our tax professionals. Although highly tenured, our tax professionals' average age is 52. But young or old, our tax professionals are passionate about our clients. One of the reasons we attract the best is because, at H&R Block, they have more opportunity. Our tax professionals prepare more returns, on average, than anyone else in the industry.","While the average non-HRB preparer completes 110 returns, our tax professionals prepare over 150, 42% more than the industry. Thus, our tax professionals stay because they build a solid book of business through their association with H&R Block, one they would lose if they were to leave the company. Our tax professionals also come back because they get the best support and training.","The new minimum IRS-registered tax return preparer exam requirements, which will require tax preparers to pass an exam prior to December 31, 2013, it encourages 15 hours of preparation. At H&R Block, our 90,000 tax professionals get an average of 43 hours of training each year. But our folks aren't average. Many are on their way to becoming a consumer tax expert or an IRS-enrolled agent. This certification level, which requires an estimated 500 hours of exam preparation and passing 3 IRS exams, gives a tax preparer or an enrolled agent the ability to represent clients with the IRS, which is the same treatment as a CPA or a lawyer. In H&R Block, we are proud to have 7,664 enrolled agents whose client retention is the highest within the company. Expertise and preparation matter.","As a company, we are well-prepared for the upcoming IRS requirements that will force all preparers to pass the IRS exam prior to next year. Without this, a tax preparer will not be able to file a return with the IRS. And while enrolled agents, CPAs and attorneys are exempt, the industry is going to be challenged to be ready. Out of the nearly 350,000 tax preparers, only 33,000 or 10% had passed the test as of November 5. Out of this 33,000, over 1\/3 were H&R Block tax professionals. Excluding enrolled agents, we have 84,000 tax pros who were required to pass the exam and we're confident they'll be ready.","So far, over 50% have either passed or are registered to take the exam. They are supported with training, and during the season with particularly thorny or complex situations, by the Tax Institute at H&R Block. This is the largest independent consumer tax think tank in the United States. This group of 85 lawyers, CPAs and enrolled agents, literally wrote the book on IRS exam preparation and are focused, each and every day, on ensuring we have the best training and the best trained experts serving our clients. So as you can see, our tax professionals have many reasons to continue to stay in H&R Block.","So why is the retention of our tax professionals so critical to our success? Well, in short, a tax professional who stays longer is better at what they do and they know their clients. Like the tax [indiscernible] you saw in the video before I started, giving them the ability to personalize the experience to better meet the unique and varying complexity and needs of our clients. The illustration in this chart demonstrates how client retention improves significantly with the tenure of our tax professionals.","And as I mentioned earlier, for clients who return to the same tax professional, retention improves 5 points. And as our tax professionals stay longer, so do our clients. You see here, that as a client of H&R Block returns year after year, they become very sticky with HRB. Clients who have been with us with 5 or more years are 3x more likely to stay than new H&R Block clients. Therefore, while our tax professional's tenure has increased, so has the retention of clients who have been served 5 or more years with retention up 140 basis points since 2010.","The next foundational block within our competitive advantage is our scale. We're the fourth largest retailer in the U.S. with more locations than Starbucks and more locations than all of our branded competitors combined. 85% of Americans live within 5 miles of one of our tax offices. But even with this breadth, our offices are continuing to become more efficient, preparing more than 1,400 returns per company-owned office and, by comparison, branded, retail competitors only prepare about 425 returns per office.","The third foundational block in our competitive advantage is our history of innovation in the tax  industry. Many of you already know that Henry and Richard Block created the tax industry back in 1955, but since then, we've continued to innovate with the assisted and digital tax products and services we offer to all clients. We were the first to offer Second Look and Peace of Mind guarantees. Last tax season, we introduced Block Live, the first virtual way to have a fully assisted experience. We introduced free audit support and representation for all DIY clients and, over the past few seasons, have launched an array of mobile tax solutions to support our clients. These are things unique to H&R Block.","Tax service innovation that brings to life our vision to serve tax clients anywhere, anyway and anytime they choose. This innovation has also been demonstrated in digital, where we've helped clients recognize the difference they get when they choose H&R Block. We were the first to offer expert advice, we did this in the year 2000. We were the first to offer federal e-file, free, within our desktop software package, and we are still the only digital solution that offers free audit support and representation for all DIY clients. We've also shown tax industry innovation in mobile.","At H&R Block, we don't believe that just because a client wants to embrace technology that, that means they want to shift from an assisted client to a do-it-yourself one. Instead, we utilize technology to make a tax preparation experience better for all clients, assisted and DIY, leading to more engagement, higher satisfaction and, ultimately, higher retention. So last year, we created 8 new mobile apps, and these weren't just tax preparation apps. They're a variety of self-service and tax preparation apps to serve clients, how they want to be served.","At H&R Block, our clients can have both. The technology-enabled experience and get the best service and expertise in the industry. Finally, our competitive advantage is anchored in the strength of our brand. We built nearly universal recognition in an industry that is relatively low churn. Out of the roughly 145 million tax filers, there are only 15 million filers that are switching from one of our competitors each year. The strength of our brand and brand marketing enables us to capture 40%, or roughly 2.5x our share, with 6 million new H&R Block clients each tax season and Greg will further quantify the value of our brand during his presentation later this morning.","Now having looked back, by explaining our leading position within the industry and competitive advantage that serve as a foundation for us, let's now look ahead, as I take you through our plans for the upcoming tax season and beyond. As Bill mentioned earlier, when he showed you this slide, Tax Plus is a big part of our strategy going forward as a company. However, it starts by providing a great tax client experience. We have to get that core of what we offer our clients, tax preparation. We really have to get that right in order to have the opportunity to do more for them, or Tax Plus.","To provide a great client experience, we have to have a clear understanding of our clients and a clear view of how to meet their needs. In the past, we've shown you that we have segmented our clients, both via tax form, which has worked well to define our services, as well as by agent income, which helps us market to our clients. This information was invaluable as we tried to create a picture of who our clients were. But the picture of our clients was not fully complete. Further, we wanted to understand how to better attract and serve high-value 1040A and 1040 clients because we know this is still something that we have to improve over time.","So this summer, we did additional research to understand our clients and their Tax Plus needs. This gave us a richer more complete view of our clients, their tax prep attitudes and motivations. Our view, by looking at all 3 of these, through the client lens, gave us a complete picture of our clients who we were looking for. This is, that regardless of how a consumer is wired, regardless of the method that they chose to have their taxes prepared, they all feel taxes are highly personal, that their situation is unique. And they're right. Because of this, both DIY and assisted clients demand that we personalize their service and price, and they expect consistent service quality.","I know this is an incredibly simple -- but it's a telling view of our client needs. It is also the basis of a much larger framework that we have created to guide our product development and client experience going forward. Is this an a-ha moment? Somewhat. But even more so, it's a confirmation of what we've come to know about our clients. And it is a reaffirmation of our purpose, to see our clients' lives through tax and find ways to help. It's also very consistent with Henry Block's original vision for the business. He's always said, the client always comes first. And while times have changed, the behavioral attitudes and needs of our clients have not. Our service promise today is also very similar. This is about delivering consistent service quality that matches the expectations of our clients. It's about matching the client experience with what they expect, what they need to be reassured that their individual needs are recognized and solved for.","But in today's more complex world, the H&R Block experience is one requires us to be seamless across many channels. Our assisted and DIY clients interact with us in our offices, interact with us online, interact with us  mobile. And last tax season, we had more assisted clients interacting with our mobile applications than DIY. Because the delivery of some information, like the information about a client's refund, is best served by mobile. And we have more of our DIY clients accessing the live expertise of our tax professionals that are located in one of our 11,000 locations, but they're accessing them through many of our digital products, virtually.","Today's opportunity is seamlessly servicing across all of the channels. Every touch point, every channel. And going forward, we have a new way, a new door, if you will, to serve all tax clients with a technology-enabled seamless client experience. This year, we will introduce My H&R Block Account to all H&R Block clients. This account, or virtual door, will allow assisted and DIY tax clients to access all H&R Block tax and Tax Plus services through our offices, online or mobile application. This is the first of many steps in Bill's vision to provide more year-round access to our clients, and it represents another step bringing to life the vision of serving clients anywhere, anyway and anytime they choose to be served.","This means that, as tax client of H&R Block, I don't have to choose DIY to have a technology-enabled experience. Further, I have the ability to toggle between assisted and DIY because of my core account remains the same. Let me explain how My H&R Block Account works and why it's valuable to our clients. First, for our assisted clients, by establishing an H&R Block account online or during the tax preparation office -- tax preparation process in the office, our clients will be able to access key information: their prior year tax returns, their Emerald Card balance, as well as connect with their tax professional and other expertise, year-round. Clients will also be able to upload documents to the account, either online or via one of our mobile apps, where a client can simply snap a picture of a document and have it available online within the account.","This virtual, cloud-based data about our clients is then accessible to our tax professionals who will be able to interact with our clients and access their data, like the documents that were uploaded from a  mobile device via My H&R Block Account. This is a clear way to provide an assisted client a way to delegate the responsibility of tax preparation, but who may still be served with a more technology-enabled experience, both from H&R Block. But the account serves all clients, the same door can and will be open by our 5.5 million online clients, who already experience a similar set of conveniences through their online account.","The difference, and why this will be unique within the industry, even from multichannel competitors like Intuit, is that H&R Block will allow our DIY clients the same types of mobile capabilities, to snap pictures and upload them to the account through an H&R Block mobile app. This information is then made available to our lives experts and tax professionals, who can serve the DIY clients using a combination of their source documents, as well as the data entered into our online and mobile digital tax products. This type of seamless technology-enabled experience is at the heart of the H&R Block experience we are uniquely positioned to offer all taxpayers.","This lead me to discuss what will be new within DIY tax services. We have many improvements lined up this tax season in order to ensure we effectively serve clients who choose to do their own taxes and continue to grow this segment, as we have the past  2 tax seasons. Today I'll walk you through a few of these.","Starting with new free live advice for all DIY clients. We'll also offer Emerald Cards to our online clients for the first time and will integrate the My H&R Block Account into our online and mobile DIY products which has multiple benefits for our DIY users. We'll provide an understanding of the upcoming health care changes to our clients, a topic I'll fully cover when I get to assisted tax, and we'll build on the launch of our mobile products last year, with new product enhancements for these users. First, this tax season will improve the mechanism through which clients can access expertise from a tax professional by offering this live, via instant chat.","And as I mentioned earlier, we've actually been serving DIY clients with expert advice from a tax professional within our digital products, in one form or another, since the year 2000. But this will be the first year live advice will be offered free to all of our online and desktop software clients via live chat with a tax professional. This capability gives us a chance to save consumers at the moment of frustration, leading to higher satisfaction retention and, occasionally, conversion to assisted.","I have to admit, I am happy to see TurboTax continuing to expand its own live advice offerings and talk about the benefits of live advice within its tax products. Because we've long believed in the need of an expert in support of the tax process. This is, of course, a strength of H&R Block. One we can readily scale, and one clients expect from our brand. In digital, we also will offer the Emerald Card for the first time this year. This change will expand the number of H&R Block tax clients who have a chance to take the Emerald Card as a delivery vehicle for their tax refund.","Today, almost 3 million clients take an Emerald Card out of the 14.9 million assisted clients who are offered it as an option. In the upcoming tax season, with the addition of online clients, we'll offer the Emerald Card to over 20 million tax clients. While this is our first season offering this as an online financial product, we are looking to build on the momentum of the success we've had last year with the refund transfer product, or the product that we've historically called a RAC.","Last year, nearly 40% more DIY clients used the refund transfer, thanks to better positioning of this financial product within our digital products. I've already mentioned the creation of My H&R Block Account which means that all H&R Block clients have the ability to access our tax service seamlessly across channels. And besides additional services, like mobile document upload and live expert integration, DIY clients will also be able to move seamlessly between the iPad and the online versions of our paid product. Here you see that, really, at any point in the flow, I can continue exactly where I left off on the iPad or online.","I also want to assure you that we remain very focused on 2 key areas that have driven our growth, particularly in online, over the last 2 tax seasons. First, although we have improved conversion, or the rate turn in clients who registered into a completed or filed return, by 3 points, we still have more opportunity. This year we have simplified areas in the interview use by more complex clients by directly integrating their charitable donations evaluation which, last season, was a separate application.","Further, our marketing team, led by a Robert Turtledove, continues to focus on one of our biggest challenges, that only nearly 2 in 3 DIY clients know H&R Block makes tax software. Our 12-point improvement in awareness over the past 2 tax seasons is only the beginning. We know that we can improve by telling the story of the power of our tax software and leveraging our unique free audit support and representation. But beyond that, I'm not going to discuss our marketing creative or any promotional plans with you, assisted or digital, because of competitive reasons.","Mobile will also be a key part of our growth plan for DIY. Last season, we launched new iPad and smartphone tax preparation apps for both Android and Apple operating systems. The iPad app is a fully functioning tax prep app with all screens that are available in our online app. The smartphone apps are more limited in functionality, geared at primarily serving 1040EZ clients with minimal data entry needs.","In 2013, we had a number of new enhancements, but the one I'm most excited about, is that our smartphone apps will be available in Spanish. This represents H&R Block's first-ever fully Spanish DIY product. We're also enhancing these products by adding the ability to import data from a W-2, a feature that has historically only been available in online and software. We've dramatically improved the feature to take a picture of a W-2 and have the data imported automatically.","We've given more flexibility to test drive our app before a purchase and we've integrated with My H&R Block Account to allow mobile DIY clients the ability to access and view their PDF prior year returns via a PDF viewer on their phone.","Now I'm going to shift gears, and I'm going to finish by taking you through the other part of our tax service strategy, what we have planned for our assisted tax clients. In assisted tax, our focus is also on the client experience. Breaking it down to deliver consistent service quality in the most critical aspects. I'm now going to share with you the highest level of the playbook that Amy McAnarney has rolled out to the entire level of her organization, just to demonstrate a glimmer of the maniacal focus we placed on delivering consistent service quality within our client experience.","This starts by leveraging technology to create systematic protocols within our offices, and that begins even before the client visits. First, to create appointments. I mentioned earlier in my presentation that we have an opportunity to make more appointments prior to the tax season. Second, when we do this, we must match our clients to the same tax professionals last year, a referred or one with more expertise or the best tax pro. With the priority, of course, to drive retention 5 points higher, by matching clients to the prior tax professional. We then have protocols within the office, at the front desk, to get that to get our clients to get that right match and to ensure our tax professionals deliver our service promise. And to deliver more value through a tax plus mindset at the desk.","We dramatically simplified and revised the process by which financial products are presented to the clients, leading with the benefit, in a way that makes it easy for the tax pro to tell the story about our Tax Plus offerings. Finally, we ensure our clients have the right follow-up, with special protocols for at-risk clients and ensuring that we have clients enroll in My H&R Block Account for year-round access and  engagement.","Through the account, clients have 24 by 7 by 365 access to all of their tax documents and can get in touch with their tax professional or office support team. We believe that this will drive a much stickier relationship over time. Now I recognize that I've taken you into the weeds a little bit regarding our retail office tactics.","And while some of you might call this Retail 101, we know we can improve the execution in our offices and when we do the things that we categorize as consistent service quality that they add up. Over time, if we consistently execute just 2 of the items that I mentioned before the visit, we see a retention improvement of 2 to 3 points. The in-office experience items can lead to 1 to 2 additional points of retention and this adds up. Each additional point of retention drives $18 million in pretax earnings. So like I said, we're maniacal about consistent service quality.","Now let's talk about the uncertainty in tax laws that will drive more clients to Block seeking help. The tax law changes and what I will discuss in detail today are the multi-year changes consumers face as part of the Affordable Care Act. This impacts consumers in 2 main areas, their tax returns and their eligibility for a subsidy when purchasing health insurance.","This tax season, consumers who work for companies with over 250 employees, will see information about their employer coverage show up on their W-2. Further, in the fall of 2013, when the health insurance exchanges open for enrollment, the tax return will be used as the easiest way to enroll. In 2014, tax filers will for the first time recognize that health care is, now, a tax. And if they don't have coverage, they will face a penalty on their 2014 return.","The prior year tax return continues to be the method for enrollment in the insurance exchanges. In 2015, anyone who received the subsidy on their health care coverage during 2014, will be required to file a tax return. And additionally, the tax process will then include a reconciliation of subsidy eligibility that could raise or lower the tax refund based on whether eligibility for the subsidy changed during that year. That is to say, for those receiving a subsidy, if income increases or decreases over the course of the year, it may mean that they owe or should have received more. But whatever the outcome, it will be determined as part of the tax filing and refund calculation process.","Did I make this process crystal clear to everyone? This is very confusing and the reality is that consumers have the same reaction. They don't understand it. They don't understand what it means and they're really not sure who is going to explain it to them. So although the Affordable Care Act won't require enrollment through the exchanges until next fall, we believe the time is now to let our clients, and in particular, 1048 clients, understand how these changes impact them.","Our consumer research clearly indicates that our clients don't understand what Health Care Reform means, but it also indicates, they see their tax preparer as a trusted source to understand the implications of these new laws. This tax season, we will ensure all of our clients walk away with an understanding of what Health Care Reform means to them, how for those impacted, the tax return will be the easiest way to enroll, will explain the penalty if no coverage is taken and how to sign up. We believe this gives our tax professionals another way to demonstrate their expertise and value to our clients.","We also like the upside it has for our business in the long-term. Whenever there are tax law changes, even small ones consumers look to our experts to help them navigate the complexity. For example, a few years back, Congress introduced the homebuyer's credit, which impacted around 3.3 million taxpayers.  We estimate that this drove an additional 50,000 high-value, high-margin assisted clients to H&R Block. By comparison, the Affordable Care Act is estimated to impact tens of millions of consumers over the next few years.","The over 90,000 tax professionals I mentioned earlier, as one of the key competitive advantages will be well-prepared to help consumers deal with these upcoming changes. Beyond health care, there are other industry trends that will help us grow in the long-term. I mentioned during my overview of the tax industry, the independent tax preparers had declined by 4% over the past couple of years. We think this trend benefits us and are poised to take advantage of it by working to convert independents to H&R Block as a franchisee or via an outright acquisition.","Today, nearly half of independent preparers are -- pardon me, nearly half of tax preparers are independent, but the economics have changed. These small business owners are facing higher compliance and regulatory cost and have lost of RAL profit sources, which make our scale more appealing to small operators. It allows us to be discerning.","We are zeroed in on the 25,000 or so independents who generate more than 500 returns and we're carefully targeting high-quality and independents who cover areas that penetrated key markets, particularly, Latino and other key client segments for H&R Block. We've also recently built a broad integration capability to bring them into the H&R Block family to ensure that we create sustainable performance in years 2, 3 and beyond.","This tax season, we also plan to grow new clients through third-party partnerships, doubling our Walmart locations, our distribution channel we'd historically seen as a source of new client acquisition. We'll also grow Latino clients through the help of Latino associations and partners. And let me be clear: H&R Block serves more Latino tax filers than any other tax preparer in the United States. And we found that we'll grow Latino clients in markets where we have tight partnerships with community-based Latino organizations.","So this year, we'll work with 2 large community-based organizations. We have a new partnership with New Futuro, an organization committed to helping Latinos achieve their educational goals. And we'll expand our partnership with the Hispanic Access Foundation, a grassroots organization aimed at improving the financial well-being of Hispanic families.","Finally, I have to mention our military partner. I'm very proud to tell you that, in tax season '12, 43% of all active and reserve duty service members prepared their taxes with H&R Block. I hope this overview gives you greater insight into how we expect to achieve sustainable profitable growth in the tax business. This begins with a strong focus on creating a great and consistent client experience. It also means deepening relationships with our clients through the expertise of the industry's best tax professionals.","And by delivering consistent service quality at every touch point, we open the door to become more than a tax company: a tax-plus company, a client-centric company that uses the tax interview experience as a springboard to new and innovative products and services that strengthen our clients' financial lives and our company's bottom line. You'll hear more about this topic from Susan Ehrlich when we return from a break. So now let's take a 15-minute break, and let's be back at about 10 'til the hour. Thank you.","[Break][Presentation]","Susan P. Ehrlich","Good morning, everyone, and welcome back from the break. I'm Susan Ehrlich, and I'm delighted to be with -- to be here with you today to share with you the evolution we've made over the last 12 months in developing and executing on our strategy for financial services. My presentation to you this morning will focus on 4 key areas. I'll begin with an overview of our business model for financial services, then I'll spend some time on our observations regarding the marketplace and the competitive landscape. This will then lead into a review of our products and our program enhancements for this tax season. And then finally, I'll finish with a discussion of H&R Block Bank and its role with respect to the future delivery of our strategy.","H&R Block possesses several unique assets for developing and delivering a successful consumer financial services program. There is tremendous leverage in our exclusive distribution channel. We possess an extensive footprint of over 11,000 offices and an army of bank agency-trained tax professionals who provide us with a near-0 cost of acquisition. Through this channel, we will introduce our clients to differentiated products of exceptional value and build on our clients' use of these products to grow year-round relationships with H&R Block. This is delivering tax plus.","So in looking at the tax plus model, which Bill and Jason have introduced you to, how do we take this critical tax preparation experience and leverage it into creating tax plus relationships with tens of millions of our clients? Our competitive advantages are exclusive distribution and seamless integration. Our goal will not be to try and serve everybody but instead to focus on the over 22 million clients in the U.S. who know our brand and our tax professionals and whom we've come to know through the tax interview. Among these clients, H&R Block holds a special place as a trusted adviser to them and their families for handling one of the most important financial transactions of their year. By seamlessly integrating our financial products directly into the client interaction points of the tax interview experience itself, we introduce our clients to the additional value we can provide them.","From here, we can expand our services, support and contact management strategies through online and mobile delivery platforms outside of the tax office and give our clients 24\/7 year-round access to H&R Block and our products' exceptional features and benefits. Through this kind of relevant year-round engagement, we provide more value, deepen our relationships and grow our revenue. The result is an H&R Block able to meet the -- our clients' money management needs anywhere, whether that's through the office, online or over the phone; any way, whether that's kiosk, live or mobile app; any time, creating a delivery capability that rivals any in the marketplace today.","The fulfillment of this evolving consumer financial strategy will take us from a company exclusively focused on settlement products to one more broadly focused on an array of financial services, from a company focused on the 3 to 4 months of tax season to one that's serving clients all 12 months year-round, and from a company serving the financials needs of primarily unbanked customer to one with the capabilities of meeting the money management needs of all mainstream Americans.","Now let's spend some time reviewing the market and competitive landscape for executing on this strategy. We've spoken with you over the years about the consumer segment referred to by the FDIC and others as the unbanked or underserved. As reported, the segment represents 34 million households and 68 million people. These households have modest incomes. 68% earn $50,000 a year or less. They're younger, 9.5 million are between the ages of 17 and 30. And their credit is less well established. Only 25% have prime credit scores, and many have no credit scores at all. H&R Block serves millions of these clients today. But today, there are millions more mainstream consumers who are looking for a better solution and are now up for grabs in the marketplace for money management. Following recent changes in account policies and pricing practices, it's estimated by the FDIC that 1 in 10 Americans have closed a bank account and left the traditional banking system.","At the same time, customer loyalty to a single banking relationship is in decline, with nearly 6 in 10 Americans now handling their money management with more than one company, up 9 percentage points from last year. And new technologies and new entrants have further encouraged consumers to explore nontraditional alternatives, with 3 in 10 Americans now having and using a nonbank payment account of some kind.","These transitions and upheavals are not limited to the deposit side of the household balance sheet either. Access to credit and the availability of consumer credit is in decline. Home equity and credit card balances are down. In fact, lending is down in every major category, with the notable exception of student lending which continues to show gains in nearly every quarter since early 2007. This reduction in access to credit gets more pronounced the further down the FICO score bands you go.","These secular changes in the consumer financial services marketplace are driving changes in consumer behavior and product usage. Prepaid is now the fastest-growing segment in the retail financial services -- in retail financial services today. Not only is it an attractive alternative to cash for the underserved, offering convenience and spending control, it's also an attractive alternative to a checking account for mainstream clients, helping them avoid overdraft and other fees.","And while prepaid is growing fast, it's still significantly smaller than either credit or debit, enabling the category to potentially sustain this level of growth for quite some time to come. And within the market for credit, with traditional supply reduced, consumer demand for alternative forms of credit is on the rise. For example, H&R Block continues to see strong demand for our Emerald Advance line of credit in the holiday season. So across the board, we're well positioned to take advantage of these market opportunities and trends. With that, let's now transition and spend some time talking about our product suite for fulfilling on this strategy.","H&R Block's products comprise 4 types of financial services: the traditional settlement products category, our Emerald Card program, our Emerald Advance credit program and our new Money Express program. Let me start with a few thoughts on settlement products.","One of the most common settlement products is the refund transfer. It's also been called the Refund Anticipation Check or RAC. In the first half of tax season last year, 53% of our clients obtained a refund transfer from us, and refund transfer volume has remained strong over the years. A primary benefit of the refund transfer is its ability to enable a client to pay their tax preparation fees out of the proceeds from a tax refund.","This payment option is a convenience that every client can benefit from, and we see a significant opportunity in improving our merchandising and communication at this payment option to grow product revenues. So this season, we're adding office collateral at all desks, which highlights the 2 ways that clients have to pay for their tax prep. They can pay today at checkout, or they can pay nothing today and withhold their fees from their refund through a refund transfer. And this presentation of the refund transfer benefits is going to be reinforced through new screens added into the tax interview itself that mirror the office collateral and present all clients with the refund transfer option for paying for their tax prep.","So now let's talk about Emerald Card. Since its launch in 2007, our Emerald Card program has been wildly successful, with 2.9 million cards issued and $9.5 billion in funds loaded in tax season 2012. In this summer, bankrate.com evaluated all prepaid programs and evaluate -- and rated Emerald Card among their top 3, a very coveted endorsement for us. The Emerald prepaid card offers us a steady stream of fee-based revenues. And historically, we've been satisfied treating Emerald and the fee income it generates as a kind of plastic tax refund check one and done. Going forward, we're focused not only on growing accounts but also on improving year-round usage and the revenues that result. How are we going to go about this?","Let's start with our fee schedule. Heading into tax season last year, we simplified the Emerald Card fee structure. We streamlined a mix of costs and fees into 5 easy-to-understand fees that create one of the lowest-cost client-friendly prepaid programs in the industry. There are no monthly fees, no activation fees, no usage fees, just 5 customer fees for an ATM withdrawal, for an ATM balance inquiry or denial. There's a monthly inactivity fee if an account goes dormant and still has a balance. There's an over-the-counter fee for clients who are withdrawing all of the funds on the card in one go. And there's an expedited card delivery fee for those who are seeking overnight replacement for a personalized card, though a non-personalized card can be reissued free from any Block office. And based on the CFPB's proposed rulemaking regarding prepaid, we're very comfortable with where this positions us in the market. And if low fees weren't enough, we've added the CashBack rewards program this year to help drive new account acquisition and ongoing client usage.","Emerald Cash Rewards was launched to all Emerald cardholders in August. Clients receive a weekly email that notifies them of the card-linked, merchant-funded offers available that week. When a client shops at these participating merchants and uses their Emerald Card, the CashBack discount they earn is loaded onto their card instantly. It's the best kind of rewards program that there is. There are no points to have to keep track of and no coupons to have to remember to use. No other prepaid program is offering anything like this.","And with our focus on everyday-purchase categories from Target and Home Depot, to Burger King and Quiznos, our clients can save over $100 every month by using their Emerald cards at places they're shopping all the time. And clients see that CashBack post instantly. So when they sign up for text alerts, they receive a text message when the qualifying purchase transaction happens, and then seconds later, a subsequent text message notifies them that the CashBack discount has posted back to their card. It's great.","On top of these value proposition changes, we've also made improvements in our account management capabilities as well. Historically, this was not an area of focus or development for us, and we really hadn't provided clients with the kind of experience and product features that they need to make Emerald relevant beyond the tax season, but we're changing that. This year, when a client chooses an Emerald Card in addition to the non-personalized card they'll receive in the office that's issued to them instantly through H&R Block client, they will also automatically receive a personalized card mailed to their home. It will arrive along with a welcome kit explaining all the rich features and benefits of card ownership, another first for us this season. Clients can learn about how to download our Emerald mobile app which helps cardholders view their transaction history or find a no-surcharge ATM to get cash.","And this fall, through our mobile app, Emerald became the first program -- prepaid program in the industry to enable check cashing to the card with instant availability of the funds, no 5- to 7-day delay, which is a critical benefit for a prepaid client. And then finally, just last month, we also launched Emerald Online so clients can now manage their Emerald Card like a bank account, pay bills, write a check, top up a cell phone or transfer money to savings. And it's all integrated to the My Account portal that Jason described to you earlier.","With this impressive array of features and functionality, the Emerald Card program is transformed, and we earn the right to have clients using Emerald Card year-round. And that's important to us because year-round Emerald Card users reload and spend 3x the average of Emerald Card users overall. This new and improved Emerald Card functionality stacks us up very competitively in the market as well, both to the category leaders NetSpend and Green Dot as well as to recent new entrants like Chase Liquid and Amex Bluebird, with a number of impressive features unmatched by any of these programs. Given the recent launch of Amex's Bluebird program at Walmart, let me just take 30 seconds and share with you our thoughts on the impact of that new program.","With its client-friendly features and marquee names, I think the launch of Bluebird will continue to help legitimize the prepaid category. But that said, there are certain features, like the limited merchant acceptance of American Express and the lack of FDIC insurance and the inability therefore to load tax refunds to the card, that make its relevance limited to the typical prepaid client. And we believe our clients will remain partial to their Emerald cards.","Shifting gears from prepaid to lending, let's talk about Emerald Advance. The Emerald Advance small-dollar line of credit program is targeted at customers who don't have as many credit options as others. So our EA program really makes a difference for these clients. Our underwriting is based on extensive knowledge we receive about our clients, including verified ability to pay gathered with their income information.","Offering credit for clients during the holiday season helps us improve client loyalty and retention as well as helps us drive new client acquisition. And our unique access to the tax event, along with enhancements we've made to our collections capabilities, helps us control our credit costs as well.","New for this season, we created a phone application channel. We've made the program available to new and prior clients, and we launched before Black Friday to capture the full holiday season.","In addition, given the marketing opportunity I described or the market opportunity I described earlier, we're piloting a number of new credit programs this year to capitalize on what we see, starting with an installment loan program. We're lending up to $1,000 for terms that range from 3 to 12 months. This program offers clients, who are more comfortable with a fixed monthly payment structure, a great option for borrowing. For clients who are looking for a more traditional line of credit product, we're also offering both unsecured and secured credit cards. These programs will offer credit lines for up to several thousand dollars and give clients the convenience of everyday access to credit and the flexibility of determining their own repayment schedules, subject, of course, to meeting minimum monthly payments. We are very excited about the prospects for all of these new programs.","And last but not least, our Money Express program. In collaboration with start-up company Nexxo, our H&R Block Money Express creates a new way to deliver a host of money services through a stand-alone kiosk, including cash withdrawals, cash reloads, money orders, check-to-card, money transfers, bill payment and prepaid cell phone top-up. Offering these services through a kiosk in our office enables us to provide our clients with lower product fees, a convenient one-stop shop in a safe and secure environment that facilitates year-round use and builds incremental revenue as well as client retention.","This season, we're piloting Money Express in 30 locations. And if you haven't met our Head of Money Express, Greg Simlet [ph], he is in the back of the room and he'll be out in the lobby to take you through a demo of Money Express and show you its capabilities.","And finally, a few words about the H&R Block Bank. Chartered in 2006, H&R Block has built a strong bank enterprise. It's a conservative portfolio of $1.2 billion, which ranks it 430th in size amongst U.S. banks. It has a stable stream of fee-based revenues and generates a strong return on assets. It's a great little bank.","The bank portfolio is very conservatively managed, with 67% of assets in readily marketable securities, a declining portfolio of legacy mortgages, a line of credit portfolio that peaks between Christmas and tax season and a sizable pool of IRA, checking and savings account deposits, in addition to the prepaid account monies. The bank's revenue profile is very conservative as well, with over 68% of revenues generated through fee income for both the prepaid card as well as through the bank's share of refund transfer fees. This helps the bank deliver a return on average assets of 437 basis points, more than 6x the return of the bank's peer group.","Let's talk a little bit about mortgages. And just to be clear, this is not Sand Canyon. Greg will talk about Sand Canyon later. This is the bank's mortgage portfolio. With just over $371 million in net outstandings, the bank's mortgage portfolio has declined in size by nearly $1 billion over the last 5 years. And with loan loss severity flattening and delinquencies trending down, our mortgage provision expense continues to improve to about $24 million in fiscal year 2012, and we project this trend to continue. The result is an overcapitalized bank, with leverage and capital ratios well in excess of the minimum requirements to be considered well capitalized, in some cases over 10x the minimum requirements.","But with all of that said, on October 9, H&R Block disclosed that it's seeking strategic alternatives to owning a bank. Goldman Sachs and First Annapolis have been retained to assist us in assessing our options. We are seeking a partner capable of acquiring our bank enterprise and partnering with us to leverage our unique set of assets, including those 22-million-plus existing clients relationships, our over-11,000 tax offices across the United States, our army of 90,000-plus bank agency-trained tax professionals, our access to over $20 billion in tax refunds facilitated and our insight into verifiable ability to pay information for lending, all this to build an unparalleled consumer financial services enterprise, and I know we can achieve this.","As you may know from my background and experience, this is not the first  time I've built this kind of model. And I know it can succeed. The key is in joining with the right partner. So if you know anyone interested in buying a bank, please have them call me.","Let me leave you now with a video of one of our newest features, the mobile Check to Card experience. Thank you.","[Presentation]","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Hi, everyone. I want to spend my time with you today actually summarizing a lot of what you've heard from Bill and Susan and Jason. I want to do that, though, from a financial perspective, of course. And also, because I've only been here in H&R Block for about 6 months, I want to provide you some -- maybe some new-guy perspective as well.","Before I do that, though, I do want to talk about the second quarter. As you know, earlier today, we filed our quarterly SEC registration -- sorry, quarterly SEC filing, and I want to hit some of the highlights with you.","From continuing operations, we reported revenues of $137 million last year, and we improved that by $8 million this year to $129 million. The main driver of this was H&R Block Australia. As Bill mentioned to you earlier, they had a great tax season. They were up high single digits for the number of returns, and that translated to double-digit revenue increases. We're quite proud of the work that the H&R Block Australia team delivered this year. From a pretax loss perspective, we reported a loss of $162 million, which is a big improvement from last year's loss of $204 million.","Now, of course, we get some of the benefits from the revenue improvement from last year -- or excuse me, from H&R Block Australia. But mostly, what's driven this is actually expense favorability. There is really 3 things that drove the expense variability. There's roughly $2 million of sort of small positive cats and dogs and then roughly $34 million combined of 2 other main drivers. The first one was really about 50% of that, and that was really favorable legal progression within our overall business model. We had a number of legal issues that resolved this year successfully. And also last year in the second quarter, we incurred a lot of expenses that didn't reoccur this year.","We also had continued favorability from our cost-reductions efforts. That was about $17 million as well, and we'll talk about that more here in a minute.","In terms of EPS and shares outstanding We reported a loss of $0.37 a share, a $0.04 improvement from last year's second quarter. The main driver there, of course, was the expenses with a small amount from the revenue side. Now as you know, we also have a lot less shares outstanding, and that's roughly 10%. In those quarters, like the second quarter where we lose money, we actually have a negative impact from that. But later this year as we turn to profitability, you will see a benefit on the EPS due to these 10%-less shares from a year-to-year perspective.","On the Sand Canyon side. Sand Canyon reviewed $10 million of new claims in the second quarter -- I'm sorry, they received $10 million more claims in the second quarter and reviewed $257 million of claims within the quarter. The result of that after all those reviews was a very immaterial change to the reserve, and that reserve stands at basically $129 million. At the end of the quarter, they also had $28 million of reserves -- excuse me, of loans that still need to be reviewed.","Specific and probably more broadly to Sand Canyon, we've talked to you a lot historically about the statute of limitations. As you know, this is the time frame in which a buyer can submit a representation of warranty claim against loans that have been sold by Sand Canyon whether they were done through securitization or direct whole loan sales. Now there's some variation within the statute of limitations, but we generally believe that to be 6 years. Within the next year, Sand Canyon will be materially through that statute of limitations for loans that have been sold.","Sand Canyon at the end of the quarter had $129 million in reserves and approximately $300 million in equity. Now historically, claims have come in, in what I consider to be more of a chunky manner. There have been some quarters when the rep and warranty claims have come in quite high, and there have been some quarters where it come in quite low, very much like the last 2 quarters. But importantly, over the last 2 years, the absolute loss rate has been less than 1.5% on those claims. In the event that this is a worst -- worse-worst scenario, when you believe that the reserves get used up, as well as the equity, we believe that any arguments around corporate veil-piercing would not be successful. Sand Canyon has been and continues to be run as a separate legal entity.","Let me talk now about our cost program. Earlier this year, management outlined to you an $85 million to $100 million commitment to the bottom line as a direct result of cost-focused efforts. I'm happy to report, halfway through the year, we continue to track to the $85 million to $100 million. Now because I have you here in person, I thought it would be helpful to spend a bit more time on the cost structure and as it relates to the $85 million to $100 million cost program.","This is a picture of my cost base at the end of last year. Roughly, we have about $2.3 billion in costs and I've segmented them here by the main categories. As you can see compensation people cost, occupancy and marketing are my big 3 expenses. Our cost program was a top-to-bottom review, and there wasn't a single dollar that wasn't challenged through this process. If we actually look at it, on main sort of 3 items which I've summarized here for you, that foot out [ph] to the $85 million to $100 million of commitment.","Year-to-date basis, which is a combination of the second quarter and the first quarter, were at $35 million. Now because due to the seasonal nature of our business and the fact that we're just ramping up expenses, we expect to receive the remainder of the $50 million to $65 million to get to the total $85 million to $100 million for the year. The additional, and this is some new information for you, as I looked at the details of the program, there's actually 51 work streams that sit behind us. And when we look at the annualization benefit, we see additional benefits in 2014 of $15 million.","This is really the summary comments that I have in the second quarter. Later today, we'll have a chance in the Q&A, if you've got some more specific questions to ask. I'll be happy to handle them. And of course, after today, both myself and Derek are available for any further follow-up questions. But with that, I do want to kind of turn it more to the broad picture here, which is really what we're here in New York to share with you all.","Now I did join H&R Block 6 months ago. And before I joined the company, I thought long and hard about what makes H&R Block special. And now after having been here for company for a while, I've been able to validate and think about that further. And I want to share with you the model and how I think about H&R Block. At the same time, I think this is the same reasons that I think H&R Block is a great company that you as investors or potential investors should too.","There's no doubt that H&R Block is a value company. We have a predictable and growing core business. The tax preparation industry is a remarkable industry. When I look at the amount of capital that we required to support a large retail footprint and as well as a large technology part of our business I consider to be generally capital light, we have a long track record of generating strong free cash flow. And we've used that free cash flow to pay a very healthy dividend. We've increased that dividend, and we've bought back a lot of shares.","Now in addition to being a good value company, I think we've got real growth opportunities. We need to start with the fact that our core business is growing every year. To complement that, though, we believe we've got international leverage. We have scale businesses in Australia and Canada, and we are looking forward to additional countries down the road. Within the digital space, H&R Block was a late entrant here, but we're making up ground quickly. And I think you saw today a lot of smart investments and things we're excited about and believe we got a lot more room to grow there as well.","Financial service is an area that I have a lot of background in and I'm excited about. I can spend in all these areas more time, but this is the one area that I'm most excited about from a growth opportunity for the company. Now not only are we a value company that has some growth opportunities, but I think, from a risk perspective, we also got some things we can talk about.","I think we're generally low risk as it comes to mortgage now. We talked about Sand Canyon a little bit. In my view, as time goes on, that risk actually will resolve itself. There has been management turnover at the top, but importantly, you need to recognize that, that isn't all that runs a company. There's actually 50 key people that run the company, and as Bill mentioned, we have over 300 years of experience running a tax business. I've been very impressed the quality of people at H&R Block, as well as some of the new people that have joined the company.","So now let me jump into this in more detail. This is information from the IRS, and what we're showing you here is the number of tax returns filed in the United States every year back to 1951. There were 9 periods over this time frame where the number of returns actually declined. And in almost every circumstance, the next year, it went right back up again. As Jason said, you can put a ruler to this and almost get a straight line. I've not shown you Australian or Canadian data here, but if I did, you'd find the same trend.","Another interesting thing I find about this tax industry is the pricing power that we enjoy. We have generally very low price elasticity in the tax preparation industry. In fact, the only industry that we can find that has similarly low price elasticity is the auto body collision business. What do we have in common with them? Well, first of all, you have to get the service done. The second thing is the client has -- doesn't really understand the amount of experience or skill required to complete the effort. And third is we typically present the price at the end of the transaction. The industry enjoys this as a fundamental part of doing business.","H&R Block, over the last 10 years, has increased price at a greater rate than inflation. I want to be very clear with you today, though, that I'm not giving you an idea of what we're going to be doing going forward, specifically for this season. Instead, I think, as you think about the future, modeling plus 1% annual price increase is a very reasonable thing to do. We are not giving you specific pricing guidance for the season, however.","Also this tax chart, the price chart here on the right-hand side of the page, is what you would see if you went to an H&R Block office. This is what a client actually sees. This is last year's poster. If you want to see this year's one, we have an office on 3rd Avenue or right off of Times Square, and please feel free to go down there and take a look at our pricing structure.","If you take this pricing power and you combine that with the fact that the core business is growing at 1% to 2% per year, and then you apply that to H&R Block that has a level of fixed costs, you should expect to see consistent earnings growth. And that's what you're seeing. And this is a chart that goes back to 1981.It is not lost on me, Bill, the Board of Directors or the management team that earnings have been down in the last 3 seasons. In addition to the $85 million to $100 million of costs that we're taking out that we're committing to, we're very much focused on driving the top line. And a lot of what you heard today are the plans in which we're going do to execute that.","This is a slide that Jason shared with you. This is the tax preparation business in total. It's a $19 billion market, a very large market, and I'm showing you here how it subsegments into the 2 smaller markets of the DIY space which is 10% of the revenues and the assisted space which is 90% of the revenues. I'm just taking that same $19 billion market, and I'm now showing it by competitor. You can see H&R Block here, Intuit, the other brand and competitors and so on. I have 2 observations here.","The first observation is that H&R Block is the only company that can serve clients any way they want to be served, whether it's DIY or assisted. The second observation is, although we are the largest tax preparer in terms of single name in the industry, we do 1 in 6 returns in the United States, we only do 15% of the revenues. The industry is still dominated by independents and CPAs at 71% market share. And we have room to grow there, as well as take some share from our branded competitors.","We do that through our competitive advantage. We deliver the best-in-class tax professionals to the industry year in and year out. We have unmatched scale. We have 11,000 distribution points in the United States, an additional 1,000 in Australia and Canada, as well as pervasive online presence. Our brand is unmatched in the tax industry, no one can come close to it. And then within the industry, not only did H&R Block invent the industry, but I think we continue bring new ideas that add value to clients every day. Ultimately, H&R Block is the only tax preparation company that serves clients anywhere, any way at any time that they want to be served.","This is actually my footprint here in United States. I am not really sure, frankly, why we don't show Alaska, Hawaii, Canada and Australia, but the reality is we've got stores there, too. What I find impressive about this is that we've been doing this for a long time. We have a lot of experience running retail. For me, to open up a new store costs $60,000. It takes me about 1 year to break even on that store. To get to what I consider to be a reasonable level of profitability takes about 3 or 4 tax seasons.","A cool and interesting statistic from my side is 46% of our offices have been opened up for more than 30 years. That's amazing. Now specific to the number of stores we have and the mix between franchisee and company-owned, we will every season look hard about what make sense for us, but in general, we're quite happy with that footprint.","This is an interesting piece of analysis, what I'm showing you here is our staffing levels. During our slower season, which is really the spring and summertime, we have about 9,000 people. Now to be clear, year-round, we already are open year-round in many locations. That typically is a couple of days a week, that type of thing. And as we think about what year-round means, I think you've could be online, it could be through the stores, it could be through the kiosks. And it really, at some point, it comes down to a labor kind of conversation. We don't expect any material shift in this labor patterns in the near term.","As we get ready for the tax season, which is what we're doing right now, we begin to staff up. And when we finish, we'll end up with over 90,000 people. You may not appreciate the infrastructure and the skill required to do that, but let me tell you, it is an amazing skill that H&R Block has to be able to staff up this many people that quickly. What makes us even more amazing is these are not seasonal Christmas people that stand there helping you get a sweater. These are people who are computer savvy, they understand the IRS guidelines, they know how to do customer service and for H&R Block, this is what customers seek. This is H&R Block, and we deliver the best tax professionals to the industry. 34% of our tax professionals have more than 10 years of experience, and over 1\/2 have more than 5 years of experience.","For a tax professional to leave H&R Block after a few years is very difficult because if they do, they lose all their clients. They cannot bring their clients with them because they're not their clients, they're H&R Block clients. They don't have access to their records, their phone numbers. And if they were to try to do that, we would sue them.","In addition to that, we invest a lot of money into them, and they know that. And they can make a lot more money, as Jason said, through the productivity and the amount of tax returns that they can do. Our brand is unmatched within the tax preparation space. In fact, when you think about it more broadly, we have the same level of awareness as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Walmart. We've invested over $3.5 billion in that brand since 1962. Also importantly is not only do people know about the brand, but when you ask them what is it that you think about when you think about H&R Block? They talk about taxes, they talk about expertise, and they talk about trust.","Why does that matter? Well, it matters because for all intents and purposes, we're only open for a part of the year. Every season, people switch tax preparers, that happens. There are also new entrants to the marketplace, and we think that our brand is an important way to make sure that we're considered in every step of that. It's something we take a lot of pride in, and we believe this is a big differentiator within our space. It's fundamentally grounded in the fact that tax preparation relationship is a very profitable one. And if you're able to establish that relationship and deliver consistent service quality, you can establish a lifetime relationship with them. We will spend money here, and we think it's a good investment.","Retention is another thing around the industry that I think is quite positive. There's a number of reasons for that. I've summarized some of them here for you. Historically, H&R Block has compared ourselves to the main branded competitors on the assisted side and felt pretty good about the fact that we're in the 72% range, and they're in the low 60% range. We should be proud because we've invested a lot of time there, and we do a good job for our clients. What we need to do is look to what can we do in terms of entitlement, and we actually look at the CPAs, they typically have retention in the 90% range.","Now there's some reasons for that from a mix perspective. They tend to be more complex type of tax forms, which does lends itself to higher retention because of the deepness of their relationship and the expertise it's provided. But at the same time, there's no reason that H&R Block cannot continue to grow its retention. We're also showing you, on the digital side, that we've got room for improvement as well. We've made progress here, but when you look at the best competitor in the space, which is Intuit, we can see a dramatic opportunity for us to improve our results, and we're very focused on that.","Why this matters is because for every point of retention improvement, I generate an additional $0.04 a share of earnings. It's a big deal for us, and we're very focused on it.","Here's some additional information for you. Last season to this season, we continue to see consolidation within the industry. There are a lot of reasons for that. There's increased pressures on revenues. We think the RAL profitability has pretty much been squeezed out of the industry. We think the cost structure is going up, and ultimately, it's grounded in the fact there's more competition from people like H&R Block. We think, as we look out over the next few years, that may actually accelerate for several specific reasons.","The IRS is very focused in what they see as a real threat around fraud. Part of their response is increasing the certification requirements for tax professionals. It'll be higher cost, it'll be harder to pass, there'll be ongoing educational requirements, and we think this will put pressures on marginal players within the industry.","RALs, we think, are pretty much gone from the industry. The third point, and this is perhaps more anecdotal in nature, is that there's a demographic favorability that we're looking at. A lot of independents, in particular, established their business in the 1970s and '80s once they saw that H&R Block was legitimizing the category that they could make money. Those individuals need to retire. They have a difficult time finding a place to sell their business due to the seasonal nature of their cash flows and the fact they have very little tangible assets.","We believe, overall, that H&R Block is well positioned to take advantage of this. We have the financial capital to be able to do these transactions. We've been doing these transactions for many years. We know what to look for, and we know what makes success look like in a transaction.","Importantly, and this is specific to the independent channel, these are people that have built their clients over decades, and they take a lot of pride in that relationship. And when they do want to leave their business, they want to make sure their clients will be taken care for -- taken cared of. H&R Block has that reputation and we have the brand.","And lastly, and this is perhaps most selfish from my perspective, is we're likely just down the street from these competitors. And what that means financially for me is if I buy them, I typically can consolidate them and take some costs out of the transaction. And I can be more competitive.","On the digital side, we are now the second largest digital provider out there, and we take great pride in that. Jason and the team have worked quite hard on developing a full suite of digital offerings, and going into tax season '13, we're quite excited about what we've done. We continue to make investments here and frankly, I'll continue to make disproportional investments here, and we've resulted in actually taking market share, and we think that trend will continue.","Now importantly, we believe that the digital and assisted are ultimately a complementary type of offering. There are synergies between the 2. And at the same time, we continue to believe there are 2 distinct subsegments here, the DIY space and the assisted space. If you disagree with us and believe over time that may end up being more overlap between the 2, I think fundamental to that assumption is that the DIY providers will need to provide more assistance to their clients.","H&R Block is best positioned to do this. Last season, we completed 15 million returns in the assisted side, and we did that with 90,000 people. If I'm an at-scale digital player and believe I need to increase the amount of assistance that I need to provide to my clients, how many tens of thousands of people they need to hire and how will they do that?","This is another slide that Jason shared with you, and I'm not going to go through all the details about some of the things that we're investing and focusing on. The point of this page is at 16.2% market share, we believe that H&R Block has further room to grow within the digital space.","Let me talk about financial services now a little bit. I spent a lot of my career at GE Capital, in fact, actually mostly worked at GE Money, and that's really their consumer lending business. When I look at H&R Block, what I see is a tremendous opportunity in financial services. I'm not sure how many people actually understand the relationship that we have with our clients. A client will come to our location, will sit next to a tax professional for 45 minutes.","During that 45-minute interview, they will share very intimate information financially and about their personal situation with us. From a financial services perspective, that is golden information and a golden relationship. What makes us even better is the vast majority of our clients get a refund. And for most of those people, that's 10% to 20% of their annual income. That also is quite interesting from a financial services perspective.","The third thing about this relationship is they come back next year, 70-plus percent of the time. And that, for me, as you can imagine is also a great thing from our overall financial services opportunity. This is a great relationship, and as long as we have the right products and we position them properly, we think we have a real opportunity to grow here.","What's also really neat is who walks through our door. Susan shared some of this information with you, but our clients do tend to skew towards modest incomes. They're a little bit younger, and they have less well established credit. Historically, we have talked about the non-bank and under banked as a primary focus for H&R Block. And I think that as time goes on, we own -- or actually reposition and think about that differently. There are fundamental changes that are happening in the United States around access to credit from a regulatory perspective and overall risk return relationship. The financial services provider, specifically traditional ones, are thinking about it differently. And H&R Block has a role to play here.","In terms of the right products, these are our products, the main one's that we're going to market with the share -- the refund transfer products, the Emerald Prepaid MasterCard or general-purpose reloadable debit card as well as the Emerald Advance line of credit. These products are complementary to the tax relationship that we've established. And it's a natural part of the discussion we're going to have with our clients. Our ability to sell these products has a direct benefit not only to the client, where we can increase satisfaction and retention, but translates to my bottom line.","One financial services product on average results in 55% more margin for me in the first year, and the overall lifetime value that client's also gone up by 32%. Let me talk about each product here a bit more specifically. For a lot of clients who walks through our doors, paying $180 for their tax preparation is a big deal. That's the average roughly cost that we charge them. Instead, because most of our clients receive a refund, 87% and it's also quite large, two thousand six hundred of odd dollars, we have the ability for them to pay that $180, 2, 3 weeks later when the IRS actually refunds their money. That's what a refund transfer is.","Last year, we gave away that product as a promotional opportunity effectively for free. This year, we're not. And we expect that our revenues from the refund transfer product in 2013 will approximately -- like that we did we did back in 2011. It will be a good source of improvement from a year-to-year perspective. On the Emerald Card, this is the one product that I'm personally most interested and most excited about. When you look at ourselves, the current program that last year issued 2.9 million cards and compare that to both NetSpend and Green Dot, we have a tremendously large program, it's the third largest in the United States. We issued that many cards. I find that quite impressive. What we've not done a good job at is convincing our clients that they can use these cards year-round.","And you can see that clearly here on the revenue per account, which is really the main driver that the more they use it, which is really a year-round statement, the more money we make. Susan and the financial services team have increased utility of that program, we'll provide better education and ongoing incentives for clients to understand that they can use this card year-round. We're also, of course, focused on issuing more cards but in particular, what I'm watching is I want to see how the number of times they use that card per year. You can now do some quick math if you see us doing $36 per year, compare that to Green Dot and NetSpend, and understand that we have a huge opportunity here. It's something we're focused on, and it's something we're investing in.","Ultimately, our financial products are going to be a core part of our tax preparation strategy. They are adjacent and they make sense from our clients perspective, and we're very focused on them. It all starts, though, with the tax origination activity.","Let me now talk about our cost structure a little bit. What this page is showing you is actually my EBITDA margins over the last 4 years here. I've also shown you -- and ours is in green -- what I'm also showing you is the S&P 500 EBITDA margins as well as the S&P 500 Consumer Index margins for comparative purposes. And I said, \"Hey, let's throw up Intuit there as well.\" We have good EBITDA margins in this company. They're strong and they're healthy. We're very focused this year in taking an initial $85 million to $100 million cost out, and that will benefit my 2013 margin percentage. I get a lot of questions about what happens after that, and so instead of giving you a specific number for 2014 and beyond, what I want to talk to you about more is a concept.","Our objective at H&R Block is not to have EBITDA margin percentages at 100%, it's not possible. Instead, our goal is to drive EBITDA dollars at acceptable margin percentage rates, and we spent a lot of time talking about that concept, analyzing our cost structure, comparing ourselves to the industry, looking at the individual sources of revenue, and where I come out at is we should be in a target range between 27% to 32%.Two main points here: first is, at the point at which we do get within this range, let's say we get to the higher end of the range, that does not mean we stop worrying about costs. Bill would not tolerate it, and my job at H&R Block would be rather limited at that point in time. We will continue and always be focused in our cost structure. What happens, though, is when we do hit the higher end of the range, we will then reinvest those cost savings into growth, which translates to more EBITDA dollars.","The second main point here is this is not a range that will stay forever at H&R Block. As we continue to grow, we may be disproportionately growing within certain areas like financial services or digital, and they do have different cost structures. I think as a point here with Intuit, that's one of the reasons they're so high is they don't have that same fixed cost basis that we do from a retail perspective as well as some of the variable costs that we incur from a tax preparation. So we will continue to reevaluate this range.","So let me now kind of summarize probably one of the main topics that people here talk about, which is capital allocation. I've been here for 6 months. I've met over 100 investors and potential investors. I've talked to a lot of the sell side analysts. We've done 2 quarterly calls, and the number one question I get, and I'm just going to boil it down here is why don't you go and borrow a bunch of money, lose your credit rating, your investment-grade credit rating, and buy back a bunch of shares? Was that about right? Not everyone asked that question, that's the number one question I get.","For those of you here today, to get an answer to that question, you're going to be disappointed because we're not going to give you the answer to that. Instead what I want to talk about is the methodology by which we think about capital allocation at H&R Block in more detail. It starts with the preferences waterfall [ph]. As I have cash available, my first priority is funding the operational needs of the business. Once I do that, I also have to worry about, at the same time, our liquidity profile. We're a very seasonal business, and this matters to us. After that, I think about our strategy and how to fund that. Sometimes that's a source of cash for us, and sometimes that's a usage of cash for us. Once I finish that, I then have to support the dividend. We have been paying a dividend for 200 consecutive quarters. We're about to be at our 201st, it's something we take a lot of pride in and we take it as a big responsibly.","After that, and as I have available cash, I then examine whether I'm going to repurchase shares, increase the dividend or hold the cash. Important to you, you need to understand that H&R Block, we always have a guiding principle, which is generating meaningful shareholder returns. We know that this is how we get measured. An important part of this concept is -- actually, probably to me the most important short-term focus, which is what I call the requirements. We need to have disciplined evaluation at each step of this preferences waterfall.","When we do choose to spend money, we need to have accountability to ensure that when they give the money, we get the proper return back on it, and ultimately we need to be guided by a clear view of what drives value. For the sake of being labeled too honest in an Investor Conference, I'll give you some perspective after being here for 6 months. This is the area that H&R Block has full room for improvement in, and it's been something I've been very focused in on and will continue to be very focused in on, which are these requirements.","I'm now going to talk what each one of these more specifically. As a large retail company, we need to have a professional appearance. When a client or prospective client walks into a retail location, the carpet, the paint, the signage matter, and we're going to spend money on that. As a large technology company, our business in the assisted space is supported by technology. In the DIY space, it is our business, and so we will invest in ongoing software as well as hardware investments. At the same time, though, because we're a mature company, most of the capital that we're spending is, in many cases, replacement. And so when I look at what we need from a retailer and a technology perspective, I feel -- especially when I compare ourselves to other large technology retail companies, that we spend relatively light capital. In fact, when I look back over the last 5 years, this is my CapEx as it relates to revenues. Going forward, I believe the right number for us is around 3% of revenues. If you notice here in 2011, we were at about 2%, and I can tell you firsthand that was a mistake, and it's not the right number for the company. We will obviously challenge every dollar we spend, but in general, I think 3% of revenues is the right number.","As it relates to liquidity, you cannot think about H&R Block and not understand the seasonal nature of our business. This graph at the bottom actually shows my cash profile over the last several tax seasons. At the end of the U.S. tax season, which is my high-water point from a cash balance, to the trough, which is really the beginning of the U.S. tax season, I go through about $1.5 billion. The capital structure's set up right now, so that roughly in the third quarter, my third quarter every year, are now borrowing money to fund the operational needs of our business. That is the current capital structure.","And we have historically used an investment-grade rating to access commercial paper as a cheap and available source of funding to get us through that time period. This past summer, as all of you know, we have successfully renegotiated our committed line of credit. We also sized it for what we think was the appropriate amount of $1.5 billion. We are quite happy with the terms of that, and importantly, we switched the main covenant from an equity-based covenant to a cash flow-based covenant, which we think is more appropriate for a business like this.","The second thing we did, which is just recent, is we had some bonds due here in the beginning of the new year. We successfully refinanced those and placed $500 million just last month that have a 10-year maturity. The interest rate savings on that is about $18 million or $19 million year, which is $0.04 a share in savings.","I want to now talk about our strategic needs, and I want to start maybe looking a little backwards here. A lot of what management has been consumed with over the last several years is unwinding this structure. We sold our Sand, McGladrey in a broker-dealer and returned most of that capital back to you. We focus very much in Sand Canyon and what the future of Sand Canyon looks like, and I think, in my opinion, that's really a time will tell type of this conclusion. What we are today is a focused tax preparation and financial services company.","Now let me talk about our strategic initiatives going forward, and I want to actually pick up some of the key themes you've heard about today, but put it in the context of capital needs. I'm going to start with international growth. This is not Canada and Australia. These are at-scale, large individual companies that are generating good returns. Of course, we'll continue to invest there, but that's pretty much in the self-funding part of my world right now. What I'm talking about here is Brazil, India and another country or 2 over the next year or 2. Last year, Brazil and India in total cost me less than $10 million. Our objective in those markets and in new markets is to determine a model that is actually scalable and profitable, and we're prepared to take a few years to figure that out. Once we do that, we will then add capital, but we'll be convinced that's a good investment.","Overall, I consider this to be a small negative use of capital, with the key word being small. Within the digital space, this is a core focus area for the company. We continue to invest money here and are quite happy with the results. Because we're a scale digital player, a lot of those investments turned back into current year return. So therefore, for me, I consider this to be a positive source of capital strategically.","I get asked a lot how do we think about acquisitions at H&R Block. And those of you who followed us for a while know that we haven't done a lot here in the last several years. This does not mean we're not thinking about things nor does it mean we're not evaluating things. We are, constantly. At the same time, we need to be guided by what we are, which is a tax preparation company with adjacent services, and we're going to use that as a very high standard to pass any acquisition screen. So for now, I'm going to put this as an unknown in terms of capital. Financial services, typically when you're building that program quickly which is what we're doing, you, would need capital to be able to do that. The reality is at H&R Block, we have a typical financial services products.","The Emerald Card product as well as the refund transfer products are sources of capital immediately, it's really just Emerald Advance which is the more typical financial services product where you lend money out and then collect the return over time. We believe the Emerald Card and that refund transfer program's growth will help self fund the Emerald Advance program. And so overall, we think this will be a good positive source of capital for the company as we grow it. This does not include H&R Block Bank conversation in, which to me is integral to but also separate. I'm going to talk about this in a bit more couple of pages here with you. But in general, as we find a solution to the bank, we expect to unwind capital from that. Right now, the bank has $450 million of capital at it. And I'm not saying that we're going to get that all back, but what I am saying is we'll get some of that back.","So now let me talk about the bank a little bit. What is important to us is that we still want to maintain basic control of the relationship with the client. We have a lot of value to add as it relates to the overall strategy for Emerald Card, the Emerald Advance as well as the refund transfer. And we continue to want to be the driver of that conversation. What we're looking for is a relationship -- or relationships, that's possible as well -- for someone who understands that and is happy to play a backseat type of a role with us. They're going to be a partner with us, but they're going to really be more on the administrative side.","For us, making sure the client is not impacted is a very important factor here. And ultimately, our goal is not a fast deal, it is the right deal. Once we do find that deal, there will be some additional benefits that we receive. Of course, I just talked about some capital that were released from the bank. At the same time, we will be able to reduce overhead on my cost structure because as I just described to you, our bank partner will actually be -- brought the administrative services to us, and therefore, I don't need to replicate that and we'll be able to take that under my structure.","We are currently at the bank, regulated by the office of currency, the OCC, and the parent bank is actually regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank. Obviously, when you get rid of the bank, those oversights go away, and we believe that's a positive for the company. Ultimately, by simplifying the bank, we end up on a continued theme of a simpler, more focused business.","Now I'm going to talk about the economics of the bank a little bit. I know this is a lot of people -- on a lot of your minds. What does the future look like from an economic perspective? And when you think about H&R Block Bank, there are really 3 pieces, and I'm going to talk about the first 2 here to start with. The first piece are the customer deposits. As you can see there, we have assets of roughly $100 million. These are IRAs, CDs, broker deposits, checking, savings, all lower risk and low yield. There is an active market for these things, and I can find a home for them quite easily.","I'm not worried about these at all. We also have legacy mortgages that Susan talked about, assets in total of $375 million. These are mortgages that were purchased by the bank from Sand Canyon many years ago as well as some additional mortgages they bought in the open market several years ago to fulfill some of the chartered requirements from a regulatory oversight perspective. Those mortgages are mature and they're in wind-down position at this point. Importantly, they do not need to be held at an insured entity or a bank level or a savings-and-loan company. If we choose to, we can keep them at the parent level. How we decide that is an economic-based decision.","There's also, I mean to be clear, a market for these mortgages, if we wanted to. The customer deposits in the mortgage portfolio are not strategic to our future, it is not a growth area or a source of investment for us. It is also not a material source of revenue nor EBITDA for the company. What we do end up talking mostly about is the third piece of the bank, which is financial products. And these are the 3 financial products in particular we talked about, refund transfers, the Emerald Card and the Emerald Advance. I'm sharing with you here the revenues last year on those products. And I want to talk about these a bit more specifically.","The refund transfer is a great product that has real utility for our clients. As I shared with you earlier, a lot of clients don't want to pay the approximately $180 at the point at which we complete their taxes. They know they're getting a refund, and what the bank does is establish us a one-time used bank account, that when the IRS refunds their money, it goes to that bank account, we then net out $180 fee that we received for the tax preparation as well as the refund transfer fee.","What I've just described to you is automated and quite easy for a bank to do, it represents no risk. We believe that this is a very easy type of a service to be able to find from a third-party provider, and it will not cost a lot of money, and I'll be able to take some of the cost out of my infrastructure that I'm currently incurring to do that. For many of those same reasons, that's how we think about Emerald Card. The Emerald Card is really, from a bank's perspective, not a really risky transaction. It doesn't have much statutory capital requirements.","In fact, it's a source of capital because what happens is when they open it up, they put a lot of money under the bank account. We're going to continue to want to be the strategy, the program manager and the marketing minds behind this product and obviously, expect them -- and our welcoming good ideas from our partner, but ultimately, we're just looking for the simple mechanisms behind the scenes to do all the money movements, reconciliations and all their insured requirements that a bank entity brings to the table. We do not believe we'll be giving up a lot of economics.","On the Emerald Advance though, this is more of a traditional lending product, and this is an area where we probably will need to do a bit more of a profit-sharing with the partner. At the same time, and probably more importantly, when you look at the future of refund transfers, plus Emerald Card, plus Emerald Advance, we expect the economic pie at H&R Block to get larger and larger for a lot of the reasons you've heard about today. We will have to share some of that with a third-party provider, but I think in general, you will find that H&R Block at the end of the day still has a lot of economic pie here, and we feel pretty good about that.","As we make further progress on the strategic and alternatives for the bank, we'll share those at the appropriate time with you.","Let me get back now to capital allocation and talk about dividends. We have paid $3.5 billion of dividends since we went public in 1962. As many of you know, we went x dividend today and we'll be trading -- we'll be settling to that in the new year. Just in case -- anticipating a question by the way, we did examine whether we'd move it into the new year, did the math on it, we decided that was immaterial and it didn't make sense, so we'll continue to pay in early January. Over the last -- since 2005, we've increased the dividend by 8% on an average annual basis. And when you look at our yield and compare that to some of the comps that are -- we're showing you here, we believe it's a compelling return. We take a lot of pride in the dividend and take our obligations here very seriously.","When you add the dividends plus the share repurchases, you see a good story, and this is last 4 years plus year-to-date for this year. Since Bill has taken over as a CEO, we have returned a total of almost $900 million to you, the shareholders. I'm also showing you on those graph at the bottom how much we've distributed as a percent of net income.","Specific to share repurchases, I have 2 requirements: my first one, do I have cash available to buy shares? The second requirement is, do I like the price of which it's trading at? If it's undervalued from our perspective, that seems like a good buying opportunity. If it's overvalued, we won't be buying. We're not going to tell you what that price is. In fact, our overall strategy and belief about share repurchases is, it's best for all shareholders that we don't tell you what our plans are until after the fact. And we'll continue to be very focused on that.","In summary, about capital allocation, we're going to be very focused on this waterfall. Our first priority is making sure we've got proper liquidity protection and the operational support for the business. I want to be very clear here. Our historic practices around liquidity do not necessarily suggest will be due in the future here. We will continue to evaluate what the right way to provide liquidity protection to the company is, always being guided for what is the right way to earn shareholder returns. Getting taken cared of the CLOC and the bonds in my first 6 months were major steps forward and we'll continue to think about that. We'll continue to think about what the right strategy is and fund that appropriately. And as I've shared with you, we think in total over the next 3 years, we'll be generating cash out of that versus using a lot of cash in those areas.","Third, we'll continue to support the dividend. After we've done that, we will continue and we'll always be focused in on how do we use that extra cash. Do we buy back shares? Do we increase the dividend or hold the cash? Our objective is consistent meaningful shareholder returns, and we're always be guided by that. I, and the management team, will be very focused on making sure that when we do make those decisions, that we're disciplined and that we're accountable and we're always guided with a clear view of value. That's our commitment to you.","So this is a page I started with, and really as I said was what I think makes H&R Block unique. And so I want to kind of want to use this to close things down. We have ability to grow this business. We have international leverage. We're proud of what we've done in Canada and Australia and look forward to what we'll do in India, Brazil and future companies. We relate to the game in the digital side. We're making up -- gain ground here very quickly. We'll continue to invest money here and expect to have a good tax season this year.","I'm excited about what I've seen in the financial services, and I expect this year to be a good next step in our journey towards providing a truly robust relationship that starts with the tax-preparation events but also understands that we have a role to play here within financial services. Time goes on and I think that the mortgage exposure will be fairly limited, but we'll see.","The management team has had some changes, that's for sure, but as I said to you before, there's a wealth of experience that sits within the top 50 people of the company, and I think the quality of individuals that I've seen, I've been very impressed with. In time, we'll also show that the stability will be a real benefit to you. We have a great track record of paying dividends. In the last year, we increased the dividend by 33%. We also have a long track record of buying back shares, and we're -- we take a lot of pride in that. We generate a lot of cash flow. Our ability to increase revenue, continue to control our expenses. Keep in mind that 27% to 32% EBITDA margin range that I talked about is a big focus for us.","As part of this, I'm also very focused on bringing additional capital out of the business model. Okay, the bank is part of this, of course, but we'll be continuing looking for other opportunities to produce the capital base in the company. Specific to CapEx, we talked about roughly a 3% level of investment of revenues as the appropriate level for a large retail and technology company of a mature nature like H&R Block.","And lastly, and this is really probably the most important thing, is the core business of tax preparation is a good one. It grows every year and we have real pricing power, and that's a great place to be. In the last year, we've actually done a pretty good job of delivering value. This is the latest 12 months performance. Of course, we paid our dividend, and we've also had share price appreciation. The overall markets have been up during this time frame, no doubt, but when you actually put it all together, we think a 20% return last 12 months has been a good result.","Now we're going to get to the Q&A here in a minute, anticipating some of your questions, I wanted to take just 2 more quick pages to kind of give you some specific numbers that I think through the presentation we talked about, or maybe I just want to bring up some to be clear on. This is general market outlook. We expect the number of filings this year in United States to be up 1.5% to 2%. Over the next 3 years, we expect it to be in the historic range of 1% to 2%.","As it relates to complexity and tax law changes, there are a substantial amount of changes that are going on right now or theoretically will be going on very soon. In addition to the fact this will be a very late tax season from a normal calendar perspective, as well as from some of the IRS guidelines that's been provided, we expect to see a material shift from the Q3 to the Q4 this year. What's important for you to know is this is not like a retailer that gets a bad storm wreck for Christmas and you lose the sale. This is taxes, people need to do their taxes. So for us, it's ultimately what happens at the end of the season that matters here, whether it's the third quarter or fourth quarter isn't as important to us specifically.","We are not going to give you guidance of how much we think that shift will be because frankly we don't know the level of changes and when they're going to come in place. At the point at which we have better clarity on that and we feel it's appropriate, we'll share that with you. As we think about more of the 3-year time frame, I'm very interested and very excited about what I see in health care reform. It will be a benefit for the industry. There is no doubt about that. And to be clear, that benefit is not listed in that 1% to 2% above there. We believe that's separate. We also think, from a simplification perspective, that the -- there's always lots of people talking about it but when you look at actions in history, there's nothing to support the fact that we see any major simplification happening.","From an industry consolidation perspective, we've seen that happen in the last several years. This year, in 2013, we expect to see that continue. And I think as time goes on at some of those factors that I shared with you earlier, we believe that may actually accelerate.","Let me talk now about H&R Block specifically. In terms of the number of returns that we're expecting this year, of course we start with what the IRS expectations are, about 1.5% to 2%, but we think we're going to take market growth above that both in the DIY space as well as the assisted space. And we think that's a true statement as well for the 3-year expectation.","On the cost side, we're committed to delivering the $85 million to 100 million, and we're well on track to do that. Additional piece of information I provided very early on is we will have incremental savings from that initiative that spill over into 2014, and that's $15 million. As we think beyond that, we'll continue to be disciplined and very focused on cost management. The overall guidance I'm providing there is 27% to 32% of EBITDA margins as a right target for H&R Block. The refund transfer product, we are going to charge for it this season, and we expect revenues in 2013 to approximate what we did in 2011. Beyond that, we continue to believe that refund transfer has value to the industry, and we'll continue to focus on those product.","In terms of the effective tax rate, it's hard for me right now to pay more taxes than I do, and some of the people in the audience know that very well. We are working very hard at finding ways to lower that. For this season, though, I think being in a 39% is where we're going to end up. But there will be discrete items that impact that. Once I do have a better idea of what opportunities we have on our tax rate, we'll share those with you. And until I do that, I don't think it's appropriate to guide into a right effective tax rate.","Specific to CapEx, we think the 3% of revenues is the right level of investment for a company like ours, and I think for this year and years beyond, that's the right number. And then I'll give you some numbers here just for DNA, to help round out some of your models. So I really sincerely want to thank all of you for taking the time here and also dealing with some of the logistics issues we had earlier today in terms of next door. We're going to invite the management team up here, and Derek up here, to begin the Q&A. But I do, once again, thank you, all, for your attention.","Question-and-Answer Session","Derek Drysdale","Okay. As we get the stools up on stage, I want to just point out 2 things quickly. The slides again will be posted about 25 minutes, so about 11:30. And then secondly, we will have a transcript of this event, that will be posted on Monday. So you can pull that down from the Investor Relations website. Along with -- for the Q&A portion, along with Bill Cobb, Susan Ehrlich, Jason Houseworth, I'd also like to introduce Amy McAnarney, who is our President of U.S. Retail Client Services. So for Q&A, we have a couple of runners for mics, please raise your hand. We do ask that, for the transcript, to do state your name and the company you're with. So let's start here in the front with Mike.","Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates","Michael Millman, the Millman Research Associates. So this week Liberty Tax on its conference call said that you think that the opportunity for price increase is about 5% to 6% a year, that they thought that block held us back. You, today, said that you find it nonelastic, and yet you're guiding to around 1% over time. Can you tell us why you're not more aggressive on pricing?","Derek Drysdale","Greg, you want to start?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes. So first of all, I think Liberty increased their prices by 5% or 6%, that would just be great, and so please pass it onto them. Our belief is that from a competitor perspective, it's a mistake to forecast what our price is going to be, we would really just say wait and see the season -- how the season goes and see how we do this in 2013. Beyond this, Mike, what we've talked about is a 1%. And frankly, as a CFO, I'm a conservative guy so to me, that sort of represents the floor. As you well know historically, H&R Block has been more aggressive on pricing, and we very much recognize that this low price elasticity in the marketplace.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research. Susan, one of the things for Emerald Cards is, last year, you had a free refund transfer. Does that obviously drove a lot of Emerald Cards for you this year, you will not? How do you make up the gap to make sure that you have growth in Emerald Cards?","Susan P. Ehrlich","Kartik, we are introducing a number of different programs this year, built around trying to incent acquisition and usage of the card. I think the rewards program is going to be a strong future for folks who may not have considered Emerald Card in the past to see the benefit that clients will receive from having their refund on the card and take advantage of year-round usage. We're also in the digital channel this year, which is new for us and represents a sizable portion of our tax clients. So that's all fertile territory for us this season, so...","William C. Cobb","We've also driven some improvements with Amy's team in terms of the flow within the -- our software contract professionals are lead there. We're also driving some incentives to the tax [indiscernible] we'll also do that.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last one for you, Greg, remiss if I didn't ask this, but any thoughts on timing as to when you get to that EBITDA goal you've laid out looking at, you have the industry growth and block growth and cost-cutting?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","I mean, job number one is to deliver the $85 million to $100 million of cost out, and as I shared with you, that will happen this season. The 27% to 32% is a very important concept for us. I'm not giving specific guidance, though, about when we'll be able get to there.","Derek Drysdale","Right here, Scott.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Starting off with the tax season. Is there any concern with regard to likely a later start to the tax season as you've outlined with regard to preparation and perhaps loss on financial products, which are often geared towards earlier season filers, might there be a decrease in need, if the season gets later, increase? Just thoughts around that and preparation.","William C. Cobb","Yes, I'll go first, and then if anyone wants to add anything. I think -- I don't think decreasing need is a particular concern. I think the need will be there. I think this is an industry issue, it's not a block issue. We've been equipped in the past. We've dealt with issues like this in the past. So it will cause some discontinuities, I think. But Amy's team and the rest are prepared for that. We have people ready to hear whatever the final resolution and some of the issues is. So as Greg pointed out in his presentation, in the end, we're fortunate with this industry, everybody has to file, and in the end, it's going to be more about the total tax season as opposed to some movement between January and February.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And Greg, 2 questions for you. One, you mentioned your most frequent inbound question is, why not lever up and return capital? I was just hoping you could address leverage credit rating and your thoughts on that? And I have one more. I'll let you get there first, please.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes, and I should tell you about, actually most popular question I got is, did you really move to Kansas City? Okay, and I did, so just to be clear. The second question was around capital allocation. So I mean, I'm not sure of this sort of new information to share, but I'll kind of hit what I think the key points are. We think about it a lot, no doubt. In the first 6 months that I've been here, I mean, I've only been here 6 months, we did the CLOC and we redid the notes, which frankly were time-focused. We had to take care of them, and that took a lot of our time. I was quite satisfied with both how we resolve the CLOC and by the bonds by the way for what it's worth. In terms of liquidity profile, I haven't been through a tax season yet. I want to see how that works. I think it's important, and then hopefully, we've all learned a lesson from a liquidity perspective. When you need liquidity, so does the rest of the world. And there is about 4 or 5 months in the year that if I don't have access to liquidity, I can jeopardize the overall value of this company very quickly. So it's something that I take very seriously and very deeply. Now having said that, there are many solutions to that problem. And I think by making progress in the CLOC in particular, we were able to solve a key part of that, so we continue to think about that. The investment-grade, we've used that historically. It's been a way we've accessed through commercial papers. We need that to support that. And not saying we're going to keep it; I'm not saying we're giving it up. It's something we're considering and thinking about deeply.","William C. Cobb","And I think, Scott, also, the reason we can't what seems like a relatively straightforward question, we are now regulated by the Federal Reserve as a savings and loan holding company. And obviously, one of the reasons why we're seeking alternatives is that, as Greg put it, we'll be in a position where we can make autonomous decisions across a whole range of issues.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","That's a great segue into my question. But before, nice job on the CLOC. Yes, I was just curious on the strategic alternatives on the bank, a better feel for timing on when that may occur. Also, to the extent you can share on partnering with others for some of the financial products.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes, I'll talk about timing and maybe Susan talk about the ideal partner sort of profile or whatever part of the question. What's important to us is get the right deal and not the fast deal. The other part that I mentioned within the strategic considerations is we want to minimize the amount of client impact. We, in terms of the tax season for all intents and purpose performance of the year, we can't do anything, right? So we end up having windows that open up, okay. And so you need to be -- I mean, I think most of you are aware of that. So in terms of actually getting a transaction completed, you have a window that opens up next spring and summer and then you basically have to go to the next year. We're going to figure that out. We don't know what the answer right now.","William C. Cobb","I'd add one thing and then Susan, you should talk about the partner. Bear in mind that this isn't just the selection of a partner. It will be a regulatory approval process that is very hard to predict how long it will take. We hope to -- we work very well with regulators. We have good relationship with them. The Federal Reserve is very open. But we're at the mercy at the regulators also on that particular topic. Do you want to talk about ideal partner?","Susan P. Ehrlich","Yes, I think from a structure standpoint and a partnership standpoint, I mean, there's -- I've worked with small banks and I've worked with large banks in these kinds of partnering arrangements for financial services in the past, and they bring different skills and benefits to them, right? A large bank is going to have a well-developed product set, that we should be able to accelerate in our channel. A small bank gives us the benefits of more of the program management control that Greg spoke to. So I think we can structure it either way. I think we're just looking forward to the continuing dialogue with potential partners, the structure -- the program that's going to be the best for us and right for our clients.","Derek Drysdale","Thomas?","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Two questions. First, on the refund transfer revenue. You said you expect to be flat to fiscal '11. What does that imply in terms of volumes and pricing? And then the second question, in your 27% to 32% EBITDA margin goal, does that include the impact of outsourcing the financial product? So assuming that would mean that you would get less revenue and a higher margin, is that built into that assumption or is that -- could that push your range higher?","William C. Cobb","So let me take the first part, and Greg, why don't you take the second. I would stay with what Greg kind of have in the slide that he's giving you an indication that we expect revenues to approximate fiscal year '11. We're not going to go through volume and mix. You want to go to the second part?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes. So I was -- I think hopefully, I was or maybe I wasn't clear, but the 27% to 32% is what we think right now as things change, as mix changes, then we'll continue to reevaluate that. So the specific, Thomas, the answer to your question is, it does not include any of the unwinding of the bank and things like that.","Derek Drysdale","Vishnu?","Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Vishnu Lekraj, MorningStar. The question here on -- sorry, the long-term pricing. You said 1% moving forward. Can you give us some thoughts behind that given the price points at DIY, assisted, along with some of your competitors price points? And how you're thinking about furthering that number?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","So let me say something generally, we're not going to talk about pricing. We have -- as our pricing board is out, we price -- you go back to Jason's thesis, which is, everyone's situation is complex. We price according to each individual. Their needs can be moved around. We -- this is not a Happy Meal that we're going to drive around the price up 5% or 6% like others have talked about. So we have our pricing board, we spent a lot of time on the modeling of that. That's a situation that we have set up for this year, and we're not in a business of forecasting that. Greg was giving you an indication that in the long-term, if you want to look at an expected model, we gave you industry growth, we gave you an expected area for pricing. So I don't mean to be -- but it is a decision that we've taken as a company and certainly shared with the board. I don't know, Jason, do you have anything else you want to add?","Jason Houseworth","Well, I think the other thing is that the way we look at our clients and really the productivity that they drive to the bottom line is not just about price. I mean, we do look at their individual needs in order to determine the price, but we also look at the mix of clients, as well as the financial products that we can offer our clients to provide a more value. And overall, we look at how that revenue adds up and how we can build it, not only in assisted but also in DIY.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So looking at the other side of the equation, given your cost reduction programs, how do you look at staffing then in terms of trying to retain the most experienced folks to make sure that you're driving customer retention and then their comp along with that, if that's possible?","William C. Cobb","So Amy, why don't you take that?","Amy McAnarney","We have focused effort over the last couple of years to continue our -- retention of our most experienced tax professionals. And in fact, just about 75% of our client see our most experienced tax professionals, and that's grown from maybe about 400 basis points over the last couple of years. We have found that, again, it's a strong brand that we have, not only attracts the clients but our tax professionals continue to stay with us more year after year is that incremental investment that we're making in training and preparation so they can serve our clients. So we're very pleased with our retention rates, our best tax professionals.","William C. Cobb","The only thing I would add is we incent our more experienced tax pros at a higher rate than the first year. We have actually, this year, with the tax pro compensation system, if you will, accelerated that, so that we've made it more lucrative for more experienced tax pros. Because as you saw from the charts that Jason displayed and Greg displayed, it's a direct line. The better and more experienced tax pro, the higher our retention is, and obviously, we are really focused on that area.","Derek Drysdale","Let's go to Mike Turner and then right here.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Mike Turner, Compass Point. Just a couple of questions. On the do-it-yourself segment, and I apologize if I've missed it earlier, what percentage of those clients are on unbanked? Do you know that, or...","William C. Cobb","I'm not sure we know that org.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","We certainly haven't released it or discussed in the past. We have to get back to you on that.","William C. Cobb","I think we've generally looked at -- I don't know. I can try to follow-up with you on that.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then also on the Emerald Advance, I think -- was it 2 years ago, you opened it to new clients, and then last year, I think you shut that down just to the existing clients, in your open and back up. Have you -- maybe you could talk about the underwriting or the things you've changed because I seem to remember you took a couple of losses when you open it to the new clients. I'm guessing you made some adjustments. Any color there will be helpful.","William C. Cobb","I mean, we feel good about steps. Susan, why don't you go through it?","Susan P. Ehrlich","Yes, it's a program that -- as I was joining H&R Block last year, it was right into the season, and so it gave me an opportunity coming off my experience in credit and credit card lending to take a look at how we were running the Emerald Advance program. And one of the things that affected the performance 2 years ago was the fact that we really did not have a robust collections focus outside of the 3 to 4 months that our offices were open, and that's really been the biggest enhancement that's been put in place. So we've really established what look like more traditional credit collections activities that really begin with even the friendly reminder that a payment on your loan program is due. And that continues for the life cycle of collection. And that was really not a strength of ours 2 years ago, and that has been completely overhauled and a better foundation has been set. In addition, we've done some work on the underwriting on the front and bringing in some folks that, in my experience, I've worked with over the years who do a phenomenal job, focused on middle-market segment, which is where we're collectively focused. And so we feel good that we've improved both on the front end and on the back end of the lending spectrum to get better results.","William C. Cobb","And I'll add, just do a little plug for Susan. Susan has brought in some terrific professionals on her team who have done this, who understand this, who have given us the ability now to do, as you stated, open this up to all clients coming in.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I know it's really early. Any early color on the acceptance or the usage of the Emerald Advance? I know it's really just been...","William C. Cobb","Yes, we're -- we've -- it's an in-quarter issue, so we've been advised not to discuss it.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","You're welcome to go apply for one of those.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","And then last, maybe Greg or whomever, on the capital or money that's presumably in Sand Canyon, call it, $450 million or so, at what point do you say that, okay, we have clarity now, maybe we could do something with that capital. I mean, is it the end of next year when the 6 years expires? Or sort of maybe what's the catalyst or what's -- how do you know you've passed that point?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Well, the answer is I don't know truthfully. Sand Canyon is very focused, obviously, and continue to support their obligations, and they handle that very professionally and  they're very thorough, and I came -- part of my job at GE, I work in subprime mortgage, so there's -- people at Sand Canyon worry about this. I think time will tell on how this is resolved. But specific to your question, it would be, at some point, happy conversation hopefully, but I still don't know when it would happen, so...","Hale Holden","I just have 2 quick ones, it's Hale Holden from Barclays. I just want to understand the sequence of events. So the possible bank resolution sometime in the spring or the summer because it can happen during the tax season even in open window. At that point, you made a capital decision of whether investment-grade ratings are core or not. And I think that's a critical point because you just sold $500 million in 10-year notes to the market with NIG rating. So those guys are going to want to know, whether you stay investment-grade or not. And then I have one follow-up.","William C. Cobb","Is that a statement?","Hale Holden","No, I mean, I think it's not a statement, but I'm just curious on whether the -- it's unclear to me whether the investment-grade rating is core or not?","William C. Cobb","Okay, that's a question.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Is that your question? Okay.","Hale Holden","That's the question.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Well, I guess my perspective on this is that we have historically used the investment-grade rating as a way to access commercial paper, cheap and available to fund us through that 3, 4 months a year. That was important for the business from an operational perspective. We've made material steps forward this year in renegotiating our CLOC, as well as these notes that we're doing in the new year, and I feel pretty good where that's ended up. We're going to continue to look at doing an investment grade or not. We're certainly well aware of the fact that the people that are in the line of credit, as well as people who lent us money through the notes, went in a certain way, so that's not lost on us. But overall, our focus is doing the right thing for the company. We got to protect, obviously, liquidity needs, but at the same time, we're very focused on what's the right thing for our shareholders.","William C. Cobb","I would also step back and say that since I've come in to the job, hopefully we've been very consistent and persistent tackling issues. So I hear you jumping out ahead. Right now, we are working through -- we report each quarter on Sand Canyon. We've announced strategic alternatives for the bank. We are working through those. When that partner is chosen, we'll then go through a regulatory process. Greg is giving you some guidelines, but that is not set in stone what the timing is. And as far as any comment or anything on liquidity, we're investment-grade today. We're we do have liquidity needs. We are not here to make a forward-looking statement on liquidity. So I hear you, but I think we're just trying to move along and knock things down as they come along.","Hale Holden","Okay. And my second question is, the disclosure that's been in the 10-Qs and Ks on AIG litigation. Obviously, there's probably not a lot you can say and it AIG driven not by your driven, but is there a sense of when that could be resolved or move to the next step, or be eliminated?","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Yes, I mean...","William C. Cobb","Not only I am not allowed to say, there's actually nothing we can say about that, so stay tuned.","Derek Drysdale","This right here.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","Efraim Levy, S&P Capital IQ. When looking at that video you had before, the gentlemen beginning, he's getting a -- he's not getting a refund, he's actually consuming a lot of services, it looks like. Are you able to recoup that, that -- the cost for that, or is it sometimes you take a loss leader for future gains?","William C. Cobb","That's a great question, and in fact, the audit services that we have year round for our clients are covered in many cases, and especially for those who take our Peace of Mind guarantee. However, in that case, we are using that as a client acquisition, where we offer audit in order to demonstrate our expertise, as well as to the Second Look product. This is exactly what we find when people come in and they\u2019re shocked at the expertise of our enrolled agents that their tax pro could have done it wrong. And in many cases, for whatever reason, they've done it wrong, and it has a big financial impact for them. And what I really like about that video is the gentleman said, and I told everybody in my church about it, which is exactly how we grow our business.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","You think about it from an economic perspective, so I mean, yes, there was a big investment time. He's a lifetime client, he has given us great PR. He -- I mean, specifically people, there probably damaged credit, so we have credit products available to them. That's a path to additional products when they have to do, and we believe that it's a good investment overall, because once you get something like that type of relationship, you got a tremendous lifetime value, too.","Efraim Levy - S&P Equity Research","Sure. And that brought me to my second question regarding the Second Look. Can you disclose what the volume is and what the conversion rate for those who take advantage of that?","William C. Cobb","Yes, we don't disclose those specific numbers. But suffice to say that the product, the service continues to grow, and we will be doing that again in tax season '13.","Christopher J. Marangi - Gabelli & Company, Inc., Brokerage Arm","Chris Marangi from Gabelli. Two questions. First, can you give us some incremental information on this scale and the pace of the rollout of Money Express, and if there's any additional capital involve there? And then secondly, Greg, I think you mentioned you are happy with the store footprint. Does that extend to happy with the mix of franchise and owned stores at the moment?","Susan P. Ehrlich","Chris, I'll start with the comments on Money Express. As I mentioned in the presentation, we're in 30 locations this tax season. We think the program's a great program, and that it is a, as you can see, a very functional, very easy-to-use kiosk that is providing an awful lot of services and giving money management to our clients at a very affordable price point. We have 11,000 potential points of distribution currently for the kiosk. We have that real estate year-round, so the ability to make Money Express accessible to clients 24\/7, 365 days a year we think is a real opportunity for building revenue from our locations on a year-round basis. Right now, Money Express supports Emerald Card, but it's possible that it can support other prepaid programs as well, as well as be distributed to other locations outside of block. And so, all of those, I think, are in the potential development roadmap for Money Express as we look to what to do with it in the future as we get through the pilot phases. In terms of scaling of that, it's really going to be a function of us continuing to like the economics we see as we get through this season and into the year-round.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","We have a lot to learn still about Money Express and the business model since it's behind that, because it isn't just simply about putting a machine there. But we want have 7\/24, which means directly you may have to have a different footprint in the offices, we have to understand how that would drive traffic. We need to learn a lot more, so I think it's premature to talk about from a capital need because I'm not sure what the business case is yet. Inherent to the question is we're going to be disciplined, we're going to be consistent and we'll always be with a clear view of value we do make investments, okay. The second part of your question about the footprint, we're very happy with the mix between franchisee and company store, and don't expect any major change in that the near term.","William C. Cobb","And let me just augment that a few years ago, the company had been on the path to re-franchise. That is not a philosophy of the company anymore. We are making the decisions on a trade area by trade area. We are buyers and sellers, so we're trying to optimize that footprint, and Amy and Greg work very closely with the real estate teams on those decisions. But the former, I just want to make sure that it's clear, the former philosophy of re-franchise of a certain amount of stores every year is not part of the company anymore.","Derek Drysdale","So let's take this one in front, and then we'll go into the back.","Steven J O'Brien - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Steve O'Brien from Jefferies. You're clear on the price points or the pricing strategy. But looking specifically at the DIY filers, is there an opportunity to grow average revenue per filer? What would be the driver? Does it take rates on any file, or potentially this health care situation coming up? And then maybe looking back, how has revenue per DIY filer gone trending?","William C. Cobb","Okay. Jason, do you want to take a shot of that?","Jason Houseworth","Well, within DIY, I think there are 3 primary methods. I think the first is better monetization within the DIY product, as we think about how we upsell from a free to basic or deluxe premium. I think the second is adding financial products, and we're obviously doing that by introducing Emerald Card within our online product. And then the third is a continued focus on mix and looking at more complex clients. And that's also where I said within our conversion funnel, I think that we're starting to go deeper and deeper as far as focusing on now the more complex aspects of our interview and really thinking about that. And this is a thing that, that I really like about technology is that we can see within the conversion funnel the exact points where we have clients drop out. And we can then work with our usability team and do AB testing in order to really find the right way to either simplify the screen or to position the value that we need to, to keep clients moving through the conversion funnel.","William C. Cobb","Jason and his team, and Jason has done a terrific job as leader of this over the past 3 years, and his team just continues to get stronger. They are relentless on user experience, they are relentless on how do we improve as we move up the chain. And I think as we get -- we have now a product that is in line or in some areas Jason believes is superior to TurboTax. We are continuing that kind of relentless assault and how do we improve the user experience, especially as we move forward on more complex returns.","Adam Liebhoff","It's Adam Liebhoff from Loomis, Sayles. Could you maybe give us a sense for how big the International segment can be over the next 3 to 5 years? And then somewhat related, maybe talk about the go-to-market model there?","William C. Cobb","Yes, and then, Greg, if you want to add anything. I don't have a number for you. I do believe that as I think companies, great companies today have a footprint beyond the U.S. and beyond the English-speaking world. We are, as Greg mentioned, we'll probably look at a country or 2 to add over the next 12 to 24 months. These are 5- to 10-year plays for us. We're looking for countries that have scale. I think I said this last year, I'll say it again. We're not going to be Apple in 100 countries. We\u2019re going to have large economies, with large middle-class, with governments that are cooperative and trying to collect revenue from their citizens. So I think the mix, the percentage, it's a single-digit part of our business. I think it will go to double-digit, but I don't have a good sense for you in terms of how to model this, if you will, because we are -- because we have chosen to make small disciplined investments. Now, as for the model, we are looking at a variety of ways as we head in the year, in the second year in both India and Brazil. There's a traditional -- what we grew up on in the United States, our retail models, but we're looking at a number of ways through employers, through distance or through digital initiatives. So we don't have a model yet. Right now, we're in the test-and-learn phase. But again, I think part of the responsibility you have leading a company is to start to make investments that are going to pay off in multiple years, and I think we're pleased with -- or I don't know if you have anything else to add.","Gregory J. Macfarlane","Last year, international was $233 million for the revenues. Canada and Australia both growing at high single digits to low double digits. Brazil and India, as Bill has rightfully said, you should be thinking more 5 or 10 years out. We're happy to experiment for 2 or 3 seasons, maybe 4 seasons till we figure out the right model. I don't think it's appropriate to share that with you right now for competitive reasons, but I can tell you that the main work that we use in these markets is entrepreneurial. Okay, we want to be very flexible, but we don't want to be grounded in what makes us special, which is tax preparation and the things that go around that.","Derek Drysdale","So let's go back to Scott real quick, and then Thomas.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Bill, last year, you approached Investor Day with some aggressive OpEx spend into your first year in a role, and you covered some of the primary spends were mobility, sounds like you're happy with the what you achieved and where you are going ahead. We have an update from you on your RT strategy this year and the pricing of that. I'm curious on Block Live and this new My HRB account. Is Block Live still a viable investment and a growth objective, or this is My HRB account kind of point of view?","William C. Cobb","No, they are 2 different things. I'll let Jason comment on the second. But no, we are very committed to Block Live, and I think it's very consistent with the basic business model we have. But Jason, why don't you comment on that, since you're driving those initiatives?","Jason Houseworth","Yes, with Block Live, I mean, we have to look at Block Live as part of the overall suite of products, so we have an order to serve all taxpayers, and Block Live fits in as part of that. It's the second year. We feel like we got a great consumer response and we're going to continue to use that in order to fit that piece of kind of virtual assistance. And then, if you look at the account, the account, as I talk about, that whole spectrum of solutions, the account is what binds it all together. It's at the center of it in order to make sure that regardless of what kind of person you are, even if you look now and you bring up the homepage today. In the upper right-hand corner, there's one log-in. We literally used to have kind of a Best of Both log-in, we have a Block Live log-in, the have-not. So we have one log-in. All clients, and what we have is we have that log-in for mobile, we have it for online, we have it for our office clients, and it accesses the same types of services for all those tax clients. And this is what we see as something that using that as a platform. It's going to give us the ability to give assisted and DIY clients a technology-enable experience.","William C. Cobb","And we think it's also a great manifestation of what we're trying to drive, which is this year-round thinking. Let's not just think about this event during the year, whether it'd be digital or assisted, but that's where the development of My Account do that people can access this, they can -- there are tax events during the year, they're able to load it into My Account. So it's not a product. It's a service that will feed in to the various products and services that we have in our core business.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just shifting from that to this year, obviously, a very good and reiterated cost-reduction approach to the year. I'm curious, usually at these events, we see maybe a glimpse of TV advertisements for the year to come. I'm not sure, I think, these that we saw today were just for this. Curious what the go-to-market strategy is with marketing this year, the media means of how you go to market, what the message will be? Often you have a tagline. And then, advertising spend year-over-year and contemplation of that?","William C. Cobb","Sure, which one of those I can answer. I'm not going to talk about marketing spend, I'm not going to tell you the message...","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Are you going to be on the commercial?","William C. Cobb","The research came back and -- No, I mean, Scott, obviously, it's a great question, and we're weeks away. Mr. Turtledove is not here today because he is very busy getting everything, but I think he'll be pleased with our message. It will be a broad range of -- we'll use traditional TV, radio, but we will be very active online, very active in social media, so -- and we're not going to talk about specific messages because some of our friends may be listening.","Derek Drysdale","Because we were working on the borrowed time, Jack hammer is back. Let's go to Thomas in back up there.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Following up on marketing question. One of your competitors talked about spending more early on to stay in front of their clients during the delays, during IRS delays. Do you expect to do the same thing? Is that something that could drive up costs?","William C. Cobb","I think from the time, we're going to be -- we'll be active early in the season as we always are, as we were last year. Immediate plans are set. We can move money around. But I think people will see H&R Block, hear our message, so I don't know what that mean. I mean, last year, tax advertising started about 12:01 a.m. on December 26, so I'm not sure how much earlier we could -- any of us could go. So I think I feel good about where we're at.","Susan P. Ehrlich","And I would just add on to that. There are other ways that we connect with our clients before tax season. We make -- we reach out to them personally through phone calls and obviously direct mail. But that personal touch that we do before tax season is really a key for us.","William C. Cobb","And Amy has put a big emphasis on this. As a matter fact, she's taken over. There are changes, such as we have an expression we use a lot of words matter, she no longer calls, people who lead our offices, office managers, they are client service leaders. And again, it just shift, too, and that's why she's been pushing her teams very hard on the proactive outreach for reasons like you said, Thomas. Up here, Ryan [ph].","Charles Stedman Garland - Hamlin Capital Management, LLC","Charlie Garland, Hamlin Capital Management. Can you describe the in-store technology systems? Maybe tell us the last time the tax professional facing systems were upgraded, and are they happy with those systems?","William C. Cobb","That's why you want somebody who's been around 16 years or so to do this, because if I answer this question -- no, I mean, this is a lot what Amy and Jason spend time on, so I'll let the 2 of you.","Amy McAnarney","Right now, we are currently going to be going through a refresh of our tax preparation software that we use in the offices. As we've seen on the digitals and the do-it-yourself side, refreshing that technology and the user experience is great for our business. And we need to keep track in front of that in our -- in office experience. So we are refreshing that technology and the software. It's going to be a multiyear rollout as with any major system that is client facing.","Jason Houseworth","Yes, and I think the -- this actually gets back to the idea that everything, whether we're talking about the assisted or the DIY side of the -- our tax business, it starts with a great client experience. And the existing tax preparation system that we have on our offices is 20-plus years old. And what we recognize is that if we really want to take it to the next level, we've got to first change out that platform and then evolve it. And I give Bill a lot of credit for coming in and really challenging us with taking the multiyear steps that we need to really make that type of change, that type of transformational change in our client experience.","Derek Drysdale","Any other questions?","William C. Cobb","There's one in the back.","Derek Drysdale","All right, it doesn't look like there are any other questions. Again, thank you all for joining us today and those of you on the webcast. That does conclude our presentation today. Please, we do hope you join us for lunch. Susan, Greg, Bill, Amy, and Jason and others of the senior management team will be there, so we hope you can join us. Thank you."],"3559":["H&R Block Inc.

We appreciate everyone being flexible with the change in call time in honor of the late President Bush.","We've been hard at work the past several months focused on executing our plans for the upcoming tax season. I want to thank our associates, tax pros, and franchisees for all they are doing to ensure we're ready to serve our clients as the season gets underway.","We're taking the right steps toward long-term growth in clients, revenue, and earnings, and ultimately value for our shareholders.

Let me start with an area in which we're making significant changes to improve our value proposition, our approach to pricing.","In June, we announced that we would be investing in price decreases for certain segments of our Assisted clients. Then in mid-October, we announced an important change in our approach which is not only new for our business but represents a complete shift for the industry as a whole, upfront transparent pricing. So, I\u2019d like to share what led us to make these changes and what it means for consumers.","Over the past year, we took a critical look at all aspects of our business, and it was clear that pricing was a pain point, and it was not just about the amount but also the way prices were determined and communicated.","In the Assisted category, we along with the rest of the industry have traditionally determined the price after the return was completed leaving many in the dark throughout much of the process. This does not meet the expectations of today's consumers who want as much information as possible prior to getting started.","This approach was a point of frustration for our current clients and also a barrier to attracting new clients who weren't willing to give our brand a chance without knowing what it was going to cost. The feedback we received from our clients and Tax Pros clearly conveyed that the approach to pricing added even more stress to what, for many of our clients is already a stressful event.","Specifically, they told us pricing shouldn't be a mystery. Nothing else they purchase in life feels this opaque. Online, they don't want to start at one price and finish at another with no idea why, and a person's price should be unique given their situation, not one size fits all.","So, we knew the pricing was something we had to address in a meaningful way, so this wasn't a surprise to us. The decision to move to upfront transparent pricing is one that we've researched the past two years and have tested in select markets. We were pleased with the feedback and results from these price tests giving us confidence that making this move was the right thing for our clients and for our company.","That's why I'm proud that H&R Block is leading the industry by offering upfront transparent pricing, so consumers know the price before they begin, as well as throughout the entire process. No mystery, no surprises, and no hidden fees.","In the office, the process of determining price can be done in three simple steps. First, the client identifies his or her price based on their life situation; then at this state return is needed, and finally adds any additional items such as investments or business income.","Nearly half of our clients will not have any of these items, meaning they will know their price in two simple steps. And our Tax Pros will be there to help them to answer any questions and to provide a positive experience.","In addition to the move to upfront transparent pricing, we are lowering prices for millions of our Assisted clients. These reductions are targeted to consumer segments where we can compete most effectively and win. A significant portion of our client base will see the positive impacts with one-third paying at least 10% less than last year.","There's one additional update in the Assisted business I'd like to talk about. Given the changes to the 1040 forms for the upcoming season, which included the elimination of the 1040EZ, we will no longer run the free 1040EZ promotion.","While free EZ brought new clients to our brand, they were increasingly expensive to acquire and had low lifetime value when compared to other client segments. So while eliminating this promotion will have a negative impact on Assisted volume, it will partially offset the price decreases from a net average charge perspective. These changes are contemplated in our revenue outlook for the year, which Tony will discuss later in the call.","In addition to pricing changes in our Assisted business, we're also making enhancements in DIY. We will continue to price aggressively to encourage consumers to switch to our brand. An extension of this aggressive posture is how we are taking price transparency to another level for the DIY consumer.","Our prices have always been stated upfront, but as clients move through the process, the price could change and they wouldn't know what they were ultimately going to pay until the very end. To address this, we are launching DIY price preview, so clients will know in real time when their price changes and why. We believe this will set a new industry expectation for DIY consumers over time.","Finally, in virtual, we will continue our upfront pricing approach with Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review products. We will also continue to test throughout the upcoming season to ensure our products are all optimally priced. We're excited for our clients to experience upfront transparent pricing, as it will enhance the value they receive and create one more reason to choose H&R Block, but a new pricing approach is just one of the many changes H&R Block is making to create a more modern, innovative consumer-focused brand.","We're creating a client experience that demonstrates our expertise, is tailored to each individual, is available year-round, and it's backed by a company that cares. And while this is not the first time we've discussed the operational improvements, I believe the changes we are making this season are important steps to set us up for success over time.","In our Assisted business, we're making a number of improvements to enhance the client experience that will benefit both new and existing clients. Our clients will receive greater help in planning for the future through an improved tax estimator to deliver key tax tips and more robust W-4 planning, both of which address the implications of tax reform. We're responding to the feedback from those who've asked for a paperless experience, making it even easier to set up a secure MyBlock account for year-round access to their return.","We're increasing the prominence of our drop-off service, which some find easier and more convenient than sitting with the tax bureau while the taxes are completed. Drop-off service has always been available in our offices, but we haven't done a good job letting people know it's an option.","For our field leaders, we have simplified and focused their efforts on the most essential operational protocols. We've dedicated significantly more effort to training and certification, and have elevated the performance expectations for key seasonal roles like office managers.","And finally, we're enhancing and differentiating the experience of our clients who are new to HR Block to demonstrate the value we provide in more tangible ways. It's also important to know that our franchise network is as engaged and excited as they've ever been.","I've been delighted to see the number of franchisees who have embraced not only the client experience enhancements but also our upfront transparent pricing model. We also saw record participation by franchisees at our convention in October and are seeing real momentum with our franchise base.","Moving to DIY, we've made a number of enhancements to our product. First, we've improved the experience for mobile users, giving more visibility to where they are in the process. We also continue to leverage data to make our products smarter and more personalized. By targeting questions relevant to the user, we are reducing the amount of screens the client sees, in some cases reducing the number of questions they need to answer by more than half.","Another key area is the significant improvements we've made in how we provide health throughout the user experience. We have redesigned the help center to give clients easier access to self-help. We're introducing a virtual assistant by leveraging machine learning to deliver quick answers. And finally, we're making it easier to get live product help. These improvements will eliminate breakpoint in the experience and ultimately drive conversion.","Finally, I'm excited to announce a brand-new online service we will be launching called Ask the Tax Pro. Those who choose this service will have a limited immediate access to a tax pro to answer their tax related question at any point in the experience.","For years, our clients have had the ability to chat online with the highly qualified Tax Pro if they needed help. This new service now includes Pro browsing capabilities, allowing our Tax Pros to work directly on the client screen to guide them to the answers they need. Clients can choose to interact with the Tax Pro through chat or phone, whichever is most convenient for them.","This is yet another innovation that connects our clients to the expertise of our Tax Pros. We expect as the Tax Pro to be the best value of the industry for those consumers who are confident doing taxes themselves, but have a few questions along the way. This innovation mindset is driving our efforts to meet consumers\u2019 evolving needs as we continuously evaluate new ways to connect clients to help.","To that end, we've made considerable improvements in our virtual products, Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review. Tax Pro Go, our virtual assistant offering which was designed and optimized for mobile users, addresses the needs of consumers who want assistance, but don't want or have the time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents to the MyBlock portal and work virtually with a Tax Pro matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed, and filed by H&R Block.","Our beta soft launch of Tax Pro Go last season had to goals of understanding who would be attracted to this product and refining the experience. We were pleased of the clients this product attracted to the brand with 70% being new to H&R Block and 65% being under 35 years old, demonstrating Tax Pro Goo\u2019s ability to drive new clients and millennials to H&R Block.","This year, we're continuing to improve the experience with more streamlined work for outflows, improved document upload and giving clients the ability to schedule an upfront phone consultation with their assigned Tax Pro.","Our second virtual product, Tax Pro Review, is a powerful way for our DIY clients to connect with one of our highly-trained experts to review resource documents as well as their entire return and identify all available credits and deductions.","At the end of the process, our Tax Pro then signs and files the return and clients can access the Tax Pro anytime during the year for any questions that may come up. We continue to make enhancements to Tax Pro Review to better demonstrate the benefits of working with an expert in this capacity.","Additionally, we've optimized our network of Tax Pros completing these returns and have made improvements to the end-to-end mobile experience. Everything we just discussed across the existing DIY and virtual spectrum shows our commitment to unmatched capability to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company.","In addition to the improvements in pricing, client experience and virtual, we continue to look for ways to provide solutions through promotional offerings and partnerships. That's why we'll bring back key promotions and partnerships this year that contributed to our performance in tax season 2018.","We will again offer refund advance, providing our clients early access to their money, in most cases, on the same day in which they file their taxes. Our loan amounts will be up to $3,000, and we're proud that our loans will remain 100% interest-free with no fee for the consumer. This contrasts with other offers that will have higher loan amounts but include interest charges. We will again be the exclusive provider of desktop software at Walmart, and we'll have an aggressive program in place with Amazon.","Additionally, for self-employed filers, we are continuing our partnership with Stride to give our clients the ability to track and import expenses into their return. Finally, we will provide access to free credit scores for our clients in all our channels through our partnership with LendingTree.","None of this matters if we don't effectively reach consumers and communicate the value we're delivering. So we're making changes that systematically improve our ability to acquire, retain, and engage clients. We're utilizing improved data analytics and enhanced marketing techniques to optimize and deliver unique messages to discrete micro segments in the market, and ultimately improve our ROI. This modern approach is key in building brand or our relevance and attracting new clients.","To wrap up, we've made many significant improvements to our business across a number of areas, including pricing, client experience, operational excellence, virtual products, promotion, and partnerships, demonstrating our commitment to delivering for our clients.","Our product offering is the most robust it's been in the history of our company. We're innovating and taking bold steps to disrupt the industry to ensure that we compete not only this season but for the long term. In short, we're excited about our future and for the season to begin.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our second quarter financial results and outlook.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Jeff. Good morning, everyone.","Before I get into the details of our Q2 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal second quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, second quarter results are not representative of our full-year performance.","Starting with revenues, we saw a year-over-year increase of $8 million or 6% to $149 million. This is primarily the result of increased Assisted tax prep revenues and the timing of revenues related to our Tax Identity Shield product, partially offset by lower international revenues which were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates.","Turning to expense, total operating expenses increased $7 million or 2% to $364 million primarily due to onetime costs of $10 million related to our office footprint optimization, as well as increased compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and marketing expense.","The increases in revenue and operating expenses combined with an increase in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and higher cash balances drove an improvement in pretax loss from continuing operations of $4 million or 2%.","While we saw an improvement in pretax loss, our loss per share increased $0.12 to $0.83. This was due to a lower-tax benefit compared to last year as the lower corporate tax rate negatively impacts quarter with a seasonal loss.","Turning to discontinued operations, there were no changes in accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and other SEC filings.","Turning to capital. Our priorities remain unchanged. We first focus on maintaining adequate liquidity to fund the business. We then look to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. We then fund our dividend, which we have done consistently since going public.","And then, finally, we look to opportunistically return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and at a minimum plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants. We did not repurchase shares during the most recent quarter, but have repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million for the fiscal year.","I\u2019d now like to provide some thoughts on our fiscal 2019 outlook. Starting with the tax industry, we anticipate overall returns to grow 1% to 2% in tax season 2019, consistent with historical trends and the current low unemployment environment. As we shared on our Q1 call, we don't anticipate the recent tax legislation to have a material impact on the methods filers use to prepare their taxes. Our research confirms that many filers are confused and will be looking for help this tax season.","As a result, we anticipate Assisted industry volume to be flat to slightly up with the remainder of the industry growth coming in DIY. Overall, we expect the industry volumes to be very similar to the trends we've seen over the last few years.","Specific to H&R Block, we expect to continue our trend of achieving overall client growth, driven by DIY and partially offset by a decline in Assisted due to the discontinuation of the Free EZ promotion. The change in Free EZ will impact the early part of the season and will be reflected in the results through February that we will release in early March.","With respect to pricing, our new approach will result in a lower net average charge in our Assisted business. While we expect the net average charge to decline, it will be impacted by positive mix as we expect to serve fewer Free EZ-type clients. In DIY, we expect our net average charge to be consistent with last year as we continue to focus on outpacing the category in returns and gaining market share.","While there is some trade down risk within DIY due to the new tax legislation which would negatively impact our net average charge, we believe that risk will largely be offset by after-tax probe and favorable mix. We are confirming our previously provided guidance as we continue to expect total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which takes into account the volume and pricing expectations I just shared. We're also maintaining our previously provided outlook and EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%.","Moving onto the other items in our financial outlook, as we've previously shared, fiscal 2018 represented a high watermark for depreciation and amortization. As we see the impact of office upgrade and franchise buybacks from several years ago roll up, we expect DNA to decline in fiscal 2019 and be $165 million to $175 million.","As a reminder, approximately two-thirds of our DNA is related to CapEx while the remaining one-third is related acquisitions. We expect to spend approximately 3% of revenues on capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 or $95 million to $105 million.","With respect to acquisitions, we anticipate repurchasing approximately 125 franchise locations, which was better than we originally expected and adding approximately 45 independent locations to our network for a total capital investment of approximately $40 million.","As a reminder, both franchise repurchases and independent acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our current trading multiple and as such are accretive to earnings. Beyond this year, we expect our franchise purchase activity to moderate. For fiscal 2019, we expect total interest expense to be $80 million to $85 million, driven by lower borrowing needs, offset by higher interest rates.","Before I turn it back over to Jeff, I just want to share my excitement for the upcoming tax season. We have a great plan to put H&R Block on the path to long-term sustainable growth. And I'm looking forward to seeing our plans come to life in the coming months.","With that, over to you Jeff for some closing thoughts.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks Tony.","I hope the additional information we shared today provides more context regarding our plans for the upcoming tax season as well as the full fiscal year. We are taking bold steps and innovating to improve the value we deliver for our clients, position as well not only for this season but for the long term. We're at the early stages of our journey but are confident in our plans. We look forward to talking with you after the fiscal third quarter.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Matthew?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open","Scott Schneeberger","Just interesting on what you just mentioned, Tony, could you quantify on the acquiring franchise locations? You mentioned it was more than anticipated. What type of positive revenue impact will that have on the year? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Yes, I don't know if I have the exact numbers, Scott. We were originally thinking more like 80 to 100 locations, so the incremental amount is approximately 25, a typical location doing $200,000 to $300,000 in revenue and obviously the incremental amount to us would be the 70% that we weren't getting before. So, I think that should give you a sense of the incremental revenue that should drive.","Scott Schneeberger","And then, Jeff, the transparent pricing, it\u2019s certainly a transformational initiative. I\u2019m curious what will we see with regard to marketing spend and marketing timing this tax season relative to those of the past. Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones","So, our overall investment is contemplated in our guidance, so that's all consistent. This will be a core message for the company where we haven't announced yet exactly all the shifts we're making in our marketing messaging, but suffice it to say upfront transparent pricing will be very clear to the market. It will be a major focus of how we go to market for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","Investing in pricing is a key objective for the upcoming tax season. Based on your study of the competitive backdrop so far, what would you say is the approximate pricing premium that H&R Block has over competitors, and is your objective to remain premium-priced based on the value provided or is it to bring pricing more in line with the competition?","Tony Bowen","This is Tony. Really good question. Our goal isn't to be the low-priced leader, so I think H&R Block will demand some level of premium relative to a lot of the other offerings in the marketplace. Specific to your question on what type of premium were we at, it really depends. I think across at spectrum and different client complexity, our premiums varied, obviously on the simple land or the Free EZ, and we were very competitive last year given we had the Free EZ promotion.","I think given how our pricing had evolved over time, we definitely identified certain client segments where we were very much above the market average, if you will. The consumers don\u2019t really feel the average, and it's impossible to shop the average, but we know in certain segments, in certain geographies, there's definitely places that we were well above the market, and we've taken the opportunity as part of this reset to try to fix most of those and bring us much more in line and use pricing as a catalyst to try to return us to client growth.","That being said, it's well beyond pricing. Pricing is just one aspect of what we're trying to do, and it's the overall value proposition and all the elements that we're making - the changes we are making that are all eventually going to allow us to be successful.","Jeffrey Jones","It's Jeff. I would just reiterate that we were not trying to be the low-price provider and to echo Tony's comments about all the other initiatives that have been put in place to demonstrate value, we also have seen that it's not just the price the consumer was paying, it was the fact they had no idea what it was going to cost.","And so, when I think about our approach to pricing, there are really three different components. The first component is really about the fact that they'll know the price before they begin. The second is how easy it will be for them to figure out what their price is, and then the third will be the actual price. And so, we're really thinking about all three of those elements.","George Tong","And as a follow-up, as the results of your new pricing transparency, you\u2019ve indicated that about one-third of filers will pay 10% less than last year. Can you help unpack that and detail which filing segment we'll see the most change?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, I\u2019d say it's a fairly complicated answer. I mean, as you know, George, the way we priced historically was extremely complex and made up of hundreds of individual billing items. So, what we were able to do in this change is simplify our overall approach which allows us to be transparent and share the price with the clients upfront.","When you think about who's going to get the bulk of that decrease, there's individuals like self-employed filers, homeowners, Middle America families that are really going to see the bulk of it, but it really depends on the specific situation and the types of complexities that that client had last year and the types of complexity that they'll come back with this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Tony, you broke up a little bit at least on my line when you were talking about the outlook. Can you review what you said about Assisted in terms of volume and the pricing, what you're expecting this year.","Tony Bowen","Yes, starting with price, I mean, just the price obviously, Jeff, will be down this year, lowering price. We're not sharing the exact amount it will be down. Obviously, it's contemplated in our overall revenue guidance. I mean that's one of the changes we tried to make this year. I mean last year, we provided a volume and more of a directional MAC.","There's a lot of moving parts this year, which is why we thought it was important just to drive guidance around an overall revenue number given there are so many parts. As far as volume, the only comment I made was we do expect Assisted to be down. I think we are really optimistic about the changes we're making around upfront pricing and the other value proposition, but obviously we have a headwind with the elimination of the free EZ promotion which we expect mostly that will occur during the first part of the tax season.","Jeff Silber","And talking about your new price transparency strategy, I\u2019m just curious what the competitive response has been so far.","Jeff Jones","This is Jeff, Jeff. I mean, obviously, we haven\u2019t really entered the season yet. So, it\u2019s difficult to know what the competitive response will be. We know that as we\u2019ve continued to evolve exactly how we will message this and communicate it, the way that we\u2019ve structured how easy it is for a client to figure out their price, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of additional testing on that with consumers, and that has been very positively received, but we don't know yet exactly how competitors will respond. We'll see once we get into the season.","Tony Bowen","One thing, Jeff, I would add to that, I mean, obviously we expect competitors will respond. I mean as a market leader, they typically react to whatever offer we have in the marketplace. I think the one thing that makes H&R Block a little bit unique is the fact that we're able to go out and market a message on a broad scale which is quite a bit different than most of other competitors in the space and we think that's going to provide us an advantage.","Operator","Your next question will come from line of Alex Paris with Barrington Research. Your line is open.","Chris Howe","This is Chris Howe sitting in for Alex. I had a question in regard to the millennial market segment. Can you perhaps add some additional color or some granular detail about the engagement and the utilization of H&R Block's product suite that you're seeing within millennials? And what you're doing heading into this tax season to increase retention efforts towards new millennials that were acquired last tax season?","Jeff Jones","I'll take this off and see if Tony wants to add anything. So, obviously, we're looking closely at who we're attracting in our ability to grow new clients. We mentioned on the last call that in tax season '18, over half of our new clients to H&R Block were millennials.","And so, one of the things we continue to see and understand is the power of the brand name, how trusted it is on the topic of taxes. With Tax Pro Go, I think what we saw was that the method of sitting down for an hour in the tax office isn't for everybody. And so I think that's why we're continuing to broaden the ways that millennials and others can access the brand.","Again, we think so digitally Tax Pro Go is a great way to do that. They get the full Assisted experience, but they don't have to physically visit an office. It actually turns out for a lot of people as well given our retail footprint that simply dropping off your documents is very convenient for people too.","So we'll continue to build out that continuum of all the ways people can access Block and pay close attention as these products grow on their ability to attract new clients to the brand, but also younger demographics to the brand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Your line is open.","Michael Millman","I believe New York City has had for some time upfront pricing . Can you talk about how that's worked in New York City, and what - how you saw that deferring in terms of clients for places that didn't have upfront pricing and so that as you're now upfront pricing nation-wide, similar to what it is or has been in New York City? I was also interested in, you talked about the first half of the season, Assisted would be down for reasons you gave. Could you talked about what you expect for the second half of the season?","Tony Bowen","I'm not exactly sure what you're alluding to with respect to New York. We have ran various tests that we're constantly doing on different pricing approaches. Several years ago we used to have a version of a pricing board in our offices and that maybe what you are remembering. It's probably been four or five years ago.","I think the main difference between that and what we're rolling out now is, that gave clients an indication of a range, about where they may fall based on their particular life situation, but the challenge with that model was, the ranges were incredibly wide. She might have a range of 99 to 199, which isn't that helpful.","And what we're rolling out this year is, every client will know the pricing in its entirety and can place themselves in the appropriate life situation and then whatever particular add-ons they have based on the documents they are bringing into the office to know their exact price. The feedback we got from several years ago is, it's helpful versus nothing, but it still doesn't tell me my price and some clients were worried that they were at the top end of the range and that maybe it is more hopeful than anything.","So I think that's specific to what you may be remembering as far as what we would have done in New York. What we are rolling out is nationwide. So it will be in every Company office. Obviously, franchisees have the ability to opt in. We are pleased that we've had incredible opt-in rates. The vast majority of franchisees will be following the model this year on a national level. Franchisees though, as you remember, do set their own individual prices.","So their price points may and will be different from the Company offices, but they will be following the model because they believe in it so much, which we were very pleased to see that result coming out of our franchise meaning.","I think your other question was specific to volume. I mean, we're not going to get more specific than saying that the first half will be where we expect to see some level of loss given the Free EZ promotion. Our goal is to continue to grow clients in all segments, in all parts of the season, whether it be first half or second half, but we just know that given the Free EZ promotion ran through 2\/28 last year, it will be a bit of a headwind.","Michael Millman","So will that over comp or will the second-half gains over comp that loss?","Tony Bowen","Overall, we did mention in the opening comments that we expect Assisted to decline. So we do expect a slight decline in Assisted, which obviously is disappointing for us given that obviously our goal over time is to grow clients, but we felt with all the changes happening with the simplification of the 1040 this year and it just didn't make sense to launch the Free EZ again, so that's going to be a bit of a headwind.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Tony, I wanted to go back to your previous answer on the franchisees and participation. I'm wondering just if you could give a ballpark range of the level of participation you're anticipating from the franchisees in the new plan, is it 80% or over, is it less, just good to get a perspective on how the franchisees are thinking about the new program?","Jeff Jones","So, we rolled this out in October at the Franchisee Convention and did a lot of work to educate in a broad way and then with individual franchisees to sit down with them at scale and help them understand in their business what this would mean to them. And just to put a percentage on it, we saw north of 80% adoption of the model, we would say the vast majority of franchisees.","And so we were very, very happy with their adaptiveness, their response. And frankly, their feedback was like what consumers told us. From their business perspective, they knew that our pricing model was causing friction for their clients as well, so they really applauded the change.","Kartik Mehta","And then just on the digital side. I noticed that you lowered prices at the beginning of this season compared to last year, now that there is a decent price difference between you and TurboTax. I'm wondering if you intend on marketing that price difference or how you might go about marketing that to try to gain market share?","Jeff Jones","And the way I'm thinking about it is, there are three core strategies in the DIY business broadly. One is, we will continue to evolve and improve the product experience, making it more personalized, making it more simple and making it more mobile, so that's the focus of how we want the product to get better year-over-year.","We will price competitively versus the marketplace and we will aggressively market the total value proposition to DIY. I have said before, we will act like a challenger brand in DIY and that's definitely our posture going into the year.","Operator","Your final question comes from line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Mario Cortellacci","This is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Just could you give us a sense of how long the investment cycle will be? Is 2019 expected to be the bottom in margins or how should we think about this longer term - or just the margin potential longer term after the increase in 2019?","Jeff Jones","So, we guided 24% to 26% for the year. Obviously, that was a reduction versus where we've been historically. And our guidance isn't changing today. One of the things that we've been talking a lot about is, where we have been historically in the high 20% range, as we assess the business and the places where we need to invest and the way we need to drive growth, we just believe that in the high 20s is represents a margin level that is the Company not investing in itself to grow and to be more relevant for the consumer.","So we are definitely not setting a goal to get back to the high 20s. We are focused on margin expansion over time as we grow volume, and that's really the key to how we're thinking about the next several years. We believe we have to grow clients and revenue and earnings over time, but again, the high 20s feels like a level where we are just not investing in our business appropriately.","Mario Cortellacci","And just regarding the Free EZ, I mean was there conversion rate year-over-year for those clients? Just trying to see if you're ever using it as an acquisition tool to go from a client that maybe got their stuff done for free and then actually convert it to a paying client in the year or two years from now. I'm just thinking if you are actually missing out on any revenue from there?","Tony Bowen","I mean definitely over time some of those clients migrated up to more complexity. I mean your tax situation tends to change from one year to the other and to qualify for the Free EZ promotion, you would have essentially had to only have a W2.","So if you bought a house the following year, had children or became self-employed or something else, then that would provide a monetization opportunity to move up. When we looked at the data over the last several years, clients are migrating up at the pace that we need to justify the program, which is part of the impetus for eliminating it this year.","The other thing that's happened, it's just become an increasingly expensive to even acquire the Free EZ clients. So the number of clients that you're bringing in relative to the dollars you're spending on marketing and the discount you're giving it's became increasingly expensive and that's why we're really pushing free clients to go into our DIY products. We still obviously have those products on the DIY side and focus more on more Middle America clients on the Assisted side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger","In your response to previous question about increasing digital year-over-year at this early part of the season, I'm aware [indiscernible]. It looks like [indiscernible] to be an offset or Jeff, based on your response I got the sense that over the year we will have a net reduction in pricing in digital. So the big question, if you could confirm that? And bigger question is, what type of pricing reductions will we see in digital versus realistic H&R Block this season, where - which will be the more meaningful and any degree of magnitude you may be able to share? Thank you.","Tony Bowen","This is Tony. I\u2019ll actually take that. I will actually take that. I mean, we're definitely going to see a bigger reduction on the Assisted side, I mean if you remember, we did a bit of a price reset in our DIY business a few years back, resetting our lineup. So, overall, this year in DIY we expect the net average charge to be maybe slightly down to even flat. And part of that's going to be driven by our attach of Ask a Tax Pro, which is a new offering we announced today, as well as just overall mix.","We're going to continue to be aggressive on the price side in DIY, but we've had favorable results last year from the launch of the self-employed skew as you mentioned. So overall, DIY will be essentially flat and that is our base expectation.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.","Colby Brown","Thanks everyone for joining us this morning.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot of exciting update to cover on today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll start by recapping our progress against the strategic framework we introduced you last year. Then I\u2019ll talk about our plans for fiscal '20 in both tax and small business. This will include details about the significant progress we have made to digitally enable all facets of H&R Block.","This work is essential to our success in both fiscal '20 and the long-term as we launch innovative new products, modernize how we deliver expertise in care, and ensure the best trained tax professionals in the industry can help clients in better and easier ways. Finally, Tony will discuss a non-GAAP financial reporting change, second quarter results including share repurchases and dividends and our fiscal '20 outlook.","Fiscal '19 represented the first steps to modernize H&R Block and to position ourselves to deliver sustainable growth. We made improvements to our business and excellent progress against our enterprise growth strategy.","We brought transparency to pricing in all our channels and we lowered prices for millions of consumers. We leveraged AI and machine learning to make the DIY experience faster, easier and more personalized. We introduced more new digital products than ever before which attracted consumers to our brand and we made tremendous progress on our technology roadmap.","These combined efforts enabled us to deliver at the top end of our financial outlook, make record increases in our client satisfaction scores, and grow overall clients and share. This positive momentum has carried into the first half of the fiscal year.","In addition to closing the Wave acquisition, which will help us accelerate our efforts in serving small business owners, we\u2019re seeing positive results in our tax business. We achieved return growth and share gains during the extension season, which just ended in October.","And having recently spent time at our National Retail meeting, I\u2019m certain that our associates and franchisees are ready to extend this momentum into the upcoming tax season.","So as we look ahead, I\u2019d like to talk about our plans for the year and how we\u2019re combining technology and our human advantage to deliver expertise in care in new and compelling ways.","In our offices, teams remain focused on operational excellence to improve the quality and consistency of the experience. A key element of this improved experience is upfront transparent pricing, which will remain a top priority.","We\u2019re also building on last year by enhancing our standard operating procedures, and we\u2019ll continue to leverage our competitive Refund Advance product to drive consumers to our brand.","We\u2019re also strengthening the tools that enable our tax pros to provide best-in-class service for our clients. This includes digitizing how our tax pros work and communicate with clients through a tool called Work Center. This technology provides our tax pros a 360 degree view of the client, consolidating and simplifying routine task, and offering a portal to all the services we provide.","This year, we\u2019ll introduce a variety of enhancements, such as an improved dashboard to streamline how tax pros manage both in office and virtual returns, and document management that makes the process of gathering and sharing tax documents easier.","By equipping our tax pros with the right technology, we\u2019re increasing their efficiency, giving them more time to provide help and inspire confidence in their clients, which will be a key to retention.","Next, Tax Pro Go represents an important product as we offer mobile first solutions that appeal to busy young consumers who know H&R Block, but haven\u2019t yet tried our brand. This season marks the second year we\u2019ve offered this fully assisted digital service nationwide. Based on client feedback, we\u2019ve improved the product flow and simplified pricing.","We\u2019re also making it easier to connect with our tax pros, a key differentiator for H&R Block. No one can match their level of training, quality and tenure, with nearly half of our pros being members of the Block team for more than 10 years.","In DIY, we've improved all aspects of our offerings, with a focus on ease, speed and personalization. We will maintain our challenger mindset by pricing competitively, making sure consumers know about our award winning product, and ensuring clients are never surprised by their price.","We\u2019re capturing client data earlier in the process and further leveraging AI and machine learning to remove questions and steps from the workflow. This year, you\u2019ll hear us talk about how consumers can now switch in two clicks, making it even easier to move from a competitor.","We\u2019ve also improved our online assist product, formerly known as Ask a Tax Pro. This offering gives our DIY clients on demand access to a tax pro for help with any questions they may have. This year, we\u2019re increasing the prominence of this product by highlighting our price advantage and offering it as a separate SKU on our website.","Let me switch gears to talk about the digital tool for clients called My Block. Regardless of how a client engages with us, whether it\u2019s in office, online or through Tax Pro Go, My Block is a digital hub of our clients experience with H&R Block.","Through this platform, clients can upload and store their tax documents, access prior year returns, set appointments, manage their Emerald Card and use our tax estimator for help with planning.","This year, My Block enable secure document upload, private messaging with the Tax Pro, and greater visibility into the status of the return, and we\u2019ve re-designed the workflow and streamlined our digital signature experience for clients who choose to finish their return online. I am pleased with where My Block is today and the valuable role it will play in the future.","Let me turn now to small business. We currently serve over 2 million small business clients in tax and are working to ensure that more small business owners understand the expertise we can provide through new tools and redesign tax prep experience.","Through Wave, we continue to simplify the financial lives of small business owners. We\u2019re excited to announce that we have opened our API to third-party developers to extend the functionality and reach of our tools.","We\u2019re also releasing new integrations to make it easier for small business - small businesses that track all of their transactions from various sources in a single system. These integrations dramatically simplify the accounting process, allowing small business owners to focus on what matters most.","And I\u2019m pleased to announce that we've partnered with Shopify for our first integration launch. This is a significant accomplishment as it represents the first direct accounting integration in the Shopify App Store.","What I\u2019ve just covered outlines our plans for the upcoming season and some of the ways in which we\u2019re using technology to drive value for consumers and small business owners. By focusing on digital enabling every aspect of our business, we\u2019re setting the company up for success for both this fiscal year and the long-term.","With that, I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Tony.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the details of our results, I\u2019d like to discuss the key change to our non-GAAP financial reporting starting this quarter. We are now reporting an adjusted non-GAAP EPS, which excludes amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions. This adjustment removes amortization of intangibles related to Wave, franchise buybacks, and tax office acquisitions. For context, approximately one third of our historical D&A expense was related to acquisitions.","We believe these adjusted results will be beneficial for investors when evaluating H&R Block's operating performance. To assist with modeling, we have included quarterly historical and adjusted EPS schedules in our earnings release.","Turning to our results. As a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal second quarter due to the seasonality of our tax business. Therefore, second quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.","Starting with revenues, we saw a year-over-year growth of $12 million or 8% to $161 million. This increase was primarily due to Wave, which contributed $11 million. Additionally, in the tax business, extension season results in the US were strong, with volume and share growth in both Assisted and DIY.","These results were partially offset by lower net average charge in Assisted, which reflects the investment in price taken at the beginning of last tax season. It does not indicate a change in our plans for the upcoming season as we continue to anticipate our net average charge to be flat to the prior year. I\u2019ll discuss details around our revenue guidance in a few minutes.","Turning to expense. Total operating expenses increased $39 million or 11% to $404 million. This was primarily due to Wave, as well as planned investments related to our technology roadmap and higher legal expenses, partially offset by lower occupancy cost. Interest expense was $21 million, which was relatively flat to the prior year.","The changes in revenue and expenses resulted in an increase in pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $29 million. GAAP loss per share increased $0.10 to $0.93. Adjusted loss per share, which we will report going forward increased $0.07 to $0.85, driven by the increase in pre-tax loss and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by an increased tax benefit due to favorable discrete items. As a reminder, while beneficial on a full year basis, the lower share count negatively impact EPS in quarters in which we report a loss.","In discontinued operations, there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC filings.","Regarding capital, our priorities remain unchanged. At the top of the list, it\u2019s maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality.","We came into this year with a strong financial position after generating over $500 million of free cash flow in fiscal '19. We then make strategic investments back in to the business that we believe deliver value to our clients, ultimately benefiting our shareholders. Making prudent investments to drive sustainable growth remains a key element of our capital allocation.","Last, we will deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. With respect to dividends, the health of our business and our outlook for the future has allowed for dividend increases over the past 4 years. Over that time, our quarterly dividend has increased 30%. We will perform an annual review of the dividend after each fiscal year.","Regarding share repurchases, we remain committed to at a minimum, repurchasing shares to offset dilution from equity grants. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $137 million at an average price of $23.94.","Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 7.3 million shares for $181 million at an average price of $24.75. Going forward, we will continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase approach.","I\u2019d now like to provide thoughts on our fiscal '20 outlook. Starting with the tax industry, we expect overall return growth of about 1%, with Assisted volume flat to slightly up and DIY growing 2% to 3%. This is consistent with the trends we\u2019ve seen over the last several years.","Regarding H&R Block, we expect to grow both clients and market share in fiscal '20, which was marked the third consecutive year of improvements. This will be driven by sustained growth in DIY and a continued improvement in our client trajectory in Assisted, as we anticipate holding market share in that category.","With respect to pricing, following the year in which we reset prices in our Assisted business, we expect net average charge to remain consistent with last year.","In DIY, we will continue to price competitively as we focus on driving return volume and share gains. DIY net average charge is expected to increase slightly due to favorable mix led by online assist.","We expect these client growth and pricing expectations, along with the addition of Wave to result in revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%. This is consistent with the outlook provided during our last two quarterly calls.","With respect to earnings, we anticipate total EBITDA dollars to be slightly higher than fiscal '19 as we return to revenue growth. While our EBITDA loss increased in the first half, we still expect EBITDA growth for the full fiscal year. The majority of our revenue increase and planned cost reductions that will offset Wave's operating losses will be achieved in the fourth quarter. We expect these changes to result in revenue growth outpacing EBITDA growth, which will impact our margin. Therefore, we continue to anticipate EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% in fiscal '20.","We\u2019re updating our tax rate outlook to 19% to 21%, an improvement from our original outlook of 23% to 25%, primarily due to favorable settlements with tax authorities during the second quarter.","Moving on to the other items in our financial outlook, we expect total depreciation and amortization of $165 million to $175 million, of which $70 million to $80 million will be amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, this amortization expense reflects both Wave and other acquisitions and will be excluded from EPS for non-GAAP reporting.","We expect full year interest expense to be $90 million to $100 million. And finally, our business continues to be capital light, and we expect capital expenditures to be slightly lower than the prior year at $70 million to $80 million. I\u2019m excited about the season ahead and look forward to updating you on our progress in March.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, Tony. I too am very excited about the progress we're making on our long-term objectives and our plans for the upcoming tax season. We\u2019re building on the successes of fiscal '19 as we continue to develop products and tools that will allow consumers and small business owners to interact with H&R Block in new and exciting ways.","I\u2019d like to thank our associates, tax pros and franchisees for their continued focus on providing expertise in care to our clients, and all they are doing to prepare for the upcoming season. I look forward to sharing more next quarter.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions. Lateef?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Goldstein of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Jeff Goldstein","Hey, good afternoon. You mentioned your view that your Assisted volumes can improve their trajectory this year, maybe you could just add a little bit more color around your confidence around that specifically given you reiterated again your plans to not increase price this year?","Jeffrey Jones II","Hey, Jeff. It's Jeff Jones. Thanks for the question. As Tony mentioned in his prepared remarks, we\u2019ve been on a trajectory year-over-year of improving our performance in the Assisted business.","As you may know, last year, we made a conscious decision about eliminating Free EZ which we knew would cost this client, but step that aside, we know we kept pace with the industry.","So when we take a step back and think about all the things we continue to do this year, year two of upfront transparent pricing, all the work we\u2019re doing on operational excellence in standard operating procedures, continuing to build on the marketing effectiveness that we started last year and into this year.","To be honest, the culture and excitement with the field and franchise organization, you know we think about retention, obviously, we already have a high retention market, about 73%, and I\u2019m eager to see how our client satisfaction scores from last year might translate into retention this year.","But you put all that together and we feel really good about the plans we have in place to continue on that trajectory. And as Tony said, our goal is ultimate growth, and this year we expect to maintain share in the category.","Jeff Goldstein","Okay. That was helpful. And then, expenses were a little bit higher than we were expecting this quarter and it seems to be centered on a step up in other wages line item. So is there anything one time to call out there or somewhere else, and is there any change to how you\u2019re thinking about the expense page for the remainder of the year.","Tony Bowen","Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. This is Tony. Yeah, there was several items in other, I mean, a lot of the Wave expenses related to some of the variable cost, show up in other. We also have some legal expenses that occurred during the quarter that are showing up in other, there's a number of moving parts.","But as I said in my opening comments, when you look at the full year, we expect a fair amount of benefit to occur during our fourth quarter, not only will - the vast majority of our revenue growth occurred during that quarter, where we have some identified expense roll off that will also hit that will allow us to grow EBITDA during that quarter, grow EBITDA for the full year and hit the overall guidance that I outlined.","Jeff Goldstein","Was there anything on the other wages line item specifically though?","Tony Bowen","Not the - Yeah, I mean, we've got build wages which obviously picks up the vast majority of our field network in the US, as well as some of our international businesses.","Wave wages that we picked up during the quarter would be showing up in other wages that would probably be a significant portion of that increase, as well as the investments we\u2019re making in their technology roadmap, and hiring additional IT professionals would also show up in that line item.","Jeff Goldstein","Okay. Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ryan Gunning","Yeah, hi. This is Ryan Gunning filling in for Hamzah. Just a quick question. Do you think there are any variables in the upcoming tax here that maybe the market isn\u2019t considering that could impact returns positively or negatively? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones II","Yeah. Ryan, this is Jeff Jones. Last year was obviously a unique year with the government shutdown, the delayed season which turned into extensions. When we look back over history of growth rate, that\u2019s why we see the industry this year kind of returning back to about 1%. There is nothing that we know of at this point that would impact that number.","Obviously not trying to predict what the government may or may not do, but there is nothing that's on our radar at this point that we see impacting that growth for upcoming season.","Ryan Gunning","Great. Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Hey, Jeff, and Tony. Jeff, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the marketing budget, especially as you have Wave now and maybe what the anticipation is, if you - if you're going to maintain kind of marketing budget, where it is and just - and take some and add it to Wave or you expect overall marketing budget to increase and increase both the tax side and for Wave?","Jeffrey Jones II","Hey Kartik, let me pull the part a little bit. Overall, our marketing budget for the year is reflected in our guidance, and what we are absolutely focused on is spend effectiveness. That you may remember last year, I talked a lot about the changes we were making in performance marketing, etc., we saw great results there, that will continue.","With respect to Wave, at the highest level, we think Wave has an incredible value proposition, and they have been able to grow effectively really through that three propositions relying primarily on SCO. They have started to experiment with SEM marketing, and are really at the beginning of learning that effectiveness added to their mix.","We think there is a lot of opportunity to grow awareness, and you\u2019ll see us take a few steps this year, you know things like Shopify integration help. We are now co-merchandising them on H&R Block's website.","We are now emailing qualified H&R Block clients about Wave. We\u2019ll be emailing qualified Wave clients about H&R Block. So inside the installed base, we think there is a lot of opportunity that doesn\u2019t rely on a lot of incremental investment and that's where we're focused for fiscal '20.","Kartik Mehta","And then just one last question, Jeff, maybe the growth in Wave customers and revenue?","Jeffrey Jones II","Yeah. So at this stage we\u2019re not really guiding on customers, but I will say that the top of the funnel remains very healthy for Wave. They grew revenue this quarter about 40%. As we said last quarter, for years now, they\u2019ve been growing 40% plus on the revenue line, they did that again this quarter. It was a little softer than we would have like based on some mix of payment type.","But overall, still feel very, very good about the health of the business, the way they're thinking about serving small business owners and the simplicity of their product, and the way they\u2019re thinking about the product roadmap and what's to come.","Kartik Mehta","Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, Kartik.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Henry Chien of BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Chien","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about some of the operational excellence that even though I know you reiterated margins for next year.","But just curious, excluding that cost impact from Wave, the underlying margin trend and sort of where you're targeting and achieving any potential through operating efficiencies that could impact margins going forward beyond the sort of impact with Wave? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Yeah. As I shared in my opening comments, all of the Wave operating loss will be offset with other cost reductions, as well as revenue growth which will allow us to grow EBITDA dollars for the year. I also said that the revenue line will grow a little bit fast, and the EBITDA line, which will cause a slight contraction in EBITDA margin.","We feel really good that EBITDA dollars are going to improve in a year that we did a really strategic acquisition for a company that is currently operating at loss, but we know over time, you know it will be accretive to H&R Block.","When we talk about operational execution, it\u2019s not only focusing on the P&L, but also in our offices and a number of the changes we\u2019re making there and how we serve clients, how we staff our offices, all of the - all the way that we lead and manage our offices, all those changes that we really focus on to make sure that every client is getting the best experience possible, and that's been a lot of our focus over the last year.","And frankly, it has resulted in an improvement in NPS scores and client satisfaction scores that Jeff mentioned should result in retention improvement over the long term.","Henry Chien","Got it. Okay. And any sort of thoughts on the - the sort of fixed cost base, whether it's real estate or any other cost otherwise, how you are sort of thinking about that?","Jeffrey Jones II","Yeah, I mean, we try to make a lot of those decisions on a year-by-year basis. I mean, we\u2019ve been focused on growing. Obviously, the last couple of years, we did a number of changes last year and resetting our baseline resetting margin levels, optimizing our footprint, resetting price.","And now we\u2019re focused on how do we take that new base and grow both in the Assisted side, DIY, and now through Wave, which should result in improved EBITDA dollars over time. And as those EBITDA dollars improve, that\u2019s really the main focus of what we\u2019re focused on over the next few years.","Henry Chien","Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much. Jeff, could we start on the technology roadmap. It\u2019s - clearly you have one, I\u2019d love to get a progress update. On the outside we don\u2019t really know the roadmap, you have that.","And so could you just kind of summarize where you are along the path, what\u2019s been accomplished, what\u2019s yet to go and is it trending financially, I guess, now on the cost side as you would expect it and are you starting to see benefits?","Jeffrey Jones II","Yeah. Hey, Scott. Great question. And I'm sorry that that feels opaque to you. So the technology roadmap that we talked about a year or so ago has a lot of different dimension. I think at the top is what we refer to as the omni-channel tax engine or a tax platform.","That\u2019s a major initiative to move from three engine to one engine, that is a multi-year effort. It\u2019s an effort that the company had attempted in the past and we are on track with that initiative. The team has found some great breakthroughs and the omni-channel tax engine is on track.","The second piece, a major piece of the roadmap is cloud migration. Obviously, this is a place where given the seasonality of our business and given resiliency, I think there is a lot of benefit of cloud, this too is a multi-year move from our data centers to the cloud, that roadmap is also on track.","The other one speak more to things like Dayton architecture, information security, and those are less about a defined number of years and just to continue its focus on improving them, really nothing to report there. They are super important priorities, but they're less of a roadmap.","So what I can report today is, our initiatives are on track. They are going to take several years to complete. When they are complete, we expect to see run rate benefit in the cost reduction and also greater ability to serve clients.","So I feel really good about the intent of why we launched them, and I\u2019m happy to say they are on track, but they do still have a couple of years to go.","Scott Schneeberger","Excellent. Thanks for the color there. From my follow-up, I would like to ask two questions if I could, just sneak them in there, they are somewhat separate. It looked like legal expenses was increased, you guys discussed a little bit. But curious is that Free File Alliance focused or other, just whatever you can elaborate?","And then my other question, it's a quickie is, will you be providing volume updates throughout the tax season? You have a large competitor in the tax base who is not going to do it this year after they had been in the past. So just curious what your plan is for that? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones II","Yeah. So we\u2019ll take them in the reverse order. On your second question, we absolutely believe that - that we should be and will be as transparent as possible with you in our business, in our transformation, in our initiatives, and we have no plans to change how we provide updates to you throughout the season that will continue.","Tony Bowen","Yeah, I\u2019ll take the legal expenses Scott. I mean, FFA was a driver during the quarter. We also had some Wave expenses that hit. We provide a lot of detail in our 10-Q, which we\u2019ll file later this week, that talks about all of our legal matters. As you know, we typically don't comment on the details of those pending matters.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks, Tony. If I just - is it going to remain elevated or no on the legal front? Thank you for taking too many.","Jeffrey Jones II","Yeah, I mean, obviously, when you see a quarter bump up, it\u2019s probably not going to go to zero on a year-over-year basis the following quarter, but we did contemplate that in our EBITDA margin outlook that I provided earlier in the call.","Scott Schneeberger","Great. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, Scott.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to dive deeper into the cost reductions that you\u2019re planning to make to help offset the Wave operating losses. Now that you\u2019re further along into the year, can you just elaborate a little bit more on where these savings are coming from and if you\u2019ve identified additional savings you didn\u2019t have earlier in the year and what the potential impact of executing on those savings could be to save revenues and market share performance?","Jeffrey Jones II","Yeah. Thanks, George. As I said, there is - most of those are going to occur during the fourth quarter. You will see in our release that we released before the call that our EBITDA loss is up slightly for the first six months, but for the full year we still expect EBITDA dollars to improve on a year-over-year basis, driven by really two factors.","One, the growth in revenue, which as you know, over 75% of our annual revenue occurred during the fourth quarter. So it's all about that quarter, as well as some planned cost reductions that have already been identified. It's just a matter of those rolling off, which will occur during the fourth quarter.","So there is some compensation efficiencies, there is some promotional expenses in the marketing budget that will roll off earlier - earlier in the year, we already had some one-time expenses related to our footprint consolidation that occurred last year that rolled off in the first half of this year.","So those are probably the three biggest drivers. Your question on, what else have we identified, and it's obviously a fluid conversation as we think about how the results are coming in. We're off to a good start to the first half of the year. But we still feel like the ranges that we provided in both revenue and EBITDA margin are on point.","George Tong","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And I know you've talked about pricing for Assisted at length, but now again you\u2019re further into the year. What's the likelihood that you'll flex pricing as a lever or are you fully committed to sustaining flat pricing for this upcoming tax season?","And then separately on DIY, it looks like pricing is coming lower, can you share some thoughts - just additional thoughts on how you plan to go to market from a pricing perspective in DIY?","Jeffrey Jones II","Hey, George. We will tag [ph] team. On Assisted, we are fully committed to holding that flat for fiscal '20. When we reset pricing, we do not believe we need to reset pricing further. This is all about getting our pricing in line so clients can see and experience the value. We feel really good about how our clients judge that last year and the scores they gave us.","And over time, once that value prop gets clearer and tighter, and we feel like we\u2019re back on a path to growth, we expect and hope to be able to get back to inflationary level price increases in the Assisted business.","Tony Bowen","Yeah. Then as regards to DIY, you know George for the last couple of years we price competitively, which has really been a key to part of our growth, we want to grow awareness for building a great product. The pricing is a key element to it.","I\u2019m not sure if you caught in my opening remarks, but we actually expected net average charge in DIY to be up this year. So pricing will not be lower and we expect it to be flat and the positive mix led by online assist will actually lead to a higher overall net average charge in DIY.","George Tong","That\u2019s helpful. Just to follow-up quickly on that. So that the pricing increase is going to be driven more by mix, is that correct?","Jeffrey Jones II","That\u2019s right. I mean, it's dynamic. As you know, pricing changes throughout the season, whether it be first half or second half in by-product, but we don\u2019t have any planned price reductions in DIY, and we believe that there is going to be positive mix led by online assist.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, George.","Jeffrey Jones II","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Colby Brown for closing remarks. Sir?","Colby Brown","Thanks again everyone for joining us. This concludes today\u2019s call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the call. Thank you for participating.

During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up, after which they may choose to jump back into the queue.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you, Colby. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2019 was a great year for H&R Block. In what was the first step of executing the strategy we\u2019ve rolled out last summer, our associates and franchisees delivered significant improvements in how we serve our clients. We introduced a lot of changes to the business and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of how the team responded.","We ended the season with improved client service scores and overall return growth that outpaced the industry, and our associates are energized by the direction we're heading which showed in our exceptionally strong associate engagement scores. As a result of the progress we've made in our tax business, we delivered financial results at the top end of our outlook ranges. The strength of our business has enabled us to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders, and we just announced an increase in our dividend and an extension of our share repurchase authorization.","I'm also excited to share details about the announcement we made this morning regarding our acquisition of Wave. I'll share more about this later. We obviously have a lot to discuss, so let me walk you through what we'll cover on today's call. First, I'll provide our perspective on the tax season for both the industry and H&R Block.","Next, I'll discuss Wave and how they fit into our long-term strategy. Tony will then review our fiscal 2019 results, the financial impact of Wave, our fiscal 2020 outlook, and capital allocation. Let's first look at tax season 2019 beginning with the overall industry. It was an unusual season with the government shutdown affecting the start of the season and changes to the tax code impacting refunds. Both contributed to an overall delay which continued throughout the season and likely resulted in an increase in extension filings.","This led to industry returns being essentially flat to prior year, which was lower than expectations. Consistent with prior years, industry results show a slight shift from Assisted to DIY. When taking into account the decline in paper returns which are typically more weighted to DIY, the assisted to DIY shift was approximately 60 basis points which is consistent with the last several years and in line with our expectations.","Turning to our results, let me recap what we set out to do this year. We've made significant improvements this season in how we serve our clients. In our assisted business, we focused on enhancing the value we deliver while developing a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block. In DIY, we made investments to improve the product and grow awareness while pricing competitively to deliver tremendous value.","And in virtual, we offered consumers three distinct ways to access the expertise of our Tax Pro network. We achieved our objectives in each channel and are pleased with our results outperforming the overall market and taking DIY share for the third straight year. In the Asssited business, we're excited about the progress we've made this year with significant operational improvements across every aspect of the business from field operations to experience for new clients to pricing.","With respect to pricing, we addressed what was a significant pain point for our clients in two ways. First, we led the industry with upfront transparent pricing; and second, we invested in price decreases for certain client segments, and the feedback from both our clients and Tax Pros has been extremely positive. In fact, client satisfaction scores around price for value increased nine points. Additionally, we focused on improving Tax Pro training, operational improvements to drive consistency in our offices, and an enhanced experience for new clients.","Nearly, one-third of our Tax Pros increased their certification levels. We converted clients at a greater rate and we increased overall NPS by 9 points. These initiatives are reflected in our volume results in assisted. While U.S. assisted volume declined 1.7%, this was expected due to the elimination of the free EZ promotion. Excluding free EZ, our assisted results were in line with the industry, which represents an improvement in our client trajectory for the third consecutive year.","Turning to DIY, we achieved outstanding client growth of 6% driven by online growth of over 9%. We grew market share for the third year in a row with several factors contributing to this performance. We enhanced the experience for mobile users, leveraged data and machine learning to make our products smarter and more personalized. We redesigned our help center and made significant improvements to price transparency by launching DIY Price Preview.","While we saw others in the industry continue to raise prices, we focused on winning clients through great value and transparency. As a result, we've received tremendous feedback from our clients as evidenced by our NPS improvement of 9 points. Our products also received numerous accolades, including the Editor's Choice Award from PC Magazine for online tax preparation.","Finally, our virtual offerings also saw significant improvements in NPS, and in total grew 75% as we attracted new clients and gave DIY filers affordable ways to get the help they needed. H&R Block is the only company able to serve consumers no matter how little or how much help they want. This year we introduced Ask a Tax Pro, an on-demand service designed for the DIY filer that wants immediate answers to their questions.","We're excited about the opportunity with this product as over one-third of Ask a Tax Pro clients were new to our brand. Our next virtual product Tax Pro Review is for the DIY consumer who wants an expert review before submitting their return. Our results demonstrate meaningful progress with nearly 40% growth in new clients, signaling that consumers understand the value in this product. Finally, this year was the national introduction of a mobile first fully assisted experience called Tax Pro Go which is the easiest way for consumers to have an expert prepare their taxes.","The initial results show that this product appeals to a younger higher income filers and nearly 60% of these clients are new to H&R Block. Adding a digital layer to our network of over 80,000 tax professionals is a great combination of expertise and ease. I'd like to now shift gears and discuss our enterprise strategy which we first shared with you last June. As a reminder, our strategic journey is driven by five pillars, elevate our talent and culture, own an sustainable brand position, win on customer experience, build operational excellence, and invest for the long term.","We made excellent progress against each of these pillars in the first year and we will continue this work in fiscal 2020. I'd now like to spend some time talking about the last pillar and specifically about how we're investing for the long-term through our acquisition of Wave. This acquisition strengthens our trajectory and expands our reach within the large and growing small business market.","Wave is the strong strategic fit and I'm extremely excited to welcome such an innovative company with great product and an outstanding team to H&R Block. To start with why we see this as a great opportunity? Let\u2019s first talk about the small business category and why it makes sense for us. There are approximately 31 million small businesses in North America and more than 100,000 new ones created every month. Additionally, roughly 57 million U.S. workers are freelancers. A staggering number that's expected to grow to nearly 87 million by 2027 representing over half of the U.S. workforce.","Small business owners struggle with cash flow, bookkeeping, payroll and tax preparation. In fact the primary reason businesses fail in the first year is poor financial management. Most do not use bookkeeping services and are instead using old fashioned methods such as keeping receipts in a shoe box or tracking their numbers on a simple Excel spreadsheet. Given our role in helping clients navigate the challenges of their financial lives, this represents a significant opportunity to deliver value and help small business owners successfully manage their complex financial needs. So this category clearly presents opportunity and in the market in which we have the right to compete.","It's also aligned well with our existing assets. Within our current client base, we serve a significant number of small business owners through both DIY and assisted tax credit. We also currently provide clients with bookkeeping and other related services. Acquiring this software platform allows us to accelerate our small business strategy, it also offers a unique opportunity over time to cross-sell and attract new clients to our tax business while helping our current tax clients with their small business needs through an innovative platform.","Importantly, there is essentially no overlap between what we offer in Wave\u2019s existing services and technology which further enhances the strategic fit. And it goes beyond the services our two companies offer. During our first visit with the Wave\u2019s team, it was clear that we share a common passion for building a great culture and delivering a superior user experience. The team of Wave is driven and they understand what their clients need as over half of Wave's associates have at one point owned their own business and it's the talented team of engineers continues to evolve the platform delivering innovative solutions to small business owners.","The dedication to quality has resulted in numerous awards including being named to the CB Insights Fintech 250 and recognition by Deloitte and KPMG as one of North America's fastest growing tech companies. In short, we are partnering with a fantastic team who are great at what they do. Let me provide little more detail about exactly what Wave offers to its clients. Wave is built for the small business owner not the accountant or bookkeeper. Its simple user experience on a single comprehensive platform is designed to empower those who don't have the time, the knowledge or the desire to manage their finances. Wave software platform includes accounting, invoicing and receipt tracking at no cost to the end user.","Wave then generates revenue by providing payment processing, payroll services and bookkeeping services. This disruptive pricing model provides significant value to the customer and is built on a low cost of acquisition which positions the company well against other competitive offerings. In fact over 80% of its users have come to Wave through unpaid channels. As a result, Wave has grown rapidly and organically more than 400,000 small business owners actively use the platform each month and the company has increased revenue in each of the last 25 quarters. And there is opportunity for additional growth as Wave increases brand awareness and expands the platform to offer additional features.","Turning to transaction details, the purchase price of $405 million will be funded by available cash. We expect the transition to close within the next few months. Tony will provide additional details on the financial impact of the transaction and our approach to capital allocation later in the call. Wave will operate as a separate business unit and a strong management team will remain on board post transaction continuing the great work they\u2019ve already started.","In summary, the Wave acquisition represents a strong strategic fit for H&R Block as we invest for the long-term. Wave has provided us the opportunity to accelerate our small business strategy drive growth and enhance shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited to welcome the Wave team. Before I turn it over to Tony, I'd like to thank our associates, Tax Pros and franchisees for embracing change and successfully executing year one of our strategic roadmap. Beyond delivering results for our clients, our team served our communities in ways we haven't in the past.","During our national convention, we dedicated over 6000 associate hours to volunteering in the community and later at more than 300 local events. Collectively these efforts clearly show that we live our purpose of providing health and inspiring confidence in our clients and communities everywhere. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Jeff. Good morning everyone. Let me start with the financial objectives we outlined prior to the tax season and how our performance is measured up. Coming into fiscal 2019, we recognized the need to make investments in price, technology and operational excellence in order to achieve long-term growth. We outlined fiscal 2019 revenue expectations at $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion and EBITDA margin of 24% to 26%. I'm pleased to report that we hit the high end of both of these ranges. Looking at the detailed results, revenue was $3.1 million representing a 2% decline from the prior year.","This was expected and was driven by a decline in assisted revenue resulting from targeted price reductions. Our strong growth in DIY volume as well as improved mix helped offset the overall decrease in revenue. Regarding expenses, total operating expenses increased 3% driven by planned investments in technology as well as an increase in marketing.","The resulting EBITDA margin of 25.8% was at the high end of our outlook range. Moving through the remainder of the income statement, we saw other income increase due to higher interest rates on cash balances. Despite these higher rates, interest expense decreased due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 18.3% which was lower than our initial outlook due to discrete items recorded in the fourth quarter but represents an increase from fiscal 2018.","As a reminder, fiscal 2018 was unique as our effective tax rate of 6.3% was significantly lower due to the federal corporate tax rate change. The higher tax rate in fiscal 2019 along with revenue and expense changes mentioned earlier resulted in a decrease in EPS from $2.98 to $2.15.","Turning to the balance sheet, our financial position remains strong. We ended the year with nearly $1.6 billion of cash which was slightly higher than the prior year. In discontinued operations, there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC filings.","I\u2019d now like to provide some detail on the Wave acquisition and its impact of fiscal 2020. As Jeff mentioned, we\u2019re acquiring all the Wave\u2019s outstanding shares for a purchase price of $405 million which will be funded with available cash. We expect this transaction to close within the next few months. I\u2019ll now provide our overall financial outlook for fiscal 2020 which includes the impact of Wave. I'll also share the Wave\u2019s specific projections. Starting with revenues, we anticipate modest growth in the tax business following the recent year. Additionally, we expect that Wave will contribute $40 million to $45 million which represents nine months of ownership. The net result is total company revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%.","With respect to earnings, we anticipate total EBITDA dollars to be slightly higher than fiscal 2019 as we return to revenue growth. And while we will absorb Wave\u2019s operating loss and related transactional costs of approximately $25 million to $30 million, we plan to offset these through other cost reductions to maintain the strong EBITDA level. As a result, we expect revenue growth will outpace EBITDA which will impact our margin. Therefore we are maintaining our EBITDA margin outlook range of 24% to 26% for fiscal 2020.","As we execute Wave\u2019s growth plans, we do expect it to be accretive over time. However given the choice to focus on top line growth, we do not expect Wave to be profitable in the near to medium term. Additionally, we expect amortization expense related to the Wave acquisition to be $40 million to $50 million in fiscal 2020. This may change and will be ultimately determined by the final purchase price allocation.","With respect to corporate taxes, we currently anticipate our rate to be 23% to 25%. As always, this may fluctuate should unanticipated discrete items occur during the fiscal year. I\u2019d now like to switch gears and talk about our capital structure. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. At the top of the list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality.","As I mentioned earlier, we ended the year with a strong cash position after another year of solid cash flow generation. We didn't make strategic investments back into the business that we believe deliver value to our clients ultimately benefiting our shareholders. In fiscal 2019, we made significant investments in pricing, technology and operational excellence. And now with the acquisition of Wave, we\u2019re accelerating our growth making prudent investments to drive sustainable growth remains a key element of our capital allocation.","Last, we will deploy excess capital through quarterly dividend and share repurchases. I'm pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 4% increase in our dividend to an annual rate of a $1.04 of $0.26 per quarter. This represents our fourth consecutive year of increases. Over that time, our quarterly dividend has increased 30%. We remain committed to performing an annual review of the dividend after each fiscal year.","With respect to share repurchases, they are a key component of capital allocation and we remain committed to at a minimum repurchasing shares to offset dilution from equity grants. As such, our Board extended our previous share repurchase authorization by three years to June 2022 with approximately $1 billion remaining.","In fiscal 2019, we repurchased a total of 7.9 million shares for $185 million at an average price of $23.51. This includes approximately 3 million shares repurchased for $75 million during the fiscal fourth quarter. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase approach. Going forward, our capital allocation strategy will remain consistent. We will balance investments in the business to drive growth with capital returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, maintaining that balance as well as a strong liquidity profile will enable us to drive shareholder value over the long-term.","And in summary, I'm pleased with our performance this year. We delivered what we said we would and we're well-positioned as we begin the second year of our strategy. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and cash position allowing us to invest for future growth, while still returning capital to shareholders. And I'm excited about the acquisition of Wave and more broadly about the opportunity to drive sustainable growth in the future. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks Tony. To recap, we had a great year. We achieved our objectives for fiscal 2019 and delivered what we promised with financial results at the top end of our outlook ranges. With a successful start on our strategic journey in the books, I couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead. We've made significant improvements in our tax business and we'll continue to innovate and drive operational excellence and we're strengthening our growth trajectory with Wave, a great strategic acquisition. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Amanda?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Good morning Jeff and Tony. Tony, I just wanted to make sure I understood the EBITDA margin guidance. If not for the Wave Financial acquisition, would EBITDA margins increase, I guess if you could just give a little bit detail -- little bit more detail on how you are thinking about EBITDA margin guidance for FY 2020?","Tony Bowen","Yes, thanks you, Kartik. As we said, we do expect revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%. We do expect EBITDA dollars to increase in fiscal 2020. But given that revenue growth will outpace EBITDA growth, there will be slight degradation in EBITDA margin, but But still in the 24% to 26% range. Specific to your question about what would it have been without Wave, obviously Wave is operating at a loss and we\u2019re acquiring it at a loss and absorbing that into our EBITDA numbers. We're offsetting that with other expense reductions. It's hard to say what it would have been if we hadn't done Wave, we've obviously been working on this for several months and that's been a key component of our plan for this year. So there would've been a lot of other moving parts and probably other investments if we haven\u2019t went down the Wave path.","Kartik Mehta","Okay. So I guess whatever the losses that are in Wave, you are able to offset those with other actions you are taking at the corporate level. Is that fair?","Tony Bowen","That's exactly right.","Kartik Mehta","Okay. And then Jeff, as you look at the tax season and what you thought happened, do you think there is a need for further price investments or are you satisfied where you are and do you think now moving forward, you can get to a positive tax client comp?","Jeffrey Jones","Great question. So on the pricing component first, obviously there were two big pieces to this investment and this decision this year. One was strategically lowering prices for a select group of clients. The other was introducing the idea of upfront transparent pricing, which applied to everyone and really changed the conversation in the industry. We do not believe that we need to further reset prices, and remember we're not trying to be the low price provider. What was really important to do this year was to balance pricing investment with core value proposition changes in terms of quality, operational excellence, and how we market and communicate the benefits of H&R Block, all of those things working together. And as we continue to make these investments, ultimately we believe we can and will return to assisted client volume growth.","Obviously, three years in a row, we've been able to improve our trajectory. And when you isolate the impact of Free EZ this year, we were in line with the industry. So, we think we're on the right path. But just to reiterate, we do not believe we need to make further investments to reduce price.","Kartik Mehta","And then just one last question. Jeff, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about free solution as it concerns DIY, and I'm wondering your thoughts on all the conversations that happened and where H&R Block stands as far as your ability to offer the product and what's been set out there?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes thanks. The Free File Alliance Program is one of four ways that you can file for free at H&R Block, and it's a program that we've participated in for many years. This year at H&R Block, the Free File program grew about 8%, a little over 8% versus the Free File industry overall, grew about 6%. So we feel good about the program. We feel good about the consumer's ability to find and choose the Free File Alliance at H&R Block as evidenced by the growth rate that we saw this year.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks Kartik.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. Just wanted to go back to the tax season and the impact of tax reform specifically. I know and maybe you guys didn\u2019t say that, but there was some thought in the industry that we might see less of a shift from assisted to DIY this past year because of all the confusion over tax reform, and it sounds like we had another 60 basis point shift in line with historical. Do you think that there was any impact of tax reform on the shift? Do you think we'll see more of a shift next year as customers get used to with the new tax laws and thanks?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. Just to take one step backwards as we evaluated tax reform going back over a year ago, we have done our own historical look at each time there had been a major change to tax law over history, and obviously with our history we're able to look back a long time, and what we saw was never in history had there been a change to the tax law that created a significant shift in method type.","So, as we prepared for tax legislation changes, we had that as a backdrop. And I think when we look at this season there were a lot of interesting dynamics starting with tax reform, then the government shutdown. We saw a shift from assisted to DIY as you said consistent with what we've seen in the last four, five, six years. We didn't see it accelerate at all. And we saw consumers looking for help in lots of different ways as evidenced by our trajectory in assisted, as evidenced by our growth in things like Tax Pro Review where consumers were looking for advice and making sure that they were making the right choice whether it was choosing us to do their taxes or validating the work they had done themselves.","And we think that that ecosystem that we're building to serve consumers in so many different ways is a great way to make sure we're listening to the consumer and being able to respond to them again whether they have a simple question or want someone to do all the work for them.","Jeff Silber","So let me ask the question maybe another way or dig a little bit deeper. In looking at your 2020 guidance for revenue, what's implied on both the assisted side and the DIY side in terms of volume and pricing?","Tony Bowen","Yes, thanks Jeff. This is Tony. I mean I think our base expectation would be a continued shift in similar level to what we saw this year. Obviously, we don't know what every individual consumer will do. I mean every year you have switching from DIY to assisted and assisted to DIY, the net migration if you will has been a net move to DIY. This year we saw DIY category grow 3% to 4% which is in line with what we thought, assisted category was down slightly.","We think that as Jeff mentioned in his opening comments was partly due to more people filing extension which we think impacts the assisted side a little bit more. So that will work itself out as we go into the May to October filing season but next year, I think we would expect our base view would be the same as we went into this year which is a DIY category will grow faster than the assisted category and ultimately it'll be determined by people's confidence in how they file their taxes which taxes are still complex and people need help.","Jeff Silber","And on the pricing side for both methodologies?","Tony Bowen","So we haven't announced exactly what our pricing strategy will be for next year for competitive reasons but we do not intend to reset further in pricing.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Thanks so much for the color.","Tony Bowen","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas Allen","Hey good morning. Just on the Wave Financial acquisition, obviously it sounds like an exciting company. But could you just talk more about like why it makes sense to fit into H&R Block like what synergistic?","Jeffrey Jones","Absolutely. This is Jeff. Maybe Tony and I will tag team that. So the point I would start is as we talked about on prior quarters, the reviews that we've been doing about the other pieces of our portfolio we already have beyond taxes and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we served small businesses today at H&R Block in terms of tax preparation. And we also serve them today in terms of bookkeeping especially through our franchisees.","And so that fact combined with the macro conditions in terms of the growth of small businesses really suggested to us that there was more we could do to serve small businesses. We approached Wave months ago really attractive by a few things about that company. Number one is they're really designed for the small business owner. Their product is widely viewed as simple, easy to use and for people that aren't great at managing their financials, that attracted us, the product roadmap and consistent sense of innovation of introducing new products, how fast they've been acquiring new clients and their revenue growth trajectory. And finally, I would say they have a very unique business model which is the core accounting software platform is free.","Most small businesses today don't use anything. And so a free proposition is a great way to get them off the sidelines. We don't do that today. So we do more tax and some bookkeeping. It's a macro trend that makes sense to try to do more with and this company is really positioned well with the small business owner and there's essentially no duplication with what we do today. So sorry if that's a bit more detail but all those things together is why we're so excited.","Thomas Allen","Okay, helpful. And then just on the assisted Tax Pro side, can you just talk about what the competitive response was like to your lower pricing and maybe you\u2019ve been around loan programs some was offering and then how you expect that to trend next year? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones","Sure. So we went into the season there was some anxiety I think by people that what the competitive response may be. And we didn't really see a lot of competitive response to pricing. Keep in mind that many of our competitors were already priced lower than H&R Block. That was part of the gap that we were trying to close. But the way we were able to take such a complex topic simplifying down to five core prices and communicate to people that you would know that upfront was a heavy lift and we didn't really see the market change as a result of it.","With respect to refund advance, our core product this year had a maximum loan tier of $3,000 and that was interest and fee-free. And that was something we felt strongly about this year. We didn't see competitors offer a higher loan tiers and we saw competitors offer a higher loan tiers with tiered interest rates as the loan amount increased. So when you take all that together, we will absolutely evaluate as we always do as we make decisions for what we do next year.","Tony Bowen","The only other thing I would add Thomas is it looks like the overall number of loans in the industry was fairly flat which is consistent with our results, our number of applications and number of loans that we provided was also fairly consistent with the prior year. So despite there being more competitive offers in the marketplace, it looks like the total refund advance loans was fairly flat year-over-year.","Thomas Allen","Helpful. Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Thomas.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","Thanks. Good morning. Fiscal 2019 was an investment year for H&R Block from the perspective of pricing reductions and other technology and operational investments. Can you talk about how much of the technology and operational and marketing investments will carry over into next year?","Jeffrey Jones","Absolutely. Good morning, George. So a few areas as you mentioned the first pricing. Again just to reiterate that's a one-year investment in price and we came in really where we expected and that will continue as we move forward. Operational excellence has a number of investments including things like optimizing our footprint. And that actually came in $15 million to $20 million better than expected. Technology has four or five dimensions of our investment in technology. Those are all multi-year investments and we do expect for the next couple of years to continue to invest at an accelerated rate as we talked about last year, no change there.","We're making great progress on the IT roadmap. Our investment and work in building our omnichannel tax engine is ahead of schedule and so we feel very good about the progress, the technology team is making and marketing finally this year, a combination of we have a number of new things introduced, the success that we saw and our ability to acquire customers with performance marketing and frankly the delay in the season all caused an elevated investment this year moving forward for next year, all of that's contemplated in the outlook we provided.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. You've previously indicated that long-term EBITDA margins will likely not return to historical highs due to needs to invest in the business. Can you help frame what longer term EBITDA margins might look like given the work that you've done around required investments in the business?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, as Tony mentioned this year, set Wave aside, we would have seen some small increases in EBITDA dollars. I mean we're absolutely focused on growing EBITDA dollars in margin expansion over time. We're not providing a long-term outlook in EBITDA margins today are reiterating that we think 27% to 30% probably isn't a level we're trying to get back to really just a reflection of continuing to invest to drive growth in the business and serve the consumer in new ways. But 24% to 26% for next year, we feel good about over time growing EBITDA dollars and with more growth ultimately being able to expand EBITDA margins as well.","George Tong","Very helpful, thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good morning everyone. First one I'd like to ask the H&R Block clearly took share in the Do It Yourself category this year, another large player also appeared to, Jeff could you comment on what you see as far as share going forward and this is really a question about the smaller players in the industry and feel free to loop in anything with the free filers discussion that you addressed little bit earlier? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, it's obviously we took share as you mentioned into took share as well. It's hard to know for sure all the players at this stage until we have all the full IRS data, Credit Karma likely gained a small amount of share and so we'll pay close attention as the IRS publishes all the final data about who exactly did what. But if I just take a step back, our investment in our DIY product is really focused on three simple parts of the strategy continuing to make the product better and better and ensuring that consumers know about it.","And we believe that we have a great value proposition and we'll continue to ensure that we maintain the right price advantage versus the market leader and that consumers know that there is a great alternative to others that have been used to. So the combination of those three things have really made a difference year-over-year and we'll continue to follow that strategy.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. And then my follow-up is two parter, Jeff, for you to start, please and then Tony to finish I'll ask it altogether. When in a prior question, Jeff you mentioned it sounds like it's still going to be a while before you can give a longer term view of what block may look like in three or four years. I realize it's still early days in this investment process. When do you think you might get a feel for a long-term margin comfort, the return on the investments that you're making, thoughts for that. Just on the timing and the future when we may get that and then obviously you mentioned there's four or five dimensions to IT and this Wave acquisition comes in not really core tax but a complementary business.","So Tony if you\u2019d kind of hop on the end of Jeff comments and talk about free cash flow and capital spend for this upcoming year fiscal 2020 with obviously the increased dividend and the spend on Wave, just a discussion of the cash position over the course of this year and what may be left over for repurchases and or other investments. Sorry for the long multipart question but would love to get an answer.","Jeffrey Jones","I'll see if I can keep up with all the pieces. Let me just start with that. In the past, we were really anchored on an EBITDA margin level that reflected the fact that we just weren't investing in the business. So we reset to 24% to 26%. And when I look at the performance of our business in just year one, our ability to deliver that range invest in the business for long-term and we returned capital to shareholders and share repurchase and a dividend increase. That's a really nice combination of elements that we were able to deliver and we want to continue to do that.","Obviously, the investments we're making are in order to enable growth. So we believe we have to return to growing clients which means growing volume which means top line growth which means higher EBITDA dollars and we're more focused on doing that now than trying to pick an EBITDA margin range for some date in the future. And so we'll continue to stay close with you all as we move into year two and year three at the strategy. But I feel so good about how we executed year one, the plans we've put in place for year two and obviously the Wave acquisition gives us a new dimension to the strategy to both accelerate and expand work against small businesses and I\u2019ll let Tony tag team.","Tony Bowen","Yes, thanks Scott. Our cash flow generation as I mentioned in my opening comments is still really strong. We ended the year with more cash than we have and probably the last four or maybe even five years with $1.6 billion at the end of the year. So even after the acquisition of Wave, we feel really good about rising the dividend and we still have plenty of cash flow to acquire shares opportunistically and that was our approach. This year we bought about $185 million in the open market. We'll continue to have that approach going into next year and still have plenty of flexibility. In addition to the cash on balance sheet, we have a $2 billion line of credit that still has four years remaining until its maturity. So lots of liquidity to do it, we need to fund future investments for growth, return capital through dividends and share repurchases.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks, appreciate it guys.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Scott.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Alex Paris of Barrington Research. Your line is open.","Chris Howe","Good morning. This is Chris Howe sitting in for Alex.","Jeffrey Jones","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Howe","Good morning. I had two questions. The first one is on Wave. Can you comment on the timing of the deal. What was attractive to its timing now. And were there any other bidders for the business. And in relation to Wave, you mentioned it will be accretive longer term and can you comment around their customer distribution, the geographic distribution of their customers versus yours and how you envision their 400,000 small business customers moving into H&R Block or vice versa?","Jeffrey Jones","Sure, Chris. I\u2019ll kick it off and see if we catch all those pieces. So the timing of the deal was just what the timing was. We approached them months ago in the context of us doing this review of the assets we had inside H&R Block already, there were no other bidders, they weren't for sale. And so we began conversations which resulted in today and today was just how the timing worked out. There was no magic about that is just how it all converged but there were no other bidders. And it all began with conversations with them several months ago. I\u2019ll let Tony tag team on here with me.","Tony Bowen","Yes, thanks Chris. So when you look at their customers today at 400,000 that we referenced in the opening comments about 60% of those are in North America. And as you would expect, the vast majority of those are in the U.S. with the remainder in Canada. They're only monetizing and charging for product features today in North America. So the 40% that set outside of North America today are using the product and are very happy with it. And it's entirely free. There's definitely an opportunity to roll out payments and some of the other features they have in North America and those other countries as they kind of build out their future product roadmap.","As far as opportunities for us to cross-sell, H&R Block services. I mean the reason, larger reason people are doing accounting for their small business is for tax reasons. And while that's why we think the strategic fit makes so much sense. You're doing it for kind of two reasons, one cash flow and the other one for tax reasons. Today they offer no tax services to speak their clients are currently asking for tax help throughout the year both with quarterly filings as well as year-end tax preparation. So we know there's going to be an opportunity down the road to put our capabilities together with theirs to serve their clients in additional ways.","Chris Howe","That's great. That's very helpful. I have lots of questions but one more question about H&R Block excluding Wave. You mentioned the new client growth that you're seeing within Tax Pro, the Review product as well as Tax Pro Go. With the accretion that you're seeing in new clients and the tremendous growth here. What\u2019s your outlook on retention of these clients. You mentioned Tax Pro Go has a younger higher income. I assume some of these new clients have a higher flight risk given their experimentation with a new tax service. Can you just comment on how you retain these clients going into next tax season?","Jeffrey Jones","Absolutely. So just again to frame the products that you're referencing that\u2019s in the Virtual platform and the way that we thought about this is for most of history, the consumer really had two choices. And so as we build these products to allow them to access different degrees of help in digital ways, we think that attracts new people to the brand. We know the brand is well known it\u2019s highly trusted for taxes.","And so we're now able to help people access us in new ways, this year when you remove the impact of Free EZ, we saw modest increases in retention in both DIY and in the assisted channel. And one of the things that we're paying close attention to is given the significant increases and positive client feedback from their experience this year how that might translate into retention for next year. Obviously that's an unknown but because of the significant improvements in what clients told us about their experience of H&R Block, we go into next year optimistic about what could happen to retention.","Chris Howe","Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Mario Cortellacci","Hey this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah.","Jeffrey Jones","How are you?","Mario Cortellacci","Hey, how are you? Could you just walk us through how you think about your digital marketing, in terms of your digital market share today I guess where that can go in the future. I know you've been doing a lot of work in your brand awareness and digital and just want to see if you can give us an update on I guess what your brand awareness is in digital as of today and then maybe I don't know outside of your satisfaction scores or NPS, are you able to quantify any of the benefits that you've experienced from the big marketing push this year?","Tony Bowen","Thanks Mario, this is Tony. So we gained market share this year in DIY as we shared, this is the third consecutive year of gaining that market share. So we feel like we're on a nice trend to continue to grow and as Jeff said, there's only two parts of the strategy that will continue and we don't see any reason why that market share gains will kind of happen next year and into the future. I just totally lost my train of thought.","Jeffrey Jones","Just on the benefits of the marketing push, we'll tag team a bit. There are several new things about the approach to marketing this year at the highest level was a move away from advertising national promotions and instead advertising what we think are the core elements of our value proposition, upfront transparent pricing. How that\u2019s translated to what we call Price Preview and the DIY channel, also more about expertise and care things that make H&R Block differentiated and great. And so at the highest level we improved awareness of our DIY channel. We're only going to continue to be surprised by how much opportunity there is, people still don't know that H&R Block offers software and online products, we continue to work against that and then our performance marketing channels.","We've talked a lot about last year which is our ability to get very granular in targeting micro segments of consumers and delivering unique messages just to them. And we saw meaningful increases in traffic to hrblock.com which is really the starting point for those conversion to online and conversion to make an appointment in an office. So we're able to watch that from the funnel of awareness through traffic, through conversion and saw great improvements across the board.","Mario Cortellacci","Great. And just want to touch on the Wave acquisition, I mean just trying to understand the -- I guess what the return profile would look like versus I mean for you buying a company like Wave versus building something internally with the H&R Block brand behind it. Maybe you can walk us through your thought process or why you chose one versus the other, it could've been timing but maybe you can talk about returns as well?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, I think obviously we don't underestimate how hard it can be to start from scratch building a software platform that's both this complex, this expansive and one of the things they've done extraordinarily well is keep it so simple and user friendly. And so they have an incredible product and engineering team, they've been working on this for nine years.","And so we just saw given all the things I said earlier, I won't repeat about why we were so excited about what they had done that it was just a better way to accelerate how we expand, what we offer to small business owners starting from scratch would just be a completely different profile than we just thought this was by far the best choice.","Tony Bowen","And Mario, I mean they've got a proven customer acquisition model that it's well on its way at a cost of acquisition per customer that's very, very attractive as we said 80% of the customers coming to Wave, and it\u2019s quite organically which is really phenomenal in this part of the category. When we look at the return, we expect revenue to obviously continue to grow at an aggressive pace and as they continue to grow revenue, they're going to continue to fund investments to drive additional revenue opportunities but they will turn profitable some date in the future which we have built into our model and the overall ROI will be a really strong benefit to H&R Block and our shareholders.","Mario Cortellacci","Great, thank you guys.","Tony Bowen","Thank you, Mario.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open.","Michael Millman","Thank you. Several questions. Why do you think that tax returns this past season were flat. You're saying people aren\u2019t doing this much or buying -- thinking that they can get away with more. So secondly on the tax, do you have a concern that this is the more tax payers see that with little help they could do it themselves that they will turn to do it themselves. Could you tell us what your cost savings are expected to be this year and from what source could you -- in terms of Wave what is their R&D and how do they compete with Intuit who spends a huge amount on R&D and AI specifically and exactly what seems to be exactly the same market? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks Michael, it's Jeff. I think we've got five or six things that we'll tick through. I think at the top of the list, I think we saw even though we don't know official data from the IRS yet, we saw pretty significant extension filing this year and so we think that drove a lot of what created the industry to be flat. I think there were questions about outcomes. There was ","delay to the tax season, a number of things that caused an increase in extension filing.","So that's our belief on the first point, your second question about this migration to DIY, you just rewind a little bit prior to tax reform, the lion's share of American taxpayers took the standard deduction and that was even more at H&R Block and so post tax reform, we still saw people lion\u2019s share who now qualify for the standard deduction and so we continue to believe and hear it from our clients constantly that even when we might judge their tax situation to be simple, they are not confident with the topic of taxes.","And there's really two things we hear consistently one is I want to get everything I deserve. And number two is I'm afraid I'll get in trouble if I get it wrong. And those are two consumer truths that have been true over time. And keep in mind for someone who qualifies for the standard deduction, they also likely are eligible for various credits. That process of understanding and filing for those credits is completely unchanged. And so that adds a level of knowledge and detail that for many, many people is just they'd rather have help. That said there is 50 bps shift and that's been consistent year-over-year over-year which is why we're also investing to have a great DIY product and value proposition and ensure that consumers have choices between those two. So that kind of represents the full spectrum and what we think we saw this year.","Tony Bowen","And specific to your question on cost savings, I mean there's a number of moving parts because you can imagine a couple of buckets. One would be the office closures that we did in FY 2019. It\u2019s a one-time cost, it's rolling off. So that's going to be kind of a benefit year-over-year. We're also starting to see some save on the IT side. There's some data centers that we're able to close down as we migrate to the cloud. Obviously we're continuing to invest broadly in IT but there\u2019s definitely specific parts that are starting to provide a return.","And then specific to your question on R&D for Wave, obviously they\u2019re fraction of the size of QuickBooks and we\u2019re not trying to show that this product is head to head with that market leader. But we do have a 200 plus team that is providing and building the great product and we think, based on user feedback and the surveys and research that we\u2019ve done that the product is robust, the users are very happy with the experience and they continue to invest in building out those capabilities for future both revenue and product features.","So it\u2019s a product that\u2019s been around for nine years since its inception in 2010 and it\u2019s continuing to add team members to invest in R&D both in Artificial Intelligence to do auto-categorization of different expenses and there\u2019s a number of features that the product provides today and we\u2019ll continue to get better over time.","Jeffrey Jones","If I have my data right, there is $28 million, $29 million, $30 million small businesses in U.S. and North America and just a few million currently use a product, QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks Self-Employed. So the vast majority of the market today is not using any product and one of the things we love about Wave\u2019s value proposition is the core accounting software being free is the great way for a small business owner to get off the sidelines and try something and we\u2019ve just seen over time once a user tries Wave\u2019s product, we see great retention over time.","So with everything Tony said being true, we also like the size of the market and the fact that most small business owners today are using nothing.","Michael Millman","Can you give us an ideas, what the R&D expenses are? And will Block support them or contribute to that expenditures?","Tony Bowen","Yes, Michael, I mean as we shared the revenue that we\u2019re expecting to pick-up for the nine months if we own them in FY 2020 would be $40 million to $45 million. We talked about their operating loss including transaction expenses being $25 million to $30 million. So that would give you a sense of kind of what the P&L looks like specific to Wave.","Michael Millman","Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Colby Brown for the closing remarks.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Amanda and thank you everyone for joining. This will conclude today\u2019s call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Colby Brown, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Colby Brown","Thank you, Michele. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2019 third quarter results. On the call today are Jeff Jones, our President and CEO; and Tony Bowen, our CFO. We've posted today\u2019s press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Also on the website you will find a link to the webcast containing today's presentation which will be posted after this call.","Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconcile the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'll remind everyone that this call will include forward looking statements as defined under the securities laws.

During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a followup, after which, they may choose to jump back into the queue.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you, Colby. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With the first half of the season behind us, we are pleased with our performance and continue to be excited about the strategic changes we are making. Feedback from our clients regarding the improvements to our services and products, including our new upfront transparent pricing has been fantastic. We're continuing to lead the industry in the virtual space with new offerings and an improved client experience. And while the season has gotten off to a slow start for the entire industry, we are seeing volumes pick up and are focused on executing for the second half.","Before I jump into the details, let me outline the areas we will cover on today's call. first, I'll provide our perspectives on what we have seen in the industry, then I will talk about our performance and expectations for the second half of the season, finally tell you where we view our third quarter financial results and thoughts on our fiscal year outlook.","Starting with what we've seen in the overall industry, the latest results from the IRS show a decline in returns of 3.5% on a day-to-day basis in February 22. While it is typical to see declines at this point in the season, this year the industry has been impacted by slower than normal start due to uncertainty surrounding both the government shutdown and the tax law changes.","Consistent with recent years, industry results through February show a change in mix from assisted to DIY. Early-season filers are more likely to change tax preparation methods, so the change in their early season is typically greater and then moderates in the second half, and at this point the industry mix shift is in line with the average of the last five years and is not accelerating due to tax reform.","Over the past several weeks the industry has been catching up to the slow start and the industry mix has been normalizing as expected. For these reasons we continue to expect overall industry returns to increase approximately 1% with assisted category volume flat to slightly up and the remainder of the industry growth coming in DIY. In other words the shift from assisted to DIY will remain moderate at levels similar to the last several years.","Turning to our performance, we've made significant improvement this season in how we serve our clients. As a reminder, we announced this strategy in June and provided more detail on our Q1 and Q2 calls including our key objectives by channel. To recap, in our assisted business we focused on improving the value we deliver while developing a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block.","In DIY we made investments to improve the product and grow awareness while pricing competitively to deliver tremendous value. And in virtual we continue to innovate leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. We have made progress toward each of these objectives this season which are not just about producing results this year. They represent important steps to set us up for success over time.","In assisted, we've made significant improvements across every aspect of the business from field operations to pricing. Starting with price, as we detailed last quarter we made meaningful changes to improve our value proposition by addressing what was a significant pain point for our clients. We did this in two ways; by investing in price decreases for certain segments of our clients, and by making our prices up front and transparent. This new pricing structure enables consumers to know the price before they begin as well as throughout the entire process. No mystery, no surprises, and no hidden fees.","The feedback from our clients and our tax pros has exceeded our expectations. Tax pros have indicated that upfront transparent pricing helps them serve clients and alleviates the often uncomfortable price discussion at the end of the process. And the response from our clients has been even better as we've seen a 7 point improvement in our client satisfaction scores when asked about price for value.","Many of you may be wondering about the overall level of price decrease given the increase in our net average charged through the first half of the tax season. This increase was expected and is attributable to the elimination of the Free Federal 1040EZ promotion. In addition, many of the targeted price decreases will occur in the second half. So we continue to expect an overall decline in net average charged by the end of the season which Tony will discuss later in the call.","Of course we've done much more than change our pricing models. We've focused on enhancing the experience for new clients and have put significant effort behind tax pro training and system enhancements to better showcase our expertise. Nearly one third of our tax pros have increase their certification levels and all of our pros through specialized training to help clients understand the impacts of tax law change and plan for the future. And it's shown as the feedback clients have provided around our expertise has improved significantly.","Our focus on operational execution is also having a positive impact. By driving improvements in the quality and consistency of service delivery in our offices we're doing a better job of scheduling the right tax pros at the right time and are converting clients at a greater rate.","Moving on to our Tax Plus products, we're pleased with our early-season results. Refund Advance, our no fee, interest free loan continues to provide compelling value as nearly 1 million clients took advantage of this offer. And overall attach rates have increased for our other Tax Plus products as they continue to be an important aspect of the benefits we provide to our clients.","The changes we have made have resulted in great feedback from our clients. In fact, our assisted NPS has increased 8 full points making it clear that we're executing on our plans. And when excluding the impact of Free EZ we estimate that our assisted return volume was comparable to the industry.","Moving to DIY, we've made a number of significant improvements to our product this year which are translating to very strong performance. We have improved the experience for mobile users giving more visibility to where they are in the process. We continue to leverage data to make our products smarter and more personalized. This has allowed us to reduce the number of screens the client sees and in some cases reduced the number of questions they need to answer by more than half.","We have redesigned our Help Center leveraging machine learning to deliver highly targeted responses and resolving over half of supported inquiries within the tool. We've also taken price transparency to another level for the DIY consumer by launching price preview, so clients know in real time when their price changes and why starting a new expectation in the industry. Collectively these efforts have translated into strong results. Conversion is up over 2 full points from the prior year.","Growth in mobile has been outstanding and we continue to see increased adoption. Our product continues to receive accolades including the Editor's Choice Award from PC Magazine. And as the sign that we're delighting our clients we've increased our NPS a full 8 points compared to last year. Given these results it is no surprise the DIY client volumes has increased over 6% through February 28 and we're on our way to taking share for the third straight year.","Finally, we are innovating by creating a new third platform in the industry we call virtual tax. As a reminder, we now have three distinct products that fit between the physical assisted and DIY online businesses making H&R Block the only company to be able to serve consumers no matter how little or how much help they want.","Our first virtual product, Tax Pro Go, is the easiest way for consumers to have someone prepare their taxes for them. After uploading documents to a secure portal and being matched to a tax pro based on their needs the consumer simply waits for the work to be done for them. H&R Block is the only major brand offering this type of mobile first assisted experience for consumers. This year was the national introduction of Tax Pro Go and it is attracting new younger clients to the brand.","Additionally, our client satisfaction scores and feedback indicate that we have a winning proposition. We will continue to improve the experience and ensure consumers are aware of this breakthrough offering in the industry. ","Our next virtual product, Tax Pro Review is for the DIY consumer who wants an expert review before submitting their return. The consumer completes their tax return using our DIY online product and then one of our tax pros reviews their work and source documents and then signs and e-files for them. We've done a much better job of helping our clients understand the benefits of this product and the results have been strong. In fact the growth rate for Tax Pro Review has outpaced our overall growth in DIY.","Finally, this year we launched our third virtual product called Ask a Tax Pro. This is designed for the DIY consumer that wants instant access to their questions. With the push of a button the consumer is connected to a tax pro within one minute. Using voice or chat as well as screen sharing the consumer has unlimited access to their tax pros for help while preparing their own taxes.","Based on the accessibility of our tax pros, our expertise, and our price, we believe Ask a Tax Pro is the best live product for those DIY filers who want help along the way. It has been encouraging to see the one third of the clients using this service are new to H&R Block and the feedback we've received has been positive. In the second half of the season we will enhance the user experience and ensure more DIY consumers are aware of this outstanding offering.","Not only do these three virtual products offer consumers modern solutions in tax preparation, they begin to enable H&R Block to optimize our labor, attract new consumer store brand, and provide trade up opportunities for those consumers who are DIY filers due to price, but are fully comfortable doing taxes themselves.","Finally, our marketing efforts have been quite effective so far this year. We're engaging with consumers in new ways and driving those who are more likely to become clients to our website. By using real-time targeted messaging we're seen better linkage between our brand and our core qualities of expertise and care which is leading to stronger brand consideration.","To wrap up, we are pleased with our progress this season. The changes we are making are having a positive impact and will position us for success in the years ahead. We're leading the industry by offering upfront transparent pricing and by taking our virtual offerings to a new level. And while we're pleased with the progress, we aren\u2019t satisfied. We know there is much more we can accomplish as we focus on finishing the season strong and looking to the future.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our quarterly financial results and outlook for fiscal '19.","Tony Bowen","Thanks Jeff. Good morning everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q3 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal third quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, third quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.","Starting with revenues, we saw a year-over-year decrease of $20 million or 4% to $468 million [ph]. This is primarily the result of the delay in the overall industry filings which shifted business out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter.","Turing to expense, total operating expenses increased $21 million or 4% to $606 million. This was primarily due to planned technology spend related to our long-term strategic initiatives as well as expenses related to marketing, bad debt and supply.","Moving through the remainder of the income statement, we saw interest expense decrease $2 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. The changes in revenue and expenses resulted in an increase in pretax loss from continuing operations of $38 million. Loss per share however improved from $1.16 to $0.58 due to prior year impact of corporate tax rate changes.","Turning to discontinued operations, there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to the disclosures and the company's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and SEC filings.","Turning to capital, our priorities remain unchanged. We first focus on maintaining adequate liquidity to fund the business. Next we look to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. We then fund our dividend and which we have done consistently since going public. And finally, we look to opportunistically return capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and as a minimum plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants. Year-to-date we have repurchased a total of $4.7 million shares for $109 million. This includes approximately 500,000 shares repurchased for $12 million during the fiscal third quarter.","I'd now like to provide thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, our outlook for fiscal 2019 is driven by our investments in three key areas; price, technology, and operational excellence, each of which have positioned us for long term growth. And overall, we continue to expect results in line with the outlook we provided in December. Given the variable at play this season, I thought it would be helpful to provide a little more color on our expectations of return volume in net average charge.","For the full year we expect overall client growth driven by DIY offset by assisted. Specific to assisted the client declines and improvement in net average charge from the first half of the season were expected due to the discontinuation of the free 1040EZ promotion. For the second half we are anticipating return growth due to our improved value proposition related to the new pricing structure and other client experience enhancements. However, we anticipate a decline in net average charge in the second half as price decreases for certain assisted consumer segments were weighted more to the back half of the season. The net result for the full year is a decline in both assisted clients and net average charge.","Moving to DIY, for the first half of the season we saw client growth driven by the product improvements and increasing conversion that Jeff discussed earlier. Net average charge was slightly lower in the first half as we continue to price competitively in this category. We anticipate this client growth to continue in the second half and net average charge to increase due to improved mix. So for the full year we anticipate growing DIY client and taking share and for net average charge to be flat to slightly up.","Turning to the income statement, we are reiterating the outlook we provided the last few quarters as we continue to expect total consolidated revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion dollars and EBITDA margin of 24% to 26%. In our corporate taxes, our expected long-term rate remains at 23% to 25%. However, there are pending discrete items that could occur during the fourth quarter that will lower our fiscal '19 rate 4 to 5 points. The remainder of our fiscal outlook remained largely unchanged with depreciation and amortization of $165 million to $175 million, capital expenditures of $95 million to $105 million and interest expense of $85 million to $90 million.","In summary, we're executing against our plans and are on track to achieve our financial goals for the year. I'm extremely pleased with the progress we're making. We have a great plan in place for long-term sustainable growth and we've taken the initial steps this season.","With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks Tony. To wrap up, I want to thank our tax professionals, franchisees and associates, who are living our purpose of providing help and inspiring confidence in our clients and communities and are doing a great job of executing against the initiatives that we put in place ahead of the season. Their dedication and the feedback we have received from our client gives us reason to be excited for the remainder of the season.","We're keenly focused on executing in the second half to deliver on our financial outlook. We've made numerous improvements across all aspects of our business and we continue to innovate positioning us not only for this season, but for the long-term. And while we are just at the beginning of our journey, we are taking the right steps toward long-term growth in clients, revenue and earnings, and ultimately creating value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more when we report our full year results in June.","With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Michelle?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Thomas Allen","Hey, good morning everyone. So Jeff, I find your comments all very positive, I mean the net promoter score improvements are great. I guess, as we think about your guidance with all these kind of positive things going on why wouldn\u2019t you increase your guidance for the year, kind of what's keeping you a little bit cautious?","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks for your comment very much. I mean on the net promoter score real quickly, we're very, very pleased in fact as we look back historically we don\u2019t think we've ever seen these kind of improvements in the amount of time we've seen it, so clients are responding favorably. There are lots of pieces of the puzzle here where we're still about to enter a very competitive part of the season. We think when you remove free EZ we're about consistent with the industry. We hope to finish just slightly down in assisted clients, continuing that trajectory we've been on for a few years.","But there's still a lot more we see we can do to improve across how we execute in offices, continuing to improve the experience in DIY, making sure consumers really understand the shift in value proposition as we reduce our dependency on promotions which we've done more of in the past. So yes, we're reaffirming our outlook because we like the momentum we're seeing, but we also know that there are a lot of things that we're doing brand new this year for the first time and we still see room for improvement.","Thomas Allen","That's helpful, thank you. And then just my followup question, there was an article out earlier this week about long wait times for virtual products. Is that a problem that the industry is seeing and you specifically? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones","So our live product, we call Ask a Tax Pro and we're seeing consistently able to connect to a tax pro within one minute. We do have room to improve in how the co-browsing experience works, which is one of the things we know we can do better in screen sharing for the second half, but one of the things that we really love about this space is, we have a network of 100,000 tax pros and so what we're really doing is activating them with a layer of technology and because of that it enables us to optimize our labor more and so that ability to connect fast to a tax pro is something we feel good about.","Thomas Allen","Helpful. Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, Thomas.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Hey, good morning. Jeff, I know you talked a little bit about the 1040EZ and you had indicated you were anticipating losing some because of the pricing dynamics for this year. I'm wondering just as a reference point what percentage of 1040EZ you have the loss from last year?","Jeffrey Jones","Hey Kartik, good morning. So we don't break out by form type or client type exactly, but when we look at where we've seen the early season decline obviously the industry is late for everybody, so that's playing into things. But we really see that losing the free EZ promotion, we are losing the clients at the rate we expected we would. It's why we feel good about the other strategies that we've put in place that it's easy to say this but if we isolate the free EZ decline we feel good that we're keeping pace with the industry and that's really what we're most focused on right now.","Kartik Mehta","So for, Jeff just so I understand, for the rest of the season for March and April would you expect that your results would be internally better than what the IRS reports because we're probably through the 1040EZ season?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, so the 1040EZ promotion ended on the 28, and so 28th last year sorry. So we're past that period. So we expect to be comparable with the industry as we move into the back half. There's a lot of things that we're focused on as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that's when our investment in price for more clients will kick in. So the combination of the operational momentum, the investment in price declines, upfront pricing, all of that as things we're feeling good about we think we'll finish comparable to the industry in assisted. Tony, do you want to add anything?","Tony Bowen","Yes, I'll just Kartik add on to that. As you know the assisted category specifically is fairly delayed, I think 2(22) (e) the IRS is showing down almost 7% in assisted. So we still expect I think as well as you do in your recent write up that we're going to end at essentially flat to slightly up on the assisted category. So we'll obviously carry that momentum with us going into the second half.","Kartik Mehta","And then Jeff, just one last question. As you look at the results of franchisees are performing better and that's usually the case. I'm wondering as you've looked at the results or why do you think the franchise operations perform better than the company and what, is there anything to take away from that that you could implement in the company operations, so that they both could be similar?","Jeffrey Jones","So, just a broad comment first, I mean, I've spent a lot of time with our franchisees and I always believe there's opportunity to learn from how they execute for sure. I think in particular right now, even though franchisees participated in free EZ last year, not all of them did. And so the impact of elimination of free EZ had less impact on the franchise performance so far this year. So that's part of it. And then they're able to set their own pricing. So when you look at map differences you know we had very wide adoption of our pricing structure, but actual price points have varied a bit across the country which is their discretion. So I think the combination of those two things have really been what's driving that difference in performance so far this year.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks Kartik.","Operator","You next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good morning. Could you guys please discuss the dynamic in RAL this year. How would you assess the performance at H&R Block relative to your expectations? And then just kind of a view of how their play in the broader industry? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Good morning Scott. This is Tony. Overall we're pleased with the number of RAL applications we have, the overall approval rates. The average loan amount was up a little over 9%. So, obviously trending in the right direction, a really good benefit for our clients. As you know there were a number of competitors in this space that were offering higher loan amounts for a fee. We feel really good about the fact that we stayed interest free, no fees for our customers which is really how we launched this product a few years ago and we were consistent with that execution this year.","We'll see how this plays out over the next several years. Some individuals are definitely looking for the largest loan amount, but you do have to have a credible refund to be able to qualify for some of the loan amounts that are being advertised out in the marketplace. We'll continue to look at it every single year. But we feel really good about how we executed this year.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks Tony. Similar question and Jeff primarily for you, the transparency offering from H&R Block this year, how do you expect it to be different in the second half or received differently in the second half versus the first half, just based on the type of customer with whom you meet? And then kind of the second and third part of the question are, what has been the competitive reaction and what do you see in future tax seasons for the industry at store fronts? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","All right Scott. Thanks I'll try to pick through those. So second half versus first half, I mean one of the things that we're paying close attention to is just how much does the market even know we're doing this. Right? It's a brand new idea. It's new to the industry. We're actively marketing it and we'll continue to actively market it as we get into the second half. We know from our research that it's a very compelling message when consumers hear it. It creates a lot of interest in the brand which we're seeing translate into website traffic et cetera.","Actual implementation of pricing, many of the investments we made in lowering prices are for more second half clients, working families, individuals with just more involved lifestyles and more situations where we thought we had an opportunity to really deliver more value for them. And so, that will be a big difference is we think more consumers will have lower prices in the second half which is reflected in the narrative we talked about.","I'm on the on the road a lot in offices with tax pros and the thing that I just feel so good about is the feedback from the field about, it just removes the really hard conversation that tax pros don't love to have. They like to focus on serving clients not on dealing with price and so I think the combination of lower prices for more of our target consumers, continuing to make sure the marketplace knows this as part of our value prop and then just continuing to help tax pros learn it and get more comfortable with it are all three things we expect to see in the second half versus first.","Scott Schneeberger","That covered the first part well, sorry for the three part, yes just kind of how did we, how does it feel vis-\u00e0-vis others in the industry and then what do you see in future tax seasons? Thanks.","Jeffrey Jones","Yes. So an important thing I want to reiterate is, we are not trying to be the low price provider. As we've talked over my year and a half year, this is really about resetting price to enable our total value proposition to be realized. And so, because the variety of what our competitive set looks like, it's hard to just say it's our price versus their price, but in general we believe that competitive pricing was already lower than H&R Block. And so from that standpoint there really hasn't been a difference and we haven't actually seen with our field network to this point any competitive response.","We have seen with the branded competitors, promotions of cash to switch, those types of things, but not fundamental shifts in pricing structure. And I think your third was more about the future and I'm just going to ask you to hold until we get through the season. We'll have a lot to debrief, both how we're executing it in assisted, in virtual, and in DIY, assess how well we performed overall and make decisions for next year and the future.","Scott Schneeberger","Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Assisted tax volumes declined 6.5% at HRB through February 28. Can you discuss how much you estimate industry volumes declined by over the same period and internally how much of HRB's decline you would attribute to the government shutdown versus elimination of the 1040 EZ promotion versus other factors?","Tony Bowen","Yes, good morning George. I'll take that. I think the easiest way to think about it is to compare our data through the same date that the IRS released. Let me just walk you through what those numbers look like. So in assisted their 2(22) (e) file data IRS was down 6.7%, H&R Block would have been down 8.9%. So it's about a 2 point difference. And as we said in our opening comments we think that difference is entirely due to the elimination of the free EZ promotion. So if we hadn't had the free EZ headwind we essentially would have been in line with the IRS.","The 6.7 through 2(22) (e) is on a day to day basis, again we expect the overall assisted industry to essentially end flat by the end of the year to slightly up. So we've got a pretty big tailwind going into the second half as we - two things happen, one we adjust for day-to-day to day-to-day which obviously is just a calendar thing, and then there is some level of delay\/uncertainty tax reform other things that's causing people to file a little bit slower. And when we look at it you're not talking weeks of delay but just a few days can obviously have a pretty big impact on the results. So again, we think it's just timing. The industry will catch up. It is just a matter of matter getting to more margin through the end of the season.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. And for my followup, the net average charge for assisted increased 3.9% through February 28, which I think you said reflects the elimination of the 1040 EZ. Can you talk about how much assisted pricing declined by excluding this impact and how tax reform has affected your pricing from a mix perspective?","Jeffrey Jones","Yes, I don't want to share the exact number, but obviously the tax reform changes and the increase in the standard deduction were all contemplated in our new pricing model that we rolled out this year. They were also contemplated on our overall revenue guidance which included that our NAC expectations for the year and were essentially on track with where we expect to be.","Again, we said in the second half net average charge will be down as is the later season filers who are getting the larger price decreases come into the offices, as well as we won't have the NAC benefit from the elimination of free EZ which drove \u2013 in the entire increase for the year we will be down in net average charge, but we're not guiding to the specific amount. It's more tied up in overall revenue outlook.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks, George.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Alex Paris from Barrington Research. Your line is open.","Chris Howe","Good morning. This is Chris Howe sitting in for Alex. I had one topic here and then one follow up. Yes, you had mentioned earlier just about your improvements in leveraging data, the reduction that you're seeing in screens and questions. How should we assess the growth that you're seeing here in regard to client acquisition, client retention? Have these changes or improvements been reactive or would you say more proactive? And how much room is there to grow as far as simplifying the product for the consumer?","Jeffrey Jones","This is Jeff, I'll kick it off and see if Tony wants to add anything. I think you know specifically in our DIY product I just think great product management is constantly improving the experience, constantly removing friction in steps and always trying to make it easier. The team last year saw really clear feedback in our client surveys around pricing, around steps in the experience and around the ability to get help. And so, they very directly tackled all three of those things. And I think that's why we continue to see the consumer feedback, improve the way it is and the volume improved the way it is.","If you just take a step back, our strategy in DIY broadly is very simple. We want to continue to have a great product that gets recognized by third parties. We want to actively market the product, so people know we're in the business, and we want to price very aggressively. And so the combination of those three things is what we continue to do. It's driving great results and it's what you'll see us continue to do as we move into the second half as well. Sorry, for my cold guys. But I'll let Tony pilot if you want.","Chris Howe","Okay. And then I had just one quick follow up here. Regardless of where you are in your tax journey, it seems H&R Block has a product suited for you, as you move from Ask a Tax Pro with some of the new virtual products that you've introduced, have you seen any material shift or a migration on-premise assisted customers moving towards the Review product or should I think of these as different product or segment to look at?","Jeffrey Jones","Our introduction of each of the products has really been about a different use case and so that is how we're going to market with each of the different ones. And I think you've summarized the range well. When I look at the industry, when I arrived it was an industry that basically forced people to two extreme ends of the spectrum. Either you wanted a lot of help or you had to do it yourself.","Obviously we have a lot of confidence in the work under way to improve assisted side. For a long time we weren't as aggressive as we are now in pure DIY, but then we recognize that there are people in the DIY space that weren't fully confident doing it themselves and so now they have two options, either get live access to their questions or have someone review all their work.","Tax Pro Go is really a brand new product in the industry and that product is conceived based on the insight that consumers know and trust H&R Block, but they didn't have the time or they didn't have the ability to come to an office and sit with the tax pro. And so that's why at this stage of being brand new in the market we're excited to see so many clients being new to the franchise. Nearly half of them are new and most of them are young and so they represent a very attractive audience for the future of the company.","Chris Howe","That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you.","Tony Bowen","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. As we were leading up to this tax season one of the issues was with the new tax laws, there might be some uncertainty from your client perspective that you might see people that used to file DIY needing more advice, needing more handling, maybe going to either your assisted products or some of your virtual products. Have you seen any indication of that so far this filing season?","Jeffrey Jones","I'll kick it off and see if Tony wants to add. I think offering this full range very much gives people lots of choices, given that there might be some questions, we know there are questions from tax reform. I think in DIY especially, to see the Tax Pro Review growth rate being a lot higher than what we're seeing in pure DIY, I think that's a great example of people who were in DIY but they recognized that they had questions. They wanted someone to review their work before they filed. And so, that's - I think that's a great example of a product that is helping people get the help they need, even though they start from a place of confidence in DIY. Tony, I don\u2019t know if\u2026","Tony Bowen","Yes, I think Jeff the only thing I would add is, when we look at the industry mix at this point of the year it's fairly in line with the average we've seen in the last several years we included that chart in the opening slides. So it doesn't feel like tax reform is having an impact on how people are filing their taxes at this point. We know that it's going to moderate in the second half is the mix will shift more towards assisted as more complex filers file later on in the season for the industry. So there's definitely some data points within our own data showing that people are seeking help and choosing some of our help products along the way. But I think from an overall industry perspective we're not seeing a change in the trajectory that we've seen in the last several years.","Jeff Silber","Okay great. And as my followup question, and I know this might be difficult to do, but you mentioned the fact about shift of timing from the fiscal third quarter to the fourth quarter, both because of the government shutdown and some of the uncertainty around tax reform. Is there any way to quantify that impact? And also did you see more of an impact maybe on your Tax Plus products where maybe you've lost some revenues per se that may have disappeared this filing season? Thanks.","Tony Bowen","Yes, I think the easiest way to think about it Jeff is, take our full year guidance and then essentially back out year-to-date through January 31, is probably the easiest way to get an idea on what we think is going to happen in the fourth quarter. I mean, even though the assisted tax returns were delayed in Q3 it was partially offset by the improvement in net average charge as we talked about through the elimination of the free EZ as well. But I think the way to get your head around Q4 is just to probably look at year-to-date relative to our overall guidance. And then the second part of your question, I'm forgetting...?","Jeff Silber","The Tax Plus product that you think you might have lost some revenues per se this filing season because of the uncertainty?","Tony Bowen","Yes. No I don't think so at all. We're actually seeing improvement in attach rates. Now again, our attach rates are relative to the base and given the assisted volume was delayed in Q3. That obviously impacted the revenue that we recorded in Q2 related to refund transfer and [indiscernible] and other things. But assuming that we approve for the rest of the year which we will, we expect that those Tax Plus revenues to come along within in Q4.","Jeff Silber","Thanks, so really just a timing issue pretty much across the board?","Tony Bowen","That's right. Yes, I think that\u2019s exactly it.","Jeff Silber","Thank you for clarifying that. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Hey good morning. Thank you. My first question is just around return on investment. So we've talked about pricing. We've talk a lot about technology. Jeff, when you came in we made these investments. Margins went down a couple of hundred basis points. How should investors judge return on investment on these initiatives? I know you make all your money in one quarter, so just curious how do investors judge return on investment? Is it, it has to show up in organic growth I presume, but just give us a sense of that.","Jeffrey Jones","Great to hear from you. This is Jeff. So yes we did obviously lower the guidance to make investments in the business. We dropped our EBITDA margin ranges from 27 to 30 to 24 to 26 and we're reaffirming that we're on our path to deliver for this year what we said we would do. The investments we're making are really important investments to position the business for growth. And so, what I like seeing, you know not only do we make all our money in one quarter, we're at the very beginning of the fourth quarter, so there's a lot that's still coming for H&R Block.","These are multi-year investments, especially when you think about the IT roadmap. These are things that will unlock value over time. Our ability to serve consumers differently, the cloud migration, the Single Tax engine, our roadmap is on track. So I feel good about the progress the IT team is making. When I take a step back from that we do not have a stated goal of how quickly can we get back to 30% EBITDA margins.","We think we can expand margin over time by growing the business and that's what we're most focused on right now. So 24 to 26 is where we are and as we get more efficient, we get more reps under our belt under the IT roadmap, we can grow the business and serve more clients. I think those are ways that we can expand margin over time.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And just a follow up question, is there any benefit of being public for H&R Block? I mean, we talk about pricing. Pricing is very competitive. You're the leader in the industry. You make all your money in one quarter. There's no public comps for you, is there a reason or what are the benefits of the company being public in your mind right here? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks again. I mean so that's not a question that I spend time thinking about. That's a board decision. We're focused on improving the business, investing in the business, delivering value for shareholders broadly over time, serving more consumers. And that's why we feel good about the progress we've made so far this season and kind of what we see for the balance of the year. We don't spend time as a management team asking ourselves that question.","Hamzah Mazari","Okay great. That's all I have. Thank you so much.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research. Your line is open.","Michael Millman","Thank you. So following up on some previous questions, this year because of the new tax law as you've suggested there are probably people who have been taxpayers have been concerned and so want to visit and get some help from a tax preparer. Given that itemization is likely to decline substantially, is it likely that some of these people will say, my, we don't really need to go to a tax preparer. We can do this online. We can do it yourself. And so that we're going to see a considerable shift more than we've seen in the past several years to do it yourself.","And now that this year becomes your seventh year of being down, are we likely and are you prepared to see this continue 8 and 9 as the market moves? And sort of related, is the company looking at making related acquisitions? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jones","Thanks Michael, again this is Jeff. I'll kick it off. So a couple things on the standard deduction question. Obviously this has been an important topic now for many, many months and there's two things I would comment on it. Number one is, before tax reform in general about 70, low 70% of American consumers already took the standard deduction. That number was far higher at H&R Block and it will increase at H&R Block as well. But the chart in the \u2013 the table in the slides is a way to try to indicate what we're seeing in terms of the migration from people who want help to people who want to do taxes themselves.","Given the changes, the tax reform this year and like we've seen year-over-year for the last several years that number bounces around a bit, but as of this point in time we're right on the five-year average of kind of mid-February how much migration happens. We're already seeing that migration moderate as we start to move into the back half and expect that to end up kind of 40 to 90 basis points for the total year.","So I never want to pretend like we have our head in the sand and that there isn't some migration happening which is why we're investing like we are in building out our DIY business and building out this range of options for consumers, so they know, they have more choice for how to get help on their terms from H&R Block than anyplace else. I think what we're seeing though is that tax reform isn't accelerating the migration from what we've seen in prior years.","This - we're on track this year to be the third straight year with improved performance in assisted business, so excluding free - the elimination of free EZ and so while you are right in terms of the multi-year trend. That is absolutely not what our goal is. Our goal is to improve the quality, improve the value proposition, and ultimately grow clients in the assisted business. So we're not settling for being down.","I think your third point was about related acquisitions. And if you refer back to our strategic framework that we introduced last year, the fifth strategic pillar is to invest for the long term and in that pillar, there is work where we're trying to do a couple of things. Number one is - and by the way this is all in addition to everything we've talked about in the core business. You've heard me say, we have a number of adjacencies in our portfolio today and we're just beginning the hard work with every single one of those products and services like we've done with DIY and assisted to figure out how to get more value from each of them. That work is just beginning.","We also will remain open if there is - if that work uncovers the new capability that we could add to the portfolio to help us serve our clients better, we will consider that. But we're really thinking about it in that sequence of core business, innovation in the third platform, further develop our adjacencies, and then determine what else may be possible.","Michael Millman","Great. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Jones","Thank you.","Operator","I have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.","Colby Brown","Thanks again everyone for joining us today. This will conclude today's call.","Operator","Thank you everyone. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
