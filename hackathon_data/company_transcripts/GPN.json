Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Global Payments Fiscal 2015 First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call will be recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane Marie Elliott","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Global Payments Fiscal 2015 First Quarter Conference Call. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour, and joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.","In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures, such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these results more clearly reflect comparative operating performance. For a full reconciliation of cash earnings to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning. The press release is also available in the Investor Relations area of our new website, at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now I'd like to introduce Jeff Sloan. Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","","Thank you Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We are delighted with our performance for the first quarter which represent a terrific start to our 2015 fiscal year and further demonstrates the continued success of our focus on solid business execution and disciplined capital deployment.","For the quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth of 12% to $705 million. Cash earnings per share growth of 22% to $1.22 and operating margin expansion of 10 basis points. Our North American business contributed better than expected results for the quarter, both in the United States and Canada. U.S. results were driven by consistent execution across our direct channels including the addition of PayPros.","Canada also reported strong performance in local currency with 8% revenue growth and stable business fundamentals. Our international business performance reflects solid results across most of our markets, with particularly strong revenue growth in Spain and our eCommerce channel. These results also include favorable currency rate trends in the quarter for the British pound, sterling and the euro as anticipated.","Importantly, we have also made tremendous progress transforming Global Payments into a unified worldwide operating company with an emphasis on direct sales and product innovation while continuing to enhance our core technology platform. Recognizing that today\u2019s merchant is increasingly connected in an OmniChannel environment, we are dedicated to providing our merchants an edge in terms of technology, and value added payment solutions.","Our efforts to combine APT and PayPros into a single integrated solutions business, which we have rebranded as OpenEdge, are further evidence of this commitment. OpenEdge helps software developers and merchants by delivering secure and personalized payment solutions. Aligned with our overall strategy, OpenEdge is driving payments innovation, adapting, scaling and simplifying how payments are processed across platforms and point of interaction in an increasingly complex landscape.","Consistent with my comments over the past year, we have also remained focused on expanding our worldwide footprint and adding direct distribution in key strategic markets. To that end, I am delighted with our agreements to require Ezidebit that we announced last month.","Ezidebit is a leading integrated payments company focused on recurring payments verticals in Australia and New Zealand. Much like our OpenEdge business in the United States, Ezidebit markets its product to a network of integrated software vendors and direct channels to numerous vertical markets. This acquisition will expand our worldwide footprint and provide us with technology enabled direct distribution in Australia, one of the largest economies in payments markets in the Asia-Pacific region.","In addition, similar to our expansion of OpenEdge technology into Canada, we intend to offer Ezidebit services to other Asia Pacific regions where these types of solutions do not presently exist. ","We are also very pleased to have entered into a strategic agreement to acquire Fidelity National Information Services gaming business that we expect will significantly expand our direct distribution in the North American Gaming Vertical. This transaction is complimentary to our existing gaming business and will expand our suite of innovative products and services.","By combining our gaming businesses, we can cross sell our full suite of products to their more than 250 flagship locations and enhance our value proposition while leveraging their industry leading scale and capabilities in risk management. We expect significant operational synergies when the transaction closes towards the end of our fiscal year.","Both of these transactions represent an attractive use of our capital and are expected to contribute meaningfully to our ability to deliver on our financial expectations over the coming years. I am confident that we have the financial flexibility and capacity to continue to pursue a well disciplined corporate development roadmap, reinvest in the business and efficiently return capital to shareholders. These are not mutually exclusive initiatives and combined will continue to drive attractive shareholder returns.","Now I will turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. It is a pleasure to be speaking with you today and to be a part of the Global Payments team. As Jeff noted, our 2015 fiscal year is off to a strong start with better than expected business performance and the positive effect of our recently executed share repurchases driving earnings growth for the quarter. Before I summarize our segment details, I would first like to remind you that we operate payment solutions businesses in multiple geographies in various stages of payments evolution.","Each of these markets has its own dynamic economic and competitive environment which allows us to achieve certain portfolio diversification benefits while also driving some variability in our results. As such I would like to begin my commentary about providing a brief overview of the key drivers of performance for the first quarter relative to our expectations.","In the United States, all of our direct businesses performed better than anticipated and we experienced continued business stability in Canada, while also benefiting from successful selective pricing initiatives. In Europe, our eCommerce channel in Spain also performed better than expected. This was partially offset by Russia, which underperformed our expectations.","In addition our effective tax rate was slightly lower than our forecast for the quarter, largely due to our geographic earnings mix and tax planning strategies. Further, subsequent to our last earnings call, we completed $75 million of share repurchases that resulted in a lower average share count for the quarter. Lastly, overall foreign currency translation impacts for the quarter were slightly better than expected and contributed positively to our results.","Now for the quarterly details. As Jeff noted, total company revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 grew to $705 million reflecting 12% growth over fiscal 2014 and cash operating margins expanded by 10 basis points to 19.8%. Dilutive cash earnings per share increased 22% over the prior year\u2019s quarter to $1.22. Our underlying business demonstrated strength during the quarter even after normalizing our revenue growth for the addition of PayPros. Assuming we owned the PayPros business in our current and prior year first quarters or normalizing its effect, total company revenue growth would have been 8% above our long term core organic growth expectations.","North America segment revenue grew 12% for the first quarter with U.S. growth of 14% and transaction growth of 11% over the prior year. U.S. revenue and transaction growth includes the addition of the PayPros acquisition and normalizing for this our organic U.S. revenue growth would have been 7% on transaction growth of 4%.","Canada revenue growth for the quarter was 4% in U.S. dollars with relatively stable spreads in low single digit credit transaction growth partially offset by an expected unfavorable exchange rate. North America cash operating income grew 13% to $89.3 million and cash operating margins were 17.7% better than we expected for the first quarter.","International revenue grew 12% for the quarter in U.S. dollars. Europe delivered strong revenue growth of nearly 14%, fueled by performance in Spain and from our eCommerce channel. Asia Pacific revenue grew 6% in line with our expectations for the quarter. International cash operating income grew 12% to $77 million, and cash operating margins remained steady at 38.4%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on a cash basis was 27.4%.","We generated approximately $87 million of free cash flow this quarter which we define as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distribution to non-controlling interests.","Capital expenditures totaled $18 million for the quarter and our total available cash, including working capital, at the end of the quarter was approximately $265 million. Lastly, we repurchased a total of approximately 1.8 million shares during the quarter.","Based on our results for the quarter as well as the anticipated closing of the Ezidebit transaction during our fiscal second quarter, we are increasing our expectations for fiscal 2015. We now expect reported revenue to grow 7% to 9%, and range from $2.74 billion to $2.79 billion. Additionally, we are raising our cash earnings per share expectations to a range of $4.65 to $4.75, reflecting growth of 13% to 15%.","We also now expect core cash operating margins to expand by as much as 40 basis points in fiscal 2015. We are forecasting that North America revenue will grow at a high single-digit rate, with high single-digit revenue growth in the United States, and Canadian revenue growth remaining in the low single-digits in local currency. We continue to expect North America cash operating income to increase in the low double-digits compared to last year with cash operating margins expansion. We also now anticipate high single to low double digit international revenue growth in U.S. dollars.","For Asia Pacific business we have raised our expectations for revenue growth to the high teens, which includes the impact of the Ezidebit acquisition. In Europe, we still expect mid single-digit revenue growth in U.S. dollars with slightly stronger performance in Spain and consistent performances from the U.K. and our eCommerce channels all on a local currency basis.","Additionally, we have a slightly more tempered view of growth expectations for Russia which as a reminder represents less than 3% of total company revenue. We now expect international cash operating income to grow in the low double digits and cash operating margins to remain relatively stable compared to last year, partially due to the Ezidebit acquisition. Importantly, we now expect foreign currency translation to represent a more meaningful headwind to overall cash earnings per share for the full year and this is also incorporated into our expectations.","Since providing our outlook for fiscal 2015 in July, we have seen an increased weakness in most of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure. As a reminder, our fiscal 2015 outlook reflects only the impacts of share repurchases that we have executed to date. We now have approximately $245 million of total authorization remaining for potential further share repurchases. In addition, upon closing the Ezidebit transaction, we expect to have approximately $850 million of capacity to fund future initiatives, including approximately $650 million of availability on our corporate credit facility.","Lastly, given that we expect the FIS transaction to close towards the end of our fiscal 2015, we intend to fund this acquisition with operating cash flows and do not expect that they have an impact on our near term capital allocation plans or facility availability.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you, Cameron. For the past five quarters, we have delivered strong and consistent performance resulting from the ongoing successful execution of our strategic initiatives. We remain committed to driving sustainable growth in each of our markets and dedicated to creating value for our shareholders, partners, customers and employees. As the first quarter demonstrates and our increased fiscal 2015 expectations suggest we continue to anticipate another strong year.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jane.","Jane Marie Elliott","Thanks, Jeff. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, I\u2019d like to ask everyone to limit their questions to questions to one with one follow up in order to try to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thanks you. And operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc","Thank you, good morning and congratulations on the solid quarter there.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Ash.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc","My first question, normally you guys go through sort of a breakout of your \u2013 sort of give us more of a flavor of what's going into your underlying assumptions with regards to specific geographies and stuff like that, country level, details in Europe and such like. Could you do that work up again because when I look at how you raised your guidance you know like you said roughly half through the acquisition of Ezidebit, I\u2019m assuming and the other half is basically the [beat] [ph] minus the impact of currency. So it seems like there\u2019s possibly some elements of conservatism in how you are looking at your outlook?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","So Ashwin, it\u2019s Jeff, I\u2019ll start. I think as we have said before we are sitting here at the end of the first quarter. So we are very, very pleased with where we are currently. We are very pleased to raise revenue margin and cash earnings guidance for the year, but we are at the start of the first quarter. And I think if you have seen us do historically we like to be in a position where we expect that as the year goes on, that we increase our confidence level around the continuing performance of the business. And I think that\u2019s something you probably have heard consistently from us over time. And with that there I\u2019ll turn it over to Cameron and perhaps Cameron you can take us little bit around the globe and just walk through some of the trending in terms about what we see the [titan] [ph] for the guidance.","Cameron M. Bready","","Sure. Ashwin, I\u2019ll start by just noting that as you look at the outlook for the revenue guidance for fiscal\u201915, you know we are obviously incorporating the first quarter performance and the Ezidebit acquisition but the FX impacts that we have for the full year are fairly meaningful. For example, the Canadian dollar has weakened roughly 3% relatively to what we had in our July expectations and as you know that\u2019s a particularly impactful currency given that our revenues are in obviously Canadian dollar and much of our expenses are in U.S. dollars given how we manage that business.","But as you go around the globe, and I think I covered some of this in my prepared remarks, we continue to expect good fundamentals in the U.S. market. We\u2019ve seen strong growth in our direct businesses on a revenue basis and we expect that momentum to carry through for the full year recognizing again however that we are in the first quarter.","As you flip over to Canada, again, we expect a relatively stable environment in Canada which is what we experienced in the first quarter and we think that\u2019s up reasonably well for the full year as well. In Europe, the U.K. business is generally performing in line with our expectations. Our eCommerce business, again is a little bit above expectations and we continue to expect good performance out of Spain, but that\u2019s somewhat tampered again by what we are seeing in Russia.","You know Russia continues to be a fairly meaningful headwind for Europe just particularly in light of the overall macro-environment in Russia; you\u2019ve got the market there down 20% year-to-date, rouble is off 18% year-to-date and an all time low against the euro and certainly near an all-time low against the U.S. dollar and GDP estimates there are not good. So that clearly creates a little bit of a headwind for our European business.","And generally in Asia, ex the Ezidebit acquisition, we are generally expecting fairly much consistent performance in line with our expectations and Ezidebit is obviously going to be added into that. And the last thing I would note just from a revenue perspective as we continue to accommodate our view of the ISO market, and our revenue growth continue to I think reflect what we have seen in that business which is obviously low single digit growth and we have accommodated the potential that that could degrade even a little bit further in the back half of the year or the back three quarters of the year. So when you roll all that together, you know we guided up at a midpoint basis about $40 million, we think that obviously given where we are, we are one quarter into the year is a reasonable outlook for the full year.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc","No, that\u2019s just quite understandable. Thank you for doing that. I guess a quick follow up on Canada. Obviously good to see it as a stable business here, but as you roll out the APT offering in Canada, first of all I guess what sort of reception are you getting and is that a good solid enough potential that down the road you can maybe call Canada better than stable?","David E. Mangum","Ashwin, this is David. The initial reception has been quite good for the rollout of integrated solutions which we now as you know rebranded OpenEdge on a worldwide basis particularly in North America. Initial reception is quite good. And you\u2019ve put your finger on an important thing to watch for Canada over the coming years really. Initially this is the initial rollout of integrated solutions into one of our largest markets, so you won\u2019t see a big change in Canadian trends, but certainly our hope is we can drive greater organic growth at high profit levels to the integrated channels and the initial signs are quite positive.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","Great job again.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Dave.","Cameron M. Bready","","Thanks, Dave","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","And I guess just one other thing. Canada got quite a bit better sequentially. I mean it was 5% constant currency growth I think in Q4 and up to 8%, and you mentioned a little bit of pricing benefit. Is there something incremental, because I know we just thought it would start to decelerate with some of the MasterCard and Visa interchange adjustments and things anniversaried, but it actually seemed to pick up a little bit, so was there new pricing benefits?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","David, it\u2019s Jeff. I think it just continued good execution. You know we have a newer management team up in Canada in the last year. I think you are starting to see the fruits of that reinvigoration of the sales channel. We are very pleased with the new initiatives that we have in Canada and I would say you know financially for the quarter and outlook for the year, Dave that Cameron expressed that we have seen a higher retention rate and some of those actions that we had taken through I think good management up in Canada than we had seen historically. So I would say more stickiness Dave is probably one thing I would point to and better sales execution.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","Okay, great. And then just my follow up. The FIS Gaming Acquisition, you know it sounds like a lot of revenue synergies so we should see growth there, but maybe you could just give us kind of the baseline annualized revenue and kind of margin profile so we start thinking about how that impacts fiscal\u201916?","David E. Mangum","Dave, this David. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to walk in a lot of detail, but the base business we are buying is on the order of about $50 million business with margins that are accretive to Global Payments margins. We obviously expect the combination will drive even better margin expansion over time and maybe it\u2019s worth doing a little bit of reset for everyone on what the gaming business is and isn\u2019t within Global Payments. We don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about it, but just as a reminder it\u2019s been in consistent mid-to-high single digit grower operating at margins higher than the company\u2019s margins and it\u2019s a very consistent business when you think of this theme of technology enabled distribution. This is a series of products, innovative products by the way, that are focused on a very specific vertical, gaming, and cash access on the floor in casinos. Our technology there helps casinos manage credit exposure, get cash onto the floor and really delight their most important customers. Fidelity does exactly the same thing, so we really love the idea of putting these two together, the ability to cross sell and the geographic expansion that comes with it, we are very excited about this transaction.","Cameron M. Bready","And David, it\u2019s Cameron, I would just note in addition to what David mentioned you know the complimentary nature of the business is very attractive to us. And then today the price that we are paying you know from our perspective is also very attractive. We view the effective purchase price of the transaction to be in the neighborhood of $180 million after taking into consideration the tax benefits that were realized through the transaction structure so we think that price relative to what we are getting and the complimentary nature of their business, our business what we do with that going forward is a very attractive use of our capital.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","Okay. That sound great. Thank you, good job.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Dave.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","","The next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","","Good morning, nice results.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","A couple questions maybe just drilling down a little bit on the U.S. revenue trend. Can you just sort of help us understand a little bit more on the direct side components, how well integrated payments did? And then I mean I sort of guess my read through is integrated payments did better than expectations or the ISO drag has been not as bad as expected. And the follow-up related to that would be given the strong Canada results and North America revenue growth, U.S. revenue growth, I'm actually surprised margins weren't a little bit better in North America.","Cameron M. Bready","Well I think its Cameron. And Glenn, I\u2019ll start with just the revenue side of the equation. I would say for the U.S. business all of our direct businesses really performed better than our expectations in the first quarter and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving from our perspective the overall performance. I would say ISO has generally performed inline with what we had anticipated for the quarter, and that\u2019s largely why you are seeing kind of such strong U.S. revenue growth in particular integrated, the integrated channel which we now as you probably saw rebranded as OpenEdge. OpenEdge performed again slightly better than our expectations. We are continuing to make very good progress that in integrating APT and PayPros, and that has generated I think positive performance and momentum as we look to the last three of the year as well.","As it relates to the overall margin we did see margin expansion year-over-year which again, I think is very much a good story for the U.S. business. As we look to the balance of the year we continue to expect to see strong margin improvement across the U.S. business and we do expect margin expansion for the U.S. business as well consistent with the outlook that we gave in July, obviously our confidence around that is little bit bolstered by the results we saw in the first quarter.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up on maybe the growth in the margin profile for the Ezidebit business?","Cameron M. Bready","Sure. Ezidebit as we mentioned before is a business that will be additive, again and accretive to the overall corporate margin. Its generally inline with what we across our international businesses, so as we look to the back three quarters of the year as well, we expect to see Ezidebit contributing a little bit to the margin improvement that we\u2019re currently anticipating for the overall business.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","And I would say Glenn, it\u2019s Jeff, that the revenue growth we expect that business is slightly higher in line but slightly higher than our OpenEdge business is here in North America.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Thanks, guys. Just a couple of sizing questions if we could. First off on OpenEdge, I mean, now that you\u2019ve put [PayPros] together can you give us a sense of what percent of your total company revenue is OpenEdge and I think the growth rate there is still kind of low double-digits or so, if you can verify that and maybe we can just start there, and then just an update on the percent of North American revs and op income from the ISOs?","Cameron M. Bready","It\u2019s Cameron and I\u2019ll jump in there. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position today to [indiscernible] to sort of sizing of the integrated business relative to our overall North American channel or the entirety of the Global Payments. As you think about obviously the combination of those businesses going forward, we will get the revenue growth for that business more in the mid-teen range.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Okay.","Cameron M. Bready","We think it has very positive momentum kind of as we look again to the back three quarters of the year and going forward beyond that. So we view that as a mid-teen growing business and are very confident in that expectation. Can you remind the second part of your question?","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Yeah, just the update on the percent of North America revs and operating income coming from the ISOs?","Cameron M. Bready","Yeah. We gave that number a few quarters ago, I believe, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to provide a specific update to that today, but I think it easy to assume that given the growth of the direct business in the intervening period that those numbers are less than probably what we quoted to you previously and continuing to decline. So, I think that\u2019s a trend that we would expect as we move forward in time, but we don\u2019t have a specific update to that today.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","And just last, the integration of the actual technology platforms for PayPros and APT, I know that\u2019s an ongoing process. Should we be thinking that as a material source of cost savings once that\u2019s completed? And should be thinking of kind of roughly end of fiscal \u201915 for when that might be done?","David Mangum","Jason; it\u2019s David. We think it\u2019s quite important to the integrated business to bring those technology platforms together. We\u2019re not in a rush, we want to do it very well and serve our 2,000 partners around the U.S. and Canada very well. It is fair to think that around the end of fiscal \u201915 will be well on our way to completing that integration, which will create very nice margin expansion opportunities for the integrated business. Now that would be within the greater context of the U.S. business and the North American than total Global Payments, so you won\u2019t necessarily see it on the face of the income statement, but its part of running business very efficiently and very well that would be great for integrated channel.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Very good. Thank you.","David Mangum","Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Georgios Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Maybe to start off on the U.S. side again, you spoke in the past about targeting mid-teens growth for the IPA solutions, it sounds like you need a little bit better in the first quarter. Is that fair to say that the growth rate accelerate a little bit in the first quarter?","Cameron M. Bready","George, this is Cameron. I do think that it\u2019s a relatively fair statement to say. We did see some acceleration of that growth in the first quarter. Again, I think that does set us up well for us to meet our overall expectations for that business for the year. But I think that is a fair characterization of the results thus far.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. And you\u2019re affirming the long-term growth of the channel as mid-teens?","Cameron Bready","Yes. I think that\u2019s right. Yeah.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. Also curious, we\u2019re hearing a lot about tokenization opportunities from a number of different payment providers. How significant could that be or will it be significant to Global Payments as you look out maybe a year or so? Is that something that could be meaningful to the U.S. operation?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","George, its Jeff, I\u2019ll start, I think you probably have seen our announcement last night with Apple Pay that will fully supporting Apple Pay here in the United States across all of our channels but in particular through OpenEdge, which is our integrated business. As you know, based on your question tokens of course are part of the solution as it relates to that mobile construct and we\u2019re pleased to be I think an early user of the tokens that are use in that kind of solution.","I would say more generally on the strategy side of what you said, we tend to view it as a combination of EMV tokenization as well as encryption and we think all three parts of that, George are going to be important for the ultimate solution. So I do think over a period of time that we will be incrementally do better in the United States market with all three of those as a package.","Whether that would meaningfully influence our results, time will tell and you\u2019ll have to see. I do think that the market will evolve toward a place wherefore the right merchant set and of course you saw us in OpenEdge and Apple with us last night, it will be a meaningful point of distinction, I believe for us. I would also say though in the case of tokens, while Apple is a very good example of an innovator and leading partner and a company who has done very well with what they\u2019ve done to-date.","I think it\u2019s important to realize that there is still a lack of uniformity on what the right baseline for tokenization should be. So, for example, we hear on our side are using at least United States currently the EMV tokenization specs, but there are variety as you probably know George, mobile alternative specifications for tokens, some are at the issuer level, some of the acquirer level, et cetera. I think it\u2019s going to be important for us as an industry to see some kind of rationalization and uniformity of specification, George for tokens really to have a meaningful impact on payments across all of us in the marketplace.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. So, it sounds like a bit of a wait and see on that. Last question from me, should we be thinking any differently about the tax rate for fiscal year \u201915, any changes there?","Cameron M. Bready","George, it\u2019s Cameron, generally no, I think we\u2019re still guiding towards a tax rate approaching 28% and it was 27.4% for the first quarter, so I think that\u2019s generally in the ballpark of the overall guidance we provided for the full year. We maybe a little light of that, but we\u2019re still guiding towards that approaching 28% level.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the guidance coming from a slightly different angle. If I just look at the first quarter, you guys did about 12% revenue growth. How do we get down to 7% to 9% growth for the full year? What\u2019s going to deteriorate the business even given the Ezidebit acquisitions going to be in there as well?","Cameron M. Bready","Bryan, its Cameron, I don\u2019t know that I would say anything that\u2019s going to really deteriorate in the business, but for perhaps FX. And also I think it\u2019s important to remember that PayPros annualizes in Q4, so that\u2019s going to obviously have an impact on the overall annual revenue growth as well.","So, now as I described earlier, I think when you look at the revenue guidance, we\u2019ve obviously factored in the first quarter performance. We are including our expectations for Ezidebit. We are being conscious I think of the momentum we have going into the back three quarters of the year, but also recognize that it\u2019s very early despite the fact we\u2019re pleased with our overall performance thus far.","And I think when you layer in FX on top of that and accommodate again for the ISO channel which again, we view as growth being relatively light in the low single-digit range and potentially worse, I think that kind of gets you to an overall 7% to 9% level.","Frankly I\u2019m less focused on the 7% to 9%, that\u2019s really just math. I think ultimately when I\u2019m focused on is the actual revenue numbers themselves. And I think again we guided the mid-point of $40 million, we think that\u2019s a good place for us to be right now given for one quarter and for the year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","How much was FX headwind going in, I guess, in the original guidance how many points and then how much is it now into when I look at this guidance, how many points of headwind is FX?","Cameron M. Bready","We didn\u2019t give a specific sort of estimate as to the FX impact coming into the year. We described it as a modest headwind, so you can use your own judgment as to what modest means. I think as we look to the balance of the year, we think it is a more meaningful headwind to the business and I\u2019ll just note that if you get all the major currencies to which we are exposed, all but one, we have a more \u2013 we have a more negative outlook for those currencies for the balance of the year than we did in the July time frame and I would say relatively meaningfully more negative outlook. So I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving a lot of what you\u2019re seeing from top-line revenue perspective is just that impact of FX.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","You do not quantifying the FX impact in the guidance?","Cameron M. Bready","No. We\u2019re not quantifying it specifically, no.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","All right, last question from me. Just on Russia now. What\u2019s in the expectations? I guess, it was short of what you were expecting originally, but how much Russia revenue, what\u2019s the baseline for the guidance now?","Cameron M. Bready","Yes. As we committed earlier Russia represents about 3% of our total revenue for the company. So, I wouldn\u2019t want to characterize performance as dramatically negative relative to our expectations, but it did fall little bit short. I think we\u2019re really pleased with the job our colleagues are doing in Russia given the overall environment there and some of the highlights that I provided earlier as the where the ruble stands, where the overall macro and economic situation is, particularly where GDP growth is. But again we have a slightly more tempered view. We came into year with the tempered view and their view slightly more tempered than it even was in July for that business for the full year.","And particularly when you layer on the impact of the ruble which has again continued to degrade significantly, performance expectations for that business are not particularly great right now.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks much and congrats.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Bryan.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks Bryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie","Thanks. Just another follow-up, seems like nice increase to margins despite the FX. What\u2019s striving kind of the boost in what\u2019s obviously tougher environment overall?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","So, I\u2019ll start Kevin and then Cameron will add in to. I think the key thing from our point of view is that we\u2019ve had very good execution in our direct channels. So if you start with the United States business, I think we are really firing on all cylinders on a direct basis in the U.S. business, of course, the direct business that are higher margin naturally than some of our third-party businesses anywhere in the world especially here in the United States.","So, I think Kevin you start with good core direct sales execution coupled with investments and things like PayPros and while Fidelity Gaming will not tie into fiscal \u201915 because its really closes at the end of the year, we also announced there Kevin as a higher margin business with better than industry rates of organic revenue growth similar to our own business.","So I would say Kevin, good execution and then those things that we\u2019re adding into our markets or more direct sales resources and more businesses with better than cooperate, average corporate operating margins. So, I think a conscious effort to have better execution, when we add something better products and services that drive additional margin.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie","And then just, Jeff, without getting too granular, any sense of \u2013 what does the target become over the course of time for direct versus indirect?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Well, I think, Kevin, as a strategy matter without giving kind of a more granular answer to your point, what we like to do is just let those businesses grow as much north of the market as we can. Every month here we look at our rates of organic revenue or transaction growth in all of our markets versus what you see from the networks and what you see from our publicly reporting peers, those are bogeys and we try to exceed what we think those market rates growth are.","If we go back to what Cameron said, if you look at the first quarter with our third-party ISO business growing in the low single-digit as Cameron mentioned. We view the organic rate of the market to be mid single-digits or better in the United States market. So we\u2019re trying to exceed that Kevin, you could imagine what that might do to that mix over time.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie","Understood. Thank you. Nice job.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","I just wanted to go back and look to Europe a bit. I know you\u2019re talking about FX headwinds being meaningful, but quantifying it. So, when we look at Spain, historically that\u2019s been more a market share play I think. I\u2019m wondering to the extent where do you guys stand in terms of that penetration and do you think that that can continue even in the face of what is going to be some? I think much more difficult purchasing power within that region?","And then secondly, within the eCommerce channel, I think your major partner had a pretty significant announcement yesterday, I\u2019m wondering Jeff, if you could just kind of philosophically think about and tell us what you\u2019re thinking there? And then the last question I have, and then I\u2019ll be quiet.","Some of the networks have suggested that they\u2019re going put on these digital enablement fees which are fees they\u2019re going to charge to you guys. I\u2019m wondering what extent you think you\u2019re going to able to absorb those and\/or pass them through in the future? Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Dan, it\u2019s Jeff, I want to congratulate you first for getting three questions in there. Usually, I think usually we\u2019re managed to limit you to two, so my congratulations on that, but certainly that\u2019s a good question and certainly happy to address those.","So let me start off with the Global Solutions business, which as you rightly said, we are very lucky and fortunate to have PayPal as one of our good partners in that business and I think as Cameron had alluded to in his prepared comment, we continue to see consistently very good performance in that business.","What I would say is that I\u2019ve said with other parties, third-parties over time that, we are only as successful in our businesses as our partners are successful. So if you think about it that way, Dan presumably rationale for eBay and PayPal is to enable additional success both eBay as well as at PayPal, and of course you\u2019d have to ask them, but that is my sense and having read about it and having lived through this stuff before.","As I said a minute ago the most success that they have we believe the more success that we as a good partner. We\u2019ll have. So from that point of view Dan, I feel like that\u2019s nothing but good news for them but also for our business and that is certainly my expectation.","On the question about Spain, I think we continue to have very good execution in market share gains in that business. I would add that as you\u2019ve seen around the EU and certainly from one of the networks. We also believe that we will benefit from continued regulatory change in the European marketplace. Spain was in affect this quarter, because it was effective I believe September 1st Spain earlier adopted their equivalent, Dan of some of the step up pricing actions for credit and debt.","So, we have a lot of confidence in our colleagues and Spain. I think you can see that through the years of consistent performance. And we would expect that to be enhance not just through additional market share gains as we\u2019ve done continuously, but also through some of the benefits that we experienced here in the context of Durbin that you\u2019ll see some of that flow through in the context of SEPA.","And then, lastly, getting to your third question about some of the announcements by the networks, I think in our business, the real key for us is the ability to provide additional values whether its Apple Pay, which we announced last night particularly through OpenEdge with the additional kiosk or announcement in our gaining business or the announcement with our partnership with Fidelity in their businesses.","The key for us is to be able to offer more value-added products and services and we and our customers will then be the beneficiary of that. So to the extent for example, tokens become more readily expected as you\u2019ve seen with some of the announcements we\u2019ve made. If that provides more value and if there\u2019s a way as part of that for us to share in that value participation, that\u2019s terrific, if they don\u2019t provide more value than I think that something that we and everybody else will have to think about.","But sitting here today, Dan I view lot of the announcements that come out about newer technologies and new initiatives and the brands is being additive to the quality by reducing consumer concerns about fraud rates by reducing actual and perceived fraud, all that stuff is very good news for us and for our customers.","David Mangum","And Dan, it\u2019s David, just a little follow-on to that into the previous question. We have the ability to do tokenization today, point-to-point as well and for customers with the right terminals the ability to do an EMV as well. If you forward over calendar \u201915 think of that is the opportunity for bundled solutions for more secure processing absolutely that\u2019s adding more value to transactions which should provide the ability to price appropriately around that as well.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks guys.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Dan.","David Mangum","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Kwok with KBW.","Steven Kwok - KBW","I just have one quick follow-up, in terms of from an M&A pipeline, just wondering what are the \u2013 how is the pipeline going and then in terms of what are the some of the areas that you\u2019re focused on that you feel that can enhance your operations even more? Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Steven. It\u2019s Jeff. So I would say, we still have good pipeline. I think you have to realize that I\u2019d say that in the context of just having announced two acquisitions in the last two or three weeks. So as with all type pipelines they build and then hopefully over time you execute on some of those transactions and then you rebuild on. So, I like where our pipeline is today, but of course to the transaction Ezidebit and Fidelity, we have now announced. So, clearly those two are no longer in the pipeline, you have to keep that in perspective.","Second in terms of areas of focus Ezidebit with Australia and New Zealand was an area of focus that we talked quite a bit about on the last number of conference calls, so we\u2019d said key strategic objectives for us even is to expand our business in the Asia Pacific region, Australia, South Korea and Japan probably in that order were three markets that were not in, that we\u2019ve really have wanted to be in and now we are very pleased to be in the Australian marketplace with the announcement of the Ezidebit acquisition.","So I would say, if we could find additional opportunities in that market or in South Korea and Japan as new markets we\u2019ll be very interested and we continue to look at those. But the markets that we\u2019re currently in an Asia Pacific that we\u2019ve said before they would want to be bigger in that\u2019s still true. So for example, we are looking fairly closely at India, China, and the Philippines three markets that we\u2019re currently in that we like that we\u2019d rather be a bigger in if we have a choose, so I think those are still on the horizon.","I would say, in the North American marketplace, U.S. and Canada we just announced Fidelity a day or two ago, so I think its fair to assume that there is lot more company of any size in the North American marketplace imminently. And then in Europe we continue to look, most of the things that we\u2019ve seen in Europe we have passed on, we are very pleased with the current construct of our European business, but if we can find additional transaction especially in Continental Europe to example our GPE business in Prague, we would be very interested in those.","But that\u2019s nothing really new. We\u2019ve been saying that for some time and of course, we\u2019re also pleased to be in Brazil with our partners at Kisha. We would look to expand our Brazilian business if we can find the right opportunity as we have said for a while and we like to do same in the rest of Latin America in particularly in Mexico if we found the right opportunity. So it\u2019s not really new Steven. I would say what is new for Ezidebit is really we\u2019re now going to be upon closing in Australia, New Zealand, so that was key focal point of ours.","Steven Kwok - KBW","Great. Thanks for taking my Questions.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Sure. Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","One question, one clarification if I could, in relative to the 40 bps of operating margin expansion you\u2019re expecting for the year, how much of that is being driven by the peer mix of the business with open edge and easy debit versus how much has been driven by kind of operational leverage?","Cameron M. Bready","Jim, its Cameron, I wouldn\u2019t give a specific estimate as how it\u2019s being driven any particular aspect of the business. I think what it reflects overall was just the continuing improvement in the overall margin profile for the aggregate company. So of that\u2019s driven by initiative that we has as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks to move towards a single operating company platform. Some of that driven by the improvements we\u2019ve made in terms of adding new businesses to the mix that obviously come in at higher than our corporate average margin. And some of it I think is just overwite execution in lot of our businesses around the world, not going to spies at more specific to the net but I think its combination of those factors.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. And then just a clarification on the follow-up, with respect to the channel it sounds like you are saying that in August quarter the ISO channel didn\u2019t decelerate in fact maybe it was the same or little bit better than it was back in the may quarter, is that accurate?","Cameron M. Bready","I think it was probably slow than it was in the May quarter. I don\u2019t think the deceleration was dramatic; we still view it in the low single digit from a growth perspective. But as mentioned before our revenue guidance does contemplate the potential that could deteriorate a little bit more as we look to the back three quarters of the year. But it was probably a little weaker than we saw in the May quarter, but it wasn\u2019t dramatic.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator: Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Great. Thanks. Good results, here. Just want to ask about Easy Debit and the revenue opportunity. I don\u2019t really know that asset, its looks like recurring payments business, plus a gateway business, so what\u2019s the mix and which piece more about?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Tien-tsin, its Jeff. I think we\u2019re excited about first the opportunity get into in additional market in Asia Pacific, we\u2019ve been looking for quite sometime as I said minute ago reaction response to Steven\u2019s question about how we additional markets in Asia Pacific in particular in Australia which is a fourth largest economy in Asia Pacific and is about the same size, little bit bigger than the economy in Spain.","So I think the first answer to the question is new market is an important thing that we\u2019re focused on. I would think second in terms of your question about the construct of our Easy Debit I would think of it really very similar to what we call Open Edge APC and PayPros, so I think you should think about that way Tien-tsin in terms of your understanding of the business. The market in Australia is a little bit different than the market in the United States, there are decent to mean alternative payment schemes outside of the card brands in Australia so that has a meaningful part of the business, over at Easy Debit. So other than construct which is local schemes I think its very similar same types of channels. I think there are 60 enterprise software and integrator who are partnering with to get out the customer base. So the model you should be thinking about is one is very similar to Open Edge albeit in the Australian market.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Okay. I appreciate that. And just follow-up for Cameron, I guess is the quarterly cadence throughout the year for EPS, I think last quarter you said with last year, any updates to that?","Cameron M. Bready","No. I think that expectation is still largely consistent based on our current outlook for the full year.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question, nice quarter.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Good morning.","Cameron M. Bready","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Cameron, just at the risk of beating a dead horse on the ISOs, can you just talk a little bit about cause and what\u2019s kind of behind the modest weakness relative to initial thoughts on that channel, is that a global payments sort of consummated initiative or is there something external taking place in the market?","Cameron M. Bready","I don\u2019t know if there is anything more significant external taking place in the market place. I think it\u2019s more of a commentary thing, largely from our perspective is to where our focus has been here over the last few quarters. Its\u2019 clearly on growing our direct business, it\u2019s clearly on growing OpenEdge, our integrated business and focusing on again putting our efforts behind what we do is more the long term future of our company which is the direct distribution model through those businesses that we have. So, I don\u2019t know if I would read too much further into it than that, I think it\u2019s just a fairly consistent commentary with what we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters around where our focus is and the result of that as I [reported] a few are -- overall financial performance.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, Andrew it\u2019s Jeff. I would just say it\u2019s a continuation in addition with what Cameron said financially at a high level, it\u2019s a continuation of the trending that we probably have talked about in the last eight quarters or so which is, at the end of the day the third party business has really come through a period post [indiscernible] and a period of very high revenue growth in particular which of course has an impact on our GAAP reported revenues. And that is well now annualized. So I think what you are seeing is those unusual one time events which cause that channel to grow very very quickly for a period of a couple of years and this is by the eight consecutive quarter we are seeing the continuation of the same trend of lower growth in that channel. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s anything other than an extension of what you\u2019ve been seeing for the last years or so.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. All right, that\u2019s helpful. And where is the through the pro forma operating leverage in the business, sorry financial leverage in the business today and what are you sort of comfortable with long term recognizing that you generate a lot of free cash?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, Andrew its Jeff. At a high level for me from a strategy point of view, we expect to see over the cycle as we let our July continuing on operating margin expansion. You know we made significant investments in our direct businesses, we believe those are growing at market rates or better. We just got you talking about our third party business and while there\u2019s not a lot new there over the last two years, the truth is that is not growing from a revenue point of view at where the rate of market growth is. So the natural mix overtime and it continued good execution and new products and services and leveraging the technology of platforms globally is we\u2019re doing generates our expectation that we talked about in July that we\u2019re going to continue to see over the cycle additional operating margin expansion.","That is supplemented by some of the deals that we have announced, so we are very focused on adding product services companies, distribution technologies that are additive to our margins. So the last two transactions we have announced, Ezidebit and now for that gaming [ph] are now we are growing better than the rates of organic market growth which we described that comment that David mentioned that margins that are better than our corporate margins. So I think from a strategic point of view, Andrew going back to July cycle based guidance, it\u2019s a combination of good, consistent, direct execution in all of our direct channels globally augmented by when we do partnerships and acquisitions those are in assets that have good technologies, products and services, good distribution but that [have] allowed us doing a lot initially has better margins than in the first place. And I think utilize stuff together, and you should continue to see our expectation is continued expansion over the cycle on our operating margin.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","","Our last question comes from Jason Deleeuw of Piper Jaffray.","Jason Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray","Hey good morning and thanks. I want to dig into the integrated payments channel just a more. I want to get a feel for the channel partners that you are working with, what percentage of their merchants already have integrated payments? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, like kind of the long term growth opportunity there. And then also, if you could just give us some color on now that you guys have been in this channel for sometime now especially with APT, what\u2019s kind of going on from a competitive front, from a pricing front, are there any changes in this dynamics in that channel that you guys have noticed over the last year and a half?","David E. Mangum","","Yeah, Jason its David I\u2019ll start and then let the other guys chime in as well. We have over 2000 partners\u2019 across our integrated channels, servicing numerous verticals with meaningful presence in probably 50 or 60 verticals, channels. And when we think about the pieces of that solution, it\u2019s the proprietary payment technology and highly secured solution as well. So when we look at the pieces of that we\u2019ve been very successful with the mid-teens kind of growth that Cameron\u2019s describing and then when you roll the sort of the rest of your question in thinking about pricing pressure we have seen very little incremental pricing pressure obviously merchant acquiring at highly competitive to link your first two questions together.","But for us, fortunately from a growth perspective we have not quoted this number in sometime when we first announced these transactions, we told you these channels are maybe 25% penetrated. In other words, the merchant\u2019s solutions being integrated with our software and our technology and the vendor\u2019s software and technology may be 25% of those margins actually we are processing through an integrated solution. So we think we\u2019ve got a long runway ahead for growth, particularly given that pricing trends are quite stable across the industry.","Jason Deleeuw \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Just the last one, do you think EMV helps accelerate their penetration rate or to give more merchants to integrate the payments?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, there\u2019s no question. In fact if you link it to Apple pay and the marriage of tokenization point to point encryption, and EMV, we think we will drive faster adoption and get the merchant the end merchant as well as the ISV the software vendor, more excited about driving these integrated solutions throughout the base.","Jason Deleeuw \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you.","Jeffrey S.

For a full reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measurer in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our trended financial highlights both of which are available on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thank you, Isabel and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I am delighted to report the strong momentum we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Once again, we accelerated growth producing double-digit organic net revenue increases across nearly 90% of our businesses. Adjusted earnings per share grew 17% in the quarter. We also made significant progress on our Heartland integration efforts and are tracking ahead of plan in terms of expected synergy realization from the merger.","Our North American business had an outstanding second quarter led by our U.S. direct sales channels, which generated low double-digit organic net revenue growth. This was driven by strength in OpenEdge, which again produced mid-teens growth and Heartland, which posted double-digit growth. We continue to operate exceptionally well delivering record sales months of Heartland, a testament to excellent sales and integration execution. In Europe, we generated strong local currency net revenue growth in the quarter led by double-digit organic growth in our United Kingdom and Spanish businesses. The UK produced its strongest quarter in years driven by increased tourism and strength in our e-commerce and omni-channel solutions business. While in Spain, we again saw market-leading volume and transaction growth.","Lastly, our Asia-Pacific business had its best performance since I joined the company 7 years ago. Organic net revenue growth was mid-teens in the quarter driven by solid trends across most of our Asian markets. We saw double-digit growth in our Greater China markets, India and the Philippines. Ezidebit once again contributed significantly to results in the region with over 20% organic growth this quarter. In addition to our strong core growth around the world, Heartland brings new opportunities to leverage our distinctive distribution capabilities and deliver differentiated solutions to merchants globally. Just this past quarter, we sold our payment solution to a large Canadian university that was a softer customer of our campus solutions business. Our Heartland sales team sold and boarded its first merchant in Puerto Rico selling our payment solution in an entirely new market for Heartland. And we partnered with a vending systems integrator to distribute our unintended payment solutions throughout Asia.","As we look to 2017 and beyond, we are focused on leveraging our combined platform to further advance the technology-enabled distribution strategies we outlined at our last investor conference. We have now combined our integrated solutions with Heartland\u2019s vertical software to create a technology-enabled software-led distribution business. This allows us to expand our leadership position in integrated payments and to develop and distribute customizable, vertically fluid software solutions for customers worldwide. We expect to accelerate growth in both payment and software revenue in verticals with attractive fundamentals.","In addition, our omni-channel solutions business remains a key growth driver of our strategy worldwide. In North America, we have integrated Heartland\u2019s e-commerce offering with Realex to create market-leading omni-channel capabilities. In Europe, we continue to build on the strength of the Realex platform with bundled omni-channel solutions deployed in the United Kingdom and Spain and further plan to enter Central Europe to our Erste joint venture.","Lastly, in Asia, we will leverage our global e-commerce capabilities to expand the scope of our omni-channel solutions across that market. While we continue to expand our offerings, our performance this quarter demonstrates the ongoing success of this strategy across all of our regions. This is one of the strongest quarters we have ever reported and I am very proud of our performance in every region in which we operate. I am particularly pleased with the team\u2019s ability to drive strong results across our businesses, while focusing on expense synergies and laying the groundwork for continued expansion and revenue enhancement opportunities.","Now I will turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. I am particularly pleased with our ongoing execution which enabled us to deliver a record second quarter, while at the same time making considerable progress further integrating Heartland. Total company net revenue for the second quarter was $817 million, a 58% increase over fiscal 2016. Adjusted earnings per share, was $0.89 reflecting growth of 17% or 22% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin for the quarter were 29.5%. On a constant currency basis, operating margin was 30%, representing a 50 basis point increase year-over-year.","Our North America segment grew net revenue by 85% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and operating margin expanded 150 basis points despite the inclusion of Heartland, which has a lower margin profile relative to Global Payments\u2019 historical levels. Margin expansion was principally a result of business mix and the realization of expense synergies from the Heartland merger.","We are delighted with the progress of our integration efforts. Our superior execution has allowed us to integrate the business faster than we expected and accelerate expense synergies. As a result, we now expect total annual run-rate expense synergies from the transaction to be approximately $135 million, an increase of $10 million compared to our prior target. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct sales channels, calculated as if we owned Heartland in both this period and in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was double-digits for the quarter surpassing our expectations and accelerating sequentially from the first quarter. This was primarily driven by our combined Heartland sales channel, which generated double-digit organic growth in our integrated solutions business, which produced another quarter of mid-teens growth.","As we mentioned last quarter, we have fully integrated legacy Global Payments and Heartland direct sales forces in the U.S. in our operating as a combined channel under the Heartland model. On a normalized basis, this combined distribution channel produced low double-digit net revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Although we do not have exact figures for the legacy Global Payments and legacy Heartland businesses as the channels are now combined, we estimate each grew low double-digits organically compared to their respective performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This represents a sequential acceleration from the high single-digit growth we estimated for both legacy businesses in the first quarter.","Canada again, delivered solid performance with low single-digit growth in local currency consistent with our expectations. The Canadian dollar remained a headwind in the quarter, albeit less severe than we experienced in 2016. Our European business performed exceptionally well this quarter delivering 18% net revenue growth on a local currency basis. Reported net revenue growth for Europe was 6% compared to the prior year due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound, which declined nearly 20% year-over-year. Local currency net revenue growth in Europe was primarily driven by low double-digit organic growth in the United Kingdom and Spain as well as the addition of the Erste joint venture. European operating margin of 46.7% declined from the previous year as expected due primarily to integration cost associated with the Erste transaction and the impacts of foreign currency. Our integration of the Erste joint venture remains on track and we expect it to be largely complete in the first half of calendar 2017.","As Jeff mentioned, Asia-Pacific had an outstanding quarter with 24% net revenue growth and operating margins of 29.6%, an increase of over 200 basis points year-over-year. Growth in Asia-Pacific was primarily driven by mid-teens organic growth in the region as well as the addition of eWAY. Excluding Heartland integration costs, we generated free cash flow of approximately $170 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations less capital expenditures in distributions to non-controlling interest.","Capital expenditures totaled $42 million for the quarter. In addition, since the date of our last call, we have reduced outstanding debt by approximately $50 million and repurchased 1.5 million shares for $105 million. A portion of the share repurchase was funded withdraws on our revolving credit facility, which we expect to repay in the first quarter of calendar 2017 with proceeds from the planned sales leaseback of our Jeffersonville service center.","Our board recently increased our share repurchase authorization capacity to $300 million. In late October, we refinanced our existing debt facilities increasing our aggregate term loan A facilities by $750 million with the proceeds being used to reduce a portion of the term loan B facility in outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings. In December, we entered into an additional $250 million notional amount interest rate swap bringing our total hedge position to $1 billion. We plan to execute additional hedges in 2017 to further reduce our exposure to the interest rates as we leg into our targeted hedge position of 40% to 50%.","As you are aware, we have changed our fiscal year end to December 31 and our first fiscal year on a calendar year basis began on January 1, 2017. Consequently, today we are providing our outlook for calendar 2017. We expect calendar 2017 net revenue to range from $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion, reflecting growth of 18% to 21% over our estimate of calendar 2016 net revenue, which includes approximately 200 to 300 basis points of foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, net revenues are expected to be in the range of $3.425 billion to $3.525 billion, which represents growth of 20% to 24% over our estimates of calendar 2016 net revenues.","Operating margin is expected to expand by up to 90 basis points. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, we expect operating margin to expand by up to 140 basis points. We expect adjusted earnings per share to range from $3.70 to $3.90 reflecting growth of 16% to 23% over our calendar 2016 adjusted earnings per share estimate. This outlook includes approximately 500 basis points of foreign currency headwinds primarily associated with the British pounds, euro and Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, we expect adjusted earnings per share to range from $3.85 to $4.05, which represents growth of 21% to 27% over our calendar 2016 estimate. Notably, our calendar 2017 expectation represents annualized growth of approximately 17% relative to our last fiscal 2017 guide or approximately 20% on a constant currency basis.","As a reminder, on our fiscal 2016 Q4 earnings call in July, we provided an early preview of calendar 2016 expectations based on fiscal 2016 currency rates. On this same currency basis, our current guide for calendar 2017 is well in excess of these ranges for both net revenues and adjusted earnings per share, which reflects the strong momentum we see in the business. We expect to use the majority of our free cash flow this year to support debt reduction and to be near the high-end of our targeted leverage ratio of 3x to 3.5x by the end of calendar 2017 consistent with our expectation when we announced the Heartland deal in December 2015.","As is customary, our outlook for 2017 also includes only share repurchases we have completed to-date and does not assume incremental repurchases. With respect to the more detailed assumptions that underlies this outlook, we expect North America net revenue to grow in excess of 20% in calendar 2017 relative to our estimate for calendar 2016, including FX headwinds from the Canadian dollar. This reflects our expectation that our combined U.S. direct business will generate organic growth in the high single-digits. It also reflects revenue enhancement targets stemming from the Heartland merger that we expect to contribute roughly 50 basis points of growth in calendar 2017.","Canadian net revenue growth assumptions remained in the low single-digits in local currency. We expect North America operating margin to expand as we anticipate realizing operating efficiencies and synergies from the Heartland merger throughout the year. In Europe, we expect net revenue on a constant currency basis to grow in the mid-teens, including the impact of the Erste transaction. FX headwinds in Europe, especially the British pound, are forecasted to impact net revenues meaningfully resulting in expected reported growth in the mid single-digits. Operating margin in Europe is expected to decrease in calendar 2017 primarily due to the impacts of foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, operating margins in Europe are expected to expand slightly.","Asia-Pacific is expected to deliver U.S. dollar net revenue growth in the low double-digits. Operating margin is expected to expand in calendar 2017 as we continue to improve our scale in this market. Our effective tax rate for calendar 2017 is projected to approach 28%. In connection with our integration efforts, we had identified planting opportunities for the combined business that we expect to generate ongoing savings which will materialize in our effective tax rate going forward. Our diluted weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 155 million. We anticipate that we will invest approximately $160 million in capital expenditures in calendar 2017.","We are extremely pleased with the record performance we achieved in the second quarter. Importantly, we have also made significant progress with our integration positioning us to exceed our original target for run-rate expense synergies from the merger. As we begin 2017, we remain enthusiastic about our ability to maintain the positive momentum in our business, which is obviously reflective in our outlook for the year.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Cameron. We are delighted with our second quarter results and the substantial progress we have made in integrating Heartland. Our team across the world continued to perform very well and as we look towards calendar 2017, we remain focused on continuing our track record of superior execution in generating strong returns for our shareholders. Isabel?","Isabel Janci","Before we begin our question-and-answer sessions, I would like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Glenn Greene","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Very nice quarter.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Glenn.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Glenn.","Glenn Greene","So first maybe Jeff, I mean, obviously, I heard sort of the specific commentary related to our Heartland in terms of the costs revenue synergies whatnot, but just talk a little bit more qualitatively about how the integration is going a little bit more on the sales progress, what\u2019s allowing you to increase the cost synergy target and it did sound like you included at this point 50 basis points within the revenue guidance?","Jeff Sloan","Hey, Glenn. It\u2019s Jeff, I\u2019ll start and I will ask David and Cameron to join thereafter. So we have been partners with Heartland at this point for 6 months since from the close \u2013 since the date of November. I would tell you probably 5 to 6 months I believe were record new sales at Heartland. I think we have been successful in doing what we do in our partnership, because as we have done with the Ezidebit, APT and PayPros really enabling the people who are best suited to continue the acceleration of their business to go ahead and do that without interference from us here in Atlanta. And I think that\u2019s really not different at Heartland than it was at Ezidebit, APT and PayPros. And of course, those new sales are now translating into revenue in calendar 2017. I think we are focused on what we think we can do best here at corporate, which is enabling cross sales into additional regions around the world, which we described I think now in the last three calls as well as providing a consistent, stable technology and operating environment for the whole company, but in particular, for Heartland. David, do you want to talk a little bit more some of the...","David Mangum","Yes, Jeff, I\u2019d be happy to. I mean, I can amplify that a little bit Glenn, again when you look around, I would start by saying that the sales leadership that was in place when we executed the merger is still in place. We have moved some things around. We have actually restructured a little bit, but that\u2019s all as a platform for the next phase of growth. So, the same leaders in place as you would expect, by the way, that\u2019s our track record around the world as you know whether you are in the UK or Asia, you run into a local leader who knows the markets and then we enable cross sales, we enable synergies, we enable consistency of service levels, that\u2019s what we do best, so really happy with the team. They are making great progress as you have already heard from some of the sales and Jeff\u2019s prepared comments, really good progress around the world. That all resulted in 10% transaction growth for Heartland between the holiday period and far more than that with e-commerce. E-commerce was much, much higher than that, but all in that was a really nice number for the peak holiday period. In addition, just in the period we have owned Heartland, that sales team has delivered low-teen sales growth, record months, month after month, as Jeff noted, so really happy with the trajectory. But don\u2019t miss the fact that beyond that, we are selling leads that they generate abroad. We have closed a lead in the UK. We closed Heartland\u2019s first deal in Puerto Rico. And also don\u2019t miss the fact that it\u2019s beyond just that sales force, right. It\u2019s also the TouchNet Campus Solutions where we sold a deal in Canada just this past quarter. To an existing software customer we sold them Global Payments payment solutions. And then obviously at Heartland, commerce continues to make great progress in Canada as well where we are selling our gift platform to Canadian customers of Global Payments as well as Canadian customers of our dealers. So, all-in really good momentum starts with the fact that it\u2019s an integration strategy matter. We wanted to keep the team in place and better equip them to sell more and all that\u2019s working just as planned right now.","Cameron Bready","Hey, Glenn. It\u2019s Cameron. I will wrap up maybe just spend a moment on the expense side of the equation. As David highlighted and I think I have said before, our priority from an integration point of view has always been not to disrupt the sales momentum in the business and I think we have done a particularly good job of that as we work through the last 7 or 8 months since closing the transaction in April. On the expense side, we have identified incremental opportunities relative to what we assumed going into the transaction, particularly in the area of corporate support functions. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we also have identified some tax planning initiatives between the two companies that we think will yield some tax benefits that flow through the effective tax rate. We have also identified incremental savings in our operating environment. So, we have been able to leverage as we look to combine operating centers here in the U.S. and continue to leverage our offshore in the Philippines. So from our point of view, again, we have raised our overall synergy run-rate targets to $135 million from the prior $125 million. A lot of the technology integration work is still in front of us. I think we remain optimistic about our ability to realize obviously the synergies that we have targeted in that area, but much of that work is still yet to come, but sitting here today, I think we are pretty enthusiastic about where we sit.","Glenn Greene","And Cameron, a little bit different direction but a segue so the North American margin performance was up 160 basis points and as you suggested that it has some margin dilution actually from Heartland. But could you talk about what\u2019s sort of happening with North America profitability, I think its two quarters in a row where you sort of significantly beat our expectations? And I want to get a sense for the core GPN North America ex-Heartland and then how much is coming from synergies?","Cameron Bready","Yes, Glenn, it\u2019s hard to disaggregate the synergy expansion to each individual driver. I will talk about it more from a macro point of view and then share a little bit of color around just how the underlying business had performed, but I think also obviously contributes to the results we have seen. So as we look at the core business, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our estimate for Heartland growth in the quarter on an organic basis in the direct sales channel was roughly low double-digits, so think about as kind of 11%, 12%. Legacy GPN, we also view as being in the low double-digits in the quarter as well, probably 10%, 11% this quarter, both accelerating sequentially from the first quarter. When those businesses \u2013 those direct sales businesses, which are higher margin businesses are growing at that pace, that\u2019s obviously going to contribute to margin expansion in a fairly meaningful way. In addition to that, our technology led businesses in the U.S., our integrated business as well as our software-driven businesses at Heartland, Heartland commerce, campus solutions, school solutions each of those grew either high single, low double in the quarter as well. Those are higher margin businesses. They are also contributing to the margin expansion we saw in the quarter. And then lastly, synergies are naturally an important driver of margin expansion in the business. They help us to absorb the margin degradation that we obviously have assumed with Heartland coming in at a lower margin. But the growth we have seen in the business has helped offset some of that to a large degree coupled with our ability to realize expenses in the quarter has driven that certainly what we view to be fairly attractive margin expansion for the North American business.","Glenn Greene","Great. Thanks a lot.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Glenn.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Good morning. When we think about that organic growth in North America, I think it was high single-digits, the direct business in the first quarter and then obviously it accelerated to the low double-digits. I guess, what can you point to that cause that acceleration? And when you look at the guidance it looks like you guys are believing it will go back down or decelerate back to the high single-digits, which is still a good growth rate, but just want to understand the dynamics there?","Jeff Sloan","Hey, Bryan, it\u2019s Jeff. I will start off and I will ask Cameron to join me. So I would say really it\u2019s a continuation of the trend of strengthening of that business. As Cameron mentioned to Glenn, our higher growth, higher margin businesses both at legacy global and also at Heartland are accelerating. So when those businesses are already growing north of the market continue the rates of growth at better margin opportunities, you are naturally going to see higher rates of growth in North America really led by as we said in our prepared remarks, lead by OpenEdge, which 4.5 years after we closed that transaction in APT produced another mid-teens quarter. In many of the Heartland businesses, Heartland Payments, but also as Cameron said school, campus, Heartland commerce etcetera. So, I think it\u2019s really the businesses continue to hit their stride. As David mentioned, we have record sales months at Heartland. While that doesn\u2019t translate in general to immediate revenue acceleration, it does over the cycle of course. And now that it\u2019s been 6 months since we closed the Heartland transaction, our expectation is that they continue to see the benefits of that partnership in our rates of revenue growth. There is really no deceleration expectation into calendar 2017. As you know, our models that we have been articulating certainly since our Investor Day in October \u201815 and updated in December \u201815 post the announcement of our partnership with Heartland is high single-digits organic growth. So, I would read into, gee, you produced the 11 and 12 and now you are saying high single-digits any other Bryan than a reiteration of what our model is over the cycle. Obviously, we are giving guidance here on January 9 for all of calendar \u201817. As you know, with our history, it\u2019s important for us to make sure we are in the trajectory heading into the calendar year.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, did the Mercury migration still impact results? And when does, if you could quantify that, when does that officially anniversary going forward? Thanks and congrats on the super quarter.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Bryan.","Cameron Bready","Sure. Thanks, Bryan. It\u2019s Cameron. I will jump in on that. So, Mercury did impact obviously the quarter as it relates to reported net revenue. Our ISO or wholesale business was down low double-digits again this quarter similar to Q1 as we have not yet annualized the anniversary of Mercury migrating off. That will happen really at the end of the first quarter of calendar 2017. So at that point, I would expect it to no longer be a headwind to growth. Obviously, we have clearly grown through that from an earnings point of view. It\u2019s really a revenue optic issue that we have been managing through here over the last 9 months or so since they really migrated off of us, so that we anniversary at the end of the first quarter of Q1. At that point, we would expect the wholesale business in calendar \u201817 beyond that point to essentially be flat to maybe down slightly as we have been guiding for the last couple of years.","Bryan Keane","Okay, super. Thanks.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Bryan.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen. Your line is now open.","George Mihalos","Great, thanks and congrats on another nice quarter guys. Wanted to start off on the U.S. business as well and just looking at the 50 basis points of enhancement from Heartland, is that all cross-sell or is there some pricing that\u2019s built into that? And I am just wondering broadly in the U.S., is it macro that feels better to you or do you just think that you are executing better and that\u2019s what coming in through the numbers?","David Mangum","Yes. George, I will start. This is David and let the other guys chime in. In back half of your question, I would say it\u2019s not macro. We think it\u2019s actually very good execution and very well positioned businesses. When we are tech-led as we are software-enabled we think we are in the right spot. You will find other competitors talking about just beginning to think about entering the integrated space right now. Obviously we are 5 years into that process and really still continuing to grow great there. So, I would look to good execution, a good combination of assets and obviously, cross-sell is helping us drive enhanced growth beyond what one might expect from the space.","In terms of your direct question about revenue synergies for the year driving the kinds of numbers that Cameron quoted in his prepared comments, there are really a couple of categories. There is some new products of rolling out based on the combined technologies. There is also sort of some new sales strategies and then finally their economic enhancements. I will talk about each for just a moment. Couple of new projects are our insights products, which is high level analytics where we can combine our payments information with customer information for a restaurant and our commerce business as well as our payments business to give small to medium-sized customers exactly what we talked about in our Analyst Day 1.5 years ago which is the same abilities that their much larger competitors have to take data \u2013 to take new versus repeat customers and total visits and sales volumes and day park sales and things like that and analyze that and drive that into marketing campaigns and loyalty campaigns. There is a new lending with series of products we are bringing out as well that we are re-enabling for the sales force of Heartland now making it much easier for the reps to sell without marketing campaigns and some new technologies. So that\u2019s all new revenue growth that wasn\u2019t in the combined basis before.","When I talk about new sales strategies, I will give you one example of that, which is really an inside sales strategy we have just initiated over the past few months with the sales force based out of Heartland and that\u2019s the ability to go chase white spaces that Heartland never chased in the past. So, Heartland has traditionally and rightfully been focused on towns and cities and metropolitan areas as we spread our 1,500 reps around the country. There is a lot of business in between those spaces that we can chase with inside sales and either turn that over to a face to face rep, close it ourselves turn into a lead, etcetera, etcetera, so nice numbers, they can come out of that over time, selling in between Cincinnati and Columbus, for example, instead of just adding Columbus metro areas. It\u2019s a really nice stuff there. And then finally, it\u2019s really I would call it the area of sort of economic enhancements and really what we are doing there we will not price for price\u2019s sake. We are matching economics the way we create real value for customers. We believe the combination of Global Payments and Heartland provides world-class service on an industry leading infrastructure. We ought to be able to be compensated for that. It\u2019s pretty simple. So we have kicked off certain initiatives with the sales team to ensure we are compensated where we are providing high-value and incremental value beyond what the market provides to our customers. Possible examples of that includes maybe the types of reporting we provide, recognizing the value of this extensive compliance infrastructure that we at, Global Payments, have built over these past few years and then the high touch customer service we operate in and out of our Jeffersonville facility. Really what we are just ensuring is that we match our economics to the value creation and the investments we have made. So, all those things would add up into the revenue synergy commentary that Cameron provided.","George Mihalos","Great. Appreciate that. And just as a quick follow-up maybe on the M&A side you guys talked a lot about software and some of your software-led solutions. Should we expect Global to be more acquisitive on the software point-of-sale front?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, George. It\u2019s Jeff. What I would say is it\u2019s really an extension of our technology enabled distribution discussion that we have been having since really our October \u201815 Analyst Day. I think that our perspective is, as we said in the Analyst Day, that\u2019s our third of the company\u2019s revenues generating the vast majority of its growth. I think we have been very successful as we discussed on today\u2019s release over a period of multiple years. With that strategy, we have made progress as Cameron described, with our partners at Heartland in bringing some of their nonpayment specific, but technology enabled related businesses to grow far faster than the market. And that\u2019s something we think is a key theme heading over the next period of time in our cycle. So, I would say yes to your question, but I really view it as a subset that technology-enabled discussion that we have been having since October 2015. If we can find businesses that are in our sweet spot, George, they are growing at 2x to 3x the rate of the market rate of growth at very attractive margins north of where we are trading, north of where we are operating and we have been going to accelerate those with what we do not just in the United States but globally, those are pretty good positions for us to be in.","David Mangum","Maybe if I could put a finer point on that too, Jeff. George, if we can find technology businesses that look like OpenEdge or campus or commerce, so cloud-based SaaS solutions where we can innovate in a defined vertical market, provide software-enabled solutions as well as commerce solutions and payment solutions. That\u2019s very attractive as in a place where software and payment solutions compliment each other. So, I would maybe say it\u2019s not as simple as we are looking for point-of-sale software companies. We are looking for places where software naturally drives payments and payments naturally drives software where they compliment each other and we can drive enhanced growth the way Jeff described it.","George Mihalos","That makes sense. Thanks, guys.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, George.","David Mangum","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. Good morning, Jeff, David, Cameron.","Jeff Sloan","Good morning.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","My congratulations for the results as well. I want to ask about the political assumptions that you guys are making, I guess, both on the Brexit front or the impact, not just limited to FX, there is more discussion about the possible downturn in the UK economy in the near-term and then Trump assumptions here in the U.S. Any preliminary comments about how you are planning for potential changes in tax rate, maybe regulation interchange, repatriation and things like that?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Ashwin, it\u2019s Jeff. I will start off. So, let me take the second point first, because the U.S., of course, represents two-thirds of the revenue of the company. As I said over the last number of months since the election, there is really nothing but good news coming out of the U.S. economy and the political environment here in the United States in the immediate to near-term. Our business as we have just described in our second quarter and David was alluding to a few minutes ago our business is experiencing very good growth and very good margins with very low attrition and that\u2019s all prior to the election. And David also gave a description of our experience during the holiday season at Heartland. So, I really don\u2019t think that there is anything in the election in the United States for two-thirds of business, which is anything but help our view of where our business is going, especially with targeted economy and getting GDP to grow more quickly in a stable environment. So we are performing very well before that. I think we continue to see indications as we suggested in our guidance that we will continue to see that. So I am very confident in our business here in the United States. People, for example, have asked about touching Durban post the election. As we said many times, I think any change to interchange up or down generally is good news for our business. Obviously, our markets are highly competitive and those all dissipate over periods of time, but we have a lot of experience, for example, with the networks of touching pricing initiatives twice a year across most of our markets. So up or down, there is really no difference in many of the things that we see perhaps on some of the regulatory reforms than we have seen before in other elements of our business. As it relates to Brexit, I think Cameron said it\u2019s exactly right in our prepared remarks, we probably have one of the best performances we have ever had across Europe, in particular, in the United Kingdom and of course, also Spain, but for purposes of Brexit in the United Kingdom, we also had a very good experience in our omni-channel solutions as Cameron also described based in Ireland, which is part of EU and not real X. So I think as we look at our business, we haven\u2019t seen any impact, in fact, quite the opposite we performed quite nicely in our UK and European EU related businesses since the June 23 vote and the like. So it\u2019s really been a story of FX to the point that you made around the euro and around the pound.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And just a separate question completely, I guess, are you seeing different trends between integrated payments versus software enablement, so any relative pros and cons to actually owning the software versus integrating?","David Mangum","Yes, Ashwin, it\u2019s David. I think what we see with both these businesses is properly positioned and properly executed. You have got really nice growers. As Cameron pointed out another quarter of mid-teens growth from OpenEdge, really nice double-digit and mid-teens growth from our key TouchNet software and other campus solutions assets, so we like the characteristics. I think what you will see us do is continue to look at the right way to serve verticals and go deeper by marrying technology to payments. So, in many cases, that\u2019s partnering like in OpenEdge with this amazing degree of integration we provide to multiple verticals than the campaign management managing the partner base. In other verticals we are going to look closely and say wow, the integration is so tight between the software and the payments and this is a vertical that\u2019s not competitive anywhere else in our space. So, why don\u2019t we think about pursuing the entire vertical ourselves and own the entire technology stack, that\u2019s what campus does, that\u2019s what we do in commerce. Each of which has zero over level OpenEdge. So you can see we have the opportunity to blank at the United States vertical by vertical, customizable flexible solutions and then uniquely unlike anyone else in the space globalize the same solutions, take them abroad with our technology infrastructure and our unique sales reach.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Understood. Thank you, guys. Congratulations again.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oscar Turner of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Oscar Turner","Good morning. Congrats on a strong quarter.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Oscar.","Oscar Turner","So just to follow-up to one of the answers from a previous question, could you quantify the potential runway to upside from pricing to Heartland portfolio to value?","Cameron Bready","Yes, Oscar, it\u2019s Cameron, I will jump in. I would say sitting here today, I would leverage off the comments we made when we announced the Heartland transaction back in December of 2015. At that time, we talked about 1% to 2% revenue enhancement opportunity coming from the merger over time. Obviously, the revenue side takes a little longer to scale as opposed to the expense side where you can start taking out cost fairly quickly and we have been able to I think do that very effectively since closing on the transaction in April. On the revenue enhancement side, sitting here today, we have targeted 50 basis points of expansion in our calendar 2017 guide. I view that as the foundation. Obviously, as we work towards the 1% to 2% we talked about back in December of 2015, which would represent about $30 million to $60 million of incremental revenue coming from these enhancement opportunities that David described earlier. I will just reiterate something he said and I think is very important, this is not pricing for pricing sake, this is obviously cross-selling between our various distribution channels both domestically, internationally, it\u2019s new product, it\u2019s a digital enhancement to our customers and it\u2019s ensuring again that we are paid and compensated appropriately for the level of value service and capability that delivering to our customers through our combined business.","Oscar Turner","Okay, thanks. And then the second question, you guys spoke a bit about some of the rest of world initiatives focused on the integrated channel. I was just wondering if you could provide some color on the size and penetration levels of the integrated opportunities in Europe and Asia and how do those compare to the integrated market in the U.S.?","David Mangum","Yes, Oscar, it\u2019s David. I am going to broadly answer the integrated question and suggest to you that we have substantial opportunities as we have enabled more and more platforms to sell fully integrated solutions across Europe and Asia. That includes something in Jeff\u2019s prepared comments, which is taking our micro-payments, unattended payment technology services around the world we are distributing that in Asia right now through a systems integrator. In addition, Heartland commerce, our restaurant hospitality SaaS-based integrated software solution can be sold all across Asia and all across Europe. We are enabling payment platforms to work with those folks as well and TouchNet, the software solution that powers campus solution is enabled for Puerto Rico, Canada and shortly UK and Asia. We are actually investing in a sales force in Europe and in Asia to resell that combined campus solutions commerce solution of Global Payments\u2019 payments with Heartland software in the campus area and in fact, the next month or so, we should enable them selling that actively, so really good progress there. I think your question maybe about the integrated solutions globalization projects we kicked off about 1 year, 1.5 years ago we talked about the Analyst Day that continues to make great progress. So we have over 60 partners signed in Canada. We also have a number of partners signed in the UK. We are exploring broader integration, broadening that to Asia. In addition, we have taken U.S. based partners in the UK and Canada. We actually have delivered over 1,000 merchants in Canada and the UK by an OpenEdge globalization, which may not sound like an enormous amount in the greater context of Global Payments, but each of these singles adds up to enhanced growth around the world and that\u2019s just the beginning of taking integrated payments around the world. As you can tell from my comments earlier about the vertical software married to the OpenEdge globalization strategy.","Oscar Turner","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hey, good morning. Good acceleration here. Just on the two questions. Asia-Pac is running above trend now, a couple of quarters, well above trend. So you are guiding above I think your cycle guidance, which was high single-digits, so are you more confident in your distribution or is the market growth just maybe better than you thought?","Jeff Sloan","Hey, Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Jeff, I\u2019ll start. No, I think we are more confident in our execution, distribution strategy. So I certainly think that there is likely going to be some benefit heading forward as we annualized some of the macro issues that we had in Greater China. But even before we did, I think you alluded this in your question, this is probably the third quarter in a row where we are seeing very good performance not just of course at Ezidebit where we are a good partner for about 2.5 years now, but in what we called business as usual Asia, which is Asia ex-Australia and New Zealand. This quarter, in particular, we singled out Greater China, India and the Philippines, of course, outside of Australia and New Zealand. So, I would say it\u2019s better distribution strategies, better execution in technologies, better product environments, for example, I think we are the only payment services technology company that\u2019s enabled Apple Pay. In all the markets, Apple Pay is around the world. We obviously, as you know, have a common technological and operational infrastructure for almost all of our markets, including in particular in this conversation for Asia, especially the new Asia. Our partnership, which is now 1.5 year old with \u2013 back in the Philippine Islands is performing quite nicely and one of the fastest GDP growth economies in Asia, the Philippines where you now have 28% or second largest market share in that country. So I think Tien-tsin, it\u2019s the aggregation of all those factors. If you like to think that the market itself will continue to accelerate and make it easier for us and I think we are hopeful that\u2019s the case, particularly across Greater China, but what I would say though is I think it really is a team out there who has done a fantastic job probably in the last three quarters in a row of helping to take our business where it really hasn\u2019t been the last 7 years.","Cameron Bready","And Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Cameron, I will just add. On top of that, we have certainly improved scale in that business over the course of time. I think revenue in Asia since the end of fiscal \u201814 is up probably 75%. So if you are thinking about the business we are operating today, we have diversified distribution outside of kind of the Greater China market, those businesses tend to be growing at faster rates than even our Greater China businesses. We have created a much more scalable platform in that market. And I would certainly think what you have seen in Q1 and Q2 is the headwinds we saw in the Greater China markets back in fiscal \u201816 obviously have dissipated. We are seeing a more normalized macroeconomic environment that coupled with I think fantastic execution from our team there has really created a more optimistic outlook for what we can deliver in calendar 2017.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay, that\u2019s great and that\u2019s all good to know. So just my second question on the Heartland acceleration there, can you specify, is that coming more from the core merchant business or in the non-card variety both in revenue and new sales? Thanks.","David Mangum","Yes, Tien-tsin, it\u2019s David. I will give you some business probably like Cameron answer any direct math question, but I am not authorized to do that. So I point you back to a couple of things. One is we continue to post record sales month, so that\u2019s the core based merchant sales force which you are familiar, but I would point out, that merchant sales base is increasingly selling technology-enabled solutions. They are directly involved in each Heartland commerce sales and also involved in selling these add-on and cross-sell products. We are talking about each of which adds more value and more technology to our customers, but we are seeing consistent low-teen sales performance. As I said earlier, we had really nice double-digit transaction growth in the holiday period, much faster e-comm growth, so that core base is performing very, very well. And then the more integrated channels, the software-led technology-enabled channels, campus solutions and schools are both performing at double-digit or high single-digit levels led by TouchNet software, which is in its own mid-teens. And then of course, that obviously is bundled in or at least in terms conceptually bundled in for us with the rest of our tech solutions, the tech-enabled double-digit growers, mid-teens growers like OpenEdge. So really nice business performance across what you might think of as both sides of the Heartland channel, the traditional 1,500 sales folks as well as the tech-enabled software-led solutions in commerce school and campus.","Cameron Bready","And Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Cameron. I will just add a little bit of color around the math side of it as we talked about before clearly the Heartland sort of payment side of the business. As we talked about, our estimate was it grew low double-digits this quarter, call it 11%, 12%, somewhere in that range which was acceleration relative to Q1. I would say, the collective software businesses that David described also accelerated slightly in Q1 to Q2. In aggregate, those businesses probably grew low double-digits as well led by again, campus and commerce and school also had a good quarter growing in the high single-digits. So I\u2019d say each of those businesses performed very well in the quarter and accelerated to some degree relative to their Q1 performance, which contributed to the overall Q2 results.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok of KBW. Your line is now open.","Steven Kwok","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been answered already. Just following up on, I guess, two questions. One was just any early read into how December is doing given some of the, I would say, mixed retail sales numbers that we have been getting?","Jeff Sloan","Yes. Steven, I can tell you the high level December looks fine. It looks kind of down in the middle of fairway for us overall, particularly if you are asking about kind of the Heartland base that has that retail quick service restaurant and restaurant exposure. We think we have a solid sales month and solid transaction month.","Steven Kwok","Great. And then just around \u2013 are there any plans perhaps to hedge some of your FX and interest rate exposure, just wanted to see given both or the volatility around FX rates and then interest rates are expected to rise, just want to see your thoughts around that? Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Yes. Hey, Steven, it\u2019s Cameron. I will jump in there. On the FX side of the equation, we have talked about this a lot in the past and we were naturally hedged in, to some degree, in every market we operate in and around the world and that we have local denominated expenses associated primarily with our sales and distribution capabilities in markets. We don\u2019t do any sort of natural other hedging, excuse me, of FX exposures around the globe largely because we do the business as being a multinational business \u2013 part of being a multinational business is having foreign currency exposures. I think we took obviously a big amount of FX risk out of the business by virtue of executing the Heartland transaction which pivoted us from about 50-50 U.S. dollar to foreign currency exposure to roughly two-thirds U.S. dollar, which we think was a good thing for us to do in light of the strong dollar environment we have seen here over the last few years. But I wouldn\u2019t expect us to do \u201cderivative hedging\u201d of FX exposure around the globe. Again, we think that\u2019s just part of managing a multinational business. And we think the right way to operate the company more importantly is the way we are operating where a lot of the expense structure is U.S. dollar, because we are leveraging common technology and operating environments that are typically U.S. dollar driven, that\u2019s the most efficient way to operate and scale business like this. And I think that\u2019s the way we will continue to operate obviously going forward.","On the interest rate side, as we talked about before, we did enter into an incremental interest rate hedge $250 million notional amount in December that brings our total hedge position today to about $1 billion represents about 22% of our variable rate exposure. We do anticipate entering into additional interest rate hedges in calendar 2017 such that between debt reduction and incremental hedges, I would expect as we are exiting calendar 2017 to be towards our targeted hedge ratio of about 40% to 50%. We think that\u2019s the right place for us to be as a business. As you can imagine, our outlook for calendar 2017 assumes underlying rates are going to rise, so that is already baked into our expectations for calendar \u201817 as well as us entering into incremental hedges as we work through that targeted hedge position.","Steven Kwok","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Steven.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to just kind of dig into a question and it really pertains to each geography but starting in North America, when we think about the growth which has consistently been above market, how much would you attribute to kind of incremental product sales at our existing clients versus share gains from competitors or even kind of taking share from your legacy wholesale business?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Dan, it\u2019s Jeff, I will start. I will ask David to comment as well. What I would say is we probably have a 3 or 4-year history now of growing more quickly than the market and we also probably have a 3 or 4-year history on some of what we call our wholesale businesses like our ISO and direct businesses being relatively flat on a normalized basis and the margin environment speaks first in North America primarily United States, which is two-thirds of the company that\u2019s growing kind of mid single-digits call it 5% transactionally. It\u2019s kind of hard to separate product from new sales, because obviously what our sales folks are selling, particularly in some of our business units like Heartland but are also in OpenEdge and also in school and campus Heartland commerce, what they are selling are in many cases new products.","What I would say is at this point, American Express, OptBlue, which is something we sell last time talking about probably a couple of years ago as, I don\u2019t know like, Cameron, probably double or triple anniversary at this point. So large, stepwise functions of products that really neatly shift the revenue curve in a certain direction either double or triple anniversary those at this point here in the United States, obviously, we do a lot of these things all the time, but in terms of looking for those kind of quantum leap things, we just posted, as Cameron said, 11% or 12% depending on how you calculate legacy Global, legacy Heartland, U.S. direct growth business, yes, as we double or triple anniversary, something like AmEx and OptBlue. So clearly the majority of what is driving the growth is just better sales execution targeted at more attractive end markets. As you know, here in the U.S., we are primarily SME-focused not just at OpenEdge but also at Heartland. And I think historically, that\u2019s been a very good place to be and I think going forward with some of the things that happened the last couple of quarters in the election and everything else, I think that will continue to be a very attractive place to be. So, new product sales are something we knew all the time, but as you can see from our performance this quarter and over the last year or so, we certainly don\u2019t need to see step-like functions for us to continue to grow at rates like we have been growing at the last period of time.","David Mangum","Yes, I think Dan, I agree with that first it is about taking market share not about cross-sells, maybe I will push it just a little bit, if the question is really particularly about strategic initiatives for brand new cross-sells whether that\u2019s Heartland in cross-selling Heartland technology or global payments technology across the Heartland base and then broadening that for initiatives like the OpenEdge initiative I commented on earlier to Oscar\u2019s question, we are really just getting started on those. So you can see the beginnings of what we think can be the returns of that in the revenue enhancement guidance that Cameron set. Think ahead to \u201818, I am very confident these are going to be really meaningful numbers from \u201818 and beyond. We are planting seeds for all these cross-sells. We are planting seeds for these cross-sells right now. And in some ways, they are just getting started where what described is the way we run the business everyday. It\u2019s cross-sell. It\u2019s new products that we can sell in North America, then to UK, then to Asia as well. So, lots more to come I think over some period of time.","Dan Perlin","Okay. Yes. And I was just trying to figure out the \u2013 I mean, is the product portfolio still much bigger now than all these guys are going to market with it, that\u2019s just incrementally is driving a lot of business but it also is driving sales. It sounds like both but...","Jeff Sloan","I would say you have hit an important point there. So if you go back to I think we were answering to a previous question about our mix of businesses, so we were talking about technology enabled back certainly when we partnered with APT in 2012 and if you think back to October \u201815 Analyst Day we talked about tech-enabled being a third of the company driving 8% of revenue. We have got a bunch of our peers who have come out and said they hope to get in that business one day. I think it\u2019s important to understand that more people increasingly are selling is less of the traditional wholesale like sales referrals that you asked is the beginning part of your question and more of the products and services that are really dedicated to technology-enabled sales that are distinctive distribution team. So I do think you are seeing some of that in our numbers. I would talk it up to good strategy and good execution rather than step-like functions in a product where I certainly think we are seeing the benefits of having made those investments over time.","Dan Perlin","Yes. I didn\u2019t mean to belittle the execution. I was just trying to make sure I understood. I got just a quick \u2013 the calendar year cost synergies, I didn\u2019t hear that number and can you just briefly update us in terms on what your plan is for filling out the stub period for us in the future for calendar numbers? Thanks.","Jeff Sloan","Yes, both good questions, Dan. I didn\u2019t you a specific estimate for realized synergies in calendar 2017, so you are right to pickup on that. My expectation is about $90 million of realized synergies in calendar 2017. So that will translate into an exit rate of about 110, from which we will scale from there as we get into calendar 2018 as we wrap up a lot of the technology work that will get us to that overall 135 run-rate target that we are now seeking as the company. Secondly, to your other question, we are going to fill out calendar 2016 results when we finalize our stub period audits, which we are in the midst of beginning right now and file our 10-K for the transition period, it\u2019s a 10-K T, which we would expect to file towards the end of February or early March. That is a 10-K for the 7-month period from June 1 to December 31. Once we get that work done, we will fill out the calendars for 2016, so you can see obviously actual results for all of calendar 2016 as well as the quarterly distribution of results. Naturally, as you can tell from the growth rates we have given you today for our calendar 2017 guide you can back into our current estimate for calendar 2016 recognized that\u2019s based on 11 months of actual and 1 month of estimate for December as we are still in the process of closing those books.","Dan Perlin","Excellent. Thank you guys very much.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open.","Dave Koning","Yes. Hey, guys. Nice job.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Dave.","Dave Koning","Yes. I guess, two questions from Europe, I guess, first of all, just Spain and UK very strong this quarter. Can you just talk about in the UK we should see deceleration in the coming quarter just as you anniversary the interchange benefit, but Spain holds up strongly going forward, is that the right way to think about that?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair way to think about it, Dave. We will anniversary or did anniversary the pricing benefits in December that came into effect in the UK. We are seeing good, strong fundamental performance in the UK as we talked about in our prepared comments, double-digit growth led by very strong transaction and volume growth in market, but we are going to anniversary those pricing benefits which will create a little of a headwind as we go into the beginning of the year. I would say, Spain, Q2, fantastic performance again building off of market leading transaction and volume trends and the execution there has been superb. Our partnership with Caixa remains I think the gold standard for bank-based JVs around the world and continues to perform exceptionally well. So as we go into Q1, I think we feel good about how we are positioned in Europe, which obviously gives rise to our guide for the calendar year. Obviously, that\u2019s going to be impacted fairly significantly by FX headwinds largely from the pound in Europe.","Dave Koning","Got it. And that really transitions into my second question. So when you say for calendar \u201817 reported mid single-digit growth in Europe and constant currency growth of mid-teens when you include the acquisition, is that still low double-digits on an organic constant currency basis?","Jeff Sloan","It\u2019s probably going to be high single is my estimate, Dave, for Europe. It did probably double-digit in Q2. But again, as we go into the year, I would say, our expectation is the region the segment is going to perform kind of at our cycle guidance which would be high single-digit growth organically. Obviously, our guidance reflects a range of possible outcomes around the variety of factors including growth. But I think our base case assumption going into the year is that the Europe produces high single-digit organic growth. You get a little bit of benefit from not having anniversarying the Erste joint venture until June. And then obviously that produces an overall mid-teens expectation that ends up being mid-single when you factor in the fairly significant decline in the pound and euro in particular as well as the check run.","Dave Koning","Yes, makes sense. Great. Thank you. Nice job.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Dave.","Jeff Sloan","On behalf of Global Payments, thank you very much for joining our call this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will open the lines for questions-and-answers. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference will be recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.","Winnie Smith","Good morning and welcome to Global Payments fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 conference call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today\u2019s conference call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and any subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligations to update them.","Some of the comments made refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net revenue, adjusted net revenue plus network fees, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our trended financial highlights, both of which are available in the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO and Cameron Bready, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Winnie. 2018 was an outstanding year for Global Payments strategically, operationally, and financially. We generated the highest adjusted net revenues plus network fees, adjusted operating margins and adjusted earnings per share in our company\u2019s history. We also continued to execute on our technology enabled, software driven payment strategy further widening our competitive note. In addition, we delivered double-digit organic constant currency growth and strong margin expansion across all markets each quarter, while also producing the fastest rate of earnings per share growth for the year that we had yet achieved.","These results exceeded the raised cycle targets we outlined at our investor conference last March, as well as the 2018 guidance we provided at this time last year. Further, we are especially pleased that we were able to build upon the success of our 2017 results which had set a record for our performance at that time. We have a consistent track record of delivering on our commitments, and 2018 was no exception. ","Turning to the fourth quarter specifically, we maintained a strong topline momentum we experienced all year, again delivering, constant currency organic growth. Notably, we witnessed peak holiday transactional volume during the quarter, led by US Direct and ecomm\/omni-channel businesses. We also expanded adjusted operating margin by 80 basis points and produced adjusted earnings per share growth of over 24%, ramming out a fantastic 2018. ","Results this quarter and year were again fueled by our unwavering focus on the three pillars of our growth strategy and broad based strength across our technology businesses. As a reminder, we expect technology enabled distribution to represent 60% of our revenue and drive a significant portion of our growth by the end of 2020, with a balanced portfolio across owned SaaS, partnered software and ecomm and omni-channel assets. ","We made substantial progress against this objective in 2018 and our results highlights the successes our strategic initiatives have produced to date. As it relates to our software-driven payment strategy, we meaningfully enhanced our portfolio during 2018 with the addition of two marquee vertical market businesses; SICOM and AdvancedMD. It is worth noting that we have a long track record of integrating technology businesses over many years, while also retaining and motivating leadership and accelerating growth. ","Beginning with APT in 2012, followed by PayPros in 2014 and Heartland in 2016. We have proven our ability to sustain momentum in technology enablement. Our investments have created a differentiated, defensible, resilient and more predictable model, and we fully expect to do the same going forward as we continue to advance this strategy. The integration of SICOM with Xenial is well underway. ","We are already going to market with combined solutions and initial customer reception has been overwhelmingly positive. One early data point, we recently signed a large coffee chain with more than 300 locations in the Pacific Northwest to our existing (inaudible) at 50,000 quick service restaurants or QSRs. The restaurant vertical is the quint-essential example of the type of market we target. Sizeable, worldwide and stoke, distinctive, recession resistant and relatively insulated from dis-remediation especially at the QSR level. ","Through the combination of Xenial and SICOM, the end-to-end capabilities we offer to every customer segment of the vertical, neatly positions us as a one-stop shop for software, mobile and payment services in this $4 billion targeted addressable market worldwide. Our footprint is broad and diverse spanning restaurants and food service measurement providers across 50 plus countries. More to come on our market-leading suite of tech solutions on our first quarter 2019 call. ","Turning to AdvancedMD or AMD, referrals by its specialized sales force to OpenEdge increased 50% year-on-year in the month of January alone. While the team also made hundreds of referrals for Heartland payroll in the first 60 days post close. At the same time, the Heartland sales organization has begun leveraging existing relationships with physician practices in the community they serve to bring new customer opportunities to AMD.","The proof is in the performance, and AMD had terrific sales results in the fourth quarter, with bookings up nearly 50% year-over-year to the highest level in its history. As we expected when we announced the transaction in August 2018, the outlook for this business could not be brighter. Finally, ACTIVE also had strong bookings momentum once again in the fourth quarter as it continues to acquire new logos and expand business with existing partners building on a very strong sales performance in the back half of 2018. ","It\u2019s been a year and a half since we partnered with ACTIVE and the business is on track with the financial expectations we outlined at the time of the deal. The fantastic results we have delivered across these assets demonstrates that our approach to managing software business is as highly affective and bolsters our confidence in our software strategy as we enter 2019. ","How did we achieve such progress across these businesses? It starts with our disciplined approach to acquisitions and our unwavering focus on identifying opportunities that align strategically and culturally, while also allowing us to generate attractive returns. Once we closed an acquisition, we follow a core and edge approach to integrating and operating those businesses. ","Let\u2019s take the second one first; our edge businesses continue to do what they do best, which ensuring that our software solutions maintain market leadership position. The management teams we retained know their customers, understand the product needs of their markets in our quest to make the best decisions to drive innovation and improve functionality. Global Payments support these priorities at scale with extensive experience in onshore and offshore development and we provide efficient sources of capital to invest in growth. ","At the core, we also leverage our capabilities to expand and monetize the payments opportunities transactionally that are inherent in these businesses on a local and global basis. In addition we provide support through scaled technology infrastructure and architecture, compliance and information security to just name a few. Lastly and importantly, we bring worldwide distribution and significant cross-selling opportunities with localized product offerings and a global sales force to accelerate standalone growth. By marrying our distribution capabilities with their technologies we are better equipped collectively to enhance rates of sustained growth and to scale the combined businesses more affectively. ","Moving to our partnership business at OpenEdge, I\u2019m delighted to report that we signed a record number of new ISV partners in 2018. Notable wins include ChiroTouch, a leading chiro practice management software solution, and [Tyro] Technologies, a software leader in the municipality and local government vertical. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that this momentum has continued its 2019 with a recent signing of one of our largest partners to date in ASI, a leading provider of software solutions to member-based non-profit organizations worldwide. ","This partnership highlights the competitive differentiation of our integration payments technologies in combination with our single API capabilities across our markets. ChiroTouch, (inaudible) ASI are all examples of recent competitive wins for OpenEdge, reinforcing our superior growth proposition in the most attractive vertical markets in integrated payments. ","Finally, we continue to add Vista Equity portfolio companies as partners including most recently with PowerSchool in the educational market. PowerSchool provides an innovative K through 12 education technology platform fueling school operations, classroom management, student growth and family engagement. We remain excited about the pipeline and future opportunities in this portfolio.","The second pillar of our strategy, our worldwide e-commerce and omni-channel businesses, continued its track record of strong growth in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net revenues plus network fees for these businesses have more than doubled over the past three years. Last quarter, we [recharged] our unique ability to deliver high value-add solutions globally in the virtual and physical worlds for our core SMB customers as well as for sophisticated multinationals. And with the rollout of our unify commerce platform later this month, we\u2019ll be able to provide a single payment solution worldwide through a sole instance of 1 API. ","We expect some of the largest and most complex omni-channel customers globally to code to this specification which will drive higher acceptance and lower fees worldwide. The third element of our strategy is our ongoing commitment to expanding our presence in faster payments markets with attractive fundamentals. To that end, we are delighted to announce the official launch of our joint venture in January, with our long standing partner HSBC in Mexico. ","We are already beginning to leverage our best-in-class sales capabilities and we expect to bring leading technologies to Mexico in future periods as we have successfully done worldwide. This new partnership highlights the durability and a continued expansion of our relationships with some of the most complex financial institutions globally, a key competitive point of differentiation for Global Payments, and the success of our existing bank joint ventures in markets like Central Europe with Erste Bank and in Spain with CaixaBank, makes the partner of choice for the most sophisticated financial institution counterparts. ","One final thought on recent industry trends; technology is transforming our industry and we believe that we are at the forefront of leading that change. Externally we go to market with a balanced mix of owned SaaS and partnered software assets with substantial exposure to trending e-commerce and omni-channel businesses against the backdrop of faster growth payments markets. ","Internally, we utilize cloud based SaaS technologies across nearly all of our infrastructure from sales management to data analytics to finance accounting and human resources. In fact, we believe we are the largest user of (inaudible) cloud in financial technology globally and it\u2019s just one point of reference. ","Over the last five plus years, we\u2019ve invested more than $2 billion organically in our technology environments complimented by substantial investments in inorganic partnerships. Competitors without their technological and financial capacity to make those types of investments will increasingly find themselves on the outside looking in, and will remain consistent share donors, and they will find their alternatives to be less attractive as time goes on. ","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Cameron. ","Cameron Bready","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. 2018 was another outstanding year for Global Payments. Consistent strong execution of our growth strategy and a constructive macro backdrop allowed us to deliver financial results exceeding our expectations, despite greater than anticipated incremental headwinds from foreign currency in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. ","For the full year, total company adjusted net revenue plus network fees was $3.97 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 15% over 2017, predominantly driven by low double-digit constant currency organic growth. Importantly, we delivered consistent growth performance across all four quarters, highlighting our topline durability, supported by our technology-enabled, software-driven payment strategy. ","Adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 31.7% and adjusted earnings per share increased 29.4% to $5.19. We are delighted with the results we are able to achieve which were not only solidly ahead of our cycle guidance, but delivered while also successfully executing on a full M&A pipeline, including the completion of three software acquisitions and our strategy partnership with HSBC in Mexico. ","For the fourth quarter, total company adjusted net revenues plus network fees was $1.04 billion, a 12% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017, which includes an approximately 200 basis points headwind from foreign currency, nearly 100 basis points worse than we had expected when we guided back in October. Adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 31.6% and adjusted earnings per share grew 24.3% to $1.33. Adverse foreign currency rates impacted margin expansion in the quarter by approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.03 to $0.04. ","North America adjusted net revenue plus network fees was $765 million, reflecting growth of 14%, which included an approximately 100 basis points headwind from the Canadian dollar. In the US, our direct businesses again contributed low double digit organic growth, led by continued strength in our integrated and vertical markets business. AdvancedMD and SICOM contribution in the quarter was at the higher end of our prior guidance. ","Our wholesale business declined mid-teens consistent with our expectations and stated strategy to pivot away from this distribution channel. Similar to last quarter, our Canadian business was significantly impacted by weakness in the Canadian dollar, resulting in a reported decline of nearly 4%. North American adjusted operating margin expanded by 160 basis points to 32.3% despite some pressure from our recent acquisitions as expected and adverse foreign currency exchange rate. ","Moving to Europe, reported adjusted net revenue plus network fees grew 8% or approximately 12% on a constant currency basis, well ahead of our high-single digit organic growth rate. Our UK business continues to perform well despite a challenging GDP growth environment delivering mid-single digit local currency growth for the quarter. Our Spanish business produced another exceptional quarter generating mid-teens growth in local currency, aided by a constructive market environment and terrific execution in collaboration with our partner, Caixa.","Pipelines of our Erste JV again delivered strong local currency growth as our ability to bring new technology and solutions to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania is driving growth well in excess of the market and meaningfully ahead of our own expectations. Our e-commerce and omni-channel solutions business in Europe again grew mid-teens as we continue to enhance our differentiated offering [needed] by e-commerce platform. ","European adjusted operating margin was 47.7% for the quarter, roughly flat as compared against 2017, widely due to the impact of foreign currency headwinds. Finally, our Asia Pacific business reported adjusted net revenue plus network fees growth of 10% or nearly 14% on a constant currency basis. Strength was again broad based across our key markets in Asia including Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia. ","Adjusted operating margin in Asia expanded 30 basis points to 34.4%, as strong organic growth was partially offset by significantly adverse foreign currency exchange rates and reinvestment in the business. GAAP investments for the full year of 2018 totaled $213 million and again included substantial investments in new product innovation that support future growth opportunities. The strong financial performance we delivered across our businesses and geographies drove adjusted free cash flow of approximately $270 million for the quarter and approximately $860 million for the full year, excluding acquisition and integration cost. This free cash flow and generation supported an ambitious capital allocation plan in 2018. ","During the year, we invested $1.2 billion in M&A to advance our technology enabled strategy including our acquisitions of AdvancedMD and SICOM as well as Central Education, a small acquisition in Australia we completed in late Q4. Central is a leading provider of cloud based enterprise SaaS solutions and cater to our school in Australia. A vertical market we know well and one where we have already demonstrated the efficacy of our ownership strategy. ","In addition to acquisitions, we also executed a total of approximately $200 million of share repurchases to return capital to shareholders. Perhaps less importantly, we executed against this capital allocation plan while still ending the year at a leverage ratio of 3.5 times, positioning the business with a strong balance sheet and meaningful investment capacity as we enter 2019. ","Additionally, we executed a total of $1.25 billion of interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter, further reducing our exposure to rising rates. Our debt portfolio is approximately 40% hedged and we continue to expect it to be nearly 50% hedged by the end of 2019. Going forward, our priority from a capital allocation standpoint remains investment in the business to support our growth initiatives, including M&A. That said, given our current leverage and expected free cash flow generation in 2019, absent any near-term opportunities to reinvest in our business, you should expect us to officially return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. ","To that end, our Board recently approved an increase to our existing share repurchase authorization, raising the total available to $750 million. As we look ahead to 2019, the momentum in our business positions us to deliver another year of exceptional financial results. For 2019, we expect adjusted net revenue plus network fees to range from $4.43 billion to $4.49 billion, reflecting growth of 12% to 13% over 2018 or 13% to 15% on a constant currency basis. This outlook reflects low-double digit normalized organic constant currency excluding our wholesale business at the high end of our cycle guidance. It also reflects a 100 basis points to 200 basis points headwind from foreign currency exchange rates which we anticipate will be heavily weighted to the first half of the year. ","We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by up to 70 basis points, which is also consistent with our cycle guidance, notwithstanding the negative impact of anticipated (inaudible) as well as slight pressure from our recent acquisitions as we previously communicated. Absent these items, larger expansion would be in excess of 100 basis points well ahead of our cycle guidance. ","With respect to the more detailed underlying this outlook, we expect North America\u2019s adjusted net revenue plus network fees to grow low to mid-teens in 2019, which includes anticipated headwinds from the Canadian dollar predominantly in the first half of the year. This reflects low-double digit normalized growth in our US direct channels, which will be partially offset by a mid-teen decline in our wholesale business. ","We anticipate AdvancedMD and SICOM will contribute approximately $125 million and $100 million respectively in adjusted net revenue plus network fees in 2019, consistent with our initial guidance. Further, we expect low single digit growth in local currency in Canada, which we anticipate will be more than offset by pressure from Canadian dollar exchange rates. ","In Europe, we are forecasting adjusted net revenue plus network fees on a local currency basis to grow high-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, our outlook reflects an approximately 500 basis points headwind from foreign currency in 2019, again with much of this impacting the first half of the year. Adjusted operating margin in Europe is expected to be roughly flat for the year, largely due to the impacts of currency headwinds and further investments we are making to expand our Erste partnership in to mews markets. ","Asia Pacific is expected to deliver local currency organic growth in the low-double digits, while we anticipate currency exchange rates will be a headwind of approximately 300 basis points to 400 basis points, Central Ed approximately 200 basis points to grow for the year. Adjusted operating margin is expected to expand in 2019, although it will be somewhat negatively impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rates. We expect net interest expense of approximately $230 million for the year with respect to our hedging strategy and the Board for interest rates and we are forecasting an effective tax rate of approximately 20% for 2019.","Bringing it all together, we currently expect 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.10, reflecting growth of 14% to 18% over 2018. This includes an approximately $0.10 to $0.15 headwind from adverse foreign currency exchange rates. Absent this headwind, we would expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6 to $6.25 or 16% to 20% growth over 2018. ","Lastly, we expect capital investments for the year of approximately $230 million. Based on this level of reinvestment and the strong financial performance we are forecasting, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in 2019, a significant milestone for Global Payments. We are delighted with the financial and operational results we delivered in 2018, while also making substantial progress on our strategy. We added leading software assets to our portfolio with AdvancedMD, SICOM and Central, made investments to further differentiate our e-comm and omni-channel platform, and expanded our long standing partnerships in to new, faster growing markets. We look forward to building on our successes and delivering another year of strong performance in 2019. ","With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff. ","Jeff Sloan","Thanks Cameron. The differentiated nature of our business model has never been clearer and those companies not on the forefront of technological innovation in our industry will find it difficult to sustain market rates of growth with increasingly few alternatives. Our record performance in 2018 and our expectations for 2019 underscores how deep the mold we have constructed has become. We don\u2019t need a litany of excuses to justify our results; rather our performance speaks for itself. ","2017 was a year of integration, 2018 was a year of investment, and 2019 will be a year of reaping what we have sowed. We could not be more optimistic about our future prospects. We look forward to delivering on our commitment today, tomorrow and in the years ahead. Winnie. ","Winnie Smith","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I\u2019d like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator we will now go to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first question will come from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","David Togut","What impact if any do you see long term from the announced (inaudible) for state merger, specifically on the US merchant acquiring business, is there anything that they\u2019d be able to do as a combined company in merchant acquiring that you think they\u2019re not doing today?","Jeff Sloan","It\u2019s Jeff; I\u2019ll start and then ask Cameron to join as well. So I would say is, the first thing is that it really validates our focus on technology enabled distribution that we\u2019ve been following really now for the last five years. So if you think about the context of where that combined company is saying what they\u2019ve announced and where they\u2019re heading, they\u2019re much more focused on really domestic-only bank based relationship distribution. I think we have shown through our investments in technology north of $2 million over the last five plus years, our consistent ability to offer enhanced evaluated services to our customer base. I would say that while you asked about the United States, if you take the mile that we build, it is particularly attractive to worldwide financial institutions outside of the United States.","So we\u2019re seeing tremendous success as Cameron outlined in his financial commentary. It is really in the areas of staying with Caixa and Continental Europe, Central Europe with Erste and in Europe with HSBC, where it\u2019s really selling with those complicated large financial institutions globally is our technology enhanced solutions. In particular our vertical market software based solutions. And I think that those trends are ultimately going to come right here to the United States particularly towards the larger FIs. ","So what I would say is, if you don\u2019t have the financial and technical capacity David to make those investments then I think getting additional scale in relationship based businesses is going to make sense. I don\u2019t think that that has particular implications for us given our technology [advance]. But for others in the industry, who haven\u2019t been able to make those technology investments, I can certainly I think heightened competition in the relationship based areas domestically in the United States is something they\u2019re going to have to look at a number of years down the road. I think for us though it\u2019s an opportunity and really a validation of the investments we\u2019ve made over the last five years. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open. ","Brett Huff","Cameron I don\u2019t know if you went through this, but can you \u2013 did you tell us what the full year margin expansion would have been ex the M&A and FX hits. I think you said it was a 120 or 30 reported, but did you give us that kind of tweaked number? ","Cameron Bready","No, I didn\u2019t, that\u2019s a good question Brett. So for the full year, I was talking about it from the fourth quarter for the full year the 130 probably then the 140, 150 something in that ballpark absent the FX headwinds we saw in the back half of the year and a little bit pressure from the recent M&A that we\u2019ve executed. ","Brett Huff","I think you said the adjusted, kind of similar number would be a little over a 100 basis points going into this year, what are we spending extra on the 50 bps, is it (inaudible) FX, or is it a stepped up investment, are we taking advantage of sort of a market leadership position here to put the pedal to the metal on investments and leave folks a little further behind or kind of what\u2019s the reason for that (inaudible).1","Cameron Bready","It\u2019s a great question Brett, I would reference back to Jeff\u2019s comments. We continue to invest heavily in the business particularly in our technology environments, in our products and innovation to drive a differentiated model. And I think we\u2019ve seen over the course of time that that has proved to be a very wise thing to do as we continue to widen them out, we believe as it relates to our business versus competitors in the space. As it relates to 2019 in particular, I think, you have a couple of things, we\u2019re always balancing obviously reinvestment back into the business with what we want to flow through to the bottom line. ","Secondly if you recall in 2018, we had a little bit of a tailwind from the adoption of ASC 606, that obviously anniversaried at the end of 2018. So a little bit of benefit you saw in margin in 2018 from that don\u2019t exist in 2019. So 2019 is a pretty pure year to look at relative to our cycle guidance, which is up to 75 basis points annually. We\u2019re getting a little bit of pressure from the acquisition as we talked about previously, but again absent that, absent FX, we would have been north of 100 which is the relative comparison against the 75 basis point targets. So we feel really good about the balance I think we\u2019re striking in 2019, as it relates to reinvestment in the business, as well as obviously continuing to drive strong bottom line growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Jeff, could you elaborate a little bit on your commentary regarding the rest of the world vertical software momentum, is this given that Europe in particular I think is somewhat behind the US in terms of the integrated and vertical software, could \u201919 be a year where we reach a tipping point in terms of adoption? It sounds like maybe you\u2019re talking about or suggesting there might be some other FI partnerships out there for you too?","Jeff Sloan","It\u2019s Jeff and I\u2019ll start, so listen I think we\u2019re in the first or second inning really in Europe in both the partner as well as the owned software model. If you look at the number of ISV partnerships we have in United States just Global Payments, those probably exceed the entire deals of most of the individual markets that we look at. If you look at our owned software businesses in the United States, I think you probably see a pretty similar stream. ","What I was really referring to was, when you talk to a large complex financial institution partners outside the United States Andrew, what they want to talk about is vertical markets software. So, I do think what you\u2019ll see at Global Payments in \u201819 and beyond is a lot of progress on things like our restaurant and food service strategy. So, one of the things we said in our prepared remarks is that the combined Xenial-SICOM business is already in 60 plus countries with restaurants, so, it\u2019s already been nativized restaurants or going to sell in all those markets. We have a lot of restaurants in Europe and a lot of restaurants in Asia and a lot of restaurants in Canada and also tuned to come in Mexico. So that is something we\u2019re certainly going to march ahead on in 2019. ","By the way, (inaudible), we\u2019ve already been selling before \u201819, our Xenial products for data analytics and customer engagement to those restaurants outside the United States already, and I\u2019d also say we\u2019ve been very successful with our education, particularly our university business outside the United States with announced wins in Canada, Europe, and Asia over the last 12 months. So, what I was really referring to in response to David\u2019s question is, we\u2019re getting incremental traction, an additional traction from our large FI partners outside the US and wanting to talk about our vertical market software in those countries. ","So yes, we\u2019ll see continued progress in those markets. But I think you have to step back and say at the end of the day that\u2019s really in the first or second inning for those countries and we are further along here in the United States.","Cameron Bready","Andrew, its Cameron, let me just add one point to that if I could. If you recall part of the thesis around owning our owned software from an integrated payment standpoint is controlling our own destiny with respect to internationalizing those solutions. So when we own the software we don\u2019t have to rely on a partner obviously in terms of what we want to bring to markets outside of the US, how we want to bring them, and when we want to bring them. So I think as it relates to the vertical markets again, where we own our owned software outright today, we are really driving kind of the growth and expansion of integrated payments in these markets by bringing our own solutions, and obviously utilizing the distribution capabilities we have in those markets obviously to drive incremental growth and to drive again an incremental and differentiated solutions relative to competitors in those local - foreign markets.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.","Bob Napoli","Jeff, Cameron, maybe for both you, the biggest concern that I get from investors as it relates to Global with your software strategy is how we are able to, and I know you\u2019ve heard this before, but I\u2019d like to hear a little bit more color on how you\u2019re building the organization to manage the various software businesses protecting yourself from loss of key management and also making sure that you\u2019re developing the software in line, because it\u2019s a lot of different businesses. So I guess like a little bit of color, because that\u2019s the \u2013 I mean the numbers speak for themselves and overtime and I appreciate Jeff the color you gave on each of the businesses upfront, but if you could give a little more color on that, I think it would be helpful.","Jeff Sloan","Sure Bob, its Jeff and I\u2019ll start. So as we said in our prepared remarks, we managed all of our businesses, but in particular our software technology businesses along a core and an edge strategy, which means those things that are customer facing, that are specific to the markets, so for example in the case of healthcare in AdvancedMD, those elements of the software that are specific to the healthcare market are really managed at the edge or locally by the folks over at AdvancedMD. What do we apply to their management? We apply our own views on security, compliance, regulatory, we apply our own views on architecture of those distribution chains, and we rely on our oversight coupled with local management to be retained and grown overtime to run those businesses effectively for us. ","The best indicator of how we\u2019re doing along those lines is the track record that you referenced that we\u2019ve been able to produce certainly going back with this management team to 2012 with APT. So the people running APT today are the people who were running APT and PayPros in 2012 and 2014, AdvancedMD is more recent, the people running AdvancedMD today are the people who were running it in August and September of 2018, when we did the deal in the first place. ","We also then apply our own view of core functionality, which is to say in the case of AdvancedMD, for example, their integration with the payments infrastructure and architecture that they already have, we said at the time of the deal that\u2019s about 20% penetrated and we\u2019d like to increase that to a much higher percentage, I gave you statistics in my prepared comments about where that sits today. So expanding and monetizing that payment space is a core functionality that we bring. And then of course, we also lay on our own sales capabilities. I also referenced this in my prepared remarks, that our ability to generate more sales, more physician sales through Heartland, for example, our ability to generate more payroll referrals, which I also referenced, and our ability of course to sell more payments via OpenEdge in the case of AdvancedMD are things that we\u2019re all focused on. ","And to be honest, when you put it together and you look at our guidance for 2019 building on the success for \u201818, but for these purposes its \u201819, one of the ways that we get to double-digit organic revenue growth guidance in the United States in our direct businesses is because of those effective cross-sells that I just described. So, those are some of the ways we think about managing and extending and expanding those businesses.","Cameron Bready","Bob, it\u2019s Cameron, I\u2019ll just add one point to that which is, I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the importance of our priced M&A as it relates to the success we\u2019ve had with the transactions we consummated of the course of time. We spent a tremendous amount of time obviously vetting these businesses upfront strategically, culturally, and in particular certainly as it relates to the returns that we expect to be able to generate from them. But as it relates to the cultural point, that\u2019s one of the key elements that we address going in to a transaction. How that management is going to be able to adapt to the Global Payments, are they going to be affected in the environment in which we operate, are they going to be able to obviously keep up with the cadence of the business that we run today, and are they well positioned to obviously understand what we\u2019re trying to achieve as a company, as it relates to both on strategy and the expectation we\u2019ve set with the investment community, and I think we\u2019ve got tremendous success with that to date with really every one of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve executed over the course of the last several years. ","Bob Napoli","And just a follow-up, are you seeing a continued, significant amount of opportunities to acquire in new verticals, as you try to avoid competing with your partnership business?","Jeff Sloan","Bob, its Jeff, I would say the answer is absolutely yes to what you said. So our pipeline we\u2019re being told that\u2019s not just a vertical markets commentary, that\u2019s a commentary that new geographies and other businesses as well more broadly for our FI and other related businesses. So the answer is yes, the pipeline is whole. Some of our markets like restaurants are changing very rapidly, and of course we\u2019ve made significant investments in the form of SICOM in 2018 to accelerate our rates of growth in those businesses. So we\u2019re not applying these skillsets against the static pool, rather these markets are changing all the time. But no there\u2019s no limit on the pipeline potential that we\u2019re seeing. Now having said that though, we just got a number of acquisitions in the back half of \u201918 which is close to our joint venture with HSBC in Mexico a couple of weeks ago. So obviously we\u2019re very focused on executing and integrating those businesses to deliver on that commitment that we\u2019re making. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","What really stood out to me was the AMD bookings up 50%, I think you said, so I\u2019m curious is this the result of maybe low hanging fruit being picked early, or it seems like you haven\u2019t really put in full effort yet on the sales side. Just trying to understand how sustainable this booking level is?","Jeff Sloan","Well Tien, this is Jeff. I put in full effort, I can't speak for Cameron. In the scheme of things, listen I think at the end of the day, and of course I'm joking on that because Cameron is sitting opposite to me. But at the end of the day listen, I think it goes back to what Cameron said, we're looking at partnerships and AdvancedMD is a very good example of them. We're really focused on, does it fit our strategy, what's the culture of the business that we're partnering with, and what are the financial outcomes that we're trying to solve? ","So it's been great growth at AdvancedMD. Is that growth in excess of what we hoped would happen? Of course not. At the end of the day we have an opinion as to what we think we can do with that business, and this is just not an accident. We spent a lot of time cross-selling, monetizing, and managing those relationships, which we think is critically important to what we do. So, no I think, we are very pleased with where we are, but those things are really related by design. Now can that accelerate further? Well we certainly hope with the cross-selling and the globalization opportunities we have, restaurants in particular, some of the vertical markets that we're in that we can continue to accelerate growth. But I think it's important for us to give you increasing evidence of how we're doing to show you how pleased we are with the investments that we have made on behalf of our shareholders.","Tien-tsin Huang","No, it\u2019s a concern. I mean I asked that I know you're kidding, but I know it takes time to get the sales on board with such a new vertical, so that is why I was curious about the sustainability. So my follow-up just on SICOM and Xenial going well, you mentioned a large signing there. I'm curious in the aggregate the pricing on these deals both on the product side as well as on the payment side or spread, any surprise there as you go to market especially moving maybe up the market a little bit?","Jeff Sloan","No Tien, it's Jeff. We haven't had any surprises there, we're really pleased as I said in my prepared remarks about SICOM. Restaurants is one of our biggest vertical markets, and of course we've also added food service management, which is a larger market that we weren't in directly at Global before as part of the partnership. If you step back for a second, what we really like about the SICOM partnership is that the old Global are really through Heartland and Xenial had 25,000 QSRs before the deal and we doubled that with 50. ","But if you step back for a second, the bread and butter at Xenial was really the enterprise level of QSR Tien-tsin, and that's exactly what SICOM does. So it\u2019s a very nice product overlap in that legacy Global and Heartland really at front of the house solutions. SICOM brought with it not just front of the house which is where some of the overlaps are, but middle of the house and back of house for enterprise customers, as well as the globalization of those businesses. So no we're not surprised by any of the trends, we are already in that business. I think it gives us additional scale in one of the most attractive vertical markets that we're in [Global]. (inaudible) what our bank partners outside the United States want to talk about, and the restaurant market as I said before is very rapidly changing today, and it's very nice to work on the forefront of that with leading technologies to do that globally. ","So we gave an indication in my prepared remarks of our recent win I would say more to come that business has a lot of momentum and this is a business to go back to (inaudible) of the prior questions where software is the leading strategy. So forget about Global Payments for a second, many of our competitors in that business are also leading with technology and leading with software, and I think that really is, as I said in response to David's first question, a validation honestly of the approach that we are taking in our technology-enablement.","Cameron Bready","And the only thing that I would add to that Tien-tsin is, I think what we've seen in SICOM thus far is consistent with what we've seen in (inaudible) historically more (inaudible) pieces around leading with software, and obviously utilizing software as a means by which to drive incremental value from customers and drag payments has proven to be a very effective and economically opportunity for us. So I think thus far the ability to bring solutions that SICOM brings to their front of the house, middle of the house, back of the house, again the middle of the house and back of the house being very distinctive relative to anyone else in the space, the ability to use that software platform again to drive the payment volume as well again has proven to be a very valuable strategy and a very effective strategy from an economic standpoint.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Jim Schneider","I was wondering, if you could maybe address the outlook you see for extending the plan for partnerships especially internationally. It's been a while since you did Erste at this point, so maybe looking forward, what does the landscape look like, how rich is the target environment, and how do you feel about the valuations in that space?","Jeff Sloan","Jim, it's Jeff, so I'll go ahead and start. So I would say our pipeline is pretty full inside but also outside the United States about FI partnerships. So if you think about what we're looking for, we certainly see more opportunities in Asia in that area, more opportunities in Latin America in that area sitting here today. I think what is interesting if anything else is the tone of those conversations So the tone of those conversations today has moved from compliance which is where it was a number of years ago, meaning EMV and that type of thing and investments in those types of security assets into how do you help me grow my business by of vertical market. ","So if you think about one of the assets that we bring that we haven't talked about much about on the call today, it's really our unified commerce platform in our e-commerce and omni-channel businesses that is selling e-commerce in cross-border, it\u2019s selling very well, for example, in Spain with CaixaBank, it\u2019s selling well in Continental Europe with Erste back, and of course it's selling well across Asia as Cameron described in his remarks ","With the release of our next generation platform which is imminent in unified commerce, that is a conversation that the most sophisticated financial institutions globally are very interested in having particularly in the area of omni-channel acceptance which very few people have. So I think differentiated technology products that we're selling today, we've seen significant increase in demand from financial institutions globally to have those conversations and the conversation has shifted from pure compliance into how do you help me grow my revenue both by vertical market via software as well as cross-border via e-commerce.","Cameron Bready","Jim, it's Cameron, just to add another point to that quickly. I think Jeff mentioned obviously in his prepared remarks, we just closed a joint venture with HSBC in Mexico. So we're busy working to expand in to that market as well. In addition to what Jeff said, the other interesting thing I think in the pipeline for us is obviously a fair number of new FI opportunity - partnership opportunities around the globe, but also more and more conversations with existing partners about expanding into new markets, in particularly with Erste in Central Europe, looking at opportunities to expand further with them, given the success we've been able to have already in markets and working in collaboration with them. ","So I think we're really delighted to see that the strength of our partnerships and the success of our partnerships overtime is allowing us to have further dialogue about extensions of those and expansions of those into different markets, where we think we can replicate the same success.","Jim Schneider","And then maybe just a follow-up, can you maybe just address your relationship with Vista and the Vista software portfolio companies going forward, given they've disposed their equity stake in the company? Maybe talk about any changes you're seeing there or is there any change at all to the relationship, and maybe can you talk a little bit about how it\u2019s gone so far?","Cameron Bready","Jim I'll start, and then ask Jeff to add any comments that he would like. So I would say our relationship with Vista remains very strong, and we've had great success already in mining opportunities in their existing portfolio of companies that have now become payment partners of ours over the course of the last call it 18 months, since we really established this relationship with Vista. So I think it's clear to say from our standpoint, we couldn't be more pleased with how things have gone thus far. ","We still see a lot of opportunity to continue to mine the relationship for further payment partnerships, given their portfolio of assets. Some of their more recent transactions as well I think fits nicely as it relates to our ability to work with them to drive incremental value for both us and them, and we continue to have very strong dialogue with them around those types of opportunities, they are continuing to work through a pipeline of opportunities to partner with existing portfolio companies in that business. ","As it relates to them selling their stake in Global Payments that they acquired by virtue of the ACTIVE acquisition, I would start by saying they are a financial buyer and a financial enterprise and ultimately I think they looked at being able to realize a very good return on that investment as it relates to the Global Payments stock, and as around in the market fundraising and looking to clean up prior funds and it's a very logical thing for them to do. But it doesn't in any way change, the nature of our relationship and the partnership that we have with the various portfolio companies that they operate today ","Jeff Sloan","Jim, it's Jeff. I would just add that we\u2019ve a lot of respect for Vista, I think they've done a fantastic job. But that is just one of a number of private equity and financial firms with whom we have a relationship and an ongoing dialogue. So I think the most interesting thing is we\u2019ve differentiated sales proposition going into that line of business, we approach private equity firms as a whole, rather than each one of their individual companies, and we see kind of more warm leads as we do with Vista with those companies. I think in that we are distinctive, I know we are distinctive relative to our peers. So more to come there over time, but I\u2019d view this as the initial step towards a broader based key related distribution strategy particularly here in the United States.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Your line is open ","Chris Brendler","I'd like to just focus on the US business for a little bit. If you could give us a little bit more detail. Lots of conversations about the software ownership until we see the results of these acquisitions really starting to fit well with the existing organization. I'd like to talk about the other side of that business for a second, just the partnership channel on the ISV side, and how that's going, and how now competition potentially maybe increase in that space, and what you\u2019re seeing through the front line since you are trying to sign new ISVs, and I have a follow-up. ","Jeff Sloan","Chris, this is Jeff, and I'll start, so if you step back for a second we said this in the press release and I said this in our prepared commentary, really we are focused on as a balanced approach across the technology enablement spectrum. So that means not just partner on software, but owned software, partnered software, e-comm and omni assets and faster-growth markets. So sometimes we gets lost in this, also we talked a lot about what kind of owned software particularly in vertical markets like restaurants where it's kind of a hot topic. Well we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we had fantastic performance last quarter and last year and our expectations are also high in \u201819 for our partnering business particularly in the context of OpenEdge. ","I gave a fair amount of detail in my prepared comments with our wins, but really Chris three marquee wins, those are all competitive in nature and we won all three of them. So our point of view there is, the proof\u2019s in the pudding and the results are what they are to sign up the largest chain of chiropractors, one of the largest municipal and I think big government billing facilities, and one of the largest not-for-profit ISV providers. I think tells you all you need to know about our competitive positioning because you want those and (inaudible). ","Putting that aside for second, that business has always been competitive. So if you go back to when we got into it, in 2012 in our business more generally, but for these purposes in OpenEdge it's always the case that as renewals come up and new customers are competitive that we need to continue to evolve that business we're offering more and more value and we're providing more and more scale in what we do. But to answer your question, there's not been a sea change in the way to go to market in that business competitively or by way of pricing over the last year or so. Our business has always been competitive, since we got into it in 2012, it\u2019s not like Mercury was not a good competitor back in '12, it\u2019s not like the assets that First Data bought over the last year or two (inaudible), it\u2019s probably they weren\u2019t good competitors in their own rights. ","I think what is different about us, as we said in our prepared comment is our ability to offer a single technology solution and provide more value-add for our partners which is part of the wins that we had in the three that I mentioned. The other thing that is distinctive is the ability to globalize and take these into a multinational geographies, which I think we're either unique or one of two really doing today. So there really hasn't been a sea change for us in the way the economics work in those businesses. I think we talked about the great performance we had in the fourth quarter at OpenEdge, and I think the recent wins that we highlighted by name I think proved that.","Cameron Bready","And just to put a little finer point on that Chris, from my perspective, if you look at the backdrop of obviously a lot of discussion and more competition in the integrated space, OpenEdge had its best year in terms of new partner signings in 2018, ended the year again with mid-teens growth for the fourth quarter, which obviously positions it well heading into 2019. The last thing I would say is, if you look at our guide for the US Direct business in 2019, again we're guiding to double digit organic growth in our US Direct business. We wouldn't do that or couldn't do that to the extent our partnership business was not performing at the level that it's performing today and not helping to drive the overall rate of revenue growth for that US Direct business. ","So that's a signal I think to a (inaudible) degree to the amount of confidence we have with the durability of the partnership model, and obviously I think one of the strengths that we have and again what we\u2019ve differentiated is the optionality we have to own a partner depending on the vertical and depending on the fit. So I think that again positions us extraordinarily well kind of heading into 2019 and for years to come, as we continue to execute on that strategy.","Chris Brendler","That's really helpful, it\u2019s a great color. And I think more of thinking about how you're doing so well and what appears to be a lot of your competitors trying to follow, and I think they're still following at this point. My follow-up question was on Europe, just amazing results as you put up another quarter of constant currency, low double-digit. Your guidance for high-single digit next year is that in macro potential slowdown, a lot of concerns from investors about Europe?","Cameron Bready","Chris, it's Cameron, so I'll touch on that one. I would say we\u2019ve had fantastic performance in Europe above our own cycle guidance frankly for that region, and that's really been driven by our Spanish business strength in our Central European business and strength in our e-comm and omni-channel business across Continental Europe. So I think we're delighted with what we've been able to achieve. Now if you think back to 2018, we had good growth in our UK domestic business for the better part of the year, and obviously that was something that was helpful to the overall European results for the year. ","As we look to 2019, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're guiding the UK in the kind of mid-single digit rate of growth, and consequently overall Europe to a high-single digit rate of growth for the year. We think that's a prudent approach to take getting into the year, particularly with Brexit on the forefront of everyone's mind. I would say our guide assumed effectively a muddle (inaudible) for lack of a better term kind of outcome as it relates to Brexit, so we are not assuming that the economy in the UK is going to fall off the cliff. I'd say we\u2019re affectively assuming something like what you saw in Q4, which was very, very low GDP growth if any, I think it was 0.2% for Q4. ","That's kind of the outlook that we're expecting in the UK for the rest of 2019. Obviously it remains to be seen how Brexit will play out and we'll adapt accordingly, but that's what our assumptions reflect today as it relates to the UK. I think the rest of Europe, we continue to assume a macro environment fairly similar to what we saw in 2018, there\u2019s a little bit of softness in a few spots in Europe, but the markets that we're in, in particular, Spain, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, and again the strength driven by our e-comm and omni business in that market, I think give us a lot of confidence we are still going to be able to grow Europe notwithstanding the UK at that high-single digit rate for 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Bryan Keane","Wanted to ask, a lot of payment players saw a slowdown in volume in fourth quarter, and in particular, saw weakness in cross-border, doesn\u2019t feel like you guys saw some of that same weakness, maybe the model is a little bit different with mix. Can you just give us a little bit of help when thinking about that?","Cameron Bready","Bryan, It's Cameron. I'll jump in and ask Jeff to add any color that he may like as well. I would just say as your opening comment, I would say across the board, we generally saw volumes pretty consistent in Q4, with what we saw in Q3. Obviously the UK was a little slower than what we saw in Q3 and that's a function of the GDP environment, and I think that's pretty obvious to anyone who's paying attention to what's happening in the UK and then obviously the GDP results coming out of the UK. ","Putting that aside, I would say in the rest of the markets around the globe, I would say volumes held up very well, and I think again that's to your own point somewhat a function of our own strategy on how we go to market, the diversity of distribution that we have today, and obviously our ability to lead the technology in most of those distribution channels. As it relates to cross-border volume, in particular, we really didn't see the slowdown obviously that was reported by the networks and then some other players in the market, as well on a cross-border basis. ","If you look at our European e-comm and omni business, which is really the heart of where we see the majority of our cross-border volumes, we continue to see mid-teens growth in that business in the fourth quarter and volume trends that were relatively consistent, I would say, with what we saw throughout the course of 2018. So no real meaningful slowdown in our portfolio of businesses Bryan, but it's obviously something we continue to monitor closely heading into 2019. But I think we have a lot of confidence that's evidenced again by the guide that we provided for 2019 as to how those businesses are going to hold up.","Jeff Sloan","Bryan, it's Jeff. I think Cameron is right, and also I think it speaks to the distinctiveness of our models are focused on SMBs domestically including in Europe and those markets and selectively focused on, first of all, MNCs where we think we can add value-added solutions and differences, and not just based on price indeed in those markets, those faster-growth markets where we think it's most attractive to offer e-comm and omni. So unlike the card networks, we are not the entirety of the market, in every market that we are in unlike some of our other competitors we have deliberately targeted some of the markets that Cameron and I described, because we think they are more attractive, and we think they are more resilient. So time will tell, but I think you can see the results in our fourth quarter and what our guidance reflects ","Bryan Keane","And just a quick follow-up Cameron, can you help us with the impact of the HSBC JV in Mexico, and how fast do you guys think it will take for you guys to start gaining share in that market? ","Cameron Bready","Bryan, it's Cameron. So, if you recall in my prepared remarks, I gave an estimate for sort of net interest expense that\u2019s obviously net of other income as well, where you'll see the impact of the HSBC Mexico joint venture for 2018. So, as we said when we announced that joint venture, we think it certainly in the near term are more important strategically than it perhaps is financially. Now over the course of time, as we scale that business, we expect it to be a nice contributor obviously of income to the company through our 50% ownership in the joint venture. I would not expect that to be a material amount in 2019, given the fact that we're just getting the joint venture off the ground, and obviously it's going to take a little bit of time to scale. ","As it relates to our ability to gain share, part of what we like about that market and obviously working with our partner HSBC is, they have a far greater percentage of the commercial banking market today in Mexico than they do in the merchant acquired market. So there's a lot of room, I think in that portfolio to capture share just with the existing book of business that HSBC Mexico is supporting today from a commercial banking standpoint, before you even get into taking share from other competitors who may not be HSBC commercial banking customers today. ","So I think we have a lot of confidence in the ability to grow that business. I would say our forecast for growth in that business is robust, obviously we'll take a little bit of time to just get it off the ground and to start to scale the business effectively. So more to come on that typically as we head into 2020 and '21, but for '19 it's not going to be a material impact to our overall financial results.

Please go ahead.","Jane Elliott","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Global Payments Fiscal 2016 first quarter conference call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour and joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and any subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.

Jeff?","Jeffrey Sloan","Thank you Jane and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are delighted to report an exceptional start to fiscal 2016 with strong first quarter performance that exceeded our expectations across our markets. We are now raising our expectations for this fiscal year.","For the quarter, we delivered net revenue growth of 8%, expanded margins by 150 basis points and grew cash earnings per share by 25%. Notably each of our regions reported margin expansion, notwithstanding the impact of foreign exchange headwinds.","This performance reflects the continued progression of our long term strategic vision coupled with relentless focus on everyday execution. We believe that we have the right people in the right positions executing the right business model around the world.","Now for more detailed highlights. We are very pleased with the performance in our North American businesses which was driven by our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit organic revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels. In Europe we delivered substantial organic revenue growth in the U.K. fueled by solid execution.","Our e-commerce business performed ahead of our expectations and in September Realex released a new bundled offering in the U.K. further demonstrating our commitment to investing in areas of exceptional future opportunity.","We also saw double-digit volume and transaction growth in Spain, meaningfully outpacing the market and highlighting the strength of our partnership with CaixaBank. We look forward to expanding this partnership when the Erste Bank joint venture closes later in fiscal 2016.","Asia produced stable organic revenue growth for the quarter. We also closed BPI transaction in early August which will help to drive stronger organic revenue growth over the long term given the attractive secular trends in the Philippians market. Finally, Ezidebit continue to perform well in Australia and New Zealand.","As you know the U.S. market adopted the EMV protocol effective October 1. We have years of expertise bringing EMV to our markets and we therefore bring substantial advantages to our domestic and multinational customers in the United States.","For example, we recently partnered with Visa in Canada to enable the first mobile contactless solution for not-for-profits using EMV and point-to-point encryption in that country. We look forward to extending this type of technology to other EMV markets.","In the United States, we have developed EMV solutions for our integrated, direct, mobile and gaming lines of businesses. As we have discussed previously, our Edge Shield and Global Shield products combine EMV with encryption, tokenization and NFC. We believe these and our other value added products and services will allow us to capture share across our businesses.","EMV adoption in the United States has and will continue to catalyze the rate of technological change in our businesses. To that end, we announced in September that we are offering Android Pay and Samsung Pay to our customers in the United States.","We also support Apple Pay in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The rapidly changing nature of Payments technology underscores the advantages of our model as we are capable of enabling new products and services in short order across markets globally.","Global Payments stands at the crossroads of a rapidly changing worldwide payments market that is increasingly defined by technological differentiation and global breadth. We target markets with higher rates of growth and margins, leveraging our scalable technologies and unified operational structure to create superior returns.","Over the last few years, we invested $1.75 billion across our businesses to accelerate growth and efficiently returned $1 billion to our shareholders. Yet, we retained substantial capital flexibility to achieve our goals. Of course, more to come on these topics in a couple of weeks.","Now I will turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm also very pleased with our strong first quarter performance which meaningfully exceeded our own expectations. Despite the significant negative impacts of foreign currency translation, we produced impressive revenue growth, margin expansion and cash earnings per share increases over fiscal 2015.","Total company adjusted net revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $537 million, reflecting growth of 8% over the prior year. Assuming we owned Ezidebit, FIS Gaming, Realex and BPI in our current and prior first quarters or normalizing for their effect, constant currency net revenue growth was 11% for the quarter.","Operating margins for the quarter expanded 150 basis points to 30.5% and cash earnings per share increased 25% to $1.57.","North American net revenue growth was 8% for the quarter with operating income growth of 9%, including the effects of significantly unfavorable currency trends in Canada. Despite these impacts, North American margins expanded by 20 basis points.","US net revenue growth was 16%, reflecting strong organic growth of 10% from our direct channels, coupled with the addition of the FIS Gaming business that contributed 6 percentage points to our US growth rate.","Canada's local currency revenue grew in line with expectations for the quarter, but the weak Canadian dollar unfavorably impacted North America net revenue growth by several hundred basis points.","Net revenue growth in Europe was 4% in US dollars, with margin expansion of 280 basis points. Adjusting for unfavorable currency exchange rates, European constant currency net revenue growth was 22%.","This was primarily driven by accelerated organic revenue growth in the UK and continued strong fundamental growth from our business in Spain. The addition of Realex also contributed to the strong local currency net revenue growth in Europe.","Asia Pacific revenue grew 30%, driven by mid single digit organic revenue growth trends, in line with our expectations, the Ezidebit acquisition and the BPI transaction, which closed in August.","Operating margins in our Asia Pacific segment meaningfully expanded largely due to the acquisition of Ezidebit which will annualize in October. We generated free cash flow of approximately $86 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests. Capital expenditures totaled $17 million for the quarter.","Since the date of our last call, we repurchased an additional 550,000 shares for $16 million. Our current share repurchase authorization capacity is $342 million.","Our total available cash including working capital at the end of the quarter was approximately $200 million. In late July we successfully completed a refinancing of our debt facilities to further expand our capacity to $3 billion, which represents an increase of $750 million from our prior capacity.","Our new facilities are comprised of a $1.75 billion term loan and a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. In addition to being more cost effective, this refinancing provides incremental capacity to ensure we are well capitalized to pursue our growth initiatives and capital allocation strategies.","Further, in August, we entered into an additional $250 million notional amount interest rate swap to hedge a portion of our variable interest rate exposure. Cumulatively, we have now hedged a notional $750 million of our outstanding variable rate debt portfolio.","Turning now to guidance, we are raising our fiscal 2016 expectations despite the incremental negative impacts of foreign currency translation. Relative to our previous outlook, our current foreign currency assumptions anticipate stronger FX headwinds for the year, largely due to further weakening of the Canadian and Aussie dollars, as well as the ruble.","As a result, we continue to expect our fiscal 2016 net revenue to grow 6% to 8% from fiscal 2015, and range from $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion. Absent the impacts of incremental foreign currency headwinds we would have expected net revenues to trend towards the higher end of this range.","Nonetheless, we are increasing our cash earnings per share and operating margin expectations for the full year. Cash earnings per share are now expected to grow 14% to 17% over fiscal 2015, and range from $5.77 to $5.92.","We also now believe cash operating margins will expand by as much as 50 basis points in fiscal 2016 on a constant currency basis.","Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that for the first time in 10 years our board has approved a two-for-one common stock split payable on November 2, to shareholders of record as of October 21st.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thank you, Cameron. I want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Conference in Atlanta on October 20th. We look forward to providing further detail in our sessions regarding our vision to accelerate transformative growth across our markets. We hope to see you there. Jane?","Jane Elliott","Before we begin the question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you and operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","George Mihalos","Great, thanks. Good morning, guys and congrats on another nice start to the year.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks, George.","George Mihalos","Was hoping we could dig in a little bit on the strength in North America. I know you've now combined the US and Canada. But Jeff, I think you said you had another quarter of double-digit direct growth.","I think you guys were looking for 9% to 11% growth coming into the year. It seems like you did better than that. How are you feeling about that going forward and any sort of pricing initiatives that may have been put in place in Canada recently?","Jeffrey Sloan","Sure, George. It's Jeff. I'll start and I'll ask Cameron to add some more detailed color on your question. First, I feel very good about where our North American businesses are today.","In the United States first, we saw a continuation of the trends and you're rights on what you said about our prepared remarks, a continuation of the double-digit trends and organic net revenue growth in the United States, George, for the fifth consecutive quarter that we really saw across last year and we feel very good about the performance in each one of our businesses.","First, in our integrated business, we continue to see mid to high double-digit revenue growth in that business, which has been consistent in terms of our expectations over the last year or so.","We also have done very well with a number of our partnerships including our Fidelity gaming transaction that closed on June 1st, and I think as Cameron said in his remarks, we're very pleased with the execution of that acquisition one quarter into the closing of that transaction.","So sitting here today we see a lot of strength in our US businesses consistent with what we described in July and really what we saw most of last fiscal year.","As relates to Canada, really more of the same. Our goal has been a stable and visible Canadian business. We continue to see that. In fact, we've had some of the better transaction growth in the last quarter or so in Canada that we've seen in quite some time and that's against an economic backdrop that's been relatively flat.","Nonetheless, our businesses continue to perform very well in Canada, putting aside the FX impact that Cameron alluded to.","So I would say, George, it's really more of the same. I see this as a continuation of momentum that we had towards the back half of 2015 and all of 2015 but the back half of 2015 heading into the 2016. Cam, you want to comment on any more of the detail?","Cameron Bready","Yes, George I'll give you couple specific metrics maybe to focus on. If you look at the North American business as we noted in our prepared comments, it grew 8% for the quarter that was about 12% on a constant currency basis. Canada was about a 400 basis point headwind as a result of the weak Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.","The U.S. direct channels grew 10%, FIS gaming added about 600 basis points as I noted in my comments. That 10% low double digit organic growth in the U.S. business is consistent with the trends I think we posted over the last probably five or six quarters and obviously is our expectation going forward kind of high single low double digit for organic growth in the U.S. business as we report to the balance of the year as well.","As Jeff noted Canada was kind of low single digit in line with our expectation on a local currency basis despite what I think we all know a weak macroeconomic environment with Canada in recession in the first quarter of our fiscal 2016. So I'd say all in all a very good performance for the North American business.","A \u2013 David Mangum","And George this is David, one bit of color, you asked about pricing in Canada. Canada is driven by stable credit metric trends. We are actually very nice growth as Jeff pointed out a moment ago offset by very manageable spread situation, we\u2019re very happy with the start. Actually we\u2019re off to a great new sales start in Canada as well this year showing OptBlue among other products in Canada.","So we\u2019re really pleased with the start in Canada this year is to repricing - there is always a little element of measured pricing in the results in the markets like that but there is nothing new or different grant in Canada at all.","George Mihalos","Okay, great. Really appreciate the color there. And just to follow-up with the liability shifting now haven't been reached, will you be taking this opportunity to may be use a bit of a stick approach for some of the merchants that, that are now looking to upgrade to - upgrade their point of sales of the shift technologies or anything you\u2019re thinking about, sort of repricing a portfolio for the Laggards. Thank you.","A \u2013 David Mangum","George, this is David again. Right now we\u2019re focused on industry adoption and migration. As you know, its early days. We're few days into this at this moment very little migration has happened you\u2019ll see statistic expanded about with different levels but the reality is we had the low single digit level of penetration from a merchant perspective except to that being the odd big box merchant who may have gone in the last six weeks to three months or so.","So right now we\u2019re really focused on what will our partners on moving through our merchant base whether there is viable business case to go ahead and move quickly. We got everything fully certified as you might imagine the basics are complete with all our solutions are compliant and as important as anything we bundled EMV with PCI compliance. The-point-to-point encryption, and with tokenization to security solutions we\u2019re looking forward to work it on merchants to implement those to drive growth in a more secure ecosystem overall.","To your question about pricing, really driving as to thinking of migration adoption right now let's fast forward a little while, come back with its little bit later and we think through and it's just much further penetrating what you do about laagered in ordered to security ecosystem but it's really have that conversation.","Cameron Bready","George, this is Cam, the only thing I would add to that is just as David highlighted, we're really focused on adoption and as a result you wouldn't - there shouldn\u2019t expect to see any sort of pricing elements were priced in our guidance for the balance of the year.","So with the focus internally being on migration and supporting our customers, we haven\u2019t really reflected anything from a pricing point of view in our expectation.","George Mihalos","Great, thanks.","Cameron Bready","Thanks George.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Ashish Sabadra","Hi, this is Ashish Sabadra, calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Let me add my congratulations as well. So just quickly on Europe, we saw some further acceleration and growth there moved up from 19% constant currency last quarter to 22%. How should we think about the momentum going forward if you could just provide some more color on that front?","David Mangum","Sure. Jeff, I'll start and I\u2019ll ask Cameron to provide some additional detail around your question. So we\u2019re very pleased with where we are in Europe. We think this is a very favorable time to be in investing that business. So for example we acquired Realex in March to expand our omni-channel offerings into Europe.","I referenced in my prepared comments or bundling of our Realex gateway solution with our acquiring solution in the U.K. market which is a part of our initiative toward omni-channel. So I think the way to think about Europe is just a quarter - very, very good sales execution which both Cam and I talked about. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our business in Spain as we alluded to in our prepared remarks.","We saw continued double digit volume in transaction growth in Spain that\u2019s also been helped by a heightened expectation of better GDP growth and low unemployment in Spain. So I think we\u2019re really firing on all cylinders as it relates to our business in Spain and we continue to invest in our business.","So we think that the adoption of the single European payments area which is been coming for quite some time and is partially here but we fully rolled out starting the back half of our fiscal year is an opportunity for us to continue investing capital shares.","So what you\u2019re seeing now is really the fruits of a number of investments but also the fruits of further investment in our sales channel primarily in the United Kingdom business but also in the Spanish business and that's before we get to the closing of the Erste joint venture which we expect to be as I said in the back half of fiscal 2016.","So I think we\u2019re really right where we want to be in our European business. It\u2019s nice that you can see that in the results. Cameron, do you want to provide more color?","Cameron Bready","Yes I will just add couple of things. First of all the double-digit constant currency revenue growth is our expectation for the year for Europe and so I think we continue to expect to see the similar trends like we've seen over the last few quarters, I think in Europe on a top line revenue growth perspective.","As Jeff highlighted that would be augmented in back of the year with the addition of the Erste transaction. I will remind you however that\u2019s not reflected in our guidance today. So we do anticipate a nice headwind kind of rolling into the back half of the year from Erste, which is not reflected in the guidance as well as benefits from pricing changes and regulatory changes in the U.K. which is reflected in our guidance.","Q \u2013 Ashish Sabadra","That's great. My second question was going to be on the international margins. Thanks for providing the details by Asia-Pacific and Europe. So on Asia-Pacific, we saw some pretty good margin expansion there this quarter but the margins are still lower than the company average, I was just wondering if you can provide some color on what you think about the sustainable margins in Asia-Pacific going forward. Is there a room for further margin expansion there?","Cameron Bready","I think first of all the margin increases you saw year-over-year were driven by couple of things. One is we obviously have Ezidebit transaction that we closed in the middle of October of last year. So in Q1 of this year that was a meaningful benefit to margins in Asia. I would say last year Asian margins were weak and little bit by the occupy central activity in Hong Kong which reflected an environment there that had lower margins than we would typically see for our traditional Asian business before the addition of Ezidebit.","I would say going forward we\u2019re looking at Asian margins now that are roughly around the corporate average and I would expect that to continue. I still think we do see opportunity for margin expansion particularly as we grow the Ezidebit business which is a higher margin business than our traditional Asian business, as well as the additional benefit we expect to see from BPI over the balance of fiscal 2016 as well.","The only somewhat minor headwind to that is what we see is a relatively weak macroeconomic environment in Asia driven by sort of a commodity glut in China, the weak China economy. It obviously have a dampening effect on the overall macroeconomic environment in Asia. So that will be a bit of a headwind to the performance there.","But I do expect to see continued good margin. I think performance as well as margin expansion although probably muted by the macroeconomic environment.","Q \u2013 Ashish Sabadra","Thanks. Thanks for the color.","Cameron Bready","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. Let me add my congratulations as well. Could you - my question is around Realex and the strategy that sort of follows from Realex. Could you elaborate on how you intend to integrate it and potentially use that as a means to penetrate other parts of Europe?","Jeffrey Sloan","Sure Ashwin, its Jeff, I will start and David is going to add some color as well. So the first thing I would say is that we are very pleased with our new partners over Realex. Unlike most partnerships in the case of Realex, we are very fortunate that we had three year relationship with Realex to see how that would perform on the ground before we partnered with the company. ","So we actually have a fair amount of data on the right way to attack the market before we actually acquired the business last March. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we have just - in September released their new bundled product which is a combination of the Realex gateway as well our merchant acquiring business in the United Kingdom and soon to be into Ireland and other parts of our Europe.","If you get back for a second, I think our thesis in omni-channel is really a couple fold. First, as we said at the time of the Realex transaction, we think we have a very small share today of the cross border multinational business particularly in Europe as it relates to the card not present and e-commerce market.","So, the first strategy to address your question is, in a market that we think is growing organically mid-to-low 20s double digits, we should have bigger share of that market given our capabilities and our position. That's kind of point number one.","Point number two, we think increasingly the market is going to blur lines especially in Europe with the advent of the single European payment area and the common currencies across Europe.","We think that over time the market will as a customer matter blur distinction between card not present interactions and face-to-face or card present interactions. And therefore we need to own all those capabilities.","And we think we already are very capable, well suited business in face-to-face in a number of countries around Europe, but we thought that adding card not present functionality would position us very well for our omni-channel business, which is a blurring the line.","And if you look at a number of our competitors, which we'll talk about in a couple of weeks, the company's like [Atian] [ph] for example, or Stripe or Braintree, if you look at number of those companies what you might say is our competition has really shifted toward card not present companies in that market who are looking to expand into card present geographies.","We think we have a very strong card present business, but with the addition of Realex and our existing assets, a very strong card not present business. So when you combine those we actually think we have a pretty significant competitive advantage relative to the people I mentioned in terms of getting more aggressively into the omni-channel market in Europe where I think we can capture on a lot of good growth and additional share.","David, you want to add some more color to that.","David Mangum","Yes, let me add a little bit for you Ashwin, and pull apart the pieces a little bit of what Jeff said. So, first off as I said, we are very pleased, the business is performing fairly financially as we wanted and the integration is going very well.","It looks like the bundle because that's where we've been creating incremental value and drive incremental growth actually on a global basis with this type of product set.","So the bundle itself, it's for enterprise customers available obviously for multinationals, as Jeff said, it's also focused on small-to-medium enterprises operating within their individual markets or cross borders which of course is going to be increasing trend particularly in Europe when we think about \u2013 of the stuff as well as the local nature of the transaction that happen in that area.","So, with the bundle we give our U.K. customers a single relationship, covers all of their payments needs including e-commerce bundled and face-to-face, merchant services or the gateway just simply bundled with merchant acquiring along with reporting fraud management, all those kinds of things you'd expect in one package solution where that single relationship covers your entire suite of needs whether its e-commerce, face-to-face, fraud, et cetera.","So, the thing to think about relative to adjust that is that's targeted to small-to-medium enterprises, enterprise level customers, but also the developer market, as you well know that's where Stripes made a tag and as Jeff, said quite correctly we have the assets to compete with Stripe, with adding all the others, as well as bundling truly integrated face-to-face acquiring in any market around the world.","So being able to deliver that out of the box on a global basis is unique, it just began to roll out in the U.K. in September week, announced that couple of weeks ago. We're really excited about them taking in around the world to drive accelerated growth, and we'll talk more about that just in a couple of weeks.","Q \u2013 Ashwin Shirvaikar","Absolutely love that. Thank you for that color. The follow on question is with regards to the higher margins. Based on some of your comments so far it seems as though the bulk of that margin improvement is sustainable and not related to one off factors. Is that correct to read? If you could kind of go through the elements of margin improvement, that would be helpful.","Cameron Bready","Ashwin, it's Cameron. I'll start, maybe and ask Jeff or David to add in any color that they may want to. As it relates to, I'd say directionally, I think the margin expansion profile remains our expectation for the business. We talked about that I think a lot during the July call. Our current model anticipates margin expansion above 50 basis points annually.","We obviously saw a very good margin expansion in the first quarter, 150 basis points, and our guide for the balance of the year now is up 50 basis points on a constant currency basis.","There is always going to be puts and takes to that Ashwin, in any given quarter, if you look at the back three quarters of fiscal 2016, there is certainly some headwinds particularly as it relates to the annualization of the Spanish regulatory changes that occurred at the beginning of the September as well as -- we're incurring integration expenses around FIS Gaming, continuing to incur some around Realex, developing the bundle package as David and Jeff, were discussing a moment ago, and we have integration expenses around BPI as well.","And those are our headwinds that I would say in the back half or back three quarters of the year. And then on the tailwind side we obviously have the anticipated benefit coming from the U.K. regulatory changes or the European regulatory changes that will impact our U.K. business most prominently as well as continued growth and execution of our strategy that we expect to drive obviously improvement in margin over time.","So, long story short, any given quarter there's going to be puts and takes around it, but our overall expectation is we still see a long runway for margin expansion business. We're not at what we would view as our targeted margin profile for the business over the cycle which is kind of over 30%, and we still see again a lot of runway for expansion and up to that 50 basis points annually over the next several years.","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, I would just add to that, Ashwin, its Jeff. Our job is to grow margins. We guide that as a company, we have track record now, I believe that by doing that we expect margins to grow. I think Cameron is right, in any given quarter related to FX and pluses and minuses, they can vary a bit, but our focus is on growing margins.","The thing about $750 billion that we talked in our prepared remarks about investing, those investments find large winds of businesses that are in markets that are faster growing than the market in general that are historical markets, and as better margin opportunities. ","You combine that with the unified operating structure that we have also talked about in our comments, investments remain our technology platforms and the incremental margin on each transaction especially growing at the rate that we're growing at is going to be accretive to the overall margin profile. So we expect to continue to grow margins and add to the strategy of the company.","Q \u2013 Ashwin Shirvaikar","That\u2019s great to hear. You got to keep on rocking. That's good. See you in a couple of weeks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore SIS. Your line is now open.","Michael Landau","Hi, this is Michael Landau, in for David Togut. For fiscal year 2016 and 2017, should we expect PSD2 regulations in Europe to have a material impact on global European revenue in earnings and could this regulation impact your Realex strategy?","Cameron Bready","So I think, Michael, it's Cameron, on certainly fiscal 2016 as we've noted, I think a couple of times today, we do expect the implementation of the new regulations in December to be a nice tailwind for us in the back half of the year around the Payment Service Directive initiatives that passed last year, more or less fiscal year I should say.","So we have reflected that in our guidance and we certainly expect that to continue to be a benefit as we roll into fiscal 2017 as well, at least for the first half of fiscal 2017. Like any of these regulatory changes, they are transitory in nature.","So, as we saw with Durban in the U.S. several years ago in Spain, here most recently over the past year they do dissipate over time and the market does revert back over time as the market prices these benefits into spreads over a 12 to 18 month period depending on the market.","So, ultimately the benefit will be transitory. But we do obviously see it as a nice tailwind for us as we look to fiscal -- the back half of fiscal 2016 and first half of fiscal 2017 as well.","Michael Landau","Understood. And then, can you provide an update on New European Bank partnerships and M&A deals. Perhaps what stage you are in with those conversations? Thanks.","Jeff Sloan","Sure, Michael. Well of course we announced in July our partnership with Erste Bank along with CaixaBank, which we expect to close in the back half of 2016. And as we've been saying for the last period of time, we expect to do more of those transactions as the regulatory environment encourages financial institutions to think about partnerships and as the economic picture particularly as it relates to rates, which we view as an opportunity in Europe, allows us to invest more economically in the immediate term for a longer term return.","So, we continue to look at and have discussions with a number of banks in consensual Europe about partnerships, and we hope to do more of those, as we've said for a period of time now the number of requirements, we have are first that is the right type of partner for us, and the second, is that to provide attractive returns for our shareholders.","So, with those two things being said, we hope to do more transactions, we have more discussions underway. Those are hard to peg toward the timing, but we do think that in general deals we get more deals.","So, we certainly have seen a pickup in discussions post the Erste Bank announcement a couple of months ago and we hope to bring more of those to market assuming to meet the criteria I just laid out.","Cameron Bready","The only thing I would add to that is obviously our appetite remains very high to continue to do these types of transactions. I think our balance sheet supports it, we have ample capacity to do so as Jeff noted in his prepared comments, notwithstanding the amounts that we've invested in acquisitions, as well as returning capital to shareholders over the last few years. We retained ample capacity to continue to advance our strategy through both organic and inorganic growth.","So this is an important element of that and something we're working very diligently to try to bring forward.","Michael Landau","Great. Thank you","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok of KBW. Your line is now open.","Steven Kwok","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to download bit more on the 50 basis points of operating margin improvement. Can you just breakout by region around what you expect the improvements to be for this year? Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Yes, Steven, it's Cameron. I'll maybe start and then I'll ask Jeff or David to jump in if they have any particular added color they'd like to add. Typically we haven't guided around each individual segment in terms of what our expectation is for margin. We are really focused on expanding margins at the total company level. And as I'll remind you, I mean we're managing a portfolio now 29, soon to be 30 markets around the world.","Not every market is going to perform terrifically every quarter, and that's certainly not our expectation. So part of this is managing a portfolio that ultimately results in overall margin expansion for the Company, that's our goal and that's our objective as Management as Jeff highlighted earlier.","As we sit here today, certainly we see North America continuing to drive margin expansion for the overall Company, driven by that double digit organic growth in our direct channels particularly the higher margin businesses like our integrated OpenEdge business here in the U.S. market that continues to grow in line with our expectations in the mid-teens, and obviously performs at a level that helps to drive overall margin expansion for the Company.","Europe on a U.S. dollar adjusted basis, we expect to continue to grow for the year as well or potentially be flat depending on what currency is due, but if we see margin expansion in Europe overall it will likely be relatively minor edge - again FX is going to play a part in tampering that a little bit.","And I've discussed Asia a little bit earlier, we do expect to continue to see margin expansion in Asia largely driven by the growth in the Ezidebit business, which is a higher margin business as well as the addition of BPI, which we think obviously improved the scale in that region and helps to drive margin expansion somewhat tampered by the overall weak macroeconomic environment as I mentioned before.","So, end of day we're really managing overall as a corporate margin expansion target and we're managing the individual portfolios within the composition of the Company to achieve that, and that's our objective in any given year.","David Mangum","And Steven, this is David, maybe from purely a business perspective to compliment what Cameron said, we're very confident in the manner which we're executing actually around the world right now, whether it's Europe, the Asia description Cameron gave or North America. As Cameron said quiet rightly, a lot of this is headlined by North America, where when you think through a stable Canada with the conditions we're describing earlier when we were answering George's question, we feel very good about that, a little execution ground with our team there and our sales team in Canada, and the United States is a course that fills the largest piece of the business.","The headline of the course OpenEdge, we are very confident in our trajectory and of the performance there. This is actually our first year with the fully integrated sales force operating with the same tools, same lead management marketing CRM and sales automation tools all driving highly incremental growth as you drive extra new partners and you drive new merchants and obviously just the organic same store sales are fantastic in that business.","The gaming integration is going very well, that will obviously support the way Cameron described our North America trajectory quite strongly, and really the rest of the business, the direct business is growing very well and even indirect pieces are performing just as we expected.","So, again from a purely business perspective we're executing very well around the world particularly in the largest markets that really supports the description Cameron gave you.","Cameron Bready","The last thing I'll add Steven just to round up the conversation entirely is we continue to invest on our operating environment. We talked fairly extensively about the evolution of this business towards the unified operating Company structure. We continue to invest in achieving that, that will help drive incremental leverage scale on a global basis that is supported through overall corporate margins in the aggregate, and that's something we're very focused on and look forward to discussing more specifically in a couple of weeks.","Steven Kwok","Got it. And then as a follow up just to trail down a little bit on the quarter and then given that we do have September that's complete or ready. Were there any differences in terms of the growth rates into quarter and then any preliminary thoughts on how September was? Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Yes, it's a little early I think to comment on September, to be honest with you, Steven. As we see the biggest thing that I'm looking at day in and day out, the fundamentals of the business I think continue to be very strong.","And certainly I don't see anything in September that would cause me to feel any differently relative to what we saw in Q1. The thing that I got to bed looking at when I wake up looking at every morning is currency. And the volatility we continue to see in currency is just staggering.","So, currency is something we're working very hard to manage as you noted in our guide for the back half of the year \u2013 as the back three quarter for the year we are absorbing incremental currency relative to what we anticipated as recently as July.","We've seen the Canadian dollar weaken by 5%, 6%. We've seen the Aussie dollar weaken by roughly 7%, Rubles weakened over that same period of time. So if you look at our total revenue guide for the year, we maintained our $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion revenue guide for the full year up 6% to 8%.","If we reflect back to July, we noted that that 6% to 8% growth was really 9% to 11% on a constant currency basis. Well that's now really 10% to 12%. So we're absorbing another point of FX headwinds in our revenue guide and still maintaining that 6% to 8% FX adjusted growth rate for fiscal 2016 and I think that's quite an accomplishment.","I mean I really think it speaks to just fundamentally how well the business is performing that we can continue to absorb this FX headwind the way that we have and still produce headline numbers that are very attractive. Ultimately that's going to turn and work in our favor, but I think we're well positioned to continue to work through fiscal 2016 and absorb it and move on.","Steven Kwok","Great. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ryan Cary","Good morning, guys. This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. Touching in an OpenEdge, we've been hearing even more bullishness coming from the industry as it relates to growth prospects for the integrated channel. As it appears to increase verticalization of software solutions that's opening up additional runway, it sounds like this is consistent with what you've seen in the OpenEdge business in the market.","So, I was just wondering, was this the principal driver behind the increase in the longer term topline outlook you outlined last quarter, and could we actually see growth above that mid-teens level that we've spoken about for the full year?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, it's Jeff. I'll start it and then I'll ask David to comment more specifically on the details around OpenEdge. I think going back to the July guide, heightening our net revenue growth over the cycle, obviously OpenEdge is the largest part as we've talked about in July of our U.S. business today and of course it's also the largest direct piece of our business.","So there is no doubt as a mathematical matter that it's a very important contributor to our confidence level in raising our targets. But I think it's important to note that the overall U.S. direct business still grew 10% organic in the most recent quarter in last four quarters prior to that also grew in double digits, so while the remainder of the businesses in the U.S. on a direct basis are not growing in the mid to high double digits, I think it's fair to say as we've said in the last couple of quarters that our targets of those business is well in excess of market growth.","So our non OpenEdge direct businesses are probably growing in the mid to high single digit area and OpenEdge of course is in the mid to high double digit area. So I think we're pleased with all those businesses not just OpenEdge, and all those things went into our discussion around what it was like the company to be on a cycle basis.","David, you want to talk a little bit more about the OpenEdge?","David Mangum","Yes, I'd be happy to. I think Ryan you put your finger on something that we recognized some time ago when we began the investments in integrated payments if you go back through a few years ago. The idea of marrying technology to distribution, marrying a payment to a technology solution that creates a more compelling value proposition and at the end of the day a stickier solution is something we've been driving for quite some time.","It's what's fuels the growth that Jeff just described both in terms of the sales, again the compelling value proposition, the leverage of working with partners on integrated solutions. It also fuels lower attrition rates. So combined you have this amazing growth profile over and above with the terrific growth profile from our co-direct businesses.","I think of that as a tip of the spear for global payments growth going forward and maybe our opportunity to accelerate growth when we go and think beyond the United States, think beyond just OpenEdge into other places we can marry technology, deep vertical expertise and payments functionality to a really compelling solution, really frankly on a global basis every time.","Ryan Cary","Great, thanks. And kind of digging on the U.S. side of business little bit more, can you talk about the U.S. transaction growth in the quarter and maybe just deconstruct into direct and indirect, as well as what part of it is inorganic. And also what is assumed for transaction growth as part of the U.S. expectations for the full year?","Cameron Bready","So, I would say the transaction growth trend we saw on the quarter in the U.S. have been pretty consistent although we\u2019ve seen over certainly most of fiscal 2015, probably mid single digit transaction growth. I'll remind you, our transaction growth numbers don't include our gaming business. So it's not going to pick up the inorganic elements of FIS gaming that we added during the first quarter.","But if you look at the growth trends we're seeing, again it's kind of mid single digits from a transaction point of view that's helping to drive an overall growth in revenue on an organic basis of about 10% for the direct channels in the US market.","On the in-organics \u2013 on the indirect side, the [ISO] [ph] business it performed pretty much in line with the expectations that we've had for the last several years on a net revenue basis. It grew kind of low to mid single digits.","I'd say transaction growth was similar in that business over the quarter or so, again, relatively consistent with what we've seen for probably the past couple of years with that business overall.","Cameron Bready","And Ryan I'm sorry, Jeff. Just not to put too fine a point on this, but when we add color to these descriptions, OpenEdge or something else, these are all organic growth numbers with the exception as Cameron said of the gaming FIS which actually is not in the transaction metrics to what he just gave color.","So when we're talking about mid teens transaction growth, mid teens volume growth and mid teens revenue growth to high teens in OpenEdge, all of that's organic.","Jeffrey Sloan","I would just add that increasingly in our industry and especially in our business we're looking at additional sales of value added products and services that while and it may be tied to transactional rates of growth, I view as points of differentiation.","So talk a lot including today, that over the last year about OptBlue for example in the United States market and now since June \u2013 the end of June in the Canadian market, of course, we've had releases in September and a year ago now for Apple Pay in the US and the United Kingdom. But also Android Pay and Samsung Pay in the last couple of weeks as the EMV has been adopted and now we've gone EdgeShield, the Global Shield as it relates to the US business.","So I think the way you have to think about it is obviously transactions are important to how our business is operating, but we exited fiscal '15, as I think we said in our July call, was the single largest number that I can recall of new products and services that we've introduced into our ecosystem worldwide, but including Europe in particular in the United States and of course through September and through the end of June did the same thing with additional products and services since May.","So it's important to look at transactional trends for all the obvious reasons. But it's also important to ask about how you guys are doing in additional value added products and services and of course in a couple weeks we'll talk more about that. But that's a meaningful measures to how we've been able to increase the rate of revenue growth in the United States.","Ryan Cary","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thanks. Great, great job. Is there any way to think about obviously you were able to maintain the revenue guidance. FX we know, but clearly the macro slowed down and you were able to absorb that.","Is there any way to think about how much stronger it would have been, just given - trying to underscore how durable the model is given what's been a pretty tough macro environment as well?","Cameron Bready","Yes. I think the way we try to characterize that Kevin is, we indicated that absent the incremental FX headwinds, our revenue would have been - our revenue expectation for fiscal '16 would have been toward the higher end of the range that we had previously provided that $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion.","So that's probably the best metric I could point to, to sort of give you a sense as to what revenue might look like absent the implications of FX.","The other way to look at it as well is what I mentioned previously. If you go back to what we said in July we expected to deliver that 2.06 to 2.10 billion, which reflects 6% to 8% growth over last year, that's 9 to 11 on a constant currency basis at that time, its now 10 to 12.","So we're absorbing about 400 basis point of FX headwind now for the full year relative to what we thought would be 300 at the beginning of the year. So that gives you a little bit I think of a sense as to what the business would have performed or how the business would have performed absent both the FX we anticipated in July, as well as the incremental FX we're now absorbing as well.","Jeffrey Sloan","Kevin, I would just add to what Cameron said that, we're really just finishing \u2013 just finished up the first quarter. So I also think you have you to realize that as we guide toward the rest of the year as Cameron mentioned, looking at fairly volatile FX environment and clearly as Cameron just indicated the majority of any impact has really been FX, not the macroeconomic environment.","But sitting here in the first quarter if you look at our track record, I think we like to be in a position where we say that we've got the balance just about right, looking out at the remainder of next year.","So I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if we were sitting here in the third quarter in fiscal 2016, we would probably be having a similar conversation, but the conversation with a little bit more pointed detail about the impacts. We've got three quarters to go, and in that context we want to make sure that we continue the trend that we've seen over the last year and a half.","Kevin McVeigh","Understood. That's helpful. And then just switching gears, in terms of - should Visa Europe change hands and ultimately the Chinese market open up to kind of MasterCard and Visa? Does that open up incremental opportunities for you folks or is it kind of net neutral?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes. So Kevin, its Jeff. Listen those things are nothing but good news for us. So as we said before, I think the ability of our partners in our ecosystem to invest in their businesses, to innovate, create new products and services, expand into new markets is an important part of our success. It's not just for us, it's true of the industry. But it's an important part of our success.","So we're big believers in those kind of technological investments, and we able to show how we've been able to catalyze on that across a number of markets. So I don't know what's going on in Visa Europe beyond what we all see in the press which you can see as well.","But I would say if the philosophy is to drive additional acceleration of growth by Visa into Visa Europe, if the philosophy is to drive additional products and innovation and really drive additional card adoption and additional technological innovation, I think that's very good news for Global Payments and probably also very good news for our broad partners.","I think a very similar thesis is true in China. If that market opens up the way the Chinese government has described, it's a very good business and relationship in China and mainland China are today and we would expect that to benefit not just Global Payments but a number of the other partners in the ecosystem.","So if you step back for a second and you ask what are some of the macro trends that are really driving some of the results we've seen across our company, the collapsing of barrier as it relates to doing business across borders, the lowering of costs of acceptance, the acceleration of technological investments through people like Apple and Google and Samsung and American Express, those are all very good things for our business and what you just cited are two additional examples of things that would be very good for us.","Kevin McVeigh","Awesome. Thanks.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Chen","Hi. This is actually Jeff Chen filling in for Jim. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you guys could quantify how much attrition rates in the direct customer business has come down over the last two years and how much of that you attribute to improved business cycle or integrated payments or other factors perhaps?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, Jeff. I'll start and give a little bit of broad color in terms of those trends and I think Dave's going to drill down into detail particularly in the North American markets. So I would say when we looked at this before, in general two thirds of you attrition for Global Payments, I'm sure it's true of our peers too really comes from the business cycle.","So the vast majority of folks who don't stay with us over quarter periods of time is reflective of the fact that they're no longer in business and that tends to be the principle issue. The other third is split between price and kind of service and other things.","So the vast majority of stuff relates to the economic cycle. You also have the related issue, of a more difficult cycle, you have less and fewer new business, small business formation.","So you see both of those issues when there's an economic slowdown. That's generally you how the math tends to play out. My guess is it's very similar for our peers. Dave, you want to talk about the\u2026","David Mangum","Yes. I mean, the core attrition is really consistent around the world. You asked specifically about the United States, it's actually very consistent there over the last couple years, as you might imagine we track this diligently.","What has changed a little bit to your point is our mix. So with more integrated payments businesses the overall attrition in the United States has dropped a little bit just based on the weighting of bringing more and more integrated merchants with the less likelihood of them leaving over a price functionality product, in fact quite the opposite they say because of price quality, product and functionality.","So other than macro issue or individually going out of business, we really don't have very much attrition at all in that integrated business. That's obviously brought down to overall US attrition a bit.","But if you go through the other channels, whether it's director or even frankly the pieces within the ISO channel but also obviously our gaming business, attrition is really quite low, but also quite consistent.","Jeffrey Chen","Thanks. And just returning to the JVs for a bit, given that regulators are beginning to encourage the partnerships like you said, have you guys seen any more incremental competition for these relationships?","Jeffrey Sloan","I would say it's always competitive. So smart global financial institutions have a bunch of alternatives. I like to think it's linked Global Payments, but of course in the real world it's not. So I think we - I know we assume that all of our potential partners may have choices be it very competitive, and that really hasn\u2019t changed at the end of the day.","So I like to thank and I think our track record shows that we bring a lot of things to the table from an ability to actually show that we have been able to create value with our partners over the broad periods of time, our ability to execute, our ability to cross-sell, ramp up sales and penetrate into new markets.","I think we have some distinctive advantages but I don\u2019t think we ever fool ourselves thinking that it\u2019s not competitive or we don\u2019t want to put our very best foot forward each and every time and that really hasn't changed.","David Mangum","I mean we work very hard, we work very hard to obviously position ourselves as the partner\u2019s choice and our ability to continue to expand partnerships like we have with Caixa as we have now partnered with them in Central Europe, in Eastern Europe through the years of transaction.","I think it is indicative just how well some of those partnerships have gone and how effective we are actually partnering with some of these financial institutions. So, although they are competitive we do work very hard to make sure that if it is a situation that we find attractive and the opportunity is compelling to us that we are doing everything we can to prevail.","Jeffrey Chen","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Craig Maurer","Good morning, thanks. Couple of questions. First, could you be more specific on the contribution OptBlue is making to topline growth in North America and potentially, if you roll that out not only Canada but across the Atlantic. And secondly, I know this is a bit of an abstract question, but could you comment on the European court's decision to eliminate the Safe Harbor Act and if that, if you can envision that having any impact on payment processors or companies that operate out of U.S. in Europe. Thanks.","Jeffrey Sloan","Sure, it\u2019s Jeff, I\u2019ll start with the second question first, and I\u2019ll ask David to comment on OptBlue and principally North America. So, on your question about the European court, firstly they really talked about the safe harbor which came out the other day and which concerns over the safe harbor.","Global payments we believe today complies with the directive. We were relying on the safe harbor, that with some of the issue the other day. So, we believe we are in compliance with the base directive.","We don't think that directly that we\u2019ll have any significant impact on the way we do business. Now there are a bunch of third parties that vary by market that will have to digest the opinion and those third parties may or may not be relying on the safe harbor and that\u2019s something that will have to be worked through.","But as it relates to us directly, there we don\u2019t expect any impact and what the EU court ruled on the other day.","David Mangum","Yes. So then relative to OptBlue really around the world is a focus on your question, we\u2019re obviously not going to break out the incremental revenue contribution of OptBlue. You should know though and I\u2019m sure you realize this, it\u2019s a nice piece of the organic growth story but really it\u2019s a piece of an overall story that Jeff touched on earlier which is we\u2019re rolling out new products on a consistent basis, therefore it can be difficult to purely model this which is transactions, trying to spread to get you to revenue.","We\u2019re rolling out value added products in every channel. We already have the value proposition I mentioned earlier in OpenEdge. Now we\u2019re going to add OptBlue on top of that to drive a little more growth deeper into the double digits and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve been able to do across all of our United States channels. ","Sales have been terrific and in fact, we are actually seeing volume increase to the ISO channel now through OptBlue. That\u2019s really the power of the distribution network we\u2019ve built, the ability to pump out new product on top of these existing core transaction volumes.","Craig Maurer","I\u2019m sorry, I just wanted to follow up. Do you - like some of your peers expect to see significant grow over the OptBlue contribution at the end of the calendar year?","David Mangum","You mean, grow over issues, no, we don\u2019t at all. In fact, this is now a core part of the transactions, we then process from there. So it becomes a part of just same stores sales as we go forward including the opportunity to go and continue to penetrate our base.","It\u2019s not as if we exit calendar 2015 fully penetrated with AmEx OptBlue and I would say, far from it. We have a long way to go. We would probably describe it, it may be the fifth innings in United States and that\u2019s not true of all of our channels. Some of our channels are in the third innings, couple in the sixth, that\u2019s why I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re beginning to see an uptick even in the ISO channel which is incremental net revenue and net profit to global payments with each sale.","So we feel very good about the trajectory in United States and the long term trajectories result of that product and the other products we are delivering.","In Canada, just to finish up the part of your first question, it\u2019s very early, just launched in June. Now remember in Canada and with the other markets if you think around the world, you have to start with what AmEx has penetration overall in the market, therefore what can the contribution be.","We\u2019re very happy today with the progress. Our sales folks have hit every milestone in Canada that we'd expect in the early days its available nationally and so we expect that to be a part of the Canada\u2019s stability and modest growth story. In fact it just give us more confidence about the Canada you\u2019ve heard us talk about for several quarters now as you roll-out around the world, what you may find and you\u2019ll find this probably in the U.K. is OptBlue will replace existing programs in some markets.","So some of the incremental opportunity may be muted but there is an incremental growth opportunity in each market as we roll this out globally again in our unique global distribution platform in our unique technology platforms.","Craig Maurer","Thank you. And just one additional if you could comment on where you think Europe is in terms of the progress made across the entire regulated area in cutting interchange levels. We know that some countries have been far more progressive than others and where you think we are in that process?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, I would say we are in the very early innings of that process of course Spain as Cameron alluded to in his comments, really adopted the interchange changes and that is annualized as of September 1 of this year 2015.","But with that exception, by and large we\u2019re in the very early innings, the way the policy directive is played through in the EU is that while it\u2019s country specific in general we expect most of that to begin in earnest in the back half of fiscal 2016 which for us is starting in December, at the beginning of our back half of 2016.","And then we will see what the pace of change is country by country thereafter. But I would say we\u2019re in the fifth or sixth inning as David said in OptBlue we are really in the first or second inning in the case of the European rate reductions.","Craig Maurer","Okay. Thank you very much.","Thank you.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks very much everybody for joining us this morning and your interest in Global Payments.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone."],"10105":["Global Payments Inc.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call will be recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Andrew Langford. Please go ahead.","Andrew Langford","Good morning and welcome to Global Payments fiscal 2016 third quarter conference call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour. Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today\u2019s conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them. In addition, some of these comments made on the call may refer to certain measures such as cash earnings, adjusted net revenue and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP measures. For a full reconciliation of cash earnings, adjusted net revenue and other non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP results, in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our trended financial highlights, both of which are available in the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now, I\u2019d like to introduce Jeff Sloan. Jeff?","Jeff Sloan","Thank you, Andrew. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong results. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets with particular strength in our United States and United Kingdom businesses, continuing our track record of solid execution globally. Importantly, we are also on track with our pending acquisition of Heartland Payment, which we expect to close later this month.","For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we grew net revenue 6%, expanded margins 50 basis points, and increased cash earnings per share 17%, all this despite absorbing significant incremental foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, each of these metrics exceeded our expectations, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy and operational excellence across the organization.","Now for more detailed highlights. We are especially pleased with our performance in North America, where we believe we continue to grow faster than our markets by capturing share and verticals at attractive growth and margin characteristics. Organic net revenue growth for our U.S. direct business accelerated in the quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. OpenEdge continued its streak of mid to high-teens growth. Our gaming business also continued to deliver strong organic growth coupled with sound execution of the FIS gaming acquisition that was completed in June.","In Europe, our UK business continues to execute exceptionally well with significant organic revenue growth. Our results also reflected benefits from the EU interchange regulation that became effective in December of 2015. Outside of the UK, Spain maintained its strong track record with yet another quarter of double-digit volume and transaction growth, well in excess of the market rate of growth and Spanish GDP. We remain pleased with the performance of our European e-commerce gateway business, Realex, and we are poised to enter the Spanish market with new omnichannel offerings in the coming months following the UK launch last fall.","In the Asia-Pacific region, we produced strong revenue growth on a local currency basis, despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in Greater China. Our strategy to diversify distribution in the region by entering new geographic markets and partnerships has been successful. Ezidebit had another outstanding quarter, accelerating growth to 20% plus on a local currency basis. Our BPI joint venture also continues to perform in line with our expectations. We\u2019ve been able to offset macro weakness by solid execution illustrated by margin performance in Asia, which significantly exceeded our expectations.","We are also building upon our successful partnership with Ezidebit with the acquisition of eWAY, a payment gateway and e-commerce technology company in Australia. Similar to Realex in Ireland, eWAY is a leading provider of payment solution to developers and software partners with approximately 25% of the online market. The combination of eWAY\u2019s cutting edge products with Ezidebit complements our global omnichannel solution strategy and will create the leading payment technology company in Asia-Pacific with nearly 40,000 merchant customers in Australia and New Zealand.","We have made considerable progress on our pending acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, which we look to close later this month. This transaction will accelerate transformative growth at a time when both businesses are executing strongly. And we continue to be impressed with the people we have met at Heartland. As we have done successfully with APT, PayPros, Ezidebit and Realex, we are confident in our ability to accelerate sales growth at Heartland.","The goal of our integration is to ensure a frictionless transition post close, building on the momentum that Global Payments and Heartland have each had individually as one combined company. We are even more confident in the synergies that we described at the time of the transaction announcements and could not be more pleased with our proposed partnership. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues shortly.","Now, I will turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019ve made substantial progresses as a business in fiscal 2016 and are delighted to report another quarter of strong adjusted net revenue growth, operating margin expansion and cash earnings per share growth despite significant FX headwinds.","Total company net revenue for the third was $497 million, reflecting growth of 6% versus the third quarter of fiscal 2015 or 11% on a constant currency basis. Importantly, normalized organic net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was high-single-digit for the quarter at the high-end of our cycle guidance.","Operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 28.7% for the quarter or 110 basis points on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share increased 17% to $0.70 or 28% on a constant currency basis. North America net revenue grew 6% in the quarter with operating margin expansion of 70 basis points to 27.2% despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels was high-single-digits for the quarter and accelerated sequentially relative to fiscal second quarter performance.","Canada delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations, driven by stable fundamentals. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North American net revenue growth by several hundred basis points.","As Jeff noted, our European business performed exceptionally well again this quarter, posting revenue growth of 8%. Adjusting for adverse currency exchange rates, especially the British pound and euro, European constant currency net revenue growth was 68%.","Operating margins in Europe for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 49.7%. Asia Pacific net revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis despite continued macroeconomic weakness in Greater China. Reported net revenue growth in Asia-Pacific was 3% as a result of significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate. We are particularly pleased with operating margins in Asia-Pacific for the quarter, which expanded by over 600 basis points. This was driven primarily by growth in our higher margin businesses, predominantly Ezidebit as well as expense management across the region in light of the broader macro trends.","Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $21 million. Free cash flow, defined as net operating cash flows excluding settlement assets and obligations less capital expenditures and distributions to the non-controlling interest was $77 million.","In connection with our planned acquisition of Heartland, we\u2019ve been engaged in a variety of financing related activities over the past few months. In February, we amended our existing credit facilities to retain them post closing of the Heartland transaction. At the same time, given strong interest from existing and new lenders, we entered into a new $735 million delayed draw term loan A facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the transaction. The new term loan A facility, which we expect to be more cost effective then our term loan B, allowed us to reduce the size of the term loan B component of the transaction financing by $735 million to $1.045 billion. In addition, in March, we successfully completed syndication of the $1.045 billion term loan B facility on terms and conditions more favorable than we expected, in December.","As a result of these activities, we now expect the weighted average pro forma interest rate on our debt facilities to be in the range of 3.75% to 4%, as compared to the 4% to 4.25% range we anticipated at the time of the announcement of the transaction. We expect this will generate a meaningful amount of annual interest expense savings relative to our original pro forma assumptions.","As we approach the closing of the Heartland transaction later this month, we intend to resume our normal capital allocation policies immediately thereafter. Although our near term priority is to return to our targeted leverage ratio, we retained sufficient capacity to continue to pursue the capital allocation program we have employed with much success over the past few years.","As evidenced by the eWAY transaction, we remain interested in select acquisitions that augment our strategies globally. Likewise, you should assume that we will return to being a consistent buyer of our stock as means by which to return capital to shareholders.","Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2016, on a constant currency basis, we expect net revenues to be towards the high end of our guidance range of 10% to 12% growth over fiscal 2015. Given the continued weakness we have seen in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, in particular the British pound, we expect reported revenues to be towards the low end of our previous guidance range at of $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion.","We are increasing our cash operating margin expectations and now anticipate margins will expand by at least 100 basis points in fiscal 2016 on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share are now expected to grow 16% to 19% over fiscal 2015 and range from $2.93 to $3. Finally, please note that our outlook does not include the impact of the Heartland\u2019s acquisition that we expect to close later this month.","We anticipate that the addition of Heartland will add $80 million to $100 million to our net revenues and have a de minimis impact on cash earnings per share for fiscal 2016.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks Cameron. We are delighted with our team\u2019s accomplishments this quarter and this fiscal year. Looking ahead, we\u2019re eager to finalize our transformative partnership with Heartland. This merger furthers the four pillars of our strategy described in our October investor day, grow and control direct distribution through the addition of 300,000 in merchants; add distinctive products and services in new markets, such as the K-12 and university educational markets; leverage our combined technological and operational advantages by increasing transactions nearly 50% on a pro forma basis; and continue to invest in our global businesses to generate superior returns. This is truly an exciting time and I look forward to speaking with you in July as one combined company. Andrew?","Andrew Langford","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I would like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll now take the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I guess the first question I have is with regards to the margin trajectory. And you\u2019ve now performed, I guess better than expected on margin for a couple of years here. I\u2019m wondering how much more is there in terms of margin improvement ex the Heartland synergy? I mean basically Heartland was not a factor. And can you go through, as you look at the company in the present shape, what are the factors that continue to drive margin improvement; is it primarily scale, revenue mix, scale or what are the factors?","Jeff Sloan","Ashwin, it\u2019s Jeff; I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Cameron to join me as well. First, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got pretty of run rate -- runway on margin enhancement. I think as we said, probably a number of times in last couple of years, we view margins on a standalone basis in the low thirties as achievable and sustainable; even with terrific margin performance today, we\u2019re still not at that level. I think to get to your question about what\u2019s driving that growth, undoubtedly scale is an important element in that but I think it\u2019s really been a conscious decision in our part to shift our mix toward businesses that we view as attractive, and by attractive I mean growing faster than the rate of market growth with better margin characteristics. So, if you look for example at OpenEdge, which we talk a lot about that used to grow, as we said in our prepared remarks, at rate 2 to 3 times the rate of market growth. If you look at Realex, if you look at Ezidebit, these are all businesses, Ashwin, that first are growing very rapidly compared to their markets, but second, provide us with opportunities for further margin enhancement prior to Heartland. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in the early innings of where we can take the margins that gives us obviously a lot of comfort as we look toward Heartland to think about what we might do together as one combined company. Cameron?","Cameron Bready","Yes, Ashwin, the only thing I would add to that -- couple of points. First, if you look at our guidance for this year, it sort of implies almost 30% margin -- growth of as we noted over 100 basis points year-over-year. We still have a lot of room relative to overall target level of low 30s to continue to expand margins from here on a standalone basis.","In addition to the items Jeff described, the other things I would call out specifically are, one, the acquisitions we continue to do, improve scale and markets that we find attractive that have good dynamics where our businesses are geared towards higher margins solutions such as for example, the eWAY transaction that we just executed and its contributions to our Australian business and what it will to do margins in Australia to continue to improve those from their already attractive levels.","The last thing I would mention is we continue make investments in our infrastructure to improve our operational leverage. We continue this transformation, we started out on several years ago, to move away from the holding company, operating company model, the business utilized from many years to the single unified operating company structure that David described at the investor conference back in October. That\u2019s still in process. And I think that continued evolution provides a nice tailwind for margin expansion over time as well.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. And then, I guess the follow-up is really on Heartland. Your comments that Heartland -- the progress you are making on Heartland is better than where you are expected to be. Was that primarily, Cameron, a direction of your commentary on interest expense or were you also talking about other things such as conversations with clients, feedback you are receiving in the market, things like that if you could comment on that?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Ashwin, it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll certainly start. No, more it\u2019s on a strategic side. So, what I would say is as we spend more time with our future colleagues at Heartland, we\u2019ve been more and more impressed with the quality of the people, the quality of the culture and the business that Bob and the team have built over a period of decade at Heartland. I think David had said in the December call that there was roughly a little overlap between Heartland, its vertical markets and our markets, even though we\u2019re both SME focused. Our view on that continues to strengthen, meaning there is relatively little overlap, as we see it. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we believe that we are even more confident today in the synergies that we described in December, sitting here in April. So, really, I was referring to the strategic rationale for the transaction and what we believe the receptiveness is and has been to-date with our partners at Heartland as well as with potential customers. Cameron, of course was commenting more on the financials but as well as commenting on the strategic objectives.","Cameron Bready","Yes, Ashwin, my comments in the script around the financing obviously serve to bolster the overall confidence in the transaction as well. Taking the financing risk off the table as we have in the first quarter of calendar \u201816, obviously it was a meaningful step towards executing the transaction. And obviously being able to do that on terms and conditions that were far more favorable than we would have expected back in December when we announced the transaction, again, gives us a nice tailwind as we look to close later this month and begin operating as a combined company in the next several weeks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","I just want to ask about the UK strength. Is that directly related to the changes in the EU regulation or is that something different?","Jeff Sloan","Hey Bryan, it\u2019s Jeff. I would say it\u2019s probably something different, meaning we probably had now 18 months of very solid new sales growth, organic sales execution in that market, yet the benefit of the interchange regulation really got picked up in December of 2015. So, certainly, the performance in the UK that I think we described last quarter on the call has significantly exceeded our expectations, really all-year implies, the last 18 months, just a little bit more of that.","As it relates to the interchange benefit as we discussed in the context of Spain and also in the case of United States when we had Durban, 4 or 5 years ago, we view the interchange benefit\u2019s a little bit more temporal. That\u2019s just a function of over what period of time that will rationalize within the marketplace. But that business as it relates to that element of its growth has also met what our expectations were heading into the third quarter. So, it\u2019s a little bit more of the latter of what you said in the former.","Bryan Keane","And do you expect the EU interchange benefit in the UK to last for a significant period, or is it hard to tell how long it will last for?","Jeff Sloan","No, I think Bryan, it\u2019s very similar what we said about Spain and the United States markets, and other markets in which we\u2019ve experienced it. We tend to think about it in 12 months increments for obviously reasons that you can imagine. This actually startles a number of fiscal years here, so it just started in December for us, given our May fiscal year. So, I\u2019d say Bryan, as we usually assume something like 12 to 18 months, until we get back to levels that predate, the interchange change, our actual experience has been closer to 18 to 24 months in terms of what we saw in the United States. I think sitting here, in Spain, and we\u2019re probably 18 months after the inspection in September of 2014 in Spain, we\u2019re still today Bryan at higher levels of spread in Spain than we were before, the adoption in the first place 18 months later.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, Cameron, I think you said $80 million to $100 million in net revenue for Heartland expectations. I guess, is that over four to five-week period and I guess, what we\u2019ll all do is, we\u2019ll extrapolate with that meetings for next year. Is there any seasonality in that number that you can guide us to as we build our models for fiscal year \u201816 and \u201817?","Cameron Bready","Sure, Bryan. And of course, we\u2019ll give you more color in July, obviously when we have our call as to what we would anticipate for Heartland for a full fiscal \u201817 for us. But to the first part of your question, yes, I mean, reflects sort of a four to five-week period. We don\u2019t know exactly when it\u2019s going to close. Obviously we know when their shareholder date is and we\u2019ll look to close as quickly thereafter as possible. But we don\u2019t know the exact date on which it will close, hence the range. There is also obviously some work to do to ensure that they\u2019re completely aligned with our net revenue reporting convention. We believe that the estimate we provided obviously is aligned but we need to get under the hood a little bit further to make sure that\u2019s the case as well. Their business is probably going to be seasonally similar to ours. So, to the extent that you want to try to extrapolate these numbers into a fiscal \u201817 early view, I\u2019d suggest their seasonality is not going to be materially different than what you\u2019d see in our business and that should help give you some color as to how to shape it for fiscal \u201817.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is now open.","George Mihalos","Great, thanks for taking my question. I caught the commentary around the U.S. direct growth. Could you guys talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in the ISO channel and then maybe somewhat related to that the rumored or expected migration of a large customer there off to a competitor\u2019s platform, how\u2019s that coming along?","David Mangum","George, this is David, happy to help with a couple of those questions there and let Cameron add any details that I miss. In terms of the ISO channel, it\u2019s really business as usual for us; it was another flat quarter from a revenue perspective. That means all the growth that Cameron is talking about the acceleration growth comes from our direct control channels. So, another very consistent quarter we\u2019ve been talking about the ISO for quite some time as a flat, maybe low single-digit grower; it continues perform in that range. As to the migration you\u2019re talking about, maybe I\u2019ll be even more specific. I appreciate though the way you\u2019ve phrased your question. You\u2019re really talking about Mercury. And the migration in Mercury accounts that will be leaving us, did actually occur over the course of this past quarter, so by the end of our February, the month of February, our third quarter, the migrations were completed. As we\u2019ve talked about any number of times that impact is already reflected in the guidance, you can tell from the performance we delivered in the United States this quarter, just how minor this migration is in terms of affecting Global Payments overall.","George Mihalos","Great, thanks for that.","Cameron Bready","I\u2019ll just add a couple of comments very quickly, as to the first part of your question, U.S. direct growth on a normalized basis organic was high single-digit for the quarter, accelerating sequentially over Q2, probably 50 to 100 basis points something in that range. So, we\u2019re obviously very pleased that continues to be laid by OpenEdge, going mid to high teens, yet again. Obviously we\u2019re now three years past the acquisition of APT and going on to for PayPros and continuing to perform again at growth levels that we find very, very attractive and the momentum remain very strong for that business. So, very pleased with our U.S. performance in Q3, as you noted.","George Mihalos","That\u2019s great to hear. And just a quick follow-up on Spain, I think you guys made a commentary, the spreads are obviously higher than what they were prior to the interchange benefit coming through but have the spreads stabilized on a quarter-over-quarter basis, so if you compare the February quarter to the November quarter?","David Mangum","They have stabilized, they\u2019ve stabilized just above levels that Jeff noted before the interchange benefits but they\u2019re quite stable right now. And then I think I\u2019d add to that what\u2019s really driving Spain is incredible sales growth, incredible volume growth that continues in the mid teens volume and transaction growth, both. So, we\u2019ve got a little extra spread from back in the day plus that volume and transaction growth. We\u2019re in a great place in Spain right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oscar Turner of Suntrust. Your line is now open.","Oscar Turner","So, we\u2019ve seen some news on the backlog or EMV certifications, so just had a couple of questions on that. One, is this something that you\u2019re seeing within your merchant base? And two, does this backlog have any long-term implications for acquirers?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Oscar; it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll start and David can provide some commentary too. So, first, I saw the same series of article. The first thing I\u2019d say relative to those articles is unlike some of our peers, we\u2019re independent, not owned by a bank. So, clearly, the implications of that article were that there were some relationships between bank ownership on the issuing side, on the acquiring side, and just so we all recognize that that wouldn\u2019t really not apply to us as it relates to the specific article, I think that you\u2019re referring to. As it relates to certifications, I think you see strength of ours has been early rollout, the EMV we announced probably a year ago, at this point, a little bit more than the year ago, a suite of products and services, EdgeShield and GlobalShield that were EMV compliant with encryption and tokenization and NFT all wrapped into one. So, I think everybody has had to push on the certification side, given the complexity of the U.S. broader ecosystem. So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s different really for anyone. But I would say that we\u2019re very proud of the fact that we were in market. And I think problem was probably very similar. In market very early on with the certifications, so we really on our side have not seen any meaningful impact as it relates to the certifications, the way that article really had alluded to as I read it. David, do you want to\u2026","David Mangum","Yes. Well, I think the key is the last couple of things you mentioned, Jeff and that we don\u2019t view EMV as a compliant exercise; it\u2019s a part of a security solution we\u2019re bringing to market, based on merchant demand. At the same time, we also are bringing to market what is global expertise in EMV. We\u2019ve rolled out EMV all over the world, as you might imagine, all the way back to Canada five years ago, which is probably the most recent example of needing to bring EMV to market to improve security for the merchants. When you think about the focus on security suites and solutions, we\u2019ve been able to drive some new sales around security but EMV itself is in no way an economic tailwind for us. It\u2019s a process for us in terms of migration of making sure the ecosystem is more secure.","From that perspective from the ecosystem perspective, our metrics are really right in line with what you might see from the industry at large. Measured migration, consistent migration is our theme driven by merchant demand, after merchant education from Global Payments. One thing I would note for you though is when you think about our key direct portfolios, things like OpenEdge, which is full of dentist offices, veterinary clinics, drycleaners; those are not high demand verticals for EMV migration. So, we\u2019re working at the pace our merchants want to work, we\u2019re trying to drive more education, drive more migration.","As Jeff noted before, our certifications are in very good shape. We\u2019re just moving along with the market and in some cases a little ahead of the market. One more reminder in terms of percentages when you see them banded about by industry players, we have a very focused portfolio as is Heartland on small to medium merchants around the country. You won\u2019t find big box retailers in our portfolio; you won\u2019t find them by and large in Heartland\u2019s portfolio either. So, just remember that when we talk about the level of migration, the pace. We\u2019ve had a lot of small to medium merchants to go through as does the rest of the industry. We\u2019re going through them very consistently, very happy with the progress I think our merchants are as well. We\u2019re managing chargebacks of the merchants which may be a follow-up you might want to ask in terms of there\u2019s a minor uptick but very manageable so far. And I think again that\u2019s the result of years of global experience managing EMV, managing the shift and being able to help our merchants through it.","Oscar Turner","Okay, thanks. And just a small follow-up to that. About what percentage of your merchant base is updated for EMV, so either that\u2019s upgraded as far as hardware goes or that\u2019s able to actually process an EMV transaction?","David Mangum","Yes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to quote any specific percentages. I would stick with we are very consistent with the industry stats you see at large. We\u2019re very happy with the progress. And I think our merchants again are driving it from a demand perspective. But just know that whether you\u2019re talking about terminals in place that are ready to be enabled or actual enable transactions, we\u2019re pretty consistent in our key verticals and a little bit ahead of the market. And the industry says it\u2019s about 20%, that obviously includes an awful lot of big box retailers because there\u2019s been a great deal of movement in the last few months from very low single digits up to that 20 percentage kind of mark you\u2019ve seen in the press in the last couple of weeks. That\u2019s a lot of big box retail. But it\u2019s really nice progress for the industry. I think we\u2019ll keep making more progress on the global side obviously as we go forward.","Cameron Bready","Hey Oscar, it\u2019s Cameron. I just want to add one other note to a pattern to David\u2019s response. If you\u2019re thinking about this question, obviously there\u2019s an industry element too, but there\u2019s maybe a financial element as well. There seems to be a fair amount of confusion in the market as it relates to the financial impacts of EMV and some of that\u2019s driven by in the space; there\u2019s a lot of issuers who also do acquiring etcetera, etcetera. I think for Global Payments in particular, EMV has certainly not been a tailwind, as it relates to our financial results. I think I still view it frankly as a headwind in the sense that we had to make investments into our systems, and I\u2019m still waiting for the return on that investment to some degree. Over time, obviously, I think we expect that to come. But to David\u2019s point, our focus has really been heretofore on ensuring that our merchants have all the tools available to them to become complaint working at a pace that aligns with their desires to become EMV complaint. We haven\u2019t really viewed it as an economic return opportunity thus far. So, the conventional wisdom is EMV\u2019s been a tailwind for all the acquirers, that\u2019s really not the case for us, but we have been I think managing through it very, very effectively.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok of KBW. Your line is now open.","Steven Kwok","Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to eWAY, could you talk about how big it is in terms of what the financial impacts are?","Cameron Bready","Steven, it\u2019s Cameron, I\u2019ll just jump in quickly. So, purchase price wise, it\u2019s small. I mean it\u2019s sort of 50ish million U.S. So, it\u2019s not a particularly large asset but it\u2019s a very nice, I think of it as a product add to our existing position in Ezidebit business in Australia; it obviously enhances our omnichannel solution strategy that we spoke at great length about in October at our investor day. I think bringing that asset to our portfolio into Australia really positions us to accelerate our omnichannel solutions capability in market. And we\u2019ve really looked at it very simply as a buy versus build opportunity. We\u2019re delighted with Realex and what it\u2019s been able to bring to our portfolio. As we noted in our prepared comments, we launched the bundle in the fall in the UK, we\u2019re bringing it to Spain in the not too distant future. But as it related to Australia, this was a very unique opportunity to buy the market leader from an e-com point of view, coupled with our existing presence with the Ezidebit, which we\u2019ve been thrilled with their performance to create the leading technology enabled distribution platform in the Asia-Pacific region. So, it was a fantastic opportunity. And one of the side benefits of structuring the Heartland transaction the way we did is we\u2019ve maintained the financial capacity to be able to do these types of things and we\u2019re obviously delighted to have eWAY as part of the family.","Steven Kwok","Got it. And then just could you update us on perhaps your M&A pipeline as well?","Jeff Sloan","Sure. Steven, it\u2019s Jeff, I\u2019ll respond to that. So obviously, we announced product expansion today with eWAY. As we said in December at the time of the Heartland announcement, we continue to have term sheets out in a bunch of regions, primarily in Asia and in Europe; of course, we\u2019re pretty full up here in the United States and in the North America with the depending close of the Heartland transaction. So, I think as you look at eWAY and as you look at Erste, which we expect to close by the end of this fiscal year, I think to Cameron\u2019s point, those are pretty good examples of the types of transactions that we have sheets out on today, which is to say while towards the lower end of what we\u2019ve invested in transaction nonetheless very meaningful from a strategic and new markets point of view. And I would look to seeing some more of those as well as Cameron mentioned in his remarks, a return to the normal cadence of capital allocation that we\u2019ve been doing as a company over the last 3.5 years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, good morning. I\u2019d just want to first start on Asia-Pac; I guess the margins there a nice upside. How much this is from the proactive cost cutting -- I think you mentioned given I think China and how much impact have you seen from a macro perspective from China? Can you quantify some of that? Thanks.","Jeff Sloan","Yes. Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Jeff, I\u2019ll start. So, one of the things that we pointed out in our prepared remarks is that we\u2019ve been very successful in Asia-Pacific by adding new markets and by increasing our presence in markets that have been performing well. So, we\u2019ve talked a lot about Australia, we just responded to Steven talking about eWAY and Ezidebit. Of course we have our joint venture with Bank of the Philippines Islands which are also performing in line with our expectations and we\u2019ve been in that market before the JV and increased our size and have the second largest presence in that market thereafter.","As a result, we\u2019ve been able to grow -- to answer your question, we\u2019ve been able to grow the Asia-Pacific business 9% on a constant currency business this quarter. So, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re still getting very good growth. And Greater China, which I define as Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, as a percentage of the business in Asia-Pacific and so reduce from probably number of years ago probably around half of it to maybe around 30% currently. And that\u2019s largely is a result of targeted additions in other markets like Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. We also continue to grow very well in markets like Singapore, beyond the two or three that I just listed. So, I\u2019d say there\u2019s been a fair amount of revenue growth and about two-thirds of Asia-Pacific, Tien-tsin, coming from markets other than as a percentage of revenue, other than Greater China, providing in the case of Ezidebit 20% plus growth. It\u2019s not really going to have a dramatic an impact on the revenue growth in any one quarter, Greater China that is. So, I think a lot of it\u2019s coming from the mix of business, particularly that Ezidebit is at a much higher margin than the overall company as well as Asia by itself and that\u2019s how I think about it. Cameron, you can comment maybe a little bit on the expense side.","Cameron Bready","Sure. I\u2019ll just start maybe, Tien-tsin, on Ezi. So, I would note first and foremost, we\u2019re a year plus beyond the acquisition. We\u2019ve now, I think in our minds fully integrated Ezidebit, so that is creating an environment where incremental margins at Ezi are improving. And obviously it\u2019s already higher than our Asia average margins, and it\u2019s increasing from there and accelerating from there. So, I think that\u2019s contributing to it. But as it relates to the expense side, I think what we really try to do is look at our core business in Asia-Pacific outside of Australia and to some degree the Philippines where we have the joint venture with BPI and really try to rationalize the size of the expense base relative to the outlook for that market over the next 12 to 18 months. And the reality is, we do expect continued weakness in China, hopefully we\u2019ve seen before, but we don\u2019t expect it to rebound dramatically in the near-term. So, we really try to reposition the business to ride out what we expect to be a soft spot in the cycle in the Greater China market and position the business for continued success. And I think you\u2019re seeing the results of that play through in margins this quarter.","Tien-tsin Huang","So, just as my follow-up, I think I\u2019ll ask on Canada. Just any update on volume and spread performance, any callouts there, I think we\u2019re all watching the growth very closely?","Cameron Bready","Yes. I think, I\u2019ll start by saying we\u2019re delighted with the performance of our Canadian team this year. Their ability to forecast, predict and manage their business to produce results in line with our expectations in light of what is obviously a continued soft macroeconomic environment has been fantastic. So, I\u2019ll start there. I think we continue to see sort of our code for stable fundamentals is the combination of stable low-single-digit transaction volume growth and relatively stable spreads. So, when we talk about fundamentals for Canada, our expectation is the combination of transaction volume growth and stable spread is going to produce low-single-digit growth in local currency in that market. We\u2019ve been consistently doing that now for probably 8 to 10 quarters I would say. And I remain very pleased with how that team has performed in light of the broader macro issues.","David Mangum","And maybe, Tien-tsin, this is David, a little commercial for Canada, we\u2019re ahead on sales. So, when you lay on top of that sales growth and new product introductions, things like OptBlue that we can rollout on a global basis, you got that little bit extra to help make you feel more confident, managing those stable conditions and stable metrics that Cameron was describing.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Dave Koning","Yes, hey guys. Nice job and I guess first of all just on Spain. I\u2019m wondering if that could be a nice catalyst for growth or improving growth into next year. I know you said spreads are still up but is revenue right now down because spreads on year-on-year basis are probably still down and the minority interest line was pretty weak this quarter. So, I\u2019m just wondering if Spain right now is even though good in a little tougher spot but basically set to really nicely to accelerate and help next year?","David Mangum","Yes. Dave, it\u2019s David. I think that\u2019s a really interesting question in that. Where Spain it\u2019s right now is flat to slightly up in terms of revenue growth, which is really remarkable when you think about annualizing that interchange benefit and it\u2019s of course driven by the amazing sales we get out of the branches and the resultant volume and transaction growth in mid teens. So, you\u2019re exactly right. As we look ahead, I can think through fully annualizing spread changes et cetera as we head toward September, it is accelerating as we speak in terms of market share and penetration and it will be a piece of the European growth story that Cameron was describing earlier as we go forward, no question about it.","Cameron Bready","And David, it\u2019s Cameron. The only thing I\u2019ll add to David\u2019s point more specifically, we annualize the annualization of interchange reductions in September. So, when you\u2019re growing transaction and volumes at the rate we\u2019re growing, once you get beyond that date, obviously you should be top line growing at similar levels, which creates a nice tailwind, growing into the back half of fiscal \u201817 in Europe, as we start to annualize the interchange reductions in the UK.","Dave Koning","Yes, that all make sense, great. And I guess secondly, as we look out, next quarter, you\u2019ll be giving guidance on fiscal \u201817 and we\u2019ll all be looking at Heartland and everything else going on, but is there anything as we look back over the last year or so, is there anything we need to think about from a comp standpoint so that we\u2019re starting to think about the quarters right in the future, is like the Q1 comp for Q1 \u201817, a really tough one or is there anything one-off that we need to be starting to think about now?","Cameron Bready","Well, I think, your point on Q1 is a good one. As we said in October, when we had our first quarter call, Q1 was an exceptional quarter this year and not one that we expect to duplicate, notwithstanding that there seem to be a view that we\u2019d duplicate it in Q2. And despite having a very good quarter, it wasn\u2019t quite as good as Q1. So, I do think that\u2019s a fair point as you think about setting your model up for fiscal \u201817. Outside of that, it\u2019s just again and I talked to many of you guys about this, it\u2019s assessing the FX impacts on results and trying to figure out how to overlay those on top of annualization of acquisitions that we\u2019ve made and how all that plays through the financials. Obviously happy to talk more offline as to how to think about that but obviously the volatility around FX and the amount headwind we\u2019ve seen from FX does make it little bit difficult from time to time to try to get reported results forecasted correctly quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year.","Jeff Sloan","I would say, Dave, though, it\u2019s Jeff, that\u2019s exactly right. I would say that the Company as you know from our descriptions before, it\u2019s going to go from about half the revenue being in the United States and half outside being dollar denominated into two-thirds post Heartland dollar denominated, so what Cameron projected right and first we saw with our three regions. And so, regionally I would hope and looking at Cameron and saying this, I would hope it would be easier to model, coming out just given the next 50% dollar denominated the overall Company going to two-thirds. So, my hope is well those things are exactly right that in terms of the impact as a whole on overall company revenue and all the company earnings, I\u2019m hopeful that more straight forward but as Cameron said, the devil is in the detail. So, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Tim Willi","Thank you, good morning. I had a question on just the e-commerce omnichannel; obviously you\u2019ve talked a lot about this in the last year. So, given the success in the UK, and you talked about moving this into Spain, could you may be just review, like lessons learned, what has worked really, really well that you think is very exportable into other regions and may be areas either it\u2019s competition or product where there were areas that needed to be improved and you\u2019ve probably done that but may be hindered some of the performance that if there were any in terms of that, just give us better feel for the momentum and the potential?","David Magnum","This is David. A couple of lessons learned. We\u2019re finding very strong demand for the bundled solution in the UK. The place where we\u2019re working hard is just probably on the joint sales proposition and being able to take what you might think of as a traditional sale and marry to it a more technology enabled piece of the sale; so, the gateway, marry to the acquiring, marry to reporting, marry to the fraud and credit management you have to be able to provide. All those tools are there. Probably the place where we\u2019ve learned the most lessons have been on making those joint sales calls and enabling and equipping traditional sales folks to be able to sell either the early stages of e-commerce enablement to small to medium merchant or sell the entire bundle. The good news is with the demand we\u2019ve had and the lot of execution we\u2019ve seen, it has not affected our sales trajectory but we\u2019re very pleased with the sales coming at back of the demand, but it isn\u2019t more technical sale. So being able to equip your sales people on a global basis to sell more technology enabled transaction processing is a challenge of its own. We feel like we\u2019ve learned a lot in that really integrations in the UK and Ireland that will serve us well in Spain particularly. It\u2019s allowed us, Tim, to think more specifically about how you target a market and how you focus a piece of the sales force on the micro payments from sales and micro merchants, a piece of the sales force on small to medium, and then joint calling of experts may be from Ireland in addition to Spain on large to national merchants and certainly joint calling between all of your regions as well as your technical experts in the place like Ireland where Realex based on multi-regional or multi-market or regional accounts.","So, really how you go to market has been where we\u2019ve learned lessons. And again, we\u2019re fortunate enough to be learning them in a situation where the sales are right at target, or above in many cases. So, we feel good about those pieces. And if you step back a little bit and think about this, the second and third piece of this is really partners and software developers. As you enter new markets, you want to continue the momentum you have with channel partners, so ISVs, cart providers, folks like that. You also want to develop and foster your relationship with developers, the PrestaShops of this world, and you\u2019ve seen the press even from other providers in e-commerce world.","So, in specific markets, you\u2019ve got certain ISVs, cart providers, as well as the software providers. You are also taking your regional partners with you. So being able to go to market and manage the direct sales, as I described earlier, in a specific region, the face-to-face marry to the technology, as well as local channel partners, local software providers and with that an overlay of the regional folks and in many cases the global software providers. It\u2019s a little tricky and it comes down again to market segmentation and how you compensate and drive the direct sales force to certain behaviors you want to target the segments, make sure they don\u2019t trip over each other, and make sure that you can drive joint sales. That\u2019s all a bit in its infancy in global, we\u2019re really-really pleased with the thesis, so pleased that we went ahead and deployed $50 million of more capital in Australia to continue executing the same strategy where we can take this bundle with Ezidebit and eWAY to market and driving a deeper penetration, what\u2019s already the leading provider of small to medium size retail e-commerce in Australia.","So, long winded answer, I realize, but it\u2019s actually been a great deal of learning, a great deal of really excellent execution by our teams in Ireland and in the UK, and now about to be in Spain, this led us to feel really good about the execution levels we are seeing relative to something we spent a lot time describing at the Investor Day in October, omnichannel, global capabilities that we think we are uniquely positioned to sell.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Kevin McVeigh","Cameron, can you give us a sense of -- there has been obviously so much FX pressure. Do you feel like we are starting to anniversary that and maybe you think about say any kind of relief as we think about \u201816 into \u201817, and just any particular thoughts on the noise coming out of the UK as well around the potential exits, just as it relates to currency as well?","Cameron Bready","It\u2019s a great question, Kevin. I would say we\u2019re still seeing some weakness in certain markets, particularly in the pound. And today is another example, I would point to today not only is the U.S. dollar sort of secularly strong, the volatility in some of these major currencies is down, see even pound moving 1.5 or 2 points intraday, for example, obviously makes it very difficult to forecast FX with any sort of certainty as we think and look forward. I think we are as we get into fiscal \u201817, particularly as we get into the back half of fiscal \u201817, hopefully going to be in an environment where we are starting to anniversary some of the stronger headwinds. But, I certainly don\u2019t think that we are approaching any time soon an environment where the U.S. dollar is going to weaken relative to most of the major currencies around the world to which we have exposure. I think we are in a sort of secular bull market for the U.S. dollar, I expect that to continue for some time, there\u2019s just not a lot out there that would cause me to believe that dollar is going to weaken.","But as we continue to anniversary some of these bigger moves, for example, we anniversary the strong euro move in Q3 of this year, unfortunately that was more than offset by an equally strong move downward in the pound, at relatively the same time. So, where we have a good exposure to a fair number of currencies to Jeff\u2019s already point, part of the benefit of the Heartland transactions is it does de-risk currency exposure to the Company, on a macro basis, will be two-thirds U.S. dollar denominated business going forward and that obviously will diminish some of the FX exposure that we have globally. But, I am hopeful to get into an environment where in \u201817 where we\u2019re seeing most of the strong headwinds begin to diminish to some degree.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","I wanted to just ask a question regarding plans for the Heartland sales force, if we just think about retention, integration, et cetera, any latest thinking there?","David Mangum","Jason, it\u2019s David. I think the thinking is very similar to what we described to you in December, that\u2019s in a large part of why we\u2019re so attracted to the Heartland acquisition that sales force, it\u2019s trajectory, it\u2019s been remarkable at couple of years. The deeper we\u2019ve gone into our homework on integration, the happier we are with what we found. So, our plans are really very similar to what they were in December. We don\u2019t want to screw this up. So, we\u2019re going to keep the performance plan consistent, we\u2019re going to keep the bills of right with which you are familiar and keep using those to drive organic growth. As the management matter, we\u2019re very impressed with the team; we spend a lot more time with them. So, I think not a lot of changes at all, as you might imagine going forward. And their trajectory right now is really impressive. So, it\u2019s more a matter of making sure we can figure out how to accelerate that with more product, maybe a different way to think about, enhancing the traditional distribution with again additional product out of Heartland commerce and the other business units, that are already in place there, so really pleased with the thesis, really pleased with the sales force and trajectory, no plans to change anything we described you in December.","Cameron Bready","The only thing I\u2019d add Jason, it\u2019s Cameron, when you think about our entire approach to integration, it\u2019s really behind the sales force, behind the customer, such that the objective is to not disrupt anything that\u2019s happing from a sales and sales momentum point of view, nor to create conflict at the customer level that\u2019s going to distract the sales, professionals from continuing to grow and expand the business. Our objective is to accelerate growth through that channel as we\u2019ve been able to do with many of the previous acquisitions we\u2019ve done. And the integration that we\u2019re going to do will be behind the scenes, so that it won\u2019t impact the momentum that we\u2019re expecting to be able to achieve from an organic sales point of view.","Jason Kupferberg","That\u2019s helpful. And just to switch gears a little bit to the OpenEdge business, at our payments conference yesterday, there was a lot of positive commentary just about the amount of runway that remains for this channel. So, I just wanted to get an understanding from Global\u2019s perspective as far as which verticals you\u2019re most excited about, in terms of remaining runway, any updates on the size or growth of the dealer and developer network there?","David Mangum","I\u2019ll start and let these guys chime in if anything I miss. So, we continue to be very pleased with OpenEdge, it still grows in the mid to high teens, the revenue production is really, really impressive that\u2019s all at increasing margins that are higher than the company\u2019s margin, so back to several of the other questions earlier today. In terms of existing verticals, we remain very, very low penetrated. That\u2019s not perfect grammar. But really, I don\u2019t think we have a vertical that\u2019s more than 20% penetrated anywhere in any of our key verticals. So, you think of vets and dentists; we talk about those a lot, pharma, we think about parking garages, all those very low levels. And we\u2019ve got at sales force that\u2019s focused on driving deeper penetration into those verticals. At the same time though, we\u2019re looking for the places to grow. So, we mentioned, the Heartland, discussed it before, where we don\u2019t have an education vertical in OpenEdge, we don\u2019t do restaurant and hospitality, the opportunity to drive deeper penetration in those verticals by OpenEdge that complements the direct sales force about what\u2019s your actually first question, it\u2019s there, it\u2019s real, we continue to work on that in integration planning.","The other couple of things we have is we literally entered a new vertical in the United States that we weren\u2019t in before just in the last couple of weeks. We entered the unattended payment vertical United States with a brand new partner, large ISV who plays in that space, you\u2019re talking about car washers, more parking, vending things like that, that\u2019s new and unique for OpenEdge. So, a brand new vertical, effectively with 0% penetration in that vertical as we sit here today but we know how to manage the ecosystem partners, merchants, leads and marketing to drive that and then maybe happy with news of all in terms of how we think about growing that OpenEdge beyond just the United States. The global opportunity is real. We\u2019re really pleased to announce we actually have opened up OpenEdge and launched it in the UK this quarter. So, we have a staff there, dedicated sales folks, dedicated product folks.","Remember back to October in the Investor Day, one of our key pillars of accelerating global growth was the global expansion of integrated payments, OpenEdge driving the Canada, driving the United Kingdom. So, we have now launched our business in the UK, we can bring that dedicated and product in ecosystem to the United Kingdom to work with ISVs to drive the benefits of technology integration that don\u2019t exist in the UK, as they exist in the U.S. today. And still we can drive existing partners into the United Kingdom. So, U.S. based ISVs and software providers provide near-term sales opportunities. In fact, we\u2019re going to bring a few customers live in the UK in just next few months, coming from U.S. based ISVs where we\u2019re extending their franchise, extending the integrated payments benefit out to UK for them. So, more to come on this, but really OpenEdge is poised for more global growth but still continued excellent execution in the United States as we go forward.","Andrew Langford","On behalf of Global Payments, thank you very much for joining us this morning and for your continuing interest in Global.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Later, we will open the lines for questions and answers. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.","Isabel Janci - Global Payments, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Global third quarter 2017 conference call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-KT and any subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update them.","Some of the comments made on this call refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net revenue and adjusted earnings per share, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our trended financial highlights, both of which are available in the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Isabel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I am delighted with our third quarter results. The continued extension of our payments technology strategy and relentless focus on execution enabled us to produce yet another quarter of double-digit organic net revenue growth. Our strong performance also allowed us to expand adjusted operating margin by 110 basis points and grow adjusted earnings per share 29%, one of the highest rates we have reported to-date.","The hard work of our 2,500-person sales organization worldwide and the pace of our global cross-selling efforts provide significant momentum for sustained growth and share gains. Never in our history have we had more capacity to sell and more distinctive solutions to deliver to customers around the world. We could not be more proud of the outstanding performance of our colleagues. And we are not done yet. On September 1, we closed the acquisition of ACTIVE Network, a cloud-based, mission-critical enterprise software and payment solutions company targeting event organizers in two vertical markets.","We are off to a fine start with our partnership with our combined business having already realized an early significant win in Europe. We've also had an early win from our strategic partnership with Vista Equity Partners. More to come in a few minutes on those achievements.","As we have described over the last couple of years, there are two fundamental drivers of share gains for our business: expansion of our integrated and vertical markets; and our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions. Each of these businesses grew organically at double-digit rates in the third quarter and, together, now account for roughly 40% (04:06) of our total worldwide net revenue.","We continue to further differentiate our company as the leading provider of payment technologies worldwide through these strategies. Our integrated and vertical markets business provides customers with specific payment technology solutions that are relevant to their verticals. We are unique in this channel in that we both partner with software providers in certain vertical markets and also own the entire software value stack in others.","In addition, our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions leverage our market-leading worldwide footprint in both the physical and virtual worlds. We are unique in this channel in the scope and breadth of our omnichannel coverage. As we continue to advance our technology-enabled software-driven strategy, we have made substantial progress on cross-selling these solutions as well as our other products and services around the world. Our single, unified operating and technology environment enables these initiatives by allowing us to quickly and seamlessly deploy solutions in and across our markets.","I want to highlight some of our cross-selling accomplishments around the globe as well as ongoing initiatives in this area that will drive future opportunities in 2018 and beyond, which we believe further differentiate us from our competitors. First, I am particularly pleased to report that in every region in which we operate worldwide, we have now successfully closed referrals from our Heartland sales channel. Many of these referrals resulted in new omnichannel customers.","In addition, during the quarter, a number of multinational retailers extended their omnichannel relationship with us into additional markets. And just last month, we closed ASO as a new ACTIVE Network customer. ASO manages the Tour de France and Paris Marathon as well as other events. ACTIVE's market-leading software coupled with our payments expertise and worldwide omnichannel offerings, resulted in signing this new marquee customer.","We also recently announced the international expansion of TouchNet into Canada, the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Brazil. Like ACTIVE, TouchNet is a sophisticated and comprehensive software solution, providing a full suite of business management and payment technology capabilities to colleges and universities. We now have specialized salespeople on the ground selling these integrated solutions to universities in these regions.","Earlier this year, we introduced Xenial, a SaaS-based offering for the restaurant and hospitality industry, building on the capabilities of our Heartland Commerce business. This product is the first of its kind, and we are very encouraged by the feedback we have received from our U.S. customers. We look forward to deploying this solution in international markets in the coming months.","And a few weeks ago, we launched Heartland Analytics, which provides small business owners with comparative key metrics such as sales trends, customer visits, new versus repeat customer business and changes in average ticket size. We are already selling this solution in the United States and expect to rollout this and other advanced analytic capabilities in other regions around the world throughout 2018.","In addition to these successes, I am also delighted to announce that we have secured our first integrated partner through our strategic relationship with Vista Equity Partners. Just last week, we were selected as the payments technology partner for DealerSocket, a Vista portfolio company. DealerSocket is a technology solutions provider for the automotive vertical that simplifies processes and workflow. Our ability to seamlessly integrate comprehensive payment solutions through their platform extends and enhances their already robust offering.","As we continue to evolve our strategy, we intend to further leverage our assets and investments to wrap more value around payment transactions. Software data and analytics are just a few examples of value-added services that we provide our customers globally, and with the addition of ACTIVE Network, we have more robust data and analytics capabilities that we intend to utilize to continue enhancing our offerings globally.","Before I turn the call over to Cameron, I'm delighted to announce that Global Payments was recently selected by Forbes as one of the global Growth Champions, which identifies the top 250 fastest growing companies worldwide and as one of the world's Top 100 Most Innovative Companies. We are particularly pleased with these distinctions given our focus on creating and delivering innovative solutions for our customers globally. Cameron?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. The strength and consistency of our execution worldwide is evident in our third quarter results. We are very pleased with our performance as we once again exceeded our expectations for the business. Consolidated net revenues for the third quarter were $930 million, a 12% increase compared to 2016, driven primarily by low double-digit organic growth. Our strong net revenue growth and continued synergy realization contributed to operating margin expansion of 110 basis points to 31.3%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 29% in the quarter to $1.15.","North American net revenue was $686 million, reflecting growth of 11%. ACTIVE Network, which closed on September 1, contributed approximately $14 million of net revenue or 2 percentage points to growth in the quarter. Excluding ACTIVE Network, organic growth in North America was high single-digits; more specifically, 9%. In the U.S., our direct distribution business again delivered low double-digit organic growth, while our wholesale business saw mid-single-digit declines in the quarter.","Canada performed very well again, contributing mid-single-digit growth in local currency with favorable Canadian foreign-currency trend adding modestly to results. Operating margin in North America expanded 120 basis points to 31.6%. Margin expansion was driven by strong organic net revenue performance across our U.S. direct channels, in particular our higher margin technology-enabled businesses and the realization of expense synergies from Heartland, partially offset by ACTIVE Network due to the seasonality of the business.","We again saw extremely strong performance in Europe with adjusted net revenues growing 17% organically in the third quarter or approximately 13% on a constant currency basis. The UK and Spain grew double digits in local currency driven by resilient underlying economies and the continuation of what has been a robust tourism season. In addition, we continued to see share gains in both of these markets. Likewise, our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions business grew well into the double digits as we further our pan-European strategy. As expected, now that most of the Erste JV integration efforts are behind us, European operating margins were flat at 47.3% for the quarter.","Our Asia-Pacific business continued its strong performance this quarter, reporting net revenue growth of 15%. We saw solid trends across our key markets in Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and China. And Ezidebit once again contributed in excess of 20% organic growth in the quarter, exceeding our own lofty expectations for this business. Operating margins in Asia expanded 330 basis points as a result of strong net revenue performance, which allows us to continue to realize the benefits of improved scale across the region.","Excluding integration costs, we generated free cash flow of approximately $236 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million for the quarter.","As a result of the ACTIVE Network acquisition, we issued 6.4 million shares of common stock in September, which increased our diluted weighted average share count by approximately 2.1 million shares for the quarter. Further, we funded the cash portion of the consideration for the transaction primarily through borrowings on our revolving credit facility, which modestly increased our gross leverage to approximately 4.1 times at the end of the third quarter.","As a result of our strong performance for the third quarter, as well as the closing of the ACTIVE Network transaction, we are again updating our 2017 guidance. We now expect net revenue to range from $3.505 billion to $3.53 billion, reflecting growth of 23% to 24% over 2016. This includes an expected contribution from ACTIVE Network of approximately $40 million to $45 million for the fourth quarter.","We continue to expect operating margin to expand by up to 120 basis points. It is worth noting that, due to the seasonality of the ACTIVE Network business, we are forecasting this transaction to reduce the margin expansion we otherwise would have expected to achieve in North America in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, our overall target for margin expansion in 2017 remains the same.","We now expect adjusted earnings per share to range from $3.94 to $4.02, reflecting growth of 24% to 26% over 2016. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect ACTIVE Network's contribution to be immaterial to 2017 adjusted earnings per share. Lastly, we now expect our effective tax rate to approach 27% for the year. In light of the share issuance associated with the ACTIVE Network acquisition, we also now expect total weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year to be 160 million (14:56) and 156 million, respectively.","We could not be more pleased with our performance in the third quarter and year-to-date periods. As we close out 2017, we're delighted to be in a position to exceed our overall objectives for the year. Likewise, as we begin to look forward to 2018, we remain excited about the momentum in the business as we advance our technology-enabled, software-driven strategy worldwide.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would ask you to save the date for our upcoming investor conference, which we are planning to host here in Atlanta on March 1, 2018. We hope to see all of you there. Jeff?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Cameron. The strong momentum across our business continued in the third quarter, as it has all year. Our laser focus on our payments technology strategy, and our emphasis on operational excellence, have enabled us to deliver one of our strongest top and bottom-line results to-date. We have also laid a solid foundation for future growth, with substantial progress for achieving the revenue enhancements in 2018 and beyond that we described at the time of our Heartland merger. While delivering exceptional performance today, we could not be more excited about where we can take Global Payments in the future.","Isabel?","Isabel Janci - Global Payments, Inc.","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one, with one follow-up, in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you.","Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. And our first question will come from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please proceed.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Another great quarter. Congrats.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. So, first of all, just I guess on North America, growth remains really strong. Is it fair to say that your mix continues to get better, the good businesses keep getting bigger? And now with ACTIVE coming on as well, I would imagine that's even maybe faster growth than average. Like, is this sustainably going to get kind of back to 10% growth kind of in the future, as the good parts keep getting bigger?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, Dave. It's Cameron. Maybe I'll start and I'll ask Jeff to chime in with anything he wants to add. So, first, I would say we're managing our North American business to organic growth in the high-single digits. Your point is right in that, our Wholesale business continues to shrink as a percentage of our North America business. And as a result of that, obviously, our faster-growing direct channels continue to drive growth in our overall North American business. And I don't want to leave Canada out; it's actually performed a little better than we would have anticipated this year as well, which has been a nice tailwind to North American growth.","Going forward, I would say, we remain targeted at that high-single-digit level. Our integrated and vertical markets are the tip of the spear for growth. In North America, they're growing in the double digits. ACTIVE will be consistent with that, as we look to 2018 and beyond, so it will be additive to the overall rate of growth. Our wholesale business, again, we target towards flat to down slightly. It was a little more than that this quarter, as we commented on in the script. And in our normal direct channel, non-integrated, non-vertical market, we targeted high-single digits as well.","So, again, you roll all that together with Canada, it was single digit in local currency, we continue to get back to that high-single-digit rate of organic growth that we're targeting for North America, and feel confident in our ability to achieve that going forward in time. Clearly, as we continue to mix shift towards more integrated and vertical markets businesses, obviously, that's going to help the overall rate of growth in North America, and it bolsters our confidence to be able to sustain that high-single-digit rate over a longer period of time.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Dave, I would just add on to what Cameron said that, as it relates to our M&A strategy, since you asked about ACTIVE, clearly, when we look at transactions and new partnerships, we certainly think about deals that we like to position as accretive to our rates of organic revenue growth. Of course, our integrated and vertical markets business, our e-com and omni business, are all in the double digits, as Cameron was describing a few minutes go. ACTIVE, I think, really fits squarely in that thesis. So certainly, if you play that over time, we're looking to partner and add businesses that help accelerate our rates of growth. So I think you're right in the mix shift over time, but of course, time will tell how quickly that happens.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for that. And then I guess my one follow-up, Europe has stayed incredibly strong, especially the UK. I know a year ago, there was a little worry about Brexit. It actually turned into a tailwind for a while. I'm wondering, are you seeing the UK continuing to just be that strong, do you think, into the future as well? Or does Brexit start to have a little bit of an impact?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, Dave. It's Jeff. I'll start and I'll ask Cameron to add some color. So, I think we're as pleased with our businesses across Europe, really, as you are, and I think our prepared remarks really reflect that. I would say that the one thing we probably underestimated sitting here today throughout the last year-and-a-half or so is really our ability to capture share in that market, particularly in the UK and particularly in Spain.","I think if you look at our performance in those markets and you look at what those markets are growing at, you look at our public peers in those markets and what they have reported for their rates of growth in those markets, this is growing six to seven times the rate of growth, particularly in the United Kingdom that one of our competitors is growing. And of course in Spain, it's really the tale of six-and-a-half years of gaining share in the market.","So stepping back for a second, Dave, the first thing I'd say is we get paid to worry. So of course, you worry about things like Brexit. That's what we do every day. But I would say if there's one thing that makes us feel comfortable about where we are is that we consistently underestimated our ability of our colleagues to capture share in the European markets, particularly in the UK and particularly in Spain. That does make us feel a little bit better about where that business is heading as a trajectory matter (21:04). That doesn't mean we change our fundamental assumptions about what that market does long-term, but certainly, it gives us confidence, Dave, that we should be able to continue to capture share going forward.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","And, Dave, it's Cameron. The only thing I would add to that as well is our e-com and omni business in Europe has been particularly strong. Our strategy there to combine our e-com capabilities with our physical brick-and-mortar presence in certain markets around Europe, I think, has been a very effective growth engine in Europe and been a nice tailwind to overall growth, on top of the very strong performance we've seen in the domestic markets in which we operate.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you, great. Well, thanks, guys. Good job.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please proceed.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just following up on Dave's \u2013 on Europe, the 13% constant currency revenue growth in Europe, was that all organic?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, Bob, it's Cameron, yeah. That's all organic. We anniversaried the Erste JV on June 1, so Q3 was entirely organic. If you compare Q3 at roughly 13% constant currency, that's basically in line with the normalized rate of growth for Q2, which was around 13% or 14% on a constant currency basis. So...","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Do you think...","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","...two very consistent quarters of strong growth in Europe, which is really a function of what Jeff and I just described.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Do you expect Europe to maintain double-digit organic as that e-commerce grows? And what are the key drivers to you gaining market share there?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. So maybe I will touch on the first point. I'll let Jeff and David comment on the second. I would say our outlook for Europe remains high single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. That is we think a very reasonable expectation given the mix of businesses that we have in market. And we think going forward, we're well-positioned to be able to achieve that. Some of the things we benefited from obviously over the last several quarters in particular, we had a very strong tourism season. Obviously, the weakness in the British pound, the side benefit of that has been obviously more towards going to the UK and more people in the UK, staying in the UK and spending in the UK. So, we've seen better trends in the UK than we would have anticipated.","We're not managing that business to sustain double-digit organic growth; that's not our target for that business. But obviously, we're delighted with the performance we've been able to achieve and have good momentum kind of going into the last quarter of the year and as we look forward to 2018, which gives us confidence in our overall target for the business.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","And, Bob, this is David. Maybe some of those strategies and tactics to chase the numbers Cameron's describing. Recall in the prepared remarks, we talked about the roll out of Realex e-commerce technology across Europe. That's a big piece of the outsized growth and the share gains Jeff described in the UK. We're now successfully selling that in Spain. You can expect more and more of that to come. We've had wildly successful omni-channel sales across Europe at the same time on a relative basis. So, we're very happy with the way the solution is coming together to manage our direct sales investment.","Pause on that for a second. We're investing in more direct sales capabilities in Europe as well because we see more and more solutions come to market. Jeff also talked about cross-sales in his prepared remarks so we're increasingly selling our university sales, our university software solutions out of TouchNet, out of our Campus Solutions in the States, so more capability to sell more technology-enhanced solutions.","So, we're thinking about that as well as Jeff talked about the Xenial software platform, which includes analytics and email marketing capabilities as well as restaurant software and eventually retail and hospitality software. Those solutions all rollout over the course of 2018 in Europe as well, so more and more product to map to more and more direct sales capabilities. It's really a great recipe for us to sustain the numbers Cameron has described and hopefully beat them over time.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask about North America, a 9% organic growth seemed solid, but I think you said the mid-single decline in wholesale was a little lower than typical expectations. Maybe you can describe what's going on in that market and then what's the outlook going forward.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes. Bryan, it's Cameron. I'll touch on that a little bit. I'll maybe just start by reminding you, as a strategy matter, we've been pivoting away from our wholesale channel going on four years now. We've invested probably north of $6 billion to move to more of a direct distribution business here in the U.S. and obviously I think that strategy sort of speaks for itself in terms of how it's played out over the last few years.","We're managing that business, obviously, to continue to see it be a smaller part of our North American business over the course of time. So it's not surprising to us that that business may be down from quarter-to-quarter, and year-over-year as we are managing it to achieve that outcome.","I would say into your point, the mid-single digit was slightly a faster rate of decline than we would've anticipated in the quarter. We were actually forecasting kind of a low-single digit rate of decline. I think the variables that took it to being more of a mid-single digit decline is just general weakness in the portfolio relative to what we would have anticipated. Some of that is attributable we think to the hurricane impacts across that portfolio and some of the concentration that may exist in those two jurisdictions, Texas and Florida in particular that were most impacted.","We think that's probably the biggest driver. One of the other variables which was in our forecast as well, of course, is we have one less processing day in Q3 2017 versus 2016. So that obviously out of the gate, it's going to cost you a point.","And lastly, I would simply say we had one other direct ISO customer that moved to an indirect relationship with us as still an ISO customer but as an indirect matter. And as part of that, they are not taking the same level of service that they were from us historically. So those factors really drove it to the level that I described in my prepared remarks. But again, as we look at the business overall, the fact that our wholesale business is declining, we're still producing the rate of growths that we're able to achieve I think speaks to the strength of our direct channel. And then long-term point of view is good for our business.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. And then international margins, we're still seeing significant margin expansion in Asia, European margins are now back to flat. Just thinking about what that outlook is going forward. Should we see more of the same or do we finally anniversary the big growth we've seen in Asia that the comps get a little bit more difficult as we go forward. Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Bryan. So I'll talk about Europe in particular. Our target with margins already in the high 40% range is to sustain those margins. Obviously, we're not managing Europe with an eye towards significant margin expansion, and we don't think it's going to be a meaningful driver of margin expansion for the total company overall.","So our objective there remains kind of achieving flat to maybe slight up margins in Europe, but we think that's a reasonable expectation just given the overall level of margins in that region. As we think about Asia, you're right in that we will begin to lap some of the more significant margin expansion we've been able to achieve over the course of the last probably four to six quarters.","Some of that simply is coming from improved scale. I think when I joined the company back in 2014, Asia was probably $150 million, $160 million business, and this year it's on track to be well north of a $250 million business. So we've added a significant amount of revenue to that business, which has allowed us to improve scale across the region, which has certainly been a nice tailwind to margins.","Naturally as those margins creep up over the course of time, we will be reinvesting in that business to continue to drive and achieve our targeted rate of growth, which is low double-digit for Asia. So I do expect to continue to expand margins in Asia over the course of time, maybe not to the same magnitude that we've been able to achieve over the course of the last four to six quarters.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Cantwell with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Morning, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk about your overall firm-wide margin outlook. It seems like you've consistently talked about operating margins getting back to that 35%-ish level. I just want to make sure I understand that given what we've seen this year. You've been adding more tech-enabled revenue. Seems like wholesale revenue is declining. You've been adding Canada, Erste Group, other areas I think are higher margin. So do you think that 35% is the jumping off point for firm-wide operating margins? Or perhaps there might be more to go beyond that as we think longer term? Thanks.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","So, Jeff, it's Cameron. I'll start and maybe ask Jeff to chime in as well. I think the mid-30% margin target in the medium term is a good target for the business. I think as we look around the globe and the aggregate of the businesses that we're managing, we can continue to grow margins at our overall cycle guidance, which is up to 75 basis points. Over the medium term, we think getting to the mid-30%s is a right objective for our business.","I think given the mix of businesses we have, as we continue to drive margins up towards that level and maybe slightly higher, the level of reinvestment to continue to drive the rates of growth we want to achieve in the business will likely increase.","And we're also, I would note, if you look at 2017 in particular, given the strong margin performance we've seen throughout the year, we are investing more in the business. We've increased our CapEx guidance a couple times this year already. It's now at $180 million originally versus a $160 million target at the start of the year.","So we are taking the opportunity as we are outperforming our own expectations to reinvest in the business to help sustain better rates of growth over longer periods of time. And I think that will continue to be our plan as we move forward in time. But I still think over the medium term that mid-30% target is achievable and the right one for the business.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes, Jeff. It's Jeff. I would just add to that, as a business man if you (30:56) step back for a second, what we really wanted to accomplish heading into 2018, I think I mentioned this earlier in one of our calls this year is to really achieve scale in our business.","Now I think we have scale as an operating matter, but scale in the underlying infrastructure of our business as we head into calendar 2018 and beyond, we feel we've built enough scale in what we do that the investments are really incremental. Part of that you're seeing in the $180 million that Cameron just described relative to the $160 million.","So here we are producing these results: 33% earnings growth, 24% now, 29% reported, yet we're investing consistently in future growth rather than attracting capital from the business and limiting our rates of growth.","So what do I mean by that? Investing in existing and additional infrastructure, cloud-based infrastructure, so the cloud-first strategy that we've had for the last year-and-a-half at the company, investing in additional HR ops and support, additional finance ops and support to make sure that we're ready to go do the next investment, whether that's a partnership or a new market or a new product that we want to launch, a new market we want to enter.","We wanted to make sure that exiting 2017 that we had the taken advantage of the opportunity presented by Heartland and really now by ACTIVE to get the business at the right level of what I'll call support scale, distinct from processing scale or anything else. And I think we've largely \u2013 2017 is not done, right, but I think we've largely achieved that. I think some of that explains some of the $180 million that Cameron was alluding to in terms of CapEx relative to $160 million.","So if you peel that back to what does that mean for margin, I think Cameron is exactly right. I think in the next number of years with the guidance that we've given in terms of our model, we should be right there, but I also think it's important to understand that even without a mix shift, we feel like we've made the investments we need to make to sustain growth over the coming years.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Appreciate that. And then on Canada, can you talk a little more about what's driving the growth there? I think I heard you say that growth is accelerating. That's something you've spoken about the past couple quarters as an emerging strategic initiative. So just curious as far as how much that contributed to revenue growth this quarter. And maybe you could just update us about a reasonable set of expectations as we start to think about 2018. Thanks very much.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes, sure. Jeff, it's David. I'll start and then pass it over to Cameron, particularly around the outlook for 2018. I can tell you, Canada is just quite simply having a fantastic year for us. It's really that simple. Our colleagues there are doing a great job. They're executing very well on the sales strategies we described at the beginning of the year.","You're quite correct that there's an analogy to Europe as we described earlier in that we are now selling more tech-enabled products and more tech-enabled solutions in Canada than ever before. We do have OpenEdge live in Canada, the ability to sell integrated payments. We have, as you'll recall, sold TouchNet software in Canada. We're increasingly selling our point-of-sale software solutions through dealers and have added several dealers in just the last two quarters to be able to sell more of that in 2018.","At the same time, we've really benefited really from some very nice macro trends as well in Canada. Although GDP is still not a mover, we've had very nice credit growth, solid underlying credit growth, which I think speaks to the quality portfolio we have there. As consumers spend a little bit more in the portfolio, we've got great retail presence, great healthcare presence, great restaurant presence, across a national portfolio. So we benefit really almost immediately when things look a little bit better in Canada, in terms of just core consumer spending.","So, all in, really a great situation for Canada, great execution by the team there in 2017. No reason to think we won't continue to execute in 2018, but for that I'll pause and turn to Cameron in terms of how those expectations play out.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes, Jeff, it's Cameron. I'll just add, we're obviously delighted with the performance we've seen in Canada over the course of the last year, to David's point. The performance in mid-single-digit local currency growth is obviously above our expectation for that business, as David highlighted. Some of that, I think, is our ability to sell different solutions, differentiated product, on the margin; some of it is an economic environment that is probably one of the better ones we've seen in Canada over the course of the last several years. I think Q2 GDP growth was in the 3.75% range, which is very high for that market, and that's been a nice tailwind for our business, because our growth always starts with, what's the underlying rate of GDP growth in the individual market in which we're operating.","I'd say, as we look out for that business, our target remains low single-digit in local currency. Obviously, as it relates to all of our targets, our expectation and hope is that we can exceed those. But I think a very realistic target for that business over the course of time remains low-single digit in local currency, and that's appropriate, just given, in particular, the history in that market. I think it's a little premature to suggest that fundamental growth rates in Canada are going to be different over the medium-term.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. I appreciate that. Thanks very much.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys. Congratulations, good quarter. I wanted to ask about the pipeline from Vista, what it looks like, and sort of a two-phased question. One is, obviously, you've got to go sign deals like DealerSocket, but then you also, I think, have to work with a company like DealerSocket to get to their customers as well. And, can you sort of help us figure out how that two-phase arrangement sort of works like, especially with a name like DealerSocket, which I believe does have an agreement at co-pay. So, is this a coexist situation? Is there exclusivity? Details like that.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, Ashwin. It's Cameron. Maybe I'll start and I'll try to frame up how we go about the process with Vista, and then I'll turn it over to David to get into more specifics as to how our interactions with a particular software partner really work, and how we get to market with that customer. So as a Vista portfolio matter, you're absolutely correct in that we're working hand-in-hand with Vista to identify the portfolio companies that they own today that, number one, would make good payment technology partners for us, and two that, frankly, need our solution and would benefit from our solutions. Once we identify that pipeline of opportunity, then I think there's something like 45, I think, portfolio companies in the Vista group today. We do then go work with the individual company to structure a bespoke arrangement with that particular entity that's going to meet their needs; it's also going to work for us as a commercial matter.","As you would appreciate, Vista is not a long-term owner of assets, so we can have the best relationship in the world with Vista, but we really want to have the relationship at the individual portfolio company, because we want that relationship to sustain whatever life expectancy they may have as a Vista tate (37:50). So that's the objective through this process. It does take time. We could not be more pleased that we already have one signed, which I think, frankly, even relative to our own expectations, is greater than we would have anticipated. And we have a nice pipeline of opportunities building, and a good discussion ongoing with a number of other portfolio companies, that we're going to work to continue to drive forward from there.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Ashwin. David. A little more color, then. So, if you think about the process of them bringing someone live or even closing the deal, I'll start with something I said last quarter which is, there's nothing better than a warm lead when you're trying to go in for a sale. So in the case of DealerSocket, we were actually already in the sale process with them. It wildly accelerated via the business relationship that Cameron described a moment ago, to the end result of us being able to actually close it in just a matter of weeks post our transaction with ACTIVE, which is just fantastic, hopefully a sign of the ability to move more quickly through those pipelines as we go forward. Of the 45 or so portfolio companies Cameron described, a handful are already in our pipeline and were before, so hopefully again, we expect to see, or hope to see, accelerated sales processes there.","To speak directly about how we bring a customer live, let's actually use DealerSocket maybe as an example. So what DealerSocket really does, they provide a really sort of Middleware engine, CRM solution, for the automotive vertical. So it simplifies sales and marketing. They tend to target independent dealers. There are also franchises as well. But you're talking about maybe 2,000 or so mostly independent dealers, so a huge opportunity. It's part of why we're so excited about it is, 2,000 dealers. This is why actually we (39:26) made the call \u2013 not just the sale, but this is a material potential partner for us.","To get them live, as you might think about, this is a CRM solution, we have to deeply integrate our payments technology into a CRM solution, add some of our marketing technology as well, and make sure that as a salesperson is working that independent dealer, they can see that on their sales force automation system, they can run marketing campaigns, they can run pricing deals at the end of a month. It's a pretty deep technical integration to create the seamless experience that we talk about the drives, the outsize growth you get from our integrated payments businesses. That'll take 90 days to as much as six months in order to create the full integration. Part of why it's so valuable is, you don't just do this in nine days with a semi-integrated solution. It's a big deal.","So we're going to pile up a number of these DealerSockets over time as our sales force does anyway. These, though, we can almost think of as a little bit of extras, right? We weren't expecting to close three or four Vista companies in the next six months. Now that's what our pipeline says. We'll see whether we do it. As Cameron correctly said, we have to earn that business and then earn it again every day, but we're really happy to have this series of warm leads and our sales folks are pretty charged up, because that portfolio of businesses looks like real opportunity for us over time.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sounds good. And then Heartland pricing, that's a question you get all the time. You talked about value-added pricing on a case-by-case basis almost, but are you sort of at a point where you're beginning to roll out pricing? And when I say pricing, I do mean in all its forms, you have pricing fees, things like that. Are you beginning to do that? Can you speak about that?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question, Ashwin. So let me start by saying we are not doing broad-based pricing initiatives across the Heartland portfolio or any of our portfolios. We continue to look to where we can match value we create to economic value. We continue to believe we provide quite simply the best infrastructure and service infrastructure available to our customers. We think we should be paid for that.","So we continue to be surgical with ideas like where we are providing higher-quality services. Should we adjust the economics there? Yes, quite possibly. So if you think that we sell higher-value service, we are working hard to train our sales reps to sell the initial deal at a higher price, which relieves you of the burden of coming along later, obviously, needing to bring that back to market. That's had great success. We can literally show in our CRM systems if someone's closing a deal that the rep next to them closed that deal at a higher price point the week before. So things like that are working well.","We have tweaked the way we approach terminal pricing as an example. We have new solutions that we've rolled out for compliance, but know that the simple answer is we are not doing broad-based pricing across the portfolio. We continue to try and surgically match value where we create value.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's great. Really appreciate that clarity. Thank you very much.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Good quarter.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the North America growth, and more thinking about by distribution channel, I realize sort of the faster-growing channels were in the low double-digits in aggregate. But maybe if you could parse a little bit I think sort of the relative growth rates of integrated, traditional direct, thinking e-com. The description you gave of the mid single-digit decline was helpful on wholesale, but just a little bit more on the overall growth parameters you're seeing across the distribution channels in North America.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Sure, Glenn. It's Cameron. I'd be happy to do that. So let me just start again with the integrated and vertical markets business. That grew in the low double-digits in aggregate in the second quarter led by OpenEdge. But our other vertical markets businesses also grew in that same sort of low double-digit range. So that business, again, consistent performance I think Q2 to Q3. And, frankly, throughout calendar 2017, we've seen double-digit growth in that business, and we're frankly very pleased with the overall performance we're seeing out of that portfolio of companies. As I said earlier, that's the tip of the spear for our growth in North America and will continue to be going forward.","Our traditional direct sales distribution channel, our Heartland direct sales distribution channel grew high single-digits in the quarter. That business, again, at the high end of our expectations for that particular channel, we think that channel can be a consistent high single-digit grower for us going forward and that's what it produced again this quarter right at around 9%, so right at the overall sort of average for North America.","Now that is down a little bit relative to what we saw in Q1 and Q2 of this year. A couple of things really driving that. To be candid, Glenn, one would be obviously there was a bit of hurricane impact in that business in the third quarter. We had a combination of obviously merchants in those markets that were not transacting with us during those periods of time. We had sales professionals who weren't contributing new in period revenue in those jurisdictions during that period of time.","And I'd say perhaps probably more importantly, we're now starting to lap the material improvement in attrition that we were able to achieve starting really last summer. So as you'll recall, we have been able to take attrition in that portfolio down from probably 12% to 13% historically down to 10% or 11%. That's probably not going to go to 8%. So as we begin to lap those significant downward trends in attrition, obviously that's going to be a tougher grow over for that business.","So for that business to continue to achieve high single-digit rates of growth this period I think was a terrific outcome for them. So that's really our direct business in the U.S. market in Q3. If you roll those two channels together, collectively they were low double-digit.","Wholesale I already talked about, kind of down mid single-digit. Canada we talked about as well. It grew mid single-digit in the quarter. We had a little bit of a tailwind from the Canadian dollar that added probably 0.5%, roughly 50 bps to North American growth in the quarter. I would say that was probably more than offset by hurricane headwinds that we faced in a number of different channels including the Heartland direct channel, but also in our schools and campus businesses as well.","I think those businesses were actually probably disproportionately impacted by the hurricane. We have a number of school districts in both Florida and Texas. Those are two of our larger markets for school districts as well as campuses at the university level, and unfortunately those storms hit right at back-to-school season which is our seasonally highest seasons for those two businesses. So they were somewhat impacted by the hurricanes as well, but I would say as management our job is to grow through those things, and I think we did that very effectively in the third quarter.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then my follow up is for Jeff, and more sort of a thematic longer-term question. But when you think about the software technology businesses, I think you've been phrasing it as 40% of revenue, and obviously that's been the focus. But do you have sort of midterm 3, 5-year goal, what proportion of the business you're sort of looking for that to be? Or how you think about that?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Well, Glenn, you're stealing our thunder for March 1. Cameron talked about the Investor Day on March 1, and now you're getting ahead of it. But I'll give you a sneak preview that not shockingly that number is probably 50% as we think where we'd like to take the business.","If you go back to where we were really in October 15 at our last Investor Day when we were together, I think at that point what we had said is those businesses in the aggregate were probably 30% plus or minus of our revenue. Today we talk about 40% now that ACTIVE has closed, and our target is 50%.","I don't know if there's any limit as to where the 50% candidly would go. I think it depends on where the opportunities are, what that mix looks like. Obviously we'll be talking about that a lot more on March 1. But if you take a step back for a second, you combine what Cameron just answered to your previous question with our strategy, well north of $1 billion of revenue on an annual basis in our U.S. business, which is our largest market, is coming from these strategies that Cameron was describing.","So we think about where we're taking the business not so much as a percentage but how we're actually setting the business up, we think that that is a defensible distinctive method of distribution for a long time to come. So yes, we'd like more of it, but I also think it makes us feel pretty good about our ability to continue, as we said in the press release this morning, to sustain those share gains.","(47:48) on top of that what David alluded to in Canada, what we talked about a little bit in the United Kingdom which we're pleasantly surprised by our ability to continue to generate share, I'd say we've done a great job in those markets.","But at the margin, I think we also do believe that the things that we've been describing on the tech-enablement side, bringing OpenEdge and integrated into Canada and into the United Kingdom, bringing Realex and our e-com omni-channels into North America and into Spain as well as the UK, those are undoubtedly helping us in terms of the momentum of the business, but as a key contributor I think going forward to baking that number 50% or some higher number. But now I've kind of given you the preview of March 1. I hope you'll still come on March 1.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Sorry to take away your thunder.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. I knew someone was going to ask that. I was going to ask to (48:33) about March 1 \u2013 here in November, but I do think though that's where we're headed. Obviously we'll be talking about that a lot more early in the New Year.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Please proceed Condra.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Cameron, I just wondered now that you have Heartland integrated ACTIVE in 2018, can you just kind of talk about seasonality just kind of for the benefit of our models that we should paying attention to? And then specifically, as we go from 4Q to 1Q and calendar processing days, just anything to kind of call out?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes. Probably the single biggest thing I would want to call out would be ACTIVE seasonality. Now that we have that transaction closed, I can give you a little bit more color as to kind of how we see seasonality in the business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're forecasting ACTIVE to contribute somewhere between $40 million to $45 million in Q4. If you look at their business overall, it's seasonally strongest in Q1 and Q2, Q2 being a seasonally strongest quarter. Q3 and Q4 tend to be wider from a revenue point of view.","So if you take that $40 million to $45 million target that we have for ACTIVE for Q4. I expect that business for all of calendar 2017 to produce $180 million to $185 million based on that expectation which is in line with our earlier commentary on Q2 where we indicated that the business would approach $200 million of revenue for calendar 2017, to be a little more specific around that right now we see it in the $180 million to $185 million range.","And that is a double-digit growing business as we talked about before, so you can factor that into the model as you look to 2018 and begin to forecast both annual and seasonal trends for the business. I'd say the rest of the business overall would be largely as experienced in 2017 as a seasonality matter, ACTIVE has a little bit of a different seasonal profile than I would say our legacy Global Payments business pre-ACTIVE would've had.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then on the direct ISO channel, I mean is there a point where that gets small enough that it becomes a little bit more of a revenue lift? And then I'm just wondering is there a reason you don't exit that business more quickly just given the declines?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Well, I would say it's still a profitable business for us, so there's no reason to exit it rapidly quite frankly. We still have a number of good ISO partners and we think we're a very good partner to them. So there's nothing inherently wrong with the business. Our strategy obviously is focused into different part of the distribution channel where we want to be direct and then control that direct relationship with our customer. We think that's where the business needs to go and will continue to go over the course of time.","I mean, as a mathematical matter as it continues to shrink, as a part of our North American business, it does become less of a headwind to growth and that I think in the long term is good for our business, and if we can manage it to flat to down, low to mid single-digit over the course of time, we can grow through that and over the course of time it will become an increasingly smaller part of our business, but we still probably have 90 ISO customers and it's a profitable business. It does add some scale to our overall business, so there's no real reason I would see to exit it more rapidly. We're not focusing lot of resources on it. We are supporting our partners in that channel well, but it's certainly not a strategic focus for us.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Sort of a qualitative question, Jeff and David, I think. When you look at Europe and the strong performance there and you talk about omnichannel in particular, can you kind of characterize where you think Global stands competitively? I guess specifically what kind of lead do you think you have over your competition? It sounds like maybe the UK is the most sophisticated market in Europe but I'm thinking about the continent Eastern Europe. Is there a multi-year competitive lead that you think sustains the kind of growth you're seeing there?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes. Andrew, it's Jeff. Listen, I think we've got to earn our business every day there because it's (52:55) competitive, but yes, I do believe that we're one of the faster growing businesses across Europe. Obviously, the level of competition there is intense but as we said in our prepared remarks, I think the thing that's distinctive about us is that we could combine physical world acceptance with online acceptance. Many of our peers if you think about Adyen or Stripe or Braintree, which of course is part of PayPal and the like, really are primarily focused on online acceptance, at least historically or even more so focused on online acceptance with low levels of service for low prices at very high volumes.","I think what's different about us is, first, we bring the broad breadth of coverage as I mentioned in our prepared remarks across a number of significant markets in Europe. They already have good growth trajectories before we get involved. But I think the second thing that we bring is the fact that we're primarily as we are in most of the rest of world for Global Payments, SMB to mid market focus. That's not to say that we don't pursue large deals in either our physical world or virtual world environments, but it is to say our bread-and-butter in the United States, in Europe and globally as a company is really SMB, the small to midmarket folks and that's where we think we can really provide a lot of value. That is very different than adding in \u2013 and many of our competitors who are almost squarely focused on self-service at a very high-level, volume at a very low price.","So I do think we have a very good angle there and I do think that does, based on our history, really tend to sell pretty well for the right group of companies. The other thing I'd say is, our partnerships in Europe, particularly in Spain which David can comment on in a minute, with Caixa, where we're partnered with the leading provider of financial services in technology, not just in Spain, but for multinational customers coming out of Spain, I also think is very distinctive for us. So I don't think there's anyone who really has what Caixa has in and around their markets, and I think we're very fortunate to be the beneficiary of what it can bring to the omni-channel strategy. David, you want to give some examples of...","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, I'd be happy to. I think the key is the distinctive distribution married to solutions targeted SMBs. And we can go upscale \u2013 sort of upstream to the MNCs and we do quite successfully, as we announced in the prepared comments.","But when you take a business where we've grown sales in Spain faster than any competitor for the last six years to build a 28% market share in that market, I think you get some sense of what we can do when we take then a Realex-solution for the e-com piece, marry it to Spain's face-to-face, and say okay, what can we do to sell and accelerate growth on an already large number you saw just this quarter in the European results? The same thing is happening in the UK, obviously. You can't grow in the double-digits in the UK just based on what's going on at a macro level. You have to be taking share, and you frankly have to be taking share in small to medium market. You don't grow that way by targeting large customers either, to be perfectly honest.","With Caixa, we have a unique partnership that brings banking services, issuing, as well as then omni capabilities to certain merchants. That works beautifully. Note that Caixa is also our partner in Eastern Europe, so we're trying to do in Eastern Europe with Erste, who is a wonderful partner, with Caixa, is take that success we've seen in Spain, take it to earlier stage markets in central Europe; your Romanias, your Czech Republic, as well as Hungary, Slovakia, and see if we can drive the same kind of outsized growth with this combination of distinctive distribution and real omni-solutions targeted at small to medium businesses.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And with regard to Xenial in the U.S., can that help you move up-market in restaurants? And maybe a comment on how important you think gateways generally are in the restaurant-acquiring business?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, a great question. And so, if you think about Xenial, yes, it can help us move up-market, but I should note to begin, we actually are up-market in the U.S. in our software businesses. And when we talk about gateway, I'm going to maybe pick on that a little bit. Gateway is valuable as you think about integrated solutions and semi-integrated solutions. What we're really talking about with Xenial is helping a small business all the way up to someone the size of a major national chain. I can't name either now, but I can start with any of the ones probably around the corner from you, Andrew. Right now they're usually customers of our software products for point-of-sale right now.","So Xenial's targeted all the way from QSRs who are individuals, sort of proprietors, the burrito shop around the corner from you, all the way up to someone who might be a piece of young brands, as an example, so any of those big brands. And what we want to do is point-of-sales software all the way back to kitchen expediting, wage modules for the folks who are working there, inventory modules, all those types of pieces of software. Not as simple as a gateway, but you're quite correct, the gateway is a core component of what we're providing.","We think what we can do then is marry dealers who deliver those products to our Heartland sales force, 1,500 people blanketing major metropolitan areas around the U.S., to sell the combination of payments and software. So the Xenial play is building on something that used to be called Heartland Commerce, which was small point-of-sale software businesses combined to one cloud-based growth engine that we can globally sell over some period of time. So in 2018, we take it across the U.S.; QSRs, table service, as well as retail. 2018 into 2019, we start to globalize it in the likes of Spain, UK, and across Asia, again, with a focus on this combination of software that runs the business, plus the payment, plus at the back end of that, Xenial analytics, Xenial reporting, Xenial e-mail marketing.","All these things are on the table and being, worse case, tested at a live restaurant in the U.S., going live in terms of the analytics products as we speak, as I think Jeff announced in the prepared comments, in the United States, with the analytics products also going out across the world in late 2018. So, pause for a moment to summarize, Xenial's a big play for us on global cloud-based software to help run restaurants, whether you're talking about small proprietors or enterprise-level, it will take us further upstream. Yes.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Awesome. Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe follow on the European strategy very broadly, Jeff. Maybe comment on, as you think about expanding Europe beyond the product side, on the geography side, how you're thinking about the idea of expanding organically into more countries versus additional JVs, and whether you're seeing any kind of changes in kind of asset pricing in that market?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Jim. So, look, I think expanding by way of additional JVs is obviously something we're very comfortable with. Certainly in Continental Europe, we've got a great history of doing that with both Caixa in Spain and Erste, which David just described, which is based in Vienna, but that business is in four other countries in Continental Europe.","I think, given the size of our business, and I know we've talked about this quite a bit in the past, Jim. Given the size of our business, I almost always prefer to find a partner. We think that we're very good at bringing sales, product, additional distribution technologies, operating infrastructure. But let's be honest, we're not resident in these markets that we're not in, and somebody else is. As Paul used to say when we did the partnership with HSBC in Asia, at the time, HSBC had been there for 150 years; we've been there for a day. So in that context, I think it's important to understand that our partners bring a lot to us, and we couldn't be more pleased with how those are going.","I will say that sometimes we have detours. So for example, our partnership with Erste, Erste is based in Vienna. For a lot of historical reasons, they don't have an existing portfolio of acquiring in Austria. We've been working with them for some time on expanding our services de novo and organically from the Czech Republic, which is the largest market we have with them organically, Jim, into Austria, which is something we're planning on doing. I think that's a bit of an exception that kind of proves the rule, because it's unusual to find someone in their home market where they don't have an existing book of business. That's not typically how we would approach it.","But I think when you step back and you look at the trend in all of our markets, particularly Europe since you asked about it, if you think about PSD2; if you think about SEPA, which, obviously, is behind us; if you think about GPDR (sic) [GDPR] (1:01:15), which is a privacy regulation that also goes into effect in 2018; if you just think about EMV and PCI, these are the things that are driving our potential partners to come toward us, before you even get to, how much technology can you bring by way of cross-sell from Realex in e-com and omnis from Caixa, in DCC additional products and everything else. So, those things will continue to accelerate, Jim, so we're not seeing any shortage of opportunities in our geographies, including Europe. We prefer to do those by way of partnership, just the bang for the buck of doing it. But we find someone like Erste, who wants us to go de novo into Austria, obviously, it's something we're going to look at.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And then, maybe just as a quick follow-up, following on your comments on the Vista portfolio, kind of any big game hunting you're doing in terms of that portfolio? Can you maybe characterize the pipeline? And also the relative yield at which some of those portfolios might come on, would that be net accretive to your kind of corporate yield on the portfolios?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Jim. It's Cameron. I'll maybe touch on that momentarily. I would say Vista has a variety of different companies in their portfolio; some very large and some that are not particularly large. I would say most of them are interesting in some form or fashion for us and we're looking at really every portfolio company they have that has a sort of direct-to-consumer relationship and would require some sort of payment technology expertise. Most of their businesses do, some do not, but we're obviously hashing through that portfolio today.","As it relates to the economics, I would say bringing in, and I'll use DealerSocket as example, they'll come in as a traditional integrated partner. So the economics of that relationship will work very similarly to other existing OpenEdge partners that we have today. We, obviously, think that is a premium product, the level of integration that we're able to drive that David articulated very nicely earlier, the value that brings to end-use customers as a premium product that warrants obviously a premium price from a market standpoint and the commercial relationship we have with DealerSocket to go-to-market is going to look and feel just like most of their relationships and structures that we have in place at OpenEdge today. So I would describe these as market deals.","We're not getting and we don't look to the relationship with Vista to drive disproportionate economics through the commercial agreements we're able to strike with the portfolio of companies. And today, we're doing market-competitive deals with those entities, and we think our ability to partner with them, improve their overall product offering and deliver differentiated solutions is what's allowing us to win the day.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jim.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Well, thank you for your interest in Global Payments, and we very much appreciate you joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Investor Relations, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane M. Forbes","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Global Payments Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Conference Call. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour. Joining me on the call are Paul Garcia, Chairman; Jeff Sloan, President and CEO; and David Mangum, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary, which are discussed in our public releases, including our most recent 10-K. We caution you not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call. In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these results more clearly reflect comparative operating performance.","For a full reconciliation of cash earnings to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K dated today, October 1, 2013, which may be located under the Investor Relations area on our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now I'd like to introduce Paul Garcia. Paul?","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, Jane. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We delivered strong results for the quarter, growing revenue by 7% and cash earnings per share by 15%. In addition, we are raising our cash earnings per share expectations by $0.05, as a result of our commitment to repurchase $100 million of our stock via an accelerated share repurchase program.","We are confident that Global Payments is positioned to deliver sustainable growth over the long term by continuing to focus on expanding our global market position and executing on our commitment of returning capital to our shareholders. We have an enviable market position and the necessary resources and talent to continue to prosper in the ever-changing payment space.","As you know, effective today and after 14 very rewarding years with the company, I'm relinquishing the role of CEO but will remain through our fiscal 2014 as Chairman. It has been an honor to lead our company. I am very confident in the company's prospects and Jeff's ability to lead it. Our board and I feel strongly that Jeff is the right leader at the right time and his proven track record of both Global Payments and in the financial services industry warrants that confidence. I look forward to working closely with Jeff to make the transition as smooth as possible.","Now I'd like to introduce you to Global Payments' new CEO, Jeff Sloan. Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Paul. First, I'd like to say a heartfelt thank you to Paul, the Board of Directors and our employees for all of their support and encouragement. I am honored and humbled to be here today. I have known Paul for many years. He has been a wonderful mentor to me, and I look forward to continuing that relationship. Global Payments is an organization of highly talented people with a fantastic culture. And while Paul had set the bar very high, I'm committed to building on the positive momentum that he has created.","Now for quarterly highlights.","I am pleased to report that North America delivered strong results, both in the United States and Canada. The U.S. was driven by terrific performance in our APT business and strength across our other channels. As we discussed in last quarter's earnings call, our ISO channel continues to contribute growth to our top line. But the rate of growth has slowed, reflecting in part the law of large numbers and the timing of fees that ISOs charge to their customers. However, much of the ISO's revenues are pass-throughs to us and have no effect on operating income.","As anticipated, Canada delivered strong performance in the quarter, reflecting organic growth, market-based pricing changes and stabilizing spreads. We anticipate closing our joint venture in Brazil this month, and we look forward to working with CaixaBank as we focus on signing new global customers and driving innovative products into the Brazilian market.","Our international results reflect strong performance across Europe, with particular strength in Spain and Russia and improved results in our Asia business as expected. Finally, we remain committed to completing additional strategic acquisitions, both in existing and new markets.","Now I will turn the call over to David.","David E. Mangum","Thanks, Jeff. We're off to a good start to the year with nice business performance and a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate, adding to our first quarter cash earnings. North America revenue grew 6% with U.S. revenue growth of 5% on transaction growth of 9%. In Canada, transactions grew 3%, credit spreads were stable for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we reported revenue growth of 10% in local currency. We remained on track for mid-single-digit annual revenue growth in local currency.","North America cash operating income grew 11% to $79 million, with cash operating margin expanding by 90 basis points to 17.6%. We continue to expect full year cash operating margins in North America to be about flat to slightly increasing. International revenue grew 10% for the quarter in U.S. dollars.","In local currency, Europe delivered solid revenue and transaction growth in all markets, with Spain and Russia benefiting from favorable secular trends and new product launches. Asia-Pacific revenue grew 3% over last year.","International cash operating income of $69 million grew 6% compared to last year, with cash operating margin down 140 basis points, primarily due to business mix in Europe and performance in Asia. This was about what we expected, and we continue to expect stable international cash operating margins for the full year.","Currency trends were about what we expected for the quarter, and we continue to expect foreign currency effects to be about neutral to a slight headwind for cash earnings per share for the full year. We continue to expect both GAAP and cash effective tax rates to approach 29% for the full year.","For the quarter, our total company cash operating margin was 19.7%. This includes over $4 million of the anticipated full year $17 million incremental security spend. Excluding the security spend, total company margins would have increased to 20.4%.","For the first quarter, we generated free cash flow of $59 million. We made our annual distribution to CaixaBank for our Comercia joint venture, which reduced our free cash flow by just over $9 million for the quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement, assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests.","Capital expenditures were about $20 million for the quarter, and we continue to anticipate our full year capital expenditures will total about $90 million. Our total available cash, including working capital at the end of the quarter, was $276 million.","During the quarter, we repurchased a total of $144 million worth of shares, $125 million of which completed our July 2012 authorization. $19 million of repurchases related to our July 2013 $250 million authorization. And in the next few days, we plan to enter into an accelerated share repurchase plan for up to $100 million. As a result, we are increasing our annual fiscal 2014 cash earnings per share expectations by $0.05 to a range of $3.98 to $4.05, reflecting 9% to 11% growth over fiscal 2013. We are maintaining our annual revenue expectations of $2.51 billion to $2.56 billion, reflecting 6% to 8% growth.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Paul.","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, David. I have enjoyed working with all of you and have appreciated your candor and support during these past years. Although we have accomplished a lot, I firmly believe that Global Payments' future has never been brighter.","I'll now turn the call over to Jane. Jane?","Jane M. Forbes","Thanks. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of George Mihalos from Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Paul, all the best. It was great working with you.","Paul R. Garcia","Thanks, George.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And congratulations, Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, George.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So maybe just to start off, nice to see the margins trending in the right direction. Within the North American business or within the U.S. business, can you break out the revenue contribution that is non-ISO direct in the growth trends that you've seen there?","David E. Mangum","George, this is David. I'd be happy to do that. And they're really quite consistent with what we expected when the year started. So we have an ISO channel, that as you heard in our prepared comments, growth is slowing a little bit, really due to the law of large numbers and the timing and sequencing of when ISOs choose to see their customers. So that channel continues to grow transaction in the double digits and with revenue growth below that, depending again on timing of the fees and just as, again, the law of large numbers. So if you go to the rest of the channels, the APT business is really carrying a lot of the water for us this year, just as we expected. Remember last year, we didn't own APT until October. So we're getting the benefit of that in this quarter and that will begin to annualize. But even when it annualizes, we'll be looking at very nice mid-teens kind of revenue growth from APT, everything we expected from that business with the opportunity to actually add growth to it on a global basis over the years. Then if you go to the rest of the channels, the check and gaming, the gaming business, you remember historically having covered us for some time, still chugs along at very nice levels, high-single-digit kind of growth levels. Our direct business, very solid business, and that's the combination of our joint venture with Comerica, as well as our core direct base. So the legacy direct base of Global Payments, that moves along in a nice sort of mid-single-digits pace as well. Our Greater Giving business, low double to maybe high-single. And then the indirect business, which is kind of the final reconciling piece of really legacy portfolios buried in us as well as buried in other processors, they have a different trajectory but small enough that it doesn't really affect the overall. The end result of which is what you see today. We're reporting really maybe, more importantly, what we continue to expect for the full year, which is mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth on an annual basis.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just, Jeff, going back to your comments on the acquisition pipeline. Can you talk a little bit more, maybe geographically and particularly with some of the new markets that you mentioned, you could be looking to get into?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, sure. George, I'm happy to do that. So we continue to have a full pipeline, and we balance that pipeline against what we think to be appropriate return of capital to our shareholders, which touches on the accelerated buyback that Paul and David mentioned. I would say a big part of what we do in terms of pipeline, George, depends on where the opportunities are as we are really looking globally for targets. Right now, we're spending a fair amount of time in Asia. I think Paul touched on that previously. We're also spending a fair amount of time in Latin America and in North America and a little bit of time in Western Europe. So it really depends on where the deals are. We have a fairly full pipeline but we thought the right thing to do at this point, balancing that versus return of capital, was to move ahead with the $100 million on the buyback relative to the $250 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just want to add my congratulations to both Paul and Jeff and wanted to just start with a question on the U.S. And obviously, overall, North American operating margins were great to see here this quarter, but we continue to see that gap in the U.S., specifically, with transaction growth eclipsing revenue growth by a bit. Saw the same thing in Q4. Just remind us of the drivers of that dynamic. Should we expect that to continue at a similar spread during the rest of fiscal '14?","David E. Mangum","Jason, it's David. You'll probably not going to love this answer, but it can move around a little bit at it has historically. You're correct. It's fairly consistent Q4 to Q1, and let's recall the drivers of that. It's transactions across the market. But the real driver is the timing of what's going on with the ISOs. And so while logically, the relationship between transaction growth and revenue growth should be consistent, unless something were to happen to pricing trends, something along those lines, I can tell you from a metrics perspective, there's almost nothing happening with average tickets and almost nothing happening with spreads in our U.S. business. So in fact, you point right back to the ISOs when you're comparing these quarters to each other and say, \"Okay, when did they charge which fee?\" And depending on that timing, and then the overall pace of growth they're seeing as their growth slows a bit, you sort kind of have that relationship, which is again quite logical. You asked a great question, but it sort of vary from what you might expect to be the norm. So I think, the reality is you should not be surprised if you see more quarters like this but also the occasional quarter, where that revenue growth and transaction growth are very consistent with each other because some fees were billed during that period.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And Paul, you've always been great to opine on industry trends and implications of changes in the space. So as we think about the possibility of a Durbin 2.0 becoming reality, if we do see another significant cut in U.S. debit interchange, as well as a potential requirement for the dual-signature networks, should we assume that your industry in general and Global Payments specifically would benefit materially, albeit perhaps on a temporary basis from these regulatory changes as was the case after Durbin 1.0?","Paul R. Garcia","Jason, it's hard to argue with just how articulately you put that. I think that -- I think you captured all of it. I think you -- I think some will benefit more materially than others. I think we're all going to be balanced. But we've always said, and as you well know, moving interchanges are good things. Interchanges going down are very good things, and it is temporal. I mean, you don't get to have it forever and ever, but it's a nice inflection point. And you're right, that's a very positive development for us and everybody in our space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Thought we would have heard about some additional distribution deals in Asia. What's kind of the update? What are you working on in Asia?","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. Greg, this is Paul. We said in a number of calls that we're very focused on expanding distribution in Asia. Now that we have the opportunity because we purchased the remaining ownership position from HSBC, we've been focused on really two-pronged approach. Number one, less dramatic, less kind of big, strategic deals, which we have executed on. And they are kind of the bread and butter, and we're looking for more of that throughout all the regions in Asia. Then there are some bigger strategic opportunities. Those are tough to time. I mean, we're pursuing lots of them. And that doesn't necessarily mean an acquisition, Greg. It could just be a bigger opportunity with a big in-country provider. Some of those are further along than others but they all kind of take their own time, and once again it's Asia. So that takes -- that probably adds a little bit more time on top of that. But I would just leave you with this thought: we are very focused on that, and we have the guy that runs our worldwide business living in Asia. He is focused on it every day. Jeff and I are heading over in 30 days. So we're all over it.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just to make you opine on something else, the PayPal's acquisition of Braintree. Just -- is that an area that APT can play in? And what are your thoughts there?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Sure. Greg, it's Jeff. I'll start, and then Paul and David, of course, can jump in. So those are slightly different businesses. APT is really a card-present business. So you think about what we talked about in January, Greg, which is dental offices, veterinary offices, auto dealers, that kind of thing. Those are almost all, by definition, card-present. As I understand it from Braintree and PayPal announcement, that was largely card-not-present, so if you go a little bit closer, Greg, to the Visa CyberSource announcement and the card-not-present gateway versus necessarily what APT does. So that's kind of the first piece, Greg, in terms of how those line up. I think on the second piece though, and I think to get the gist of your question, I think on the second piece, it does make us feel very good as we've already, as David already described, in the integrated solutions market. So one thing I think they do have in common is how do we all think about value propositions and integrated solutions. I think Braintree was a step in that direction, too. So I think it does make us feel very good in addition to the numbers David described in executing our strategy through APT, Greater Giving and our own bar business here in the U.S.","Paul R. Garcia","And Greg, I would add that our relationship with PayPal has never been stronger. They briefed us on this. They let us know what opportunities could develop because of this deal they did. And to that end, we are focused on expanding our relationship, and they are focused on expanding our relationship. So we're very bullish on PayPal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And congrats, again, on the transitions. My first question is just Canada. Usually, that's one of the first questions on the call. I think we were at the -- about fifth. But it was so strong this quarter, and I guess I'm wondering, is that -- it sounds like it's not sustainable. But maybe, was there something in Q1 that's not sustainable? And maybe as part of the reason you're guiding to mid-single digits for the full year, just that it's hard to keep the price-increase impact as we go further down the road?","David E. Mangum","Dave, this is David. First, I'd like to thank you all for not asking about Canada until the fourth question. So I wouldn't regard the performance of Canada in the first quarter relative to the rest of the year in any way as sort of a precursor of something falling off later in the year, in fact, quite the opposite. I think when you think about Canada, realize that the comparables last year don't have some of the price changes that start to happen in Q4. Realize too that the history of Canada is what it is. And we're looking to have a very successful year in Canada and certainly, very successful relative to what we posted the last couple of years. So I wouldn't look at Canada as anything other than we're off to a very strong start, on track for our goals. You could accuse us of being somewhat conservative where revenue will end up in Canada. But we're at end of the first quarter, and we'll keep running with Canada. Maybe what is important is anything about Canada, maybe more than just the price changes, because remember some of that's assessment-driven anyway, is that the core underlying trends in Canada have stayed consistent with the last couple of quarters. Remember we started talking about this really with the February quarter of last year. More stable credit spread trends and they declined in each of the last 2 quarters of fiscal '13 on the order of 4%. Now they're roughly flat year-over-year in Q1, married to ongoing transaction growth and, again, back to the prepared comments, transaction growth was 3%, the same as it had been in Q4, gives us something we can manage. So I would not suggest you look askance at what may happen with Canada the rest of the year relative to just posting a very good start to the year in Q1.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just, I guess, a follow-up would just be that the U.K. would be the other big, very profitable market and just wondering, one, growth seems like -- because Europe growth was so strong, I mean, was the U.K. also strong and then some people often asked is just, could the U.K. ever turn into Canada, if there was very transparent pricing? Do you see that ever happening?","David E. Mangum","So I'll take this on maybe in reverse order. There's already very transparent pricing in the United Kingdom. The competitors and we, as long -- as well as anyone who watches the industry has taken care of that. A lot of that started happening in the order of 2 or 3 years ago. Probably most important prospective for the United Kingdom is it has had a level of complexity in interchange and now assessments for years that Canada never had prior to the big pricing change as you recall from calendar 2008. And that, as you recall, without going through the history of Canada again, was the setup for the more challenging macro and micro situations in Canada over the last 3 or 4 years. With that said, our U.K. business, remember, operates sort of a couple of different product lines that kind of came out of or emanated from our original joint venture with HSBC going back to '08 and '09. It's the core credit business, which, as you say, is highly profitable and tends to chug along, married to our debit business and cash advance, the rest of the products you'd sell to merchants in a card-present, to use Jeff's description of APT kind of environment, that business chugs along. And then within that business as well is what we call Global Solutions, which we used to refer to as International Acquiring. This is the e-commerce business we run over the card-not-present, cross-border business. And that's driving an enormous amount of revenue growth in Europe particularly, and recall, particularly around the February quarter of last year, we saw some outsized growth and began talking to you guys about the fact that those transactions, many of which by the way come from PayPal to go back to an earlier question, come at a lower contribution margin. And thus, you can have the dynamic, where you've got really high European revenue growth, married to maybe less international profit growth than you might expect overall. That doesn't mean there's any problem with the channel. It's the nature of the transactions themselves.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Congratulations, as well, to Paul and Jeff. The question I had around sort of partner-of-choice strategy that you've been putting into place. I think, Jeff, it's sort of been one of your initiatives. But you've announced deals with companies like edo, having ShopKeep, just very curious if you could talk a little bit about initial reactions from your channel partners about these alliances and partnerships you're building. And any way to think about how much more expensive that might be, I mean, eventually, the income statement impact and then [ph] I know it's a big topic but curious if you could walk us through some thoughts there.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, sure. Tim, I'm happy to do that. So I think to back up a bit, the partner-of-choice strategy that we talked a lot about in January at our Investor Day is really grounded in the fact that we're a service business. So what's important for us is to provide our partners and our merchants, our customers with the ability to accept any payment, anytime, anywhere. And that means that they have the choice, for example, to accept PayPal. That means they have to have the choice, for example, to accept a tablet form of acceptance like a ShopKeep. We have to have loyalty solutions like edo, which you referenced. So the way we view our business is how much choice can we give our customers and how much choice can we give our partners. If you look at the deals that you mentioned, one common thread is with the increasing complexity at the point of sale, how do we enable that choice and ultimately, provide more value-added services to our customers and that's really the common thread. So I would say the reaction from our partners has been very good to what we're doing with these third parties. We continue to expand the suite of solutions in our mobile universe. ShopKeep is a part of that. You may also remember in January that we talked about PayApp, which is our own proprietary solution for mobile commerce, which we now have in 5 markets in Asia Pacific, including, in particular, in Hong Kong. You've also read, of course, our initiatives with Intuit in the U.K., with PayPal in the U.K. and there's more to come in other markets. So I really think of that, Tim, in the context of we're a service provider. We need to provide value-added services to maintain our position. ShopKeep, edo, all the types of things that our customers are looking for, and I think the reception has been very good, and I think there's more to come.","David E. Mangum","And maybe a little color on top of that, Tim. When we talk about PayApp, what we really build is an infrastructure, into which all of our partners can plug. So for mobility, whether you're dealing with tablet or a dongle or any other integrated solution, you can plug in there for boarding, underwriting risk management, reporting, processing, tailored for digital commerce. That also means what can plug in there is content, whether that's the kind of edo offer or couponing for analytics, available in all markets around the world and available to our current partners, as well as the new partners, about what you're asking. So all that infrastructure is available for any partner who wants to plug in, as well as our direct sales force anywhere in the world. As you might imagine, we're selling a lot of this on a direct basis in the Asian markets Jeff referenced, with the ability to do that across Europe and some of the other markets as well. So the way we thought about is very much that service architecture. Everyone can plug into that service, whether you're current partner with your own, mobility or tablet strategy or whether you're a new partner, like a ShopKeep, we can make that available to any customer they'd like around the world.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just follow up, I guess obviously, this is sort of evolutionary. So when you get to sort of the income statement or think about North American revenue or I guess I'm going to say revenue overall, is this something that you think from -- however your structuring these partnerships with edo, ShopKeep, your own proprietary PayApp-type stuff, is this something that sort of works against maybe sort of what people view as the secular margin issue around North America? I mean, do we get into more revenue per merchants, more revenue per channel partner, that really help defend the margin structure? Is that the -- just sort of your thoughts on the likelihood of it playing out that way over some period of time in the next couple of years?","David E. Mangum","Yes, without going into specifics, I believe this should fundamentally transform over the long term, the shape of the face of the income statement and here's why. Right now, our conversations about margins are dominated by whether the ISOs are doing that kind of conversation. To the extent a plug-in service infrastructure like this allows our customers to on more of an \u00e0la carte basis by services from us with maybe a different contractual relationship from what we have ISOs today in the United States, then what you're talking about is getting more and more growth in volume, sort of wholesaling as Jeff described it from large partners, without the problematic GAAP accounting margin implications you get from the ISO accounting today. I certainly believe -- we certainly believe we're dedicating entire business units to the belief that mobility and digital commerce is how transactions are going to be effectuated over the coming years. And with that should come the opportunity for sort of different optics on the income statement to answer your question directly. No promises, I can't tell you exactly how it's going to shape. But that's certainly the view of how the partnerships should evolve, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And again, congratulations to both of you. I was wondering if you could comment if there's been any change in -- if you've been able to perceive any change in how Paymentech is operating. We're about 6 months from the CMS announcement, and I was wondering if you've seen any change in behavior. Also if you have any thoughts on today's announcement of an alliance to explore tokens, which I know banks are also looking at as a way to move us to -- to skip the payment networks altogether, that would be helpful.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, sure. Greg, it's Jeff. So on Paymentech and the JPM Visa announcement some time ago, we haven't seen any difference in a go-to-market strategy or in the competitive landscape. It's always been a very competitive business. JPM and other large acquirers, as well as acquirers and issuers, are going to use their rightly earned competitive advantages to compete in those marketplaces. So we really have seen no difference over time in the go-to-market strategy from that announcement or otherwise. Second, in your question about the announcement today from Visa MasterCard and AmEx, we welcome anything that provides more secure commerce for any of our businesses in any of our markets. Obviously, there's a variety of solutions to go-to-market there. Tokens might be one. EMV, which, of course, we're knee deep in and we've discussed before is another. But anything that provides more security to the ecosystem in the U.S. or elsewhere is a welcome occurrence. As I said before in response to Tim's question, we are a service provider. So as long as something is touching a merchant and the consumer is using that service and\/or a merchant wants to get paid, we'll be there providing solutions. So whether that's riding on existing rails, on Visa and MasterCard, the other networks or which we ride [ph] again different functionality that's been described before, as long as it is touches a merchant and somebody wants to get paid and somebody wants to transact, we're going to be the beneficiaries of being in the middle of that. If that's more secure, ala tokens, that's great news for what we do. So we welcome things like that, and I'm sure there'll be more to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Paul, I also want to wish you the best. I also enjoyed working with you. And I guess, I've learned a lot talking with you over all these years. So just wanted to say thanks upfront.","Paul R. Garcia","Well, that's very kind, Tien-tsin. I feel the same. Thank you very much.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. I do appreciate that. I guess, maybe I'll just ask you, Paul. How active do you think you'll be here as Chairman to '14? And Jeff, congrats as well. Should we expect any big changes from you? Or will be you running things differently, anything to call out today?","Paul R. Garcia","Well, Tien-tsin, I'd like to, first of all, comment on why and when. So this is something that -- this is a planned transition. Jeff has been here for 3.5 years. And the board and I believe strongly he's the right guy at the right time. The company is in terrific shape, so that plays well into this. And honestly, from my own vantage point, this is good timing for me personally as well for the company. To your exact question, I'm going to remain on a couple of different levels. I'm going to remain a large shareholder. I'm going to be actively involved as Chairman, primarily focusing on ensuring a smooth transition. I'm working with Jeff on a number of strategic things, working on some key introductions around the world. Jeff knows that a ton of this people already but I'm just kind of adding a little impetus to those relationships, and that is my focus. Jeff is CEO and my job is Chairman, and he is charged with the day-to-day responsibilities running our company. And I, for one, am convinced he'll do a great job of it.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","And to answer your second question, Tien-tsin. Of course, today, we've reaffirmed our revenue expectations for this fiscal and also raised our earnings expectations for this fiscal as we've described, and that's what we're working toward. So I think it's a pretty clear path as to what we're doing. Of course, we also had an Analyst Day that you were at in January, where we set forth our strategy, which we're pursuing. And I'm sure, over time, we'll have further discussions about what that strategy is and what it will be. For now, for day 1, it's really business as usual and I'm going to continue to work with Paul and our board, as we execute on the objectives that we've laid out for this fiscal.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood, understood. So let me -- as my follow-up, I'll ask a business question. just -- I'll ask on Europe. I think David mentioned -- asked it before. But Europe was better than we had modeled sequentially by quite a bit on very little expense growth, it looks like, sequentially again. Was there a pricing change there? Is this sustainable? Just trying to think about how that might sketch out over the remainder of the fiscal year.","Paul R. Garcia","So Tien-tsin, if I point you back to the strong global solutions, also that e-commerce solution in the quarter, and then one other thing to watch for, that I think is going to be a trend going forward as we go from Q4 and to Q1, remember Q4 ends in May and then Q1 really takes over the entire summer. So we have product sets that we've now introduced in an awful lot of markets, like DCC, that have really big quarters in our first quarter. You get a lot of the travelers moving around. Lot of travelers, for example, headed to Spain for us in the first quarter. And so we saw outsized growth and frankly, more growth than we expected in Spain from that particular product, which you then see flow through in your Europe revenue. So don't be surprised if you see pretty strong sequential revenue Q4 -- Q1 over Q4 kind of going forward now that we've fully rolled out that product across much of Europe, and we still have the Asia version of that product that continues to chug along as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I certainly will miss you. Hopefully, our paths will cross again soon.","Paul R. Garcia","Well, thank you, Andrew, and I hope so as well.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","David, you mentioned you -- called out the security spend, and I just want to make sure I got it, you said $4 million in the quarter, $17 million for the year was the expectations?","David E. Mangum","That's right, Andrew?","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you sort of normalized the margin. I guess what I'm wondering is, how do we look at that as we go out to '15? Are we thinking about an elevated level of security spend around that level by which your overall corporate expenses rise this year? Or is there going to be a way to scale that? Or does it actually grow?","David E. Mangum","Yes. I think it has to scale as we head into '15. It's like any other piece of this infrastructure. It has to scale. It may be an exceptional piece in that as tools improve, you want to be as secure as you can from a posture perspective. So perhaps, counting on it to grow no more than we have our human resources or our legal department grow from a scale perspective inside the corporate is asking too much. But we do not expect it to grow at outsized expense levels from '15 and beyond. We think we're setting up the baseline over the course of '14 in order to lever it, really across the world, '15 and beyond. There may be a hair of an element of it's not fully in every run rate for the full year in '14 so it might grow a little faster than one might imagine but, I mean, a little faster. Again, we don't expect to see huge chunks because as with any other piece of the infrastructure, security services, the entire infrastructure and should provide some element of scale.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so recognizing, and maybe this is a question for Jeff, recognizing that it's hard to predict what's going to happen next in the world, all else being equal, do you feel like you probably hit the trough for consolidated profitability at this point?","David E. Mangum","I think that question requires an awful lot of a crystal ball. I would point you back to maybe a different language. I think we feel good about where the business is and how it's executing right now. We're off to a good start for this year. This year is the first clean year in a while. There is no breach. There's no weird trajectories of pieces of the business. We have opportunities to expand distribution, not just in Asia, but in other places. In fact, we are expanding distribution in places like Asia. They're actually implicit in our view of the year and the improvement in Asia in the second half of the year. There's new distribution partners in Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, may be tactical may not be as sexy as the big banks that Paul was talking about earlier, but that's just running the business. It's what we do. And you sink pieces all around the world. So rather than say this is the trough, I would tell you we feel good about the position of the execution, and we've been consistently executing against what we talked to you guys about in January, which allows the business to execute better quite frankly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok with KBW.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Congrats to both Paul and Jeff. I was just wondering if there are any early indicators of how the second quarter is trending?","David E. Mangum","Steven, we really don't break out monthlies. But I would say, there's nothing we've seen, thus far, in the quarter that suggests our forecasts are off-track.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, in terms from an M&A perspective, I mean how big can you currently flex the balance sheet for a deal?","David E. Mangum","We can flex quite substantially from here. As you know, we target an implicit investment-grade approach to keep our cost of capital low and make sure we're as attractive as we want to be to different financial services partners around the world. But we have a great deal of room as you can tell from what we reported, in the order of 2x levered. We can certainly run this business quite a bit above that, depending on the opportunities. Jeff described exactly where we stand right now, which is a solid pipeline but enough of a view of that pipeline to suggest that this is a good time to go ahead and return a little more capital to shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase. But we can flex the balance sheet well north of 3x for the right combination of capital opportunities.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","And Steven, just to add to what David said, I don't view us and I don't think David does either, as being capital constrained relative to deals that we see in our pipeline. So it's a balance and that's what we are executing on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about the spread there between the revenue growth in constant currency in Canada and the 3% transaction growth. I just want to make sure I have the moving pieces. I know credit spreads are flat, but can you just maybe walk through it for me, David?","David E. Mangum","Yes, I'm happy to. So you got the foundation, Bryan. It's flattish spread -- flat spreads, not flattish, flat spreads and then beyond that 3% transaction growth in aggregate, which is a combination of credit, highly profitable credit growth and debit, which is a little less profitable. So credit is moving along nicely in Canada. Now what goes on top of that is the changes, the structural changes introduced by each of Visa and MasterCard in April and July, respectively, which changed the structure around assessments in the market, domestic assessments, cross-border assessments, international, et cetera. So the difference between then between the 10% reported and what your math and your model would say 3% plus flat ought to deliver, presumably around 3%, is the change in the assessments in the market overall and then how those ended up reflected on customers' statements by the time the actual volumes had come through based on charge types, card types and the application of the assessment. So it's revenue, core revenue, nice progress, nice foundation but then on top of that, the network-driven changes and assessments.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then with the MasterCard change in July, we'll see a little bit more of that. I guess it's not a pure number, the one that we're looking at for the quarter.","David E. Mangum","Yes, I think, that's the right way to think about it. You get a little more help in the September quarter from MasterCard, while at that point you'll have a full quarter of Visa. But yes, I think that's a fair way to think about it.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just for the big margin improvement in North America, is it safe to say that was pretty much all Canada? Or was some of that improvement also in the U.S.?","David E. Mangum","Actually, I would start you with the U.S. That is APT, which is 2 things. One is not a comparable quarter last year because we closed in October. In addition, just a very nice profitable business we've added that's growing and growing its profits at a rapid rate, married to a little slower ISO growth, which as you know, at the margin line and, quite honestly, at EBIT line as well, are not necessarily bad things for Global Payments, given how much that helps with the optics in North America and then total company margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Roman Leal with Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Let me call the congratulatory comments to both Paul and Jeff.","Paul R. Garcia","Thanks, Roman.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe if we start off, David, you kind of talked a little bit about the moving parts U.S. versus Canada. To get to your full year guidance in terms of margins being flat to maybe slightly up, are the expectations that may be APT anniversaries and the ISOs start to go a little faster towards the second half of the year or Canada's maybe gets a little bit weaker second of the year? Can you walk us through the different moving parts to get to flat to slightly up for the rest of the year?","David E. Mangum","Yes, I'd be happy to. And I think I'll toss on top of that the rest of the world in total company, because that question is inevitable as well, I'm sure. So you've got the right question, the right pieces in mind. Let's start with -- at a total company level. Total company margin is about flat year-over-year in Q1. That's what we expect for the full year. Now below that, as usual, Global Payments have all kinds of moving parts. You put your finger on the correct view of North America. We closed the APT transaction last October, so Q1 gets a big benefit from that. We'll get a little bit of help in Q2 as well. And then we're benefiting right now from less margin pressure from the ISOs, that growth slows a bit with large numbers. However, there's nothing to stop the ISOs from billing lots of fees later in the year and that often happens in our Q -- in our Q3 -- for Q3 and our Q4. So we do allow for that to happen, and so to have a little slightly different trajectory from the ISOs later in the year. Frankly, we also expect Canada margins to be a little bit better in the first half of the year versus the second. That's where the time of the reprices and then how the metric shape for the full year. So if you think about those couple of things, we've got margin expansion on the first couple of quarters and then you probably ought to have a model that has margins for the second half of the year look a little like they did the second half of last year. As we go through the year, we post some Q2 results, we'll have another view of Q3 and Q4 and we'll talk some more about it at that time. If you park that for a second and, again, indulge me to the whole world for everyone why we're doing it, in international, we expect to be around the same level in FY '14 we were in FY '13 as well. So as we saw last year, and as I mentioned earlier in answering Tien-tsin's question, a lot of our most profitable products come on -- it's been a seasonally strong Q1, except DCC, and also our IPP products. Again, a lot in Spain and some of our other markets as we introduce them. So that will result in a strong Q1 margin, a little lower margin in Q2. But that's not unlike the sequential change in margin from Q1 to Q2 you saw last year. And then you should expect the same sequential change in Q3, traditionally our weakest quarter, but you're talking about U.S., Canada, U.K., Russia, anywhere around the world. So expect that again and expect that margin looks something like last year's margin. What's important about this, I think, and part of why I want to touch on it is, by the time you get out to Q4, we expect to be executing better in Asia. We expect some of these distribution partners to come through and be creating some level of leverage in some of these markets in that latter quarter. We expect continued execution in Europe so that you should have some margin expansion in Q4 in international overall. So that'll begin to play against the North America, which means for the total company, you get those trends. You lay in our corporate expenses, which are growing a little more than you would expect this year because of corporate security, and you end up in total, now for total company margins '14 over '13, slightly down on a year-over-year basis but would have been up without that incremental security. Those are the pieces.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. My follow-up maybe for Jeff, what's the strategy with the Caixa partnership in Brazil? And we're talking about the M&A pipeline, but how does the distribution or even the client pipeline looks like in Brazil? It could be a pretty important market obviously.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, thanks, Roman. We're very pleased with where we are in Brazil. We actually have roughly 1,000 merchants today processing with us in a very short period of time, just a number of months in Brazil. We expect the CaixaBank transactions, we said, to close this month in October. I think what we're going to get from the CaixaBank transaction is a few things. First, we're going to bring their technology into the Brazilian market. They have their own mobile point-of-sale technology today in Spain. One of our key initiatives is to roll that out into the Brazilian market, which we're working on now. We also expect to take DCC, which David just described, and we have, of course, in other markets to have that available by the World Cup, which, of course, is next summer here, June and July 2014 in Brazil. And we're also building -- looking at building an e-commerce business in Brazil from a distribution point of view, again, with CaixaBank. And then lastly, with Caixa, we've staked out a number of their customers who are already in Brazil today from a processing point of view who are their customers in Europe or Spain, have those become our customers in the Brazilian marketplace, as well as other customers of theirs in Latin America outside of Brazil. So I think there's a number of things going for us in Brazil, so we feel good about where we are. But we need to continue to expand that business and capitalize on where we are with CaixaBank.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe, if I may, a last -- one last one on Asia. David, I know you don't like calling bottoms here. But just given the sequential trajectory we're seeing and some of the distribution you're gaining there, is it safe to say that the sequential improvement continues going forward?","David E. Mangum","Yes. Particularly, I'd focus on the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year, but yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.","Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","My question is really based on overseas as well. Can you talk a little bit about the Moscow market? Paul, I know you've done a lot of work on this, and I understand all parties have done a lot of work on it. But if we could talk a little bit about how that's been evolving, what you guys expect to achieve in that particular geography this year? And the follow-up is, does the relatively recent Qiwi IPO, that hurt or helped GPN prospects in that region?","Paul R. Garcia","Okay, Wayne, this is Paul. I'll do Russia, and then I'll ask Jeff and David to do the second question. So Russia has been a nice double-digit growing business for us, pretty much from onset. It's an interesting demographic, about 140 million people, and credit and debit cards are growing very strongly there. So that kind of -- you get the benefit of that rising tide lifting all ships but we're also introducing a number of products. We have a very adroit sales force. We have superb management there, and we've done a great job of signing new business and expanding. For example, if you goes to Sochi for the Olympics, the great majority of those merchants, we send whole teams out there to sign them up, sign them up for credit cards, debit cards and for club cards, so which is very important to our Chinese partners. So we love that market. It's -- it has some intrigues, but we love that market and I love our management team there and most particularly, we all love our growth.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","I would just add to your question, Wayne, about Qiwi. I think that the way to think about Russia, and Paul touched on it, is that the vast majority of the market called more than 90% remains cash and check. I think it's one of the government's initiatives in Russia to make the business -- to make their economy more electronic for all the obvious reasons. I think digital wallets, ATMs, top-up kiosks, all these other things, of which Qiwi is a part, are all good news to us. If you go back to what we described before, we're a service provider. The more choice that we have in market, the better the ability to displace cash and check at the point of sale, the more service providers, the more merchants who accept cards, those are all key inputs into what we do and I think Qiwi plays right into that. So from our point of view, that's fertile ground for growth, everyone around the world, but especially in Russia.","Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right, terrific. Congratulations on the announcement today.","Paul R. Garcia","Thanks, Wayne.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Let me just add my heartfelt congratulations to both of you. It's been a long road, Paul. So I very much appreciate everything you've done over the years for me so...","Paul R. Garcia","Well, thanks, Dan.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The question I had is, you added John to your board recently, John Partridge, to your board. And I'm interested, since we got you here, Paul, your thoughts about what opportunities he might be able to present to you guys in that there's new regions that he might want to bring you into, where there might be new technologies or partnerships, for that matter, given his experience with Visa?","Paul R. Garcia","Thanks for that one. I would say that we are just delighted to have John on our board. And John was President of Visa and he was, obviously, involved in all the issues that we went through when we had that data intrusion. And I think that in scenarios like that, you get to know the networks and the networks get to know the processor. And I think he felt comfortable with what we did and we felt comfortable with the way they did it and particularly, with John's leadership. He has -- as you mentioned, Dan, he has significant experiences, particularly in Latin America. He's a fluent speaker. He spent a lot of his career there. He's also a technologist. And his Rolodex is deeper than anybody's. So -- and he, by the way, is just at Visa, so he's bringing all current knowledge. He's bringing tons of contacts. He's bringing credible business acumen. And the thing that made us feel the best, it seems like a bit of an endorsement to us because this is not the only opportunity John has. So for him to accept our invitation, it felt pretty darn good that he would serve on our board.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just real quick on a follow-up. I keep trying to figure out how you guys are going to monetize your distribution asset, both domestically and then globally. And I hear you talk a lot about partner of choice. But I'm wondering, are you finding that a lot of new technology companies are increasingly coming to you directly proactively in order to get access to your distribution? And if so, how do you think about really monetizing that outside of just as partner-of-choice idea -- or strategy rather, sorry?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. Dan, it's Jeff. I'll certainly start with that. So I think Tim asked this question. If you look ShopKeep; if you look at edo; of course, if you look at PayPal and some of things that they're doing, I think our ability to provide value-added services to our customer base and to our partners around the world is something that's very distinctive to us. And if you look at the customers that we have, who we have in multiple geographies like PayPal, for example, I think what you realize is that very few folks in the world that can provide that suite of services in multiple markets. So if you just go back to the conversation a few minutes ago, the partner-of-choice strategy is rooted in the notion that we can do well if our partners do well and if our partners do well, we don't, and providing with more value-added solutions that enable them to win in the marketplace and enable us to win on a direct basis makes a lot of sense to us. I think that's what you've seen with these announcements since the Investor Day in January, for example, along the lines of the mobile ecosystem that David described.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And is there a unified technology that they're able to plug into that falls under this partner strategy, so that you're easy to partner with quickly? Or is this separate and distinct for each partnership?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. That's a great question, Dan. So again, going back to the Investor Day, so one of the things about the partner of choice is that we have to make it easy to do business with us. Otherwise, people would decide it's too hard to partner. So if you look at some of the multinationals with whom we're doing business today that we've described on this call and previously, I think you'll see a common theme is, they're generally based on a variety of markets, many of the companies we're in market with in Europe and Asia are U.S. companies and domiciled here. And the reason they're selecting us is they know that they can do business with us in multiple markets, including, in particular, outside their home market. David described a few minutes ago in response to another question our International Acquiring platform, which is based in the U.K., we use that platform to provide card-not-present services to customers around the world. So to your question about kind of one solution, there's a very good example with one platform and how people can dial into multiple markets with us. Same thing is true for the mobile ecosystem that David also described. The ability for Intuit, PayPal and others to participate with us, not just in their home markets, but in markets around the world is also distinctive to Global Payments. So I wish I could say there is always one solution in every market that we're in, but obviously is our goal. But what I would say is that, I think we're much further down the path than many of our peers are and certainly, much down -- much further down the path of that strategy than we were just a number of years ago.","Operator","We will take the last question from Tulu Yunus from Nomura.","Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Let me just add my congrats to Paul and Jeff as well. Just 2 quick questions on North American revenues, actually. Firstly on Canada, can you -- thanks for the comments on the trajectory of revenue growth, I guess I was kind of curious how much of the Visa -- could you maybe give us some more detail around how much of the Visa assessments have actually really stuck around now with them being installed for several months now?","David E. Mangum","I'd be happy to. I really can't break that out. But I can tell you when assessments are introduced to a market, they become a new cost in the market for merchants. So 100% of the assessments stick around in that setting, which is why when you get to the level of Global Payments income statement, that becomes revenue as well as expense in our income statement, unless we're looking at that and saying, \"While we have worked around this, we've got to create more value. Therefore, we might mark this up a little bit.\" But 100% of that sticks around from the perspective of the assessments themselves coming from the networks.","Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Understood. I guess I was more curious around the markup associated with the assessments. Has that more or less kind of stuck around here? Or should we expect that to kind of get computed away? I mean, I guess your comments around spread is having the stabilized help answer that question potentially but more curious around like the markup, the benefit that you guys are enjoying from those fees.","David E. Mangum","Yes. I think the key way to measure competition in the market is the one you mentioned, which is what is happening, particularly with credit spreads in the market. In the Canadian market, there's no room for changes in debit spread-outs and mix. And as you can tell, we think we've been -- we've had manageable credit spread changes the last 3 quarters, culminating in one that's flat this quarter. So I think you put your finger on the right thing. In terms of how all the other pieces come together, I would just tell you that everything is tracking along with our models right now.","Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, on U.S. revenues, you're basically putting up around 6% revenue growth this quarter. With APT anniversary-ing later this year, and keeping in mind that your guidance is kind of mid- to high-single digit, how do you get there as kind of APT anniversary? I guess -- are you going to see some pickup in some of these other lines of businesses, maybe just help me get there?","David E. Mangum","Yes. I don't expect us to see a material pickup, and we don't need that in order to hit the full year expectations. We will see the ISOs, we think, bill some of the fees I was describing earlier at odd times later in the year. APT, even when it annualizes, it's still going to be growing well into the double digits. Now marry to that to some of the other channels I described earlier, the gaming, the Greater Giving, we have all the pieces to go ahead and hit this sort of mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth for the full year on top of the Q1 performance.","Paul R.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference will be recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.","Isabel Janci","Good morning, and welcome to Global Payments fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 conference call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today\u2019s conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-KT and any subsequent filings.

Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update them.","Some of the comments made on this call refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net revenue, adjusted net revenue plus network fees and adjusted earnings per share, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our trended financial highlights, both of which are available in the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Isabel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and our exceptional results for the year. 2017 was one of our best years ever as a company by nearly any measure. We sustained strong business momentum in the fourth quarter, delivering double-digit normalized organic revenue growth, 170 basis points of margin expansion, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 23%. Each of these results exceeded our expectations as well as the cycle guidance we set forth at our last Investor Day in October 2015. These results were again fueled by continued share gains across our technology-enabled businesses.","Our integrated and vertical markets and e-com and omni-solutions businesses maintained their track record of double-digit revenue growth, highlighting consistent, solid execution. We also secured significant wins and achieved substantial milestones across these businesses in the quarter.","We are delighted to announce that we have reached an agreement with Gather, a leading hospitality event management SaaS business, owned by Vista Equity Partners to be its new payments technology partner. This is the second Vista portfolio company to select Global Payments as its partner in as many quarters. And we\u2019re also very pleased to report that our e-com and omni-solutions business grew well into the double digits for the holiday season.","For calendar 2017, we delivered the fastest rates of organic revenue growth, margin expansion, and adjusted earnings per share growth in our history. These outstanding results demonstrate the underlying power of our differentiated business model, which we have continued to evolve further into software-driven, vertically fluent solutions globally. With the investments we have made to expand our capabilities in these areas over the past several years, we expect our technology-enabled channels to represent an increasingly larger proportion of our business going forward.","We are delighted to announce today an agreement with our longstanding partner, HSBC, to establish a new joint venture in Mexico. This joint venture will provide payment technology services to the fast-growing Mexican market where HSBC has a leading presence and significant merchant base. As we have successfully done with our other partnerships around the world, we intend to leverage our best-in-class technology, products and sales capabilities to drive accelerated growth. This transaction demonstrates our ongoing commitment to expanding our direct distribution into new, faster growth payments markets globally with attractive fundamentals, further distinguishing us from our peers.","We also continue to make substantial strategic investments in our ongoing businesses to provide for future growth and invest in our people, while also giving back to our communities. Our capital investment plans reflect increased investment in our next generation worldwide omni-channel platform; the rollout of our U.S. direct sales model to Canada, the United Kingdom and selected markets in Asia Pacific; further investment in cloud-based delivery models for our core products; and the accelerated rollout of software products like Xenial, outside the United States.","We also recognize how fortunate we are to be in the position we are in. To that end, as a result of the newly enacted tax reforms here in the United States, we plan to make incremental investments in our people, our technologies, and our communities this year.","For example, we plan to accelerate our investments in extending our U.S. direct sales model around the world. We also intend to invest in new career development programs and additional diversity and inclusion efforts for our people worldwide. And we plan to make incremental investments in artificial intelligence and data analytics, building on ACTIVE Networks successes in these areas. Finally, we intended double our charitable contributions to our local communities based on feedback from our employees to benefit those most in need.","In the aggregate, these significant initiatives represent a low eight-figure amount of potential investment globally. We look forward to seeing everyone in two weeks at our next investor conference here in Atlanta. We are very excited to share our vision for the Company over the next three years, building on the substantial progress since our last event in 2015. In particular, we will discuss why believe our model of technology enablement is unique within our industry, demonstrated by the sustained rate of revenue and earnings growth we have delivered since 2015 and expect to continue to produce in the future.","Before I turn it over to Cameron, I want to reiterate how delighted I am with the performance of our team worldwide that led us to delivering the best results on record in 2017. And we did this while making the necessary strategic investments in the business that will not only position us well in 2018, but will also allow us to accelerate growth for years to come. Cameron?","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was a fantastic year for Global Payments with a number of significant accomplishments to highlight. First, we largely completed integrating Heartland, exceeded our original expense savings expectations, and built a solid foundation for future revenue synergies. We also again successfully refinanced our credit facilities to optimize our capital structure and reduce expense while executing on the deleveraging plan we committed to in connection with the Heartland transaction. And we continue to meaningfully invest in expanding our software-driven, vertically fluent solutions globally, including the acquisition of the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, in the third quarter.","Importantly, we accomplished all of this while producing exceptionally strong financial performance throughout the year.","Total Company net revenue for 2017 was $3.52 billion, reflecting growth of 24% versus 2016. Normalized organic net revenue growth for the full year was low double digits, a significant achievement for our business. Operating margin in 2017 expanded 120 basis points to 29.9% and adjusted earnings per share increased 26% to $4.01 per share.","For the fourth quarter, total Company net revenue was $939 million, a 15% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 30.3% and adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $1.07.","North American net revenue was $688 million, reflecting growth of 14%. In the U.S., our direct distribution business delivered 9% normalized organic growth, led by our integrated and vertical markets business while our wholesale business saw a mid single digit decline. Canada performed in line with expectations in local currency with slightly favorable Canadian foreign currency trends adding modestly to results.","Operating margin in North America expanded 90 basis points to 30%. Margin expansion was driven by strong net revenue performance across our U.S. direct channels, in particular our higher margin, technology-enabled businesses, and the realization of expense synergies from Heartland. As expected, ACTIVE Network, slightly diminished margin expansion in North America in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality of the business.","We again saw strong performance in Europe with adjusted net revenues growing 17% in the fourth quarter, benefited by several hundred basis points of foreign currency tailwind. Spain again grew double digits in local currency, despite some disruption in the quarter from political unrest in the Catalonia region.","We also saw double-digit growth in our Erste JV as we are beginning to bring differentiated solutions to customers across our Central European markets. Our e-commerce and omni-solutions business grew well into the double digits in the quarter as we continue to penetrate the pan-European market. Operating margin in Europe expanded 190 basis points to 47.9%.","Our Asia Pacific business continued its strong performance this quarter, reporting net revenue growth of 11%. We saw solid trends across our key markets in Asia, including the Philippians, Singapore, Taiwan, and China. And Ezidebit and eWAY continued to surpass our expectations, once again contributing approximately 20% organic growth in the quarter. Operating margins in Asia expanded 410 basis points to 34.1%, primarily as a result of strong net revenue performance and the benefits of increased scale across the region.","Excluding integration costs, we generated free cash flow of approximately $261 million this quarter, bringing our total for the year to $777 million. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests. Capital expenditures totaled $45 million for the quarter.","In terms of the leverage, we ended 2017 with gross leverage of approximately 3.9 times, including the incremental debt added to fund the ACTIVE Network acquisition. Excluding this debt, our gross leverage would have been approximately 3.4 times at December 31, 2017, below the target we established when we announced the Heartland acquisition. In addition, as a result of tax reform legislation passed in December, which I will address more fulsomely in a moment, we repatriated in excess of $300 million of cash subsequent to year-end to further reduce debt. Consequently, as of today, our leverage is approximately 3.6 times.","As Jeff discussed, today, we announced the definitive agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture with HSBC in Mexico. We are delighted to further build on our long history of partnership with HSBC, this time in Mexico, an attractive growth market with strong secular fundamentals. As a result of the structure for this venture, we will not consolidate its financial results for financial reporting purposes. We expect to finalize formation of the joint venture late in 2018, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.","Before turning to our outlook for 2018, I want to provide an update on two topical items, tax reform and the adoption of ASC 606, the new revenue accounting standard.","Starting with tax reform, in Q4 2017, we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $158 million to reflect the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 passed on December 22nd. This amount included a $222 million benefit related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities, based on the new U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%. This benefit was partially offset by an incremental estimated provision of $64 million, associated with the mandatory transition tax imposed by the new tax law on our foreign earnings, not previously subjected to U.S. tax. This transition tax will be paid over the next eight years, on an interest free basis and results from the conversion of the U.S. federal system to a territorial regime.","The significant net benefit associated with the implementation of the new tax law was excluded from our adjusted earnings results for the fourth quarter. In addition to these impacts in Q4, tax reform will also serve to lower our effective tax rate going forward, as a result of the decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate. The transition to a territorial tax regime in the U.S. should also allow us to manage our global cash resources more efficiently and repatriate foreign source earnings in the future without incurring additional U.S. taxes. As a reminder, Jeff noted earlier, we do plan to reinvest a substantial portion of the benefit of lower statutory taxes in the U.S. back into the business in 2018, and our guidance for the year reflects that expectation. More to come on that in a moment.","In terms of the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018, there are three noteworthy impacts to our reporting to highlight. First, under ASC 606, we are required to report GAAP revenues net of fees paid to payment networks rather than gross, with these amounts being reflected as a cost of service, as they have been historically. Secondly, for our gaming business, revenues associated with our cash advance solutions are now required to be reported net of associated commissions paid casinos. It is worth noting that neither of these changes have any impact on operating income, net income or earnings per share. Lastly, in addition to these changes in GAAP revenue presentation, under ASC 606, we expect to capitalize slightly more customer acquisition costs than we have historically, and we\u2019ll amortize these costs over a longer period of time, which will have a modestly favorable impact on operating income in 2018.","For external reporting purposes going forward, we\u2019ll will naturally report GAAP results, reflecting ASC 606, as noted above. For non-GAAP reporting, we will now report an adjusted net revenue plus network fees metric which we believe better reflects how we manage our business and is largely consistent with our historical non-GAAP adjusted net revenue reporting convention, except with respect to the netting of gaming cash advance commissions. In addition, we will report adjusted operating margin, based on the adjusted net revenue plus network fees metrics, which again is largely consistent with our historical reporting convention.","With that as a backdrop, I would ask you to reference to slide we have provided to bridge to our outlook for 2018. ","We are delighted to provide our outlook for the year which reflects a step up in expected growth for our business. We are also providing additional transparency with respect to our North American wholesale business. We expect adjusted net revenue plus network fees to range from $3.88 billion to $3.97 billion, reflecting growth of 12% to 15% over a comparable 2017 amount of $3.45 billion.","For the sake of clarity, the netting of casino commissions reduces 2017 reported amounts by approximately $68 million and impacts 2018 by an estimated $73 million. Excluding our North American wholesale business, we expect adjusted net revenue plus network fees to grow 15% to 17% over 2017 results on a comparable basis. We expect adjusted operating margin calculated based on our adjusted net revenue plus network fees metric to expand by up to 110 basis points from our 2017 adjusted operating margin of 30.4% on a comparable basis. Adjusted operating margin expansion includes a net benefit of approximately 20 basis points, resulting from the implementation of ASC 606 success, net of the impact of reinvestment of tax reform benefit as Jeff highlighted earlier.","As a result of tax reform, we are forecasting our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% for the year, down from approximately 26.5% in 2017. Due to the timing of enactment of this new legislation and the lack of specific U.S. treasury guidance today, there remain a number of uncertainties with respect to the implementation of this new law. Our guidance reflects our best testament of the impacts on our business, but we will continue to refine this over the coming months. It is worth noting that based on our outlook for 2018 we do not currently expect any limitation to our ability to deduct interest expense from the new tax law.","Our total weighted average shares outstanding for the full year is expected to be approximately 160 million. Finally, we expect adjusted earnings per share to range from $4.95 to $5.15, reflecting growth of 23% to 28% over 2017.","With respect to the more detailed assumptions they underlie this outlook, we expect North America adjusted net revenue plus network fees to grow low teens in 2018. This reflects normalized growth in our U.S. direct channels of high single to low double digits, partially offset by our wholesale business, which we expect to decline from approximately $175 million in 2017 to a range of approximately $140 million to $145 million in 2018 due to certain wholesale customers converting from direct ISO relationships to indirect, and expected attrition during the year.","We expect Canada to grow low single digits in local currency. We expect North America adjusted operating margin to expand for the year as we continue to grow our higher margin technology-enabled business and realize the final remaining synergies associated with Heartland.","In Europe, we expect adjusted net revenue plus network fees on a local currency basis to grow high single digit. We expect favorable foreign currency tailwinds impact reported growth by a few hundred basis points. Adjusted operating margin in Europe is expected to be flat to slightly up for the year.","Asia Pacific is expected to deliver adjusted net revenue plus network fees growth in the low double digits. Adjusted operating margin is expected to expand in 2018. But now that we have achieved margins in Asia approaching the mid 30% level, we are reinvesting more back into the business to sustain growth going forward. We anticipate that we will invest $210 million in capital expenditures in 2018.","For purposes of modeling, our outlook for the year assumes, we will utilize the majority of our forecasted free cash flow to pay down debt, which will result in leverage of well below 3 times at the end of the year, which is lower than our targeted leverage ratio. Consequently, we expect to have meaningful capacity to continue to pursue our capital allocation priorities during 2018, including additional acquisitions and partnerships to advance our strategy and capital returns to shareholders. To that end, our Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization to $600 million from approximately $250 million, providing us a great deal of flexibility to return capital to shareholders as appropriate. That said, our outlook for 2018 does not include any future share repurchases.","We cannot be more pleased with our performance for 2017 and we remain excited about the momentum we have entering 2018. As our guidance for 2018 suggests, excluding our North American wholesale business, we expect to be able to deliver faster rates of top-line organic growth going forward. In addition, as a result of the substantial progress we have made in evolving our business mix, we believe we can now sustain higher rates of adjusted earnings per share growth in the future as well.","Naturally, we will discuss our long-term outlook more extensively at our investor conference, here in Atlanta, on March 1st. We will look forward to seeing you all there. Jeff?","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Cameron.","As we look forward to our investor conference next month, it is worth reflecting on just how much our business has evolved over the past several years. At our core, we no longer just deliver simple payments, we are a payments technology company that offers distinctive, defensible and comprehensive vertical specific software solutions that help merchants run their businesses more efficiently. And we seek to warp value-added services around every transaction, further deepening our relationships with our customers. We offer these technologies around the globe in more markets than our peers, in conjunction with a market-leading, unified, and compelling omni-solution. And it is these solutions that underlie our ability to continue to accelerate growth over the next several years. The best is yet to come. Isabel?","Isabel Janci","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I\u2019d like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you.","Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen & Co.","George Mihalos","Great. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask, as it relates to the fourth quarter, the 9% growth in the U.S. direct, I think that decelerated just a touch from 3Q. Just wondering if there\u2019s anything to call out there that may have impacted that number?","Cameron Bready","Hey, George, it\u2019s Cameron. Good morning. I would say nothing specific that I would call out on that front. I think, largely, it\u2019s rounding on the margin. I think, we kind of rounded up to 10% in Q3 and rounded down to 9% in Q4. We did have one less processing day in Q4 of 2017 versus Q4 of 2016. So that has a little bit of an impact on the result. But, I\u2019ll remind you, I mean, we guided our business to kind of high single digits, 7%, 8%, 9%. We produced 9% for our direct business. Overall North America, including the wholesale business was 8%, so right in the range of our expectations. So, we\u2019re pleased with that result.","If you look forward then for the guide for 2018, I think, you would clearly see that we\u2019re forecasting a step-up and acceleration of growth. Our guide contemplates12% to 15% growth on an apples-to-apples basis for 2018 versus 2017. And I would note that that reflects normalized organic growth of about 9% to 11% and for our -- excluding the wholesale business, it reflects normalized organic growth of somewhere in the 10% to 13% range. So, I think, as we\u2019re heading into 2018, we have a lot of momentum in the business from organic growth standpoint. I think, the Q4 results were solid and very much in line with our expectations, but we\u2019re obviously very excited about what we think we can produce in 2018 as well.","David Mangum","George, this is David. Maybe a little bit more color a level below that. Sales productivity remains high, the momentum is terrific, leadership is executing well, e-commerce growth, weighted double digits in the U.S. All the pieces as an execution matter are going well and set up for the acceleration that Cameron is describing.","George Mihalos","Okay. That\u2019s great color, really appreciate that. And then, just as a quick follow-up, I know, you guys have been talking about sort of maintaining high single digit organic growth in Europe. That\u2019s been the target for awhile; that\u2019s in the guide for 2018. But, should we be thinking that sort of first half growth in Europe will be stronger than back half, just given the comparisons, or maybe just any sort of cadence you can walk us through there?","Cameron Bready","Yes. Georgia, it\u2019s Cameron, again. The way to think about it is we guide Europe on a local currency basis, the high single digit rates of organic growth. Now, obviously, currency tailwinds are going to impact those results as it did in Q4. I think, you\u2019re right, as it relates to 2018, I think, our current outlook would suggest that European growth on a reported basis would be better in the first half of the year because we do expect more currency tailwinds. Obviously, given the volatility we\u2019re seeing around currency, rates, it\u2019s hard for me to predict with great precision what the back half of the year is going to look like. So, I think your overall thesis is generally right. Overall, we manage that business to local currency growth and we are forecasting for 2018 high single digit rates of local currency organic growth in Europe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the strong results.","Jeff Sloan","Thank you, Dave.","David Togut","You saw some very strong operating margin expansion in the December quarter, 190 basis points year-over-year. You\u2019ve been largely in an investment mode in Europe as you kind of work on the Erste JV. How should we think about operating leverage going forward in Europe, especially given the strong organic growth profile that you have?","Cameron Bready","Dave, it\u2019s Cameron. Let me just talk about the mathematics, and maybe I\u2019ll let Jeff comment a little bit about just the investments we\u2019re making in Europe and how we think about our business. I\u2019d remind you, that business today is margins are in the high 40% range. So, when margins are at that level, I would say we\u2019re not really anticipating a great deal of margin expansion in Europe, going forward. We\u2019d like to be able to maintain stable to slightly up margins in Europe. That is our expectation for that segment. A little bit of what you saw in Q4 was obviously lapping some of the investments that we made in the back half of 2016 as we worked to integrate Erste, as talked about previously. So, that integration is largely behind us. And obviously as a result of that, we produced strong margin expansion Q4 really on the backs of strong net revenue growth in Europe and again, just lapping those integration benefits in 2017.","As it relates to the investments we\u2019re making, I\u2019ll let Jeff comment a little bit more about how we\u2019re thinking about that business.","Jeff Sloan","Yes. Thanks Dave for the question. So, I would say, as we addressed in our prepared comments that we continue to roll out our technology enabled businesses globally. I think, Cameron in his remarks commented on the Erste joint venture and the fact that that\u2019s now into double digits. And I think that\u2019s a good template for other businesses, including when we close the HSBC new partnership, which of course will be in Mexico. But, I would say, it\u2019s a few things. We continue to take our technology and bring it overseas, make investments days in terms of new products, additional salespeople into markets that we think are faster growth. Erste, clearly in Continental Europe is a good template for that. So, we hope, we will be in Mexico when we look to close that deal later in 2018. So, if you think about our integrated and vertical markets business that we\u2019ve been bringing overseas, you think about our e-com and omni business, which historically had its genesis, overseas those are really resident [ph] and accelerating in Europe.","The other thing we mentioned, Dave, on our phone call was we\u2019re going to accelerate our investment in additional direct sales, not just here in the United States, but really around the world. We\u2019re very pleased with our existing sales folks globally, but we think there is an ability to take our direct sales model, which as you know, in the case of some of our businesses is mostly or largely commission based, and to take that model into newer markets. So, as we called out in our commentary, in 2018, we\u2019ll make incremental investments by way of bringing some of those models to markets like the United Kingdom, which is one of ones that we highlighted as part of our remarks. You throw that stuff together, Dave, we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to grow those markets at very attractive rates. These are some of the investments we\u2019re making.","David Togut","Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up, Jeff. I\u2019d be curious for your thoughts about how the merchant acceptance footprint in Europe is expanding for electronic payments, especially post interchange caps, both Visa and Mastercard have called out some expansion recently, especially in Germany?","Jeff Sloan","Yes. Dave, I think, you are exactly right and I think you\u2019ve been on this point for quite some time and really rightly so. I think, started this was SEPA, as you just alluded to. And as we\u2019ve talked about before PSD2 and now GDPR are really kind of upon us. As we said, we think that PSD2 is really directed at financial institutions and really opening up via API, the ability to get broader access into financial institution DDA accounts. As you know, we are not a bank in Europe. The way we go to market, this is like e-commerce and Realex. In Ireland, it is largely through developers and APIs. So, Dave, I think if you combine the cross-border incentives that you\u2019ve seen by lowering of cost through SEPA with the openness that we\u2019ve seen through PSD2 which is now here in 2018, that should be really nothing but good news for our business over the next number of years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan Securities.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thank you. I\u2019ll add to the Europe question. Europe you came in a little bit better than what we had. So, I\u2019m curious how healthy is the end market, especially in the UK? I don\u2019t think, Cameron, I heard any UK comments, curious competitively macro economy wise, how the UK is performing?","Cameron Bready","Yes. Tien-tsin, this is Cameron. Good morning. I\u2019ll comment maybe on the results and let Jeff talk a little bit about the environment as well. I would say, the UK in Q4 performed very much in line with our expectations. It had been for the last couple of quarters, I think, low double digit on a local currency basis, as we talked about previously. That\u2019s not our expectation for growth in the UK. It was closer to high single digits in this particular quarter with obviously about 800 basis points of currency tailwind, benefiting the overall Europe results. And that\u2019s largely driven by the pound and our performance in the UK, so high single digit performance. I would say retail sales in Q4 in UK were fairly poor overall and certainly down I think relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the course of the year. That\u2019s not an uncommon phenomenon in UK, frankly heading into the winter, so even after a strong tourism season this past summer. But, I think we would view the overall market as fairly stable. I think, we remained very pleased with how our business is performing there. We believe we continue to gain share in the market that\u2019s otherwise growing probably in the low single digit rate. We\u2019re growing at least high single digits in that market, and that\u2019s our expectation going into 2018 as well. So, I think our franchise is well-positioned. To that comments Jeff made earlier, I think we\u2019re bringing new technology, more differentiated solutions to that market that are helping us to gain share. And I think, we remain very well poised to continue to grow that business at that targeted high-single-digit rates going into 2018 and beyond.","Jeff Sloan","Yes. Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Jeff. I would say what we saw in the fourth quarter in the UK in terms of retail sales is very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2016. I think it\u2019s very similar to what Visa said about their experience with retail sales in the UK in the December time period. Nonetheless, we think we\u2019re growing at least 4 times the rate of market growth, currently in the UK. I\u2019d chop that up to a few things. First, I think, like most of the rest of the world, we really target the SMB customers. So, while we have a national business across all of the United Kingdom, we make most of our money and certainly most of our revenue and our pretax from SMB. And obviously, we\u2019re very selective by way of vertical market in terms of which SMB areas that we\u2019re in. I think, you can see that reflect in the sustained market share gains that we\u2019re seeing around the world, but in particular, in light of your question, in the United Kingdom.","The second thing, as I mentioned a few minutes ago in light of David Togut\u2019s comments, we continue to make investments in Europe, but for these purposes in the United Kingdom. So, more sales, we talk about expanding our direct sales footprint in Europe, including the United Kingdom. The UK was one of the early markets, next to Canada that we brought our integrated and vertical markets from the U.S. into, over the last number of years. And to be candid, Europe and in particular UK is where our e-com and omni business also targeted at SMB and cross-border multinationals, really is also domiciled in addition to Ireland and Spain.","So, I think, Tien-tsin, you\u2019re seeing a continued share gain in Europe and in UK on our side, really driven by the way we go to market, the investments we made and of course I\u2019ve given away a little bit of the story in a couple weeks and more to come in the Investor Day. But, I think it\u2019s a continuation of the trend that you\u2019ve seen over the last number of years.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. It\u2019s great to see. This is my quick follow-up, I know, -- just on the U.S. direct, I know we all split hairs over high single versus low double digit growth, but what is the swing factor that\u2019s maybe under your control to get you to that low double? Because, I know you are running above market. So, to get to low double, what needs to happen under your control?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Tien-tsin. So, I think we\u2019re on that trajectory already. I think, as Cameron mentioned, heading into 2018, in terms of our guidance, and obviously, we\u2019re now sitting here in February, our expectations for our U.S. direct business, as Cameron mentioned a minute ago, is high single digits, low double digits, which to be honest is probably the highest rate of guidance growth for that business that we\u2019ve ever given since I\u2019ve been at the Company for the last 8 years. So, to answer your, I think, the macro extent of your question, I really think that we\u2019re already there. Now, why are we already there and why are we accelerating that rate of growth versus history, I think it\u2019s the investments we\u2019ve made in our distribution, in our technology footprint over the last number of years. Probably over the last five years we\u2019ve invested $7 billion by way of principally M&A, but also technology investments. And of course, the U.S. at nearly three quarters of the Company is a primary -- necessarily the primary beneficiary of those investments. So, you\u2019ll hear more in a couple of weeks about the mixes and everything else. As I said in our prepared remarks, we continue to expect our mix shift to favor our technology-enabled businesses is a bigger percentage of the Company going forward. I think that\u2019s reflected in what is certainly since we\u2019ve been here, the fastest rate of organic revenue guidance in 2018 that we\u2019ve ever given.","David Mangum","Tien-tsin, this is David. Maybe to add a little more color to that, I like phrase sort of splitting hairs over this. What we see in the business is really building momentum. We have the sales force that we will expect to add on the order of 200 plus net new sales folks this coming year, all increasingly selling technology-enabled, software-driven solutions. So, we\u2019re not selling bricks on countertops. And again, I don\u2019t want to get too far than two weeks from now, but we\u2019re selling solutions to customers, that drives uniquely low merchant attrition rates, drives higher growth, obviously stickier solutions. All that\u2019s built into the kind of growth numbers that Cameron and Jeff are describing. The execution level is very high. So, rather than split hairs over sequential this and sequential that, we\u2019re growing faster than anybody in the market here at the end.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Dan Perlin","Thanks, guys. Good morning. I might have missed it, but can you just give us a number for the ACTIVE Network contribution? I know, last quarter you gave it to us, I think it was $14 million and 2 points. So, I just want to have that as a comparison reference.","Cameron Bready","Yes. It was around the midpoint of the range that we had provided to you previously, going into the quarter, Dan, which was 40 to 45.","Dan Perlin","Okay. And then, for stake kind of helping us with this positive mix shift, are you -- and maybe we\u2019re jumping ahead on the Analyst Day, but, would you break down a little bit in terms of the contribution within North America, the percentage mix? So, you gave us wholesale, which is dropping 20%. And so, I\u2019m also interested to know kind of little more dynamics of what\u2019s driving that conversion, direct to indirect, but more specifically just helping that so we can guide our models to this positive mix shift. So, I think we got one component of it with wholesale. I think we need the other two a little bit. Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve given you the wholesale number for North America. Canada, I think, you have a pretty good sense as to what Canada contributes annually in terms of U.S. dollar revenue, just north of $300 million; the rest is our U.S. direct business. It\u2019s really not a lot more complicated than that. And if you think about the U.S. direct business, it\u2019s obviously a combination of our integrated and vertical markets business which we target low double digit growth for that channel. And if you think about the remainder, it\u2019s going to be more of our traditional direct sales force, but today, at this point, more and more selling technology-enabled, software-driven solutions as well. That business, we target high single to low double. And that\u2019s our expectation kind of going into 2018. So, you roll all that together and you\u2019re going to get a North American business, ex wholesale that we\u2019ve been just poised to grow at the high -- very high single digit level or the low double digit level, going into 2018, which again is above the rate of expectation that we\u2019ve had for that business historically.","Jeff Sloan","I\u2019d also say Dan that -- on your question about the ISOs, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a few things. First, first for a number of years, as you\u2019ve heard from us, we\u2019ve had ISOs convert on us from ISO related contracts in a way they sell technologies into what we call indirect customers, where they really buy our technologies wholesale. So, part of the assumption of decline is just a continued mix shift among the ISOs that are existing customers that ISOs will just convert over to our existing customers as indirect, and that\u2019s been a continuation of trend.","The second thing I\u2019d say is, well, I think, we\u2019ll always have an element of the ISO business within Global Payments. What I\u2019ll say is that increasingly we are not signing new ISOs to the customer. When contracts come up with existing ISOs, we choose not to renew on number of those. So, I would say, Dan, it\u2019s really a combination of conversion from one type of customer to another, which impacts our revenue, and that\u2019s been happening for a period of time, combined with us focusing on the direct distribution that we\u2019ve spent $7 billion on investing in terms of where we\u2019re signing up new accounts.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene","Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a question. In the press release, you talked about raising growth target, given your business mix and more of your technology solutions and investments. And Cameron referenced it as well. Certainly, clearly you\u2019re going to talk about it more at the Analyst event. But, could you just give a little bit more color what you are thinking and why you\u2019re sort of confident in that, and what do you sort of mean by raising growth targets?","Cameron Bready","Sure, Glenn, it\u2019s Cameron. I\u2019ll kind of kick it off. And again, I think, to your point, we\u2019re cautious about getting ahead of ourselves with respect to the March 1st Investor Day. We don\u2019t want to give you guys a reason not to attend. Kidding. But, I think as we tried to set up in the script and in some of the commentary today and all of this, I think is reflected in our guidance for 2018, given the success we\u2019ve had in shifting our business mix over the last several years, continuing to drive more technology-enabled, software-driven solutions in our business, our e-com, and omni-channel successes around the globe and how again we\u2019re utilizing our sales force more and more to sell these differentiated product suites, as well as the fact that we continue to move away and our wholesale business continues to decline as a portion of the overall company. We feel like we are in a position to be able to raise our expectations for organic growth on a topline basis for the Company going forward. Historically, as you\u2019ll recall that\u2019s been high single digit since the merger with Heartland back in 2015, so call that 7, 8, 9. Clearly, that number is going to 15, but we certainly think it\u2019s going to go to a number of 7, 8, 9. We\u2019ll give a little more color around that when we get to the investor conference in a couple of weeks.","I\u2019d also note that we think about our business kind of ex that wholesale business. We\u2019re going to wind that down over a period of time. As Jeff highlighted, we don\u2019t sign new ISOs. We\u2019re not renewing ISOs typically as they come up for renewal. And obviously, we have a handful of ISOs which is becoming more and more of a trend that are moving from direct relationships with us to indirect relationships with us. So that business is going to continue to shrink. So, we think about the business we\u2019re managing is really, ex that ISO wholesale channel in North America, and we think the investments we\u2019ve made are going to position us to drive higher rates organic growth above that 7, 8, 9 that we\u2019ve been able to deliver historically. Even including the ISO business, as you flow that through then to earnings, we think we\u2019re in a position to drive sustained rates of adjusted earnings per share growth above what we\u2019ve been targeting historically which is mid teens.","Again, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re trying to compound 25% earnings growth annually. We\u2019d love to be in a position to do that. But certainly, we think that we can deliver on a sustained basis adjusted earnings per share growth above that mid teen level going forward, and we think that\u2019s a very attractive, obviously opportunity for investors. Our ability to sustain and compound adjusted earnings per share growth saying that high teens level I think is a very -- creates a very attractive opportunity for this business as we look into 2018 and beyond. So, to your point earlier, a lot more to comment at the investor conference. We think our guide for 2018 directionally gives a good sense as to where we see this business going over the course of time and we look forward to sharing lot more detail in a couple of weeks.","Jeff Sloan","Yes. Glenn, it\u2019s Jeff. I would just add on to that. I know there is a bunch of moving with the ASC implementation and everything else. I think, there is very good schedule that Cameron\u2019s team posted on our website about apples-to-apples comparisons. Cameron hit it head-on. This is the fastest rate of organic revenue growth for 2018 that we\u2019ve guided to you collectively since this group has been here by way of revenue and the like. That is not an accident and well above the 7 to 9, for those purposes of actually including the ISOs within it and well above the 7 to 9 number that we talked back in our last cycle guide, historically. I think Cameron said in his prepared remarks including the ISO business reflect 9 to 11 on an organic basis the rest being ACTIVE to get you 12 to 14. So, I think you put that together Glenn, you look at 9 to 11 revenue guide organically for 2018 on a model historically that we told you the 7 to 9, having just finished the year what was low double digits as I said in the introductory and my comments in the press release, it makes us feel pretty good about where we\u2019re heading.","Glenn Greene","That\u2019s very helpful. So, my follow-up question maybe for Jeff would be the JV with HSBC. Just a little bit more color around that? What do they bring to the table, how much do you put do you pay to buy into the JV, any other help you could give us in terms of sizing it?","Jeff Sloan","So, Glenn, I will start and ask David to comment a little bit more of the detail of the market in Mexico. So, first, we\u2019re delighted to announce the entry of Mexico. For long time, of course, we viewed ourselves by the name of Global, as a global company. Yet sitting here in the United States, we were not in all of North America. So, Mexico, going back to Paul\u2019s days, was always a target for us. And we couldn\u2019t be more pleased to have HSBC as our long-term partner. I think, they\u2019ve been a partner for ours in various forms for half a century, which is how old our Company is through 2017, so yet another partnership, following on the heels with HSBC in the United Kingdom, in Asia Pacific and now in Mexico. The other thing I\u2019ll say is that it\u2019s a two partnership and that is 50-50. We\u2019re both extremely excited about the growth opportunities of the market in Mexico where we have a significant presence. And as a result we\u2019re going to share the upside and opportunities as equal partners together. David, do you want to go through some of the details\u2026","David Mangum","Yes, happy to. I think, it starts, Glenn, with what Jeff said, which is we\u2019re just thrilled to partner with HSBC around the world. This puts us in something on the order of 15 markets around the world where we partner with HSBC. And as you know from our Asia and our UK results, it\u2019s been nothing but wildly successful for the last, I won\u2019t say the 50 years, because I haven\u2019t been around for all those, at least the last kind of 11 or so, you can count from the original Asia deal the Company did back in 2006. So, we think that partnership, that marriage of Global Payments and HSBC, in market a like Mexico where you\u2019ve got 125 million somewhat folks in the population, nominal GDP is what 12th or 15th in the world, something along those lines, high growth GDP and a partner where we know how to work and partner together, this is a great partner that got sort of the fifth largest branch presence on the order of 1,000 in major economic areas, your Guadalajaras, your Monterreys as well as Mexico City itself, lots of ATMs, lots of regional presence, really good business banking and small business franchise, which as you know is core to what we do around the world. So, we love the presence, like the pieces of it, a nice SME merchant presence already which we can grow. So, all those piece are there. What we plan to do is go apply our U.S. direct sales methodology, U.S. direct sales methods and techniques to the Mexican market. There is nice electronic payments growth, currently not a ton of credit card penetration but nice debit card penetration. So, pretty good model for what we like to do with HSBC, go chase small and medium business, go do it with our U.S. sales model, marry to the partnership with HSBC. We\u2019re pretty excited about.","Cameron Bready","And Glenn, just on your last comment, our investment in the joint venture is going to be less than $50 million. So, it\u2019s a relatively nominal investment for us to have the opportunity and to partner with HSBC. To David\u2019s point, we\u2019ve been very successful with them over the course of a very long period of time in a market that we think has very attractive secular fundamentals going forward. So, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased to be entering that market in the way that we\u2019re doing it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I appreciate the forward commentary; you guys are obviously receiving very good, which is great to hear. At your last Investor Day, you rooted your growth rate to the economic cycle kind of calling up a single as a mid-cycle. What I\u2019m hearing now is not so much a reference to the economic cycle and more about company-specific positioning. So, is that the correct conclusion? Am I hearing that right? And if so, one of the big things you\u2019ve done obviously is the integrated in vertical. Can you kind of root the conclusion that you\u2019re reaching to the relative opportunity penetration into new markets and things like that, I mean for integrated?","Jeff Sloan","Ashwin, it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll start with that. It\u2019s a very good question. I would say, to step back for a second, at the highest level you can think of, we still chase GDP. So, I think as David alluded to, when he talks about the opportunity in Mexico, we certainly look at the demographics and economic statistics of a market before we decide to go enter in, I think Mexico, there is no different. That\u2019s probably the highest level. Healthy growing economies are very important, not just to our business but to Visas, Mastercards, PayPal, go down the list, obviously that\u2019s an important thing.","I would say though, you asked a very insightful question on how do we think about the markets, the vertical markets now that we\u2019ve been chasing. And I think you\u2019re right in what you said. I think at the end of the day, most of our vertical markets on investments, and now I\u2019m thinking about dental and veterinary and some of the areas that have really been core for us at Global Payments including a school, K-12, and university. I would say in general, those are somewhat decoupled from the macro environment, certainly relative to the last Investor Day in 2015. So, you think about an integrated and vertical markets business today that you\u2019ll hear in a couple of weeks, is about $1.2 billion in size. And you think about a lot of that now being in the markets that you would say are somewhat less sensitive because your schools, universities, dental and veterinary and healthcare, for dietary, et cetera that hopefully are less correlated to the overall rate of accelerating economic growth around the world.","Having said that though, much like Visa and Mastercard, it is incredibly important that we would be in a healthy economy. And I\u2019ll tell you that probably for the first time, Cameron, in the last few years, probably the last six to nine to 12 months, every market we\u2019re in globally has been growing. That wasn\u2019t true for a period of time in parts of China, that wasn\u2019t true in Brazil and Russia and some other markets. But that has been true. And I think undoubtedly, Ashwin, we\u2019ve been the beneficiary of some of that.","But I would say, today the movement toward a software model, movement toward SaaS model and movement toward vertical markets that are largely card present, the lack of exposure to big box and grocery and specialty apparel is very important in thinking about the sustainability of our business. That\u2019s why, if you go back to what Cameron said in light -- on Glenn\u2019s question about the cycle that you\u2019ll hear more in a couple of weeks, yes, it\u2019s the investments in our businesses, it\u2019s mix shift that does give us confidence in giving the best forward look for 2018 by way of revenue growth that we\u2019ve ever given while we\u2019re seven or eight years into an expansionary economy here in the United States, which is three quarters of our business.","David Mangum","Ashwin, this is David. I think what you\u2019re also hearing is increasing confidence, given our execution at being able to globalize the solutions Jeff described. Integrated payments with which you\u2019re familiar with over the years, but increasingly the software solutions. Our revenue synergy tracker alone this year where we did deliver over 50 basis points of growth that we talked about, and we\u2019re on track for the over 100 basis points of growth for 2018, all fuels this increase. And we\u2019re selling the software solutions we own in markets around the world, great track record there. We already know about the globalizing of integrated payments, increasing these more and more enriched solutions with analytics and other services on top, again, uniquely globalizing those types of things.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Thank you for that. So, I guess, look to be hearing more about that on Investor Day. Quick follow-up is back on that synergy comment that you had. Does that take into account any pricing impact? How are you thinking about the pricing in the Heartland client base?","Jeff Sloan","Yes. Ashwin, it really does not the way we traditionally use pricing. So, just to be clear, we have not done what -- as we said would not, have not done broad-based repricing of Heartland, which by the way is consistent if you go back to 2015. What we\u2019ve talked about and I think David has mentioned this many times. What we talked about is charging fairly for value that we\u2019re creating. So, that means when we\u2019re introducing new analytics and new data products, of course, those should be really coming in at market. That means when existing customer relationships reach the end of the maturity of their initial contractual terms, understanding where the market is at that point of time. And to be clear, we have not done those things yet at Heartland, whether it\u2019s the fourth quarter of 2017 or since we\u2019ve been partner since April of 2016. So, there has really been none of that in the results that you\u2019ve seen today. On a go forward basis, of course, we certainly intend to manage it as we said all along, much closer to where we think the market will be going forward and the types of things that we would do, what I just suggested around contracts that come up for maturity, moving them closer to market that has not in fact occurred to date.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.","Dave Koning","Yes. So, I have I guess just two numbers questions. The first one being if we exclude tax reform, it seems like that\u2019s maybe a 5% to 6% EPS benefit, so core EPS 18% to 22%, in that ballpark. Is that kind of what you are thinking?","Cameron Bready","I think you\u2019re pretty close there, Dave. I would put it right around 20, at the midpoint.","Dave Koning","Okay. So, nicely above cycle guidance?","Cameron Bready","That\u2019s right.","Jeff Sloan","I would say nicely above current cycle guidance, Dave.","Dave Koning","Got you. Okay, great. And I guess, secondly, your free cash flow conversion in a group of great free cash flow across FinTech, yours is like way above anybody else, a 125% of adjusted net income. Is that sustainable? Maybe not at that level, but above earnings, is that sustainable?","Cameron Bready","Yes, I think, it is. I mean, we feel very good about our ability to convert obviously EBITDA into free cash flow of the business, and I think 2017 is evidence of that. I think, if we look at 2018 and beyond, I think, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to convert it at fairly high pace. As our CapEx guidance suggests for 2018, we are reinvesting a fair amount back into the business. Our guide is $210 million off of I think an actual of around 185 for 2017. So, we continue to invest in the business. And I think that\u2019s a very important thing to highlight. We\u2019re not producing these results by virtue of starving the business. We\u2019re investing in technology, we\u2019re investing in solutions, we\u2019re globalizing these solutions, we\u2019re globalizing unique distribution capabilities. We\u2019re doing all this at a time when we\u2019re still producing exceptionally strong financial results, investing in the business for future growth. And I think that\u2019s a big part of what underlies our confidence and the ability to grow the business at the level that we\u2019re forecasting going into 2018 and beyond.","If you take our 2018 guide even at the midpoint and you overlay that, a little bit of a commentary you heard today around cycle guidance or adjusted earnings per share growth going forward, it\u2019s not hard to see something close to or at maybe 6 in 2019. As a reminder, we did 3.19 for 2016. So, almost 90% growth over a three-year period; that\u2019s pretty attractive compounded earnings growth for a business of this nature. I don\u2019t know anybody else with a similar characteristic business putting out that type of growth.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question for today comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Jeff, I\u2019m pretty encouraged to see the kind of growth you\u2019re putting up especially in Europe. I\u2019m wondering if you could contrast where Europe is in terms of its evolution around ISV and omni as compared to the U.S. In other words, to the extent the U.S. maybe is a little more mature than it\u2019s been as ISVs have been around for a while longer. How is Europe -- how does that compare and how much longer might runway of this kind of really impressive growth last as you look out over the next few years?","Jeff Sloan","Great, question, Andrew. So, what I would say is, I typically think that Europe is really just being in a first inning of ISV, VAR penetration. The size of those economies, the maturity of technology in Europe as well as in Asia for that matter, really, puts it at the very beginning of the game. The way I could think about it, Andrew, is if Global Payments were a public company on the FTSE, we\u2019re probably one of the two or three largest technology companies listed in the United Kingdom. I think we\u2019re doing great here, but we\u2019re somewhere in the S&P 500, and it\u2019s probably not in top 100. And that gives you a sense of size by way of market value as to how those two markets compare.","So, I would say, we\u2019re in the first inning. I think we\u2019ve been in ISV VAR land in Europe. I think we\u2019ve been successful in taking our integrated and vertical markets businesses from the United States, we\u2019re net exporter of those businesses into Canada and then into the UK and into Europe. The e-com and omni businesses have already been domiciled there historically because of common purchasing area that you see in the EU, even though there are different countries pre and post SEPA. But we\u2019re very early on there. By way of comparison, I\u2019d say the U.S., maybe we\u2019re in the fifth inning of ISV VAR land. And I would also say that our ability to continue growth in the United States, I said this in my prepared remarks, but another double digit organic revenue performance in integrated and vertical markets, the vast majority of which is here in the United States in the fourth quarter. And as Cameron said for our guide, obviously we expect to continue to try to guide to the low to mid-teens organic numbers for 2018 when the U.S. is three quarters of the company, of course, that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from. But I would say, here in the United States, it\u2019s a little different and answer to your question is the only software model.","So, I think where we\u2019ve been distinctive and we\u2019ll talk about this on March 1st is, with a great market share gains, call it 2x the rate plus of market growth in our partner model. But now the own, the whole vertical stack of opportunities in the United States and we\u2019ll look to export that, Andrew, not just to Europe, but also to Asia. In fact, I think as David has mentioned, bringing our Campus Solutions, TouchNet into the United Kingdom where we have a very large share of universities are ready, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve done, bringing our Xenial restaurant hospitality business into cloud from the United States into Europe, it\u2019s something that we have been doing and have done. So, I think we have the ability by way of some of the owned assets to really catalyze, Andrew, a bit of growth in Europe. I think there is no denying that we\u2019re probably in the first inning in Europe with where that technology stuff is, yet we\u2019re still growing at 4x the rate of market growth today.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. That\u2019s great detailed answer. And just a quick follow-up, can you comment a little bit on the cadence perhaps of just the wins? Is it one a quarter; is this how we should expect going forward?","Cameron Bready","Yes. Andrew, it\u2019s Cameron. Good morning. I don\u2019t know that I would put a particular sort of targeted cadence around those opportunities. I think, as we indicated when we announced that arrangement back in our second quarter earnings call, we feel very good about the portfolio of companies that they have. We feel obviously encouraged about our ability to continue to provide differentiated technology enabled payment solutions to those businesses. And we think we have a nice pipeline building with them. But again, we feel as if we have to earn every one of those opportunities. Every arrangement is a unique arrangement with one of their portfolio companies. I think, we have the right cadence around how we\u2019re approaching those conversations. But, I don\u2019t want to put a particular target as to how we\u2019re going to continue to build on the successes we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters. Obviously, it\u2019d be nice to do at least one a quarter, but our focus is really on making sure we can demonstrate a value proposition to those companies that works for them and making sure we\u2019re doing it on economic terms that work for us. And I think we\u2019ll continue to have a lot of success with that.","Jeff Sloan","On behalf of Global Payments, thank you very much for your interest in joining our call this morning.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Investor Relations, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane M. Forbes","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Global Payments Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Conference Call. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour. Joining me on the call are Paul Garcia, Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sloan, President; and David Mangum, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary, which are discussed in our public releases, including our most recent 10-K. We caution you not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call.","In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these results more clearly reflect comparative operating performance.","For a full reconciliation of cash earnings to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K dated today, September 27, 2012, which may be located under the Investor Relations area on our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now I'd like to introduce Paul Garcia. Paul?","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, Jane. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon.","We met our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, and we are on target to achieve our full year financial expectations. Revenue grew 9% in the first quarter to $590 million, resulting in cash earnings per share of $0.87. On a constant currency basis, revenue and cash earnings per share grew 12% and 3%, respectively. I'm pleased to note that the 2 previously announced acquisitions, namely the U.S.-based Accelerated Payment Technologies, or APT, and the purchase of HSBC's 44% ownership interest in our Asia-Pacific joint venture, are both expected to close in the second quarter. We also anticipate increasing our borrowing capacity by up to $850 million, which David will take you through in just a moment.","I think the benefits of the Asia-Pacific transaction are obvious, as it allows us to execute our long-term expansion strategy. As APT was just announced in August, it represents a significant investment. I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the strategic benefits of this acquisition.","APT is an innovative provider of fully integrated technology payment solutions for small to medium-sized merchants. This deal allows us to add a very profitable, defensible, high growth, direct distribution channel. APT markets its products through a network of 700 value-added resellers, or VARs, covering 30 verticals. Integrated payment solutions are a tremendous growth area for small to medium-sized merchants which, of course, is our sweet spot. These merchants value customized solutions that streamline back-office operations like scheduling, inventory, record management and billing, to name a few. APT seamlessly integrates a payment module into software solutions for vertical markets, including dental, medical, pharmacy, specialty retail, automotive and veterinary. Growth will be fueled by ongoing organic trends, adding new merchants via existing VAR partners and through establishing new VAR relationships. Importantly, once these relationships are established, the business tends to be very sticky, resulting in low attrition rates.","As we have had a long-standing relationship with APT and process approximately 90% of their volumes, there is little to no integration risk. In summary, APT has sustained excellent margins and a loyal customer base while leveraging industry-leading technology. We look forward to welcoming the APT team to Global Payments.","I'll now turn the call over to David. David?","David E. Mangum","Thank you, Paul. As we expected, currency changes were a headwind during the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. For the total company, currency changes negatively affected revenues and cash earnings by about $16 million and $0.04 per share, respectively, with the most significant impact due to movements against the euro, Canadian dollar and the British pound. North America Merchant Services delivered revenue growth of 13% in the quarter, driven by U.S. transaction growth of 12%. Canada's revenue declined 8% in local currency on a year-over-year basis. This reflects ongoing pressure on spreads, partially offset by transaction growth of 3%. Canada delivered about what we expected from an income contribution perspective.","For the quarter, North America cash operating income, or EBIT dollars, were $71.4 million, a decline of 4% primarily due to Canadian performance, an unfavorable Canadian exchange rate and an increase in technology spending, partially offset by profit growth in our U.S. business. The resulting operating margin in North America was 16.7%.","International revenue was slightly below prior year, primarily due to foreign currency exchange rates across all currencies. On a local-currency basis, Europe performed well, especially given current macroeconomic conditions, driven by revenue growth in the United Kingdom and Russia. Spain grew modestly on a local-currency basis, which was impressive given that this quarter we annualized a joint venture marketing free true up from last year's first quarter. For the quarter, Asia-Pacific revenue grew 1% over last year's first quarter and delivered its expected income contribution for the quarter. International cash operating income in total of $65 million was down 1%, and of course was affected by currency translation. Operating margin of 39.8% was about flat with prior year. Remember that the Q1 2012 margin included over 100 basis points of margin benefit from the marketing free true-up in Spain.","Our first quarter GAAP and cash tax rates were 31.4% and 31.8%, respectively. We continue to expect that both the GAAP and cash effective tax rates to be about 29% of the full year of fiscal 2013, with lower quarterly rates for the remainder of the year. We generated free cash flow of $44 million, down from $67 million in the prior year primarily due to cash outflows related to the processing system intrusion and the timing of capital expenditures. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement, assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests.","During the quarter, capital expenditures were $29 million, primarily related to the data center and infrastructure initiatives and intrusion remediation activities. And we continue to anticipate our full year fiscal capital expenditures will total about $110 million. Our total available cash, including working capital at the end of the first quarter, was approximately $275 million. Regarding our data intrusion remediation efforts, we are on track to hit our target of completing our remediation efforts to our processing systems by calendar year end. First quarter pretax charges related to this initiative totaled $24 million and included investigation costs, incentive payments to certain business partners, remediation costs and professional fees. We continue to anticipate that for the full year of 2013, intrusion costs will total about $55 million to $65 million or a net expense of $25 million to $35 million after expected insurance proceeds of $28 million are applied. This, of course, includes the $24 million amount we recorded in the first quarter.","Under our stock repurchase program, for September 26 we have purchased a total of 280,000 shares at an average price of just over $42 per share for a total of about $12 million. $138 million remains outstanding $150 million authorization. In the next few days, we anticipate closing a new senior unsecured term loan of up to $700 million and to increase our existing revolving line of credit by as much as $150 million for a total increase in capacity of $850 million. We appreciate the support of our partners and want to thank them for their efforts as we complete this transaction. After the imminent close of the APT acquisition, we will have over $700 million of dry powder for acquisitions and ongoing share repurchases.","Now given all the moving parts, including the acquisitions and the new financing, I thought it would be helpful to review the details of our outlook for 2013, incorporating these new items. We continue to expect annual fiscal 2013 revenue to range from $2.36 billion to $2.4 billion, reflecting 7% to 9% growth on a reported basis and 8% to 10% growth on a constant currency basis.","We continue to expect revenue growth in the United States of low double digits, and we expect Canada to decline slightly in local currency. We continue to anticipate total international revenues will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in U.S. dollars. That includes mid-single-digit growth in local currency in the United Kingdom and Spain. We expect the Czech Republic's revenue in local currency to be about flat, with Russia growing over 20% in local currency. When you translate this performance into U.S. dollars, this results in low-single-digit growth in a difficult macro environment in Europe. Then in Asia-Pacific, we expect high single to low-double-digit revenue growth. We continue to expect foreign currency to negatively affect cash earnings per share this year by approximately $0.08, assuming downward pressure from all currencies with the most significant impact coming from the euro. We expect APT to be about neutral to cash earnings per share in fiscal 2013.","Given that we currently process over 90% of APT's volume, our revenue expectations already include the impact of this acquisition. We also expect APT to add about 70 basis points to North America margins and approximately 50 basis points to the total company operating margin of fiscal 2013. So we now expect overall company cash operating margins to decline a little over 100 basis points on a reported basis.","We now anticipate our Asia-Pacific acquisition will close a little later in the second quarter. However, the impact of this delay on cash earnings will be offset by the positive impact of the small share repurchases we've executed to date.","Interest and other expense from the new financing has already been factored into our Asia and APT financial expectations. So in summary, based on these current assumptions, we continue to expect our cash earnings per share to be in the range of $3.59 to $3.66, reflecting 2% to 4% growth over fiscal 2012. On a constant currency basis, we expect revenue to grow 8% to 10%, and cash earnings per share to grow 4% to 6% over fiscal 2012.","As a reminder, this outlook does not include the impact of any future share repurchases.","We've updated our fiscal 2013 GAAP earnings per share expectation to include the impact of the APT acquisition. Based on preliminary purchase accounting estimates, we expect APT to be about $0.23 dilutive to fiscal year 2013 GAAP earnings per share. We now anticipate GAAP earnings per share, excluding the impact of all intrusion remediation costs to be in the range of $2.99 to $3.06.","And one final note. In the next couple of days, we will be filing an amendment to our 2012 10-K to correct clerical errors in a couple of places in the original filing. There will be no changes to the financial statements or related disclosures. The revised filing will include an explanatory note that will point you to the changes.","And I will turn the call back to Paul.","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, David. I am pleased with our company's financial performance, our global market position and our execution on strategic initiatives such as a recent announcement to allow our merchants to accept PayPal at the point-of-sale. We have strengthened our U.S. direct business with the APT acquisition and we intend to aggressively expand our Asia-Pacific presence.","In closing, I am confident that we are on track to successfully execute our strategies for growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Jane. Jane?","Jane M. Forbes","Thanks, Paul. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to 1 and 1 follow-up in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you and operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jim Kissane with Credit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","David, can you give a little more color on the outlook in Canada? It sounds like you're expecting the decline to moderate somewhat for the balance of the year? I'm just trying to get a sense in terms of why you expect that to decline? Are you seeing real stability up there, because it doesn't look like that in the -- in just the quarter just passed?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes. I don't think we're expecting fundamental changes in sort of the core spread declines, Jim, on an organic basis. And I'll turn this over to Jeff in a second to talk about the market, what we're seeing there. What you will see though, as the year goes on, first off, is less pressure year-over-year from a currency perspective, which will, assuming like a big difference in the reported outlook in U.S. dollars. In addition, we have a couple of different actions, again I'll let Jeff add color to this, working on some products, pricing and also some sales actions over the course of the year to begin to have a little more impact in Q3 and Q4. But again, really nothing fundamental changing in terms of the trajectory and some of the ongoing pressures. There's some things around the edges that help ameliorate things later in the year.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, thanks, David. Jim, it's Jeff. If you recall, there was a quarter last year where we really felt like the spread diminution got ahead of us. I think we've done a nice job and I think David's commentary reflects this, taking a very good view about what spread trends are likely to be for the year, and that's encompassed in our -- in David's guidance today. So as we said in the July call, we do expect Canada to be a modest headwind for this fiscal year, and we've done a few things just to be more specific. First, we had some reductions that we took at the end of last fiscal year, and we'll get the full year impact of that throughout fiscal '13. Second, we continue to see new good sales trends for new direct revenue signings, Jim, in Canada. Those will help as we go throughout the year so we're happy with that, as well as additional product introductions. And then selectively, throughout the year, price actions. So when I think you come to a good view on where spread is likely to continue to trend with the advantage of some of the things we've done last year and some good sales efforts this year, we feel comfortable with the guidance that David reiterated. And as you mentioned, in his prepared remarks, we did end up about as expected on income contribution for the quarter.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Jeff, is it all spread compression? Or is it an increase in client attrition? So a decline in the retention in Canada, as a result of pricing and more competition up there, what's the mix of that?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Well, thanks for pointing that out, Jim. Actually, attrition in Canada has declined fairly markedly in our Canadian business. I think, as I mentioned on some previous calls, I'm glad you raised it, we put in place a fair amount of analytics by way of framework around value-added customers, and we actually have seen a decline most recently in attrition, and that's part of our outlook that, that continue. And is part of the reason why we're giving the guidance we're giving for the rest of the fiscal year.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just one last question, I'm sorry, Jane. Jeff, do you see the light at the end of the tunnel in Canada?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Well, I think what we've seen is the spread diminution persist, and we're going to make sure that we avoid some of the pitfalls, Jim, that we had last year, where we assume that we're really moderate and instead what I think we're doing is managing for that continued scenario, and if we're presently surprised, then that's a happy outcome for everybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just following Jim's question around Canada, just maybe the products, I'm assuming it's things like DCC, I mean, how are those things sort of testing in marketplace? And then just on the pricing side, I think historically, that's usually come together with rule changes or any change adjustments. I don't -- I didn't see any big changes, maybe I missed it. So I'm curious what the strategy is around the price in Canada.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Tien-Tsin, it's Jeff. I'll start. And David obviously, and Paul can jump in. First on the pricing changes, there really has not been a meaningful interchange change from the networks in Canada for, I believe, 3 years now. Tien-Tsin, that's a environment we've been living in for quite some time, and have taken selective actions as you know, over the last few years in that landscape. So we're not anticipating, Tien-Tsin, that, that change at all, and that been imbibed in our commentary and David's commentary about our outlook for the -- for fiscal '13. That's your second question first. On your first question, we have introduced DCC into the marketplace in Canada. I can tell you that, that product is running ahead of our expectations at this point, which was part of my explanation to Jim in his questioning. And we hope and expect that to continue in Canada. We're also looking at introducing other new products and customers in different segments use that marketplace in fiscal '13. So I feel good about where we are. It's really the small, medium-sized business spread diminution, coupled with a relatively difficult macroeconomic climate in that region. But we're managing for that, and I think we managed it well in the first quarter.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful.  Thanks, Jeff. And then just, I guess a bigger picture question around APT and ISOs and flying in some of those ISOs. I know the VAR channel's quite attractive, and that's a good asset. But I'm curious in general what the ISO reaction has been to you buying Accelerated here, and I know there's been lot of chatter about other portfolios potentially coming to market and whether or not, if that's something you -- we should consider global -- putting -- committing more capital to doing and potentially bring in more ISOs down the road? Just a bigger question around that, did that make sense?","Paul R. Garcia","Okay, Tien-Tsin, this is Paul. The APT deal was unique in that there are really not a lot of companies that we're familiar with that fit that profile. The reaction from our ISO customers has been, I think, the correct one. And that is, they know this has no impact on their relationship with us. There's no impact on their relationship with existing or potential customers. And they're in no way disadvantaged at all. In fact, it's possible they may take up some additional services and offerings out of this deal as we understand more about what we can do with this asset. So the reaction has been pretty much, really, not much of a reaction at all, quite frankly. Now so and also to be clear what we would -- do you expect us to do more of these deals, I think it's probably unlikely we're going to be actively participating in other ISO opportunities because once again, this was something that was unique.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Roman Leal from Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess as a follow-up to Tien-Tsin's. What -- can you help us understand what are some of the, I guess, the potential uses of capital and -- I know it's hard to answer the question, but $700 million is a lot of dry powder, and more curious on the timing, just happens to coincide with a lot of chatter on the ISO front. But maybe help us understand what you're hearing elsewhere.","David E. Mangum","So Roman, this is David, I'll take the first part, maybe pass it off to Paul for a bit more color on the second. What you're seeing us do with the term loan and the addition to the revolving line of credit is indeed resetting the capital structure and resetting our dry powder. What that does is give us the flexibility to go forward, to continue to pursue our growth strategies, organic, inorganic, so more acquisitions, but also to pursue share buybacks as we talked to you before about being opportunistic with us, we obviously have a current authorization of $150 million, you heard in the prepared comments we've used just a small bit of that because we are circumspect during the quarter on the way to actually getting close to executing the financing I described in the prepared comments. So what this really does is allow to pursue what we've described to you for some time in terms of capital strategy, continued organic pension, continued focus on acquisitions that bring us at to some version near-term accretion and\/or our long-term growth opportunities, married to consistent buybacks, opportunistic or just routine, in order to offset dilution. So we're on track to do all of those things, and really pleased to execute that in the middle of a lot of complexity around the company. So very happy with the way all these pieces have come together, having the imminent close of APT married to that all works very nicely for us. Add a little more color, Paul?","David E. Mangum","Yes, thanks, David. Roman, I think your point about the chatter. I think we should be worried about ISOs that potentially could be looking for a transaction.  I would tell you, it is a rare ISO and I would speak for ours, I know some of them that aren't ours. It's a rare ISO that isn't for sale at the right price. This is some more overt action that takes place from time-to-time. But I would tell you it is to be expected. And quite frankly, although you never say never, I am not -- I would not tell you to expect us to be actively engaged in any of those processes.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, thanks. And maybe for Jeff, obviously was a big announcement out of Brazil with the Redecard acquisition. Just curious to hear your thoughts on how that changes, if at all, your strategy there?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, thanks, Roman. So just to give a quick update on Brazil. As a reminder, we're still licensing with the networks where we're heading toward the tail end of that process in licensing, and moving on to certification. I think one happy change with the Redecard transaction is that we are seeing a higher level of interest among potential bank partners in that market to pursue outsourcing, a JV or other relationships with us. For the sheer reason that they do view now, Redecard really is being a part of another financial institution. I think it's one thing to be owned by a number of financial institutions for banking products, and it's another to be owned by one, especially a large one, so we certainly have seen a pickup in interest, Roman, in the last number of months from the financial institutions in Brazil and having an active dialogue with us, which is consistent with what we thought, and it's good news.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And is there any update on the potential timing of getting your licenses, which I think is maybe the last hurdle there? And then also, maybe -- sorry if I missed this, but on the tax rate, it was a little higher than we had expected in this quarter. What was the cost of that? And I guess the implications are that the tax rates are going to be a little bit lower for the next few quarters?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, I'll start, Roman. It's Jeff.","Paul R. Garcia","By the way for the record, that was just one follow-up.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Roman, it's Jeff. I'll talk with the Brazil question. I think David will tell you about the tax rate. While I'm on Brazil, we're very much toward the tail end, I believe, of the licensing effort with both the networks in Brazil and then it really moves toward certification. So what we are targeting is toward the tail end of this fiscal year, fiscal '13, to be in pallid [ph] and then to be live. That goes beyond the licensing and certification date, because obviously then, we're ramping up the sales force and introducing the products and then going into pilot. And February, as you know, in Brazil tends to be a pretty light month given the schedule down there. But I would say that we're very pleased and on track with where we are with licensing, and we view certification as really the next step and with our technology partner there, we feel like they've got a  lot of visibility in getting that done.","David E. Mangum","From a tax rate, Roman, I would point you back to 2012 where you saw the same trajectory, a higher Q1, a much lower Q2 through Q4. What's happened in each of the last 2 years, the start of the year is U.K. has changed its effective corporate income tax rates. That causes us to revalue some of our deferred tax assets, which causes us to take some extra tax expense in Q1, and it all washes through with lower rates, as you said in your question, in Q2, Q3 and Q4, on the way to be about 29% we expect to see for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor from Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Asia-Pacific, it sounds like you -- if I caught the message right, that the outlook for the year just slightly couched a little bit more to the downside with the high single-digit, low double-digit caveat. Why the slight ramp down in expectations?","David E. Mangum","Glenn, it's David, and then I'll let Paul comment as well. So what we saw in Q1, maybe not different from some other headlines you've seen around Asia. We saw a bit of a decline in average ticket, which hindered growth a little bit. We're obviously watching that closely. Maybe as important as anything else is we expect Asia to be on profit for the year, it was on profit for the quarter. We have managed out some unprofitable merchant relationships, you know about the airline we managed out 2 or 3 quarters ago, so that obviously was a bit of a hindrance to growth. So in looking at sort of the macro in Asia, looking at the initial indicator of the average ticket, we're taking a slightly more cautious look at the top line in Asia, not the bottom line. We still expect our business in Asia to achieve its bottom line objectives. So when you pull the pieces together, we're expecting higher growth in Q3 and Q4 than we've seen in Q1, a little better performance in Q2 as well. And to marry that, just to explain it a little bit because it's the obvious follow-up, what we're seeing is a couple of product launches in Q3 and Q4 from some of our big merchants, particularly some big electronics merchants. We do expect to have volume from some new referral partners we've signed coming online in Q3 and Q4 as well. We've got some targeted marketing actions around some of our products, installment payment plan products and dynamic currency products as well. But all in, yes, you read the tea leaves correctly. A little cautious on the top line outlook, but feeling like the execution there in Asia to drive the bottom line.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's great color. And then regarding Discover, just so I'm clear on how this relationship works, I mean will you be actively soliciting merchants to accept it or is that just something that it's -- the [indiscernible] the merchant to come to you to say we want this PayPal acceptance? And then to map out the potential revenue lift for you, is it -- it's just simply we assume some level of volume increase with roughly your same economics or will be -- there'll be something different there with this model?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Glenn, it's Jeff. Let me start with that and David and Paul, obviously, can jump in. So we're very pleased in our partnership with Discover and with PayPal that was part of our announcement today with our earnings. I would say that we're going to actively market this through Discover in the same way that we have a very active partnership with Discover in the United States and around the world today. So this is another way that we're making it easier for our merchants to accept any form of payment from a consumer that, that consumer chooses to utilize. Just like CUP, for example, is something we enable acceptance for around the world, so is PayPal at the point-of-sale in the United States. PayPal on PayPal is something else that we're going to enable acceptance among our merchant base, which I think is very exciting for them. In terms of a revenue lift, I think it's too early to really get into that kind of segmentation. I think you'll note that Discover has said that is really a Q2 2013 calendar initiative for Discover and PayPal. So we're very excited about it. But we really view it as another point of technology-enabled distribution that we can provide as a value to our customer base.","David E. Mangum","And, Glenn, I would also tell you in all fairness, it's similar economics. And the question is, does it result in additional transactions going from cash or you're just taking another credit or debit card and turning it into this one? And quite frankly, we don't know that. We suspect probably a little bit of that. And I think -- so we're going to -- this is about offering products and services to our customers. It's about supporting -- Discover has been a great partner and quite frankly, PayPal is a great customer of ours as well. So it just made a lot of sense for us and -- but I would think any revenue implications this year are going to be modest. I would like to comment on Asia-Pacific though, if I may, and go back. The issue with Asia-Pacific, and we've said this a number of times, is about $35 million for the quarter. If it increased by 10% or 15% or 20%, I mean it's a very small increase for the company overall. I mean, it might impact the overall growth by 1% or 2% on the upper end. The opportunity for Asia is all about taking advantage of China and India. And heretofore, we really haven't had that opportunity with this transaction we're hoping will close in the not-too-distant future, we now can take advantage of that. And that's where the excitement is. So hopefully, we'll be talking about Asian growth that is significant, and eventually a significant part of our company.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Just wonder if you could give us a little more color on margin progression across international North America on a sequential basis, quarterly for the balance of the year, just directionally.","Paul R. Garcia","Just the segments themselves and how they shape over the course of the year?","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Yes. And just so I think I'm clear, the full year impact of the margin progression would really be more significant in terms of the back half of the year, right? If it's a full year impact. So if it's 50 basis points, is it 100 in the back of the year and that just annualizes to the 50? Just a little more color on margins overall, that would be great.","David E. Mangum","Yes, sure, I'd be happy to give you some of those pieces. So the way to think about this just in terms of progression sequentially is that the North America margins likely hang around about where they are on a cash basis over the course of the year. You see a little bit more movement in the international pieces just depending on the timing of some FX and how the pieces come together in terms of the performance in which market, at which margin do we see the performance over the course of the year. So you'll see more movement in international sequentially than domestic. Now what you'll see in total when we add all this together is almost some traditional seasonality. So you see our margins dip a little bit into Q2 and then into Q3, which is our seasonally weakest quarter around the world. And in other words, in every market around the world in that December through February period for us, you'll see our lowest margin and you'll see the margins come back maybe toward even Q1 levels in Q4. And then all in, that's where you'll get the overall impact. Now recall, when I say that about the U.S. margins, that means that -- or the U.S. margins -- excuse me, the North American margins, they are being held by the addition of APT coming in, in Q2 and helping provide a little more ballast to that margin in Qs 2, 3 and 4, hence the trajectory there may be a little different from your model right now just because of that little bit of extra help you get in each of the quarters from APT.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Super. And then any sense of -- and this may be hard to kind of segment, but of the 850, how much would be kind of dedicated towards buyback? It sounds like you're a little hampered in the quarter versus growing the business organically versus potential acquisitions.","Paul R. Garcia","Well, I think we've -- what you have to like about what we've done in terms of sort of resetting the cap structure is we have attractive pricing, we have attractive amortization, so we now have the flexibility to pursue, win or not, usually exclusive goals. So we have an excellent authorization for buyback. As you know, we have a track record of executing on those buybacks, there's 138 million remaining. So it's pretty mature to talk about anything beyond what we've done to date and the fact that we have a track record to execute on those. But this gives us the opportunity to do both those things, continue to pursue growth while appropriately balancing that with returning capital to shareholders with buybacks. And that's really how I think about the dry powder at this point.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","I would just say, it's Jeff. Let me just add to what David said. I would say from an M&A pipeline point of view, we still have a very full pipeline. I would say most of the deals are probably on the smaller side in terms of purchase price from a capital point of view versus some of the deals that we've done to date. So we're pleased with the opportunities, but those look like they're probably going toward the smaller side versus the larger.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of a Brett Huff from Stephens Incorporated.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","David, just a quick question for you. In terms of the cash available, I know some of your cash is overseas; can you remind us what the split is between what you can use for a repo and what you can't?","David E. Mangum","Yes, I think the simplest answer, Brett, is we can assume right now that almost every dollar of that available cash is abroad, is overseas. And it was another piece of what was important about straightening out the cap structure, was to make sure that we have the flexibility to go anywhere with capital deployment. So I appreciate the question, I'm glad. I should have highlighted that earlier.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess my follow-up, and I'm not sure who is best to answer this, but you kind of alluded to Europe as still being an interesting place where some portfolios might come. Can you just give us a sense of what banks are thinking, what your sense is sort of, I guess, near and medium term about what attractive portfolios might be out there? I mean, in my view, you guys are the best acquirer of those portfolios if I'm a bank in Europe. Can you just give us more color on that? Because I think a lot of folks are interested to hear about that.","Paul R. Garcia","Well, Brett, thank you for that last comment, this is Paul. I would tell you that we are limited in what we could say. We will tell you that part of the pipeline that Jeff just referred to does involve Europe. And there are some attractive properties. We can talk about one opportunity in Spain. As you know, la Caixa has purchased some financial institutions or merging with those, and they do have some portfolios available. And we always said that when that happens, we'll have an opportunity to do something here. Those aren't big at all. But there are some other opportunities outside of Spain that we are pursuing. So I would tell you, stay tuned.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.","Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","More of an industry-centric question. Could you comment on the impact, if any, Square, Groupon, their pricing strategy for payment processing in the small retail market? Is that a potential threat to industry pricing? Does it impact GPN? Just any commentary around that, Paul, would be very helpful.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay, Wayne, thank you. Well, I think it would be disingenuous to suggest that all the advertisements, Square in particular, and of course some recent announcements from Groupon that's trying to one up them, doesn't have some impact. So you could say that they have kind of set the high bar at whatever they announce. Now the reality is there's a lot more to pricing. I think that our ISOs who are primarily involved with that space, that's not really something we pitch directly. They do sign tens of thousands, tens of thousands of new customers every single month with us, and successfully doing so. In some cases, the headline rate is lower than the Square rate. In many cases though, it's not, and in some -- in most cases there are some fees, appropriate fees. I think that the major difference between what they're doing and what Square's doing, I would say their business is pretty profitable. I think Square has different objectives other than profit because at these levels on these merchants, they can't be making a whole bunch. I think Groupon, obviously I don't have any deep insight there, Wayne, but they're taking advantage of touching all of those merchants and that's probably a clever add-on. And they are another ISO, for want of a better term, and welcome to the party and let's see how they do.","Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And just a question on a company-specific item. Could you give us an update on how the domestic G2 conversion is going? Any directional color there would be helpful.","David E. Mangum","Yes, Wayne, it's David. We continue to move methodically through the G2 migrations. As we've discussed, we're not giving lots of highlights and so we're not giving expectations. We have moved large customers, including our largest customer, onto the platform and we continue to move through in a very collaborative environment with our customers as we nail their requirements, and we're ready to move when they are ready to move, we continue to move through the base. So we think we're on track in continuing the solid performance in this regard, not highlighting it because with everything else going on with all the moving parts, it's not core to the strategy to rush customers toward G2 when they're processing perfectly well with great service on existing platforms.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. A quick question on the Durbin benefit. Can you just let us know if you're still getting the benefit from Durbin Amendment? And -- or has it been completed of yet? And what are your expectations of that benefit going forward?","David E. Mangum","Yes, this is David. At this point, it would be difficult analytically to find the impact and parse out the impact of debit legislation. Anything we've discussed with you before, which really dates back almost to January when we last really parsed this individually, remains in the base. We do expect, obviously over a very long period of time, water finds its own level and pricing is pricing. But right now, the price is the price and any debit legislation that's in the price continues to be in the price, and we continue to work in a highly competitive market, signing new merchants and retaining and maintaining existing. But analytically, it'd be very difficult to parse that out for you right now.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So the expectation is that it will continue to help going forward and obviously, the question was just like how long do you think it will be before completed of yet. And then a quick follow-up on Visa's new debit strategy. So they have this new debit strategy where they're giving out increased incentives for the merchants and acquirers. Have you seen any benefit from that? And have you seen any change in routing volume based on those benefits? If you broke -- add any color on that.","Paul R. Garcia","Sure, happy to. I think first, I'd start by reminding you and everyone else that routing is something we do on behalf of our customers as inexpensively and as well as we can. That means on a routine basis, we are always looking for the cheapest option. I don't regard the debit routing incentives that you're describing that have been disclosed by other parties in the market as a huge sea change in the way debit is processed in the market in terms of the economics to us. Each couple of years, we are looking almost from a procurement perspective, to get the best deal we can, and this is this year's example of it. Is there a benefit in our income statement this year? Absolutely. It is quite small and nothing I would point out to you very directly. I would suggest it's probably an effective strategy and we are happy to work with folks who incent us and give us the best benefits we can to give routing and drive the most volume to the right places.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just ask a follow-up on the question regarding some of the newer entrants to the market and particularly with Square and Starbucks. And I guess, Paul, just to kind of get your gut feeling, if we're sitting here 12 to 18 months from now, do you think we'll be saying that Starbucks was kind of a one-off for Square in terms of a real large merchant, signing up with them and Paymentech, or do you think that it has the potential to actually set off a chain reaction among other large retailers in that type of quick serve retail environment?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes, I would think of -- I would say more the former. I think it's  -- I'm not in any way dissing the clever nature of it and I think that certainly garnered a lot of headlines. But there are some inherent pricing disadvantages to how they're approaching it. And also some of the kind of the sexy stuff they're doing is still not to be realized and quite frankly, not proprietary like facial recognition and things. What I would say, Jason, is that I think you'll see more clever creative approaches. But I think what we saw with PayPal is more indicative. And I know it sounds a little self-serving, but I happen to believe it\u2019s 100% accurate. It's more indicative, I think, of how we'll see things happen. There are very well, well-worn, very proven ways to get back and forth to merchants, and those people that want to ride those rails and willing to pay all the participants appropriately will find themselves with a huge amount of new customers. I mean I think the PayPal adoption versus the Square adoption, I think you'll see some significant differences with the emphasis on the PayPal side just because of what they're doing.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to shift gears a bit into the gaming business, I know it's not that big in terms of revenue but it is high margin, and just given some of the shakiness in the macro environment and discretionary consumer spending, any impact on your gaming business or just talk about how it's performing versus plan?","David E. Mangum","Yes. Thus far, Jason, this is David, it's right on track for what we expected. So we haven't seen it yet. An interesting question, certainly bears watching and we are watching closely, but thus far, right on track.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","And, Jason, it's Jeff. I would just add to that, we're very pleased with how we're doing in new wins in the gaming business. You probably saw our press release some time ago about a new customer win, and we're very happy with how that's going and more to come.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's great color. Just lastly on Brazil, any more color on your plans to sell into that market this fiscal year? Are we still looking at another few pennies or so of investment in that market in fiscal '13 kind of similar to last year?","David E. Mangum","Yes, Jason, we are, not just materially off the run rate of last Q4. So it's up a bit year-over-year, but sort of lost in the sauce inside of $3-plus of overall cash earnings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So Paul, I wanted to come back to the JV, HSBC agent JV buy-in, and you talked about this is a huge opportunity long-term. And what I'm trying to reconcile is the timing of the potential for the deal, understanding that the new CUP in one market took, I don't know, something like 5 years. And so by having CUP kind of sign off on you guys, is that like the due diligence check in that market and that's what gives you confidence to believe that these other large financial institutions will be willing to join forces with you? Or are you just talking in the context of 5, 6, 7 years from now, this is going to be big for Global?","Paul R. Garcia","Well I would say the former, not the latter, that we think this has a more immediate impact. Now I would tell you, even though -- in fact, we haven't actually closed the deal yet. But we haven't been waiting to do that to have conversations, number one. Number two, they're not just necessarily CUP related. I think your point's well made, though. It took years and years and years, Dan, to establish a presence. By the way, we're in 4 areas now with CUP. We haven't really made a big deal out of it, but we now have expanded that geography well beyond where we were even in the last call. I think we had 2 last one and we added 2 more since. So we're expanding throughout PRC with CUP acceptance. But what we're talking about is something even more dramatic than that. Now I hesitate to say that, that will take 6 months or 6 years, but the bias is to have something happen more quickly that is -- that will move the needle. And that's what we're all focused on.","David E. Mangum","And, Dan, this is David, maybe a little more color. Part of that focus is additional partnerships that you can structure now while maintaining the fabulous partnership we have with HSBC in the market. And you can tell that from the extension of the marketing group with them, but expanding partnerships around the region rather than a pure singular focus on China, which is a bit of how I took your question. So there are opportunities to move maybe more quickly than just the China you've tracked over the last few years.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","That's an excellent point. Because -- thank you, David. Because India and also some other markets, quite frankly, that we're, quite frankly, we're not in but would like to that have some reasonable demographics.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's a point well taken. And the idea is that post closing and even pre-closing, you're having the discussions throughout all of Asia, and the way we should be thinking about it is hopefully 12 months hence closing, you'll have something. And the deals, when you talk about them, are you talking about them in significance of onto themselves? Are you talking about it in the basket of all of these deals once aggregated?","Paul R. Garcia","Well, I think that's also tough to pin us down. I would say both. There are some countries where you're looking at a series of relationships and there's others where just one could be significant. And we'll approach them all differently and there's other ways to -- I mean, there's ways to structure those relationships, not necessarily all cash. So just a couple -- so we've been working for quite some time and I would say this, you're right. In a year from now, if we're still talking about this, we don't have anything to show it for, I'll be disappointed.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then since everyone else got to ask 3 questions, I'll ask one more. The deal with APT, to me, clearly not about revenues at this point, at least. And it's certainly, seemingly more about the protections and expansion of your North American margins which we've all complained about for so long. But once that gets absorbed into the system, then we have to still worry about North American margin degradation because we will grow over the 70 basis points. So I'm just wondering when's the next act that you have that you can utilize this asset for to pay so much money for.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. So, Dan, let me start that and I'm going to ask David to jump in, too. So first of all, the 50 basis points is just for this year's impact. It will offer more than that on a longer-term basis. And in addition, because it's an accretive grower to our business, those margin benefits, we continue to enjoy those margin benefits going forward. So as we can -- this business just -- if it just maintains its growth rate, we hope to accelerate it, we'll continue to get margin benefits of significantly more than that or year after year after year. Now, the other actions we're taking is that we are going to be entering the next fiscal year with a terrific operating platform that offers leverage opportunities. And in North America in general, Jeff, is growing the U.S. I mean, you guys haven't seen that in a long time.  And that's -- he's doing a terrific job with that, and we think that Canada does stabilize over time. So there's a number of nice things that we could look forward to in North America. And internationally, we have -- I think we're in the best markets. We have some wonderful businesses and we have opportunities to execute on a number of initiatives there, too. And I think the story there is pretty bright. David? David, you want to add anything here?","David E. Mangum","No.","Operator","We will take the last question from Glenn Greene from Oppenheim. After which, Mr. Garcia will give his closing remarks. Mr. Greene, please go ahead.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'll just keep it to a couple of questions, the first one's pretty easy. For David, on la Caixa, I guess I was surprised a little bit that Spain was up modestly. I was wondering if you could give us the volume base growth versus the pricing growth or was it all volume-based?","Paul R. Garcia","Well, Glenn, we don't really parse the specific markets out. If you look at Spain itself, we saw transaction growth there. You continue, as you would expect, in that market and that economy to see pressure on average tickets. So all in, I think we're seeing organic growth and that's a tribute to the partner we have in that market, la Caixa. So fundamentally, we have organic growth in Spain, which I think is a pretty unique thing to say.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I'll throw in one more Square question for Paul. And the only reason I ask, because there seems to be -- there is a lot of confusion out in the market and the way you described it, I thought, was pretty helpful. Is it just simply the best way to think about this as the kind of comparable to an ISO and the competitive threat to someone like a Global would be sort of an indirect competitive threat to the extent that they potentially take away business from one of your ISOs?","Paul R. Garcia","Start with Groupon and then Square. Yes, I think, Glenn, Square is another competitor. I think they've done a very clever job of going after a much smaller customer, and I think their innovation with the first guy out, their advertisement, I mean that stuff is all very impressive. And Jack Dorsey's an impressive guy. I mean, he's -- it's kind of he's bringing some excitement to our business and I personally am grateful for that. But in terms of what impact it has for us, I would say it's not a business we're in, number one, with Starbucks aside, well, that wasn't our customer. It's not a business we're in, number one. Number two, he's got -- I would tell you he's got some challenges if that is his economic model. The reason none of us have chased that business is it's not terribly attractive. Now we do have one of our ISOs who signs thousands and thousands of Square-like merchants right now successfully. That is a slightly different model. He hasn't cornered the market on that. So long story short, I would say that there are more benefits to have Square as a competitor, quite frankly, than there are negatives.","Okay.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane Marie Elliott","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Global Payments Fiscal 2014 Second Quarter Conference Call. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour and joining me on the call are Paul Garcia, Chairman; Jeff Sloan, President and CEO; and David Mangum, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our public releases, including our most recent 10-K that could cause actual results to vary. We caution you not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call.","In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these results more clearly reflect comparative operating performance. For a full reconciliation of cash earnings to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K dated today, January 8, 2014, which may be located under the Investor Relations area on our website, www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now I'd like to introduce Jeff Sloan. Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We delivered strong results for the quarter, growing revenue by 8% and cash earnings per share by 15%. As a result, we are raising our annual fiscal 2014 cash earnings per share expectations by $0.05 to a range of $4.03 to $4.10 or 10% to 12% growth. We are pleased to confirm that we remain on track to achieve stable total company cash operating margin for the full year. This performance demonstrates that we are executing the right strategies to drive sustainable growth across our regions.","Now for quarterly highlights. I am delighted to report that North America continued to deliver strong results, both in the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. results were driven by strong performance across all channels, headlined by our integrated solutions business. Canada had another quarter of stable performance with 5% credit transaction growth and low-single digit spread declines on a comparable year-over-year basis. In addition, Canadian revenue benefited from assessment-based pricing changes. We are also pleased with our international performance, reflecting strong execution on our strategic initiatives in all our markets in Europe and Asia.","Now I will turn the call over to David.","David E. Mangum","Thank you, Jeff. We are gratified by the strong business performance across our markets during the quarter. North America revenue grew 6% with U.S. revenue growth of 6% and transaction growth of 8%. Canada revenue grew 11% in local currency for the quarter and we now expect a mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth in local currency for the full year. North America cash operating income grew 6% to $78 million with cash operating margin of 17.4%. Our full year expectations for North America cash operating margins remain unchanged at flat to slightly increasing as compared to prior year.","International revenue grew 12% for the quarter in U.S. dollars. Europe delivered solid revenue growth in all markets with particular strength in our e-Commerce business, Global Solutions, and in Spain. Asia-Pacific revenue grew 10% over last year, driven primarily by strong transaction growth and successful product launches from our largest customer in the region. International cash operating income of $70 million grew 12% with cash operating margins increasing to 37.3%. We continue to expect stable cash operating margins in international for the full year.","Currency trends were generally in line with our expectations for the quarter and we continue to expect foreign currency effects to be about neutral to a slight headwind for cash earnings per share for the full year. We continue to expect both GAAP and cash effective tax rates to approach 29% for the full year.","For the quarter, our total cash operating margin was 19.4%. This includes over $4 million of an expected full year $17 million incremental security spend. Excluding the security spend, our total cash operating margin for the quarter would have been 20.1%, an increase of 30 basis points over last year.","We generated free cash flow of $91 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures totaled $21 million for the quarter and we continue to anticipate our full year capital expenditures will total about $90 million. Our total available cash, including working capital at the end of the quarter was $280 million.","During the second quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for $100 million which we expect to complete by the end of the third quarter. When we complete the accelerated share repurchase, we will have $125 million on our current authorization for potential further repurchases.","As a result of our strong performance, we are increasing our annual fiscal 2014 cash earnings per share expectations by $0.05 to a range of $4.03 to $4.10, reflecting 10% to 12% growth over fiscal 2013. We are maintaining our annual revenue expectations of $2.51 billion to $2.56 billion, reflecting 6% to 8% growth. We are on track to achieve stable total company operating margins for the full fiscal year. This includes the negative effect of the $17 million incremental step function security spending in the current fiscal year.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you, David. We are executing well on our strategies around the world and we maintain substantial capital flexibility to achieve our goals. Jane?","Jane Marie Elliott","[Operator Instructions] And operator, we will now go to question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dan Perlin with RBC.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wondered if you could just elaborate a little bit on what the dynamic is that's playing out in Europe. I know you mentioned Spain was strong and your e-Commerce partnership there, but I'm just wondering if you could provide maybe something a little more detailed in terms of the dynamics that are building in that region.","David E. Mangum","Sure, Dan. This is David. Europe is an amalgamation of a number of markets and services that actually are all performing about on our plan for the year, so we're pleased about that. If I walk through them one by one, maybe that'll help a little with the color about what you're asking. I mean, it's headlined by the largest single asset there is our United Kingdom business, which is a mid- to high-single digit grower. It's growing in a very solid fashion, delivering very nice profit, had a good second quarter. On top of that, or with that actually comes our multi-business, which goes hand in hand with the United Kingdom. In Spain, we continue to see, what, from the surface, is probably just remarkable growth, double-digit revenue growth. We think we'll do high-single for the year in Spain. Right now, we're running a little bit ahead of that. We had a very strong first quarter as you'll recall with the DCC product driving a lot of tourist space revenue in Spain over the course of that quarter. So Spain continues to move along, given the remarkable partnership we have with CaixaBank there, the marketing they drive to this asset and then just really good execution in that business overall. In Russia, we have a terrific, sort of secular adoption acceptance story, going with high-teens growth, mid-teens growth quarter-after-quarter as we continue to see more and more Russians transacting and more and more acceptance of merchant locations around the country. We do have a Global Payments Europe business, which is our indirect business, which is performing right on its expectations for the year. That's never going to be a fast grower, as you know. When you bring all those pieces together, you're sitting right on the edge of high-single-digit growth in Europe, double-digit, depending on the quarter, and that's before we talk about Global Solutions, which is our e-Commerce platform, which is growing very well this year. Recall we have one large customer in that whom we service all around the world, with the exception of the United States. But in addition, we've added 40, 50, 60 customers to that platform in the last year, so much smaller than our lead customer, so we continue build out the volume on that platform. So when you bring together a big asset like U.K., running the mid- to high-single digits and operating at -- right at its plan, solid Spain asset growing double digits, nice growth in Russia and then marry that to an e-Commerce platform that's growing in the double digits as well, you have really, really nice performance overall in Europe.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, and the U.K. growth, is that more a function of pricing opportunities that you've identified or is that just kind of cyclical rebounds in volumes?","David E. Mangum","Well, there's always pricing in every market we serve that's helping from time to time or about flat, depending on the timing of which period about which we're discussing. In the U.K. alone, credit is solid in terms of the metrics. Debit is very solid, and we've added some very nice new customers over the last year or so.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I'll ask one more, even though I'm going go over my allotted 2. Are there any kind of proof points that you can kind of talk to about this partner of choice that's really provided incremental growth, in particular, in this quarter or something you see coming down the pipeline?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Well, Dan, it's Jeff. I'll start and David can add as well. We really don't get into specific customers and how they translate into revenue and profit in a given period. I would say, as we think about partner of choice, it's really a few things. First, when you think about the announcements we made around mobility and the ecosystem we've built, and we've announced this in prior calls, in this fiscal I believe, with people like PayPal on mobile, Intuit on mobile, O2 Telef\u00f3nica, et cetera, I don't think we would have them as customers if we weren't an incredibly good partner, and the nature of those relationships really varies in terms of what we provide to them based on who the partner really is. So I think you can look at each one of those as a very good example about the success of our partner of choice model. Second, I think we're a very good joint venture partner, and David discussed rightly our terrific performance in Spain with Caixa at -- or [ph] our Comercia business. And while that transaction is a number of years old, I don't think we have that kind of performance in a market like Spain, which, as you know, has its macroeconomic challenges and that kind of execution without a very good relationship and partnership with a terrific partner at Caixa. I think those are 2 examples how partner of choice really translates into something distinctive for Global Payments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird.","Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, just looking at the model for Q3 in the back half of the year, I think typically EPS is down about mid-single digit in percentage terms sequentially and I just want to make sure that there's nothing that we should be aware of in Q3 this year that, that trend wouldn't hold.","David E. Mangum","No. Tim -- this is David, there's nothing new or different about trends. As you know, I often like to talk about how to think about the quarterly flow based on what percentage of full year earnings does each quarter contribute. And that, as we sit here today reporting to you on Q2, is unchanged in terms of our view of what Q1, Q2, Q3 and then Q4, what each of those will contribute toward the $4.03 to $4.10 range that we've now established with the raise today. And as you know, that looks an awful lot like the distribution we saw in each of FY 2013 and FY 2012.","Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just on Canada, another good quarter there. Is there a way to give us a little bit of a bridge between maybe transaction growth and then what you're seeing just from a pricing perspective and then maybe a market share perspective?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. I'll start, Tim, and David can add additional color. So as we said in our prepared comments, we saw mid-single digits credit transactional growth year-over-year in Canada and very low-single-digit spread declines in that market. That is a pretty good raw indicator of what that business is doing on a normalized basis without some of the network pricing actions that have taken place over the last period of time, which generally gets added on the assessment side to our revenue stream and then of course, in some cases, we have margin on top of that. So one way to think about how is that business really in a normalized environment is our prepared remarks of mid-single-digit credit transactional growth, which is mostly how we get paid, coupled with low-single-digit spread declines is a good way to think about it relative to the low-double-digit local currency revenue growth that David cited in his comments.","David E. Mangum","Yes, and to add a little more color maybe, those are the very dynamics we've been discussing to you guys probably going back 4 quarters now that, to the extent we see manageable spread declines married to our traditional transaction declines, we -- again, I used the same words twice, we have a very manageable situation in Canada. And so we continue to see those solid metrics right now, and that would then be the outlook from here on as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Roman Leal with Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, on the capital allocation efforts, it's good to see another round of buybacks. But just help us think through what the next step is in terms of -- you're always kind of, I guess, balancing what you see in M&A opportunities versus buybacks. Anything changed in that dynamic at all?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","No. Roman, it's Jeff. So we have, as David mentioned in his prepared comments, 2\/3 of $1 billion of available capacity today between cash on hand that is available, coupled with existing financing capacity. So I would say nothing's changed there. We obviously generated a lot of free cash flow in the quarter, which also helps. So with that kind of firepower, there's really no change in our capital allocation philosophy. I would also say that we view our M&A pipeline as being full, which it has been for a period of time, and we intend to continue with the same kind of capital allocation in terms of strategies that we shared with you and the public previously.","David E. Mangum","Yes. I think, Roman, just to put a fine print on a couple of those pieces, you're quite correct. We think the first and best use of the capital -- the excess capital is global expansion. We continue to look at that and as Jeff said, we have a full pipeline. Let us get through the current accelerated share repurchase, which closes this quarter and see where the pipeline stands and see what we're going to do next. But I think we've certainly shown you over the last 12 to 18 months that when we talked about buybacks, we're committed to doing them on an ongoing basis and committed to doing them as a core part of the strategy married to M&A. So let's first come back with -- to you with more communication, but let us close out the current ASR.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up, Jeff, recently, I think you articulated maybe a slight change in the type of M&A deals that are in the pipeline. I think the kind of phrase you used was we're not looking only for home runs, we're also looking for those singles and doubles and more kind of technology-oriented M&A deals. Is that a change of just the actual deals that are available or is that something that you are constituting [ph] because you just see that the distribution and technology makes a lot more sense than maybe another -- other sorts of distribution channels?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Well, thanks, Roman. We're always looking, of course, for grand slams, not just home runs and doubles. But I appreciate what you said. So I think the answer is we feel very good, for example, about our transaction with APT, which we announced in August of '12 and closed in October of '12 and we've owned it now only for over a year. So very comfortable with how that's performing and I do think that's given us a perspective that's slightly different in our business than it may have been historically, as we feel very good about making transactions and investments in that area. And if we could find more of that type of thing, given our experience with APT, of course we'd be very open-minded about it. I would say also our business is changing as an industry. So this isn't just APT or experience in that area. I think as you've seen over the last couple of years the importance of technology to our business, the importance of preserving our role in the financial intermediation of what we do, the importance of expanding in geographies that we're already as David said, as well as additional geographies that are attractive that we're not in today. We've mentioned before, for example, Australia, South Korea and Japan, as 3 examples in Asia. Those are all important to us for filling our strategy. And I think we recognize, as our business changes, that not every deal going forward in this environment is going to look exactly like every deal that we've done historically over the last 13 years as a public company. So first, I think it's comfort level with what we've done, in particular with APT, and deals like that and second, an acknowledgment that our business is changing and we need to make those investments to get ahead and skate to where the pop [ph] is going to be in our business in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about, first, transaction growth in the U.S. Looked like, what, 8%, I think I heard. So can't remember the last time it was in the single digits. Is that cyclical or something else going on there?","David E. Mangum","Tien-tsin, it's David. It was 8% for the U.S. You heard correctly. It was 9% last quarter, so we're right where we were before. I think what you're seeing, and this is a happy piece of really how the U.S. North America are coming together, business slowed down from the ISOs. And as you well know in the face of income statement, that's not a bad thing, particularly when you've got other assets, our integrated payments assets headlined by APT growing very nicely, expanding margins, et cetera. So that 8% is really quite consistent with where we were last quarter. And even exiting last year was only 10% in Q4, so we're right in line with where we were.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So that's going to be into cyclically or from a structural standpoint, in your mind?","David E. Mangum","Only in my comment about really what works out to be a happy thing for us in aggregate, which is the ISO channel will going to be a little bit slower. At the same time, our direct integration -- integrated payments space assets are growing very well.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Got it. And then just on the EPS revision, just wanted to clarify, I heard the margin commentary, no change. And then the revenue guidance, no change there. So the guide -- the -- what's the $0.05 comprised of, I suppose, is what I'm asking?","David E. Mangum","Yes. I mean, so let's walk through that a little bit and I'll give you probably far more color than you actually want. First off, I'd suggest that we all think about the $0.05 -- there's a bit of an illusory component to the $0.05 in that it's actually a little bit of a higher increase than you might think when you look beneath the covers. With the recent upward movement in the share price, we now expect our accelerated share repurchase, the one we announced last quarter, to probably deliver $0.01 less in earnings per share than we announced last quarter. That's really given, again, the fact that share prices moved from $50 roughly when we announced this on the 1st of October up to, and you'll see in the 10-Q we filed about 0.5 hour ago or 1 hour ago, the average price of our repurchases so far has been below $55. And of course, yesterday the stock closed nearly $65. So when you think about that, first off, we're really happy to have executed that in an accelerated fashion. But second, the only downside to that, and this is a very happy outcome, is that we'll likely only see $0.04 of incremental EPS instead of the $0.05 we announced. So we think of this as a bit of a $0.06 increase just for business and operating purposes. So if you then talk about, \"What are the components of this?\" our performance in Q2 was right about where we expected. We're getting nice performance in Europe, as I'd sort of outlined a little bit and answered to Dan's question. We saw Asia kicked back to a higher revenue growth rate than we've seen in the past. And yes, some of that is with a large customer and a product release but that doesn't that customer is going away next quarter necessarily. It just means you won't necessarily see the same huge uptick. So really, it's about business performance and having the increments relative to our expectations be just a little bit north of where we were a quarter or so ago. So we're really happy, quite honestly, with where we stand and it is these components: Canada executing well, Europe executing well, Asia executing well, U.S. executing well. So you pull all that together and, quite honestly, other than, a little bit of increased earnings, we think we have the same outlook we have, whether it's margin at a segment level, international versus North America, or the total company level that we had just a quarter ago but we're rolling through this year pretty well into about the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I wanted to start off on the margin front, specifically in North America. You reiterated your outlook for flattish margins year-over-year there. Yet over the back half of the year, you're going to have a bigger headwind from FX in Canada. So maybe what's performing a little bit better than your expectations to allow you to reiterate?","David E. Mangum","Yes. So George, a couple of things. One is, and I'd point back to your first point, FX is not wildly different from what we thought when we started the year. It's a little bit worse in Canada as you might imagine, especially given the recent movement. But it's not wildly worse than we might have thought. So first note that the headwind created by FX when you translate that Canadian growth into U.S. dollars is not maybe as bad as you might think from the outside looking in. If you then marry that to -- we've got a U.S. business where the ISOs are a little slower than we might have thought. We get a little bit of help there from the margin line and then we've got, again, these integrated payments businesses that are a little ahead of what we might have thought at the start of the year. The end of that sort of happy mixture is -- we're right on track for what we thought even with FX being a hair worse than we might have thought going into the year from a Canadian perspective.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just second question for me, looking at APAC and the good growth that you saw there. You called out the successful launch from your large partner there. What would the growth rate have been x that partner? Or maybe another way to ask is, how should we be thinking about growth now over the back half of the year?","David E. Mangum","I would think about it as -- but first, you know we're not going to pull up the growth of any specific customer. But know that, that customer obviously isn't large enough to be a factor for something on top of the growth. We've seen, I think, a very solid recovery towards solid metrics in Asia overall over the last quarter or so, so it's performing fine and then this extra growth from the large customer is kind of the cherry on top.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And then long term for APAC, there's no reason that business should not be able to drive double-digit growth. Is that safe to say?","David E. Mangum","We don't believe there's any reason to believe otherwise. We have a mixture of markets there that includes some relatively mature markets like Taiwan, a little bit of Hong Kong to that as well, all the way to the other end of the spectrum, but really, early stage markets that should grow well over time as we improve our distribution across the region. Those will be your Indias, the Chinas, a little bit of Philippines. We do need, as you know, to round out our distribution capabilities across Asia but our expectation is that, that's a fast grower for a very long period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up. On the ISOs, the slower growth, is that a function of slower transaction growth inside the ISOs, like a same-store sales number? Or is that a little bit of a share shift where they could be doing it on their own or they'll [ph] shift share somewhere else to another processor?","David E. Mangum","Yes. Bryan, it's David. It's a great question. I think it's not much other than the law of large numbers. So if -- when we analyze what's going on, we don't see a share shift away from our ISOs to other channels at all. And I think if you look at some of the external reporting and analyses and surveys that have gone, that supports that conclusion thus far. I think that within the ISOs themselves, we don't believe anyone has moved any volume away from us and we would have pretty good insight into that. So right now, I think all you're seeing is a very large channel, very large numbers. They're continuing to grow and grow in absolute transaction count. It's just not going to be the same percentage level as it's been in the past.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a question on the international margins. On a year-over-year basis, they were slightly up. It's the first time in a couple of quarters. Just wanted to make sure I understand, what's driving the -- a little bit of a margin improvement in international? And then as we go forward the next couple of quarters, is that sustainable kind of a slight improvement year-over-year or do they fall back down?","David E. Mangum","Yes, it's a good question. So for this quarter, we get a little bit of help from Asia because the metrics of snap back. It's not just the large customer, who you might imagine, we brought on the greatest margins on that customer's revenue anyway. Well, we had a solid quarter in Asia, which is nice for a change and, hopefully, is a nice sign of continuing improvement there. When we have good quarters in each of U.K. and Spain, you'll find slightly better margins than you would have the year before or than you might have thought as you were building your model. When I look out to Q3 and Q4, I don't think margins are going to be -- they're going to vary around being flat with each of those quarters. You could be slightly down in Q3, depends on how the seasonality affects us across the international markets. You could be around flat in Q3, which is about what we expect. And again, same in Q4, although Q4, I think, is more likely to be up year-over-year than flat or down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. One is, can you just give an update on Brazil and any thoughts about that operation and its trajectory or progress, as you look out through the balance of fiscal '14?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. Tim, it's Jeff. So we're pleased with where we are in Brazil. Our transaction with our partner, Caixa, closed during the quarter and we think that's gone well. We're up to just under a couple of thousand merchants live on us today in Brazil, and we intend to continue to grow that throughout the fiscal year. We've added fast, as we've added transaction count. Mainly that's on the sales side but also includes infrastructure. Business that was based in S\u00e3o Paulo and also a bit of Brasilia. So we're very happy with how we're doing, and we're getting ready to manage as most of Brazil starts to think about the World Cup in June, July of 2014 and then the Olympics a couple of years thereafter.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up, and I'll hop off, was with APT, any thoughts about geographic expansion into places like the U.K. or Spain or Hong Kong or any markets where, let's say, within the 12- to 24-month window, there would be geographic expansion opportunities for that type of platform?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. It's a great question, Tim. So we are actually in the process of bringing APT today to Canada. So the most obvious market for us outside the U.S., which is most similar for a variety of reasons for APT's business, is Canada. I believe that we're in pilot this quarter in Canada with APT on an integrated basis. We think we're early in that market for what we're doing with the native solution. That is for Canadian customers in Canada rather than customers in the U.S., just going cross-border into Canada. So Canada is the next most obvious market and we're already doing that. Thereafter, we'll look at each one of our markets and we've got VAR sales folks in most of our markets around the world, including in Europe, in Asia, and we're also looking at bringing that business to Brazil. So while the initial business case for APT was really focused on successful execution of that business plan, I think we all agree, as we discussed in January at the Investor Day, that we would be missing something at the end of the day if 3 or 5 years from now, all we have is a very good and well-performing U.S. business because while we think that we're early and underpenetrated in the U.S., we firmly believe that we're early and underpenetrated in the markets outside of the U.S. So we think there's a great opportunity for APT, and we are very excited to be entering into Canada this quarter with that product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Ramsey El-Assal for Jason. Can you give us an update on the CUP partnership adding more cities to China, where we stand there?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Sure. So we've a very good partnership with CUP in China and that involves, by the way, not just Mainland China, but that involves the rest of the world, too. We've a very active partnership and relationship outside of Mainland China. We do feel like our ability to expand into the rest of the People's Republic of China is a very good opportunity for us. We've got active discussions with CUP about it and many of the investments that David had described over the last couple of quarters into our Asia business have gone into Mainland China to get ready for that expansion of the business throughout all of China. So it's very important to us. I think our relationship is very good with CUP, both in China and around the world, and they think they, too, fit into the partnership mode that we described earlier.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to ask about the DCC, the Direct (sic) [Dynamic] Currency Conversion solutions. Are the timing and magnitude of the rollout of that solution across your business kind of happening according to plan? And I guess, sort of what -- I would imagine there's pretty high-quality revenue. At what kind of inning are we in terms of rolling that out across your business? Is there a lot of space out there left for it or is it pretty much kind of installed where you want it to be?","David E. Mangum","I would tell you that there's actually a lot of room left from that product. It's a recent rollout in Spain. It's been quite successful for some period of time in Asia, and we've talked about that before relative to annualizing into Asia's growth. It is available without a huge level of penetration in North America and the rest of Europe. So we still think -- I don't want to necessarily pick an exact inning, but we still think it's relatively early days, particularly in those last few markets I described and that there's still room there. As I said earlier, there's the occasional seasonality to it, summer being a big tourist season in Europe. You might see more rather than less. But if we're sort of waving our hands over that and talking about full years in rollouts, there's still a lot of room for further rollout of that product around the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess, Dave, for the first question, going back to North America margins, which is sort of thinking about it for the quarter as opposed to the full year, and maybe they got spoiled a little bit by last quarter's healthy margin expansion. But kind of like looking at this quarter and thinking it was flat year-over-year despite the benefit of 11% constant currency in Canada. So I'm just trying to reconcile those sort of dynamics.","David E. Mangum","Yes. It's a great question, Glenn. So if you think about the pieces of North America, I think you're right to put your finger on the first question being a little bit of Canada. Now recognize that Canada, when you translate that nice growth in local currency, was the hardest hit of any market we have by currency translation. So by the time you bring all that back in U.S. dollars, you don't have 11% anymore. You've got something substantially less than that. That's part of why, as we sit here today, we're talking about Canada will do mid- to high single in local currency, which by the time you marry that to U.S. in mid- to high-single unit, even our total North America U.S. dollar growth isn't going to approach that Canadian sort of upticks of -- the double digit we posted year-to-date. So recognize the chunk of that came back the other way. And then beyond that, in any given quarter, you've got the timing of investments expenses, et cetera, so there's really not a lot going on. I would also suggest to you that flat margin is a nice place to be. We're still on track for everything we've got, everything we expected for the full year there. And remember, too, that Canadian growth is fueled by assessments. So with the assessments, they're going to come with dilutive impact on margins overall before we even talk about the currency translation.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. Drilling down on the U.S. a little bit, and you talked a little bit about this to Tien-tsin's question, but maybe you could put a little bit more of a fine point on the kind of the components of the revenue growth sort of thinking about the ISO channel versus direct versus APT. Is it reasonable to think the ISO revenue growth was kind of in line with that 8% transaction growth and is APT kind of still mid-teens?","David E. Mangum","The way I'd answer that without calling each is that in line or even perhaps a little below the transaction growth is the ISO channel right now. That obviously can vary from time to time, depending on fees and timing. Know that APT is well above that and obviously, well into the double digits, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Could you just give us, so we have the numbers kind of where we are in terms of the ASR, in terms of absolute dollars now and then as we think about that into Q3?","David E. Mangum","I can. We announced $100 million ASR. As you well know, Kevin, what happens is you take -- deliver essentially 80% of that into the share count at the time you announce it and then, over time, the actual purchaser are effectuated by a broker-dealer then you settle up at the end. So we haven't settled. We don't have a final accounting for it, but I know enough now to tell you when I look at the average price that we're going to get a little less earnings, again, for a happy reason with the $65 stock price, which is a little north of that as we sit here at the moment. But the mechanics really are we'll finish that. This quarter, we'll finish -- we'll round out, having spent the full $100 million. It'll be whatever it'll be in terms of the final share exchange for the final count of shares delivered to us and then we'll take a look at where we are from a capital planning perspective as we're describing earlier.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then, if I did my math right, it looks like you've bought a little less in Q2 than Q1. Was that just a function of where the stock was? Or anything in terms of just different priorities for the remaining capital on the balance sheet?","David E. Mangum","It's a function of where the stock is. It's a function when we entered into ASR relative to previous purchases in Q1 under a 10b-5 and then it's just how quickly the things roll through. Now things roll through in ASR based on stock price itself, volumes, et cetera just as they do with any other buy. So there's nothing to be seen there in terms of the strategy around buying because when you enter into an ASR, you're receiving [ph] the broker-dealer the timing and pace of the buybacks then you settle with them at the end of the period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A big-picture question on -- a question -- a kind of follow-up to this question asked earlier on the geo expansion focus versus the let's buy technology pieces and use our distribution channel focus. And I'm curious, which of those 2 -- I guess, I'm not thinking in terms of M&A, really, but in terms of growth, as you guys see big growth drivers the next couple of years, do you still see geographic expansion as the most likely biggest growth driver in driving more pieces of technology or more value add through your existing geos? Do you still see that as #1 and #2? Or do you -- could you see that flip, given -- and Jeff, you mentioned this, given the -- your desire to kind of protect where you are in the value chain and protect your distribution system?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. I think, Brett, as I said before, I mean, I think you have to start all M&A conversations with what's actually for sale because you really are looking for the right partnership and the right transaction. You typically have a lot of irons in the fire to make sure that you are the right partner as you're at the right place at the right time. So I would say today, Brett, we actually do both at the same time because we're not exactly sure of what order our partner is going to want to proceed in. So from a geographic expansion point of view, for example, and most focused in Asia, in Australia, South Korea and Japan and markets that we're not in from an expansion point of view and, of course, getting bigger in India and Mainland China in terms of market that we're actually in today. In Latin America, we're obviously in Brazil. We'd like to be bigger in Brazil. We're not in Mexico and some other markets directly in Latin America today, as we would like to be. So we're focused on those as well. In Europe, I think we're opportunistic. As I've said on prior calls, we haven't seen transactions and assets there that have a great rate of return to make us feel comfortable to pursue them. So it doesn't mean that we don't see opportunities. We see opportunities all over the world. But it does mean, as David mentioned, that we do balance from a capital allocation point of view where our returns are. And today, we haven't really seen those across Europe, although an exception to that would be in markets like Spain, where we have a direct partner in Caixa, and we've been able to add portfolios like Civica because we find those economics to be attractive because of our joint venture, Comercia. And then in North America, I would say we see opportunities continually in the U.S. Those tend to be more technology-enabled to the point that you were making unless, by definition, less expansion in the sense that there's a region that we're not in. We're in all of the U.S. and in all of Canada. So it's less about the regions necessarily by definition and more about, are there vertical markets that we can make a difference in, and are there technologies like APT and integrated, that we think we can really make additional returns in from pursuing those avenues? So to come back where you started, I think we're opportunistic on all these things. It really depends on what's available and what those returns are.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then just quick follow-up. David, on the P&L, there was a fairly large other operating benefit that we saw and they were just larger than what we had modeled in kind of in the past. Was there anything unusual there that we should think about?","David E. Mangum","What we -- Brett, when you say other operating, are you talking about on the GAAP income statement? Are you talking about other income?","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, other income. I apologize.","David E. Mangum","And a -- from a cash earnings perspective or...","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I was just looking at it from just a straight-up GAAP.","David E. Mangum","Oh, yes. So straight-up GAAP, what you're seeing there is the gain on Brazil. So when we had our partners at Caixa enter into the 50-50, they put $2 million into the venture and then as I think we've discussed, they also committed to incrementing their investment level up until it matches our life-to-date investment level. So that initial capital inflow resulted in a gain and that's what you're seeing on the GAAP income statement.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And do you back that out? How do you adjust that, if at all, for the cash?","David E. Mangum","Right. So we back that out for cash earnings purposes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan with Janney.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I had a question on the ISO channel and the trends you're seeing in the strength of the interchange. Have you seen -- can you just talk about the trends you're seeing there? And I think last quarter you mentioned that there was some expectation that there's some prices or fees that the ISOs were going to possibly layer on during the quarter and if you actually saw that happen with the impact where it was on the spreads there?","David E. Mangum","Yes. Tom, it's David. The ISOs -- I think what we tend to say about the ISOs and fees is the piece of the ISOs that are difficult to predict for us tend to be when they choose to fee their customers. So we have, as you might have imagined, a reasonable forecast model how their transactions flow and what that's going to turn into in terms of their spreads and how it drives revenue for the company and then our per-transaction rates to them, what that's going to mean for real revenue and economic benefit to the company. But then if they happen to fee their customers on top of that, that's 100% revenue, 100% expense for the company and it affects margins. If you look at Q2, our last reported quarter, the actual fees were really not different from what we thought going in. Hence, we're really not talking about them today in terms of variance analysis or something analytic that's going to affect your view of the model. But from time to time, those will vary. And to the extent an ISO decides, particularly one of our larger ISOs, decides to heavily fee a customer in any given quarter, that can affect revenue growth to the positive but margins the negative but really not a lot on that and nothing new and nothing really quantify for you for Q2.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then given the very well-publicized data breach at Target, is there any takeaways from that, that you feel you can tell or share with us in terms of implication longer term for the merchant-acquiring industry?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Tom, it's Jeff. I'll start. I'm sure David will contribute as well. So listen, I think it is absolutely something, as you know, that we're very focused on, given the exposure in the industry and given our background. As you've mentioned a number of times, we're investing $17 million incrementally this year in added security and that, of course, is a cost of doing business in our industry. It's certainly unfortunate in terms of what's going on at Target. I don't really know the details any more than you do. I do think changes over time from the networks, like EMV, will help certain aspects of what's going on in the industry but they're not cure-alls. So for example, EMV, by itself, doesn't really address non-face-to-face or card-not-present transactions. And I don't know all of the specifics of Target, but that is an area that people are focused on. And you probably saw the networks announced in the last few months that they're also lobbying tokenization for some of the mobile and other types of transactions to further enhance security. So we're a big proponents of all those things. We're obviously making substantial investments in our own infrastructure. But I'm not sure if there's anything other than what we've seen to date that would change our view or anyone's view in the industry as to how important security is and the fact that there are bad guys out there.","David E. Mangum","Yes, and I think that's very well said. I would just say no one knows better than we what folks at Target are going through. We've a lot of empathy for them and wish them well. It certainly reminded all of us to stay vigilant, but I can't add anything to what Jeff had to say.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So just a couple of quick questions. One, I just wanted to clarify in the reconciliation in the back of the press release, it says there's about $3.3 million of termination costs be added back in the quarter. And just wanted to clarify what kind of headcount reductions you've been doing, and where and to what extent does that benefit the guidance?","David E. Mangum","So Chris, that's a couple of movements that had to do with our leadership transition and having nothing to do with anyone on this call, to be very specific, and it has actually absolutely no benefit to the cash earnings for this year.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, got you. And then just one quick one on the ISO comment. Just wanted to clarify the slowdown in growth there, at least, the slight slowdown in growth, is that purely being driven by the ISOs themselves? Or is there any decision on your part to kind of consciously slow that down?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","No. It's not a decision in our part, Chris. I think David hit the nail on the head with his comment before. It really is growth rates relates to law of large numbers. If you think, Chris, about the comparisons over the last 3 or 4 years in terms of our rates of growth, you had things like Durbin regulatory reform come down the pipe, which, as they've annualized, substantially at the time, increased the rates of revenue growth. And then from a transactional point of view, to the extent that it lowered the cost of acceptance for merchants, also had the beneficial effect of changing demand in the market for card-acquiring services as price reductions, in general, if you sense [ph] that their pass-through do. So I think as David said, you're really lapping large growth rates and large numbers, and that's our -- really our view of what you're seeing. And to add to what David said as well, I do think this is probably the second or third quarter that we've gone through with you guys in a row, where we've seen the law of large numbers impact the rate of growth of the ISO business. So I really view it as nothing new.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question was really about just going back to the slower ISO growth and I kind of get the law of large numbers comment. But as you think of North America and particularly, the U.S., you have APT pretty doing well. You have the ISO portion potentially slowing. Could you comment on the eventual direct versus indirect ratio that you want to get to and what you're doing to further increase the direct portion? It's clearly more profitable as well.","David E. Mangum","Yes. Ashwin, it's David, and it's a great question. So pieces of this, as Jeff said a moment ago, are out of our control. The ISOs are great partners. We serve them well for the last decade and beyond. That will continue to grow. It's certainly incumbent on us to continue to grow our other channels around them and make sure that we, with the partner-of-choice strategy, have arrayed a series of channels and distribution mechanisms that allow us to grow for the long term, hence, our focus on integrated payments, our focus on either directly or with partners driving access to mobility, mobile payments, tablet processing, whatever is going to be the paradigm that merchants use and consumers use for processing over time. And that kind of complexity is nothing but good for us. So I think it's fair to say if we're to look out, we expect an ever-greater proportion of direct distribution base revenue, in other words, revenue we control more directly, merchants we control more directly. Look for us to do that organically with investments in additional channels, investments in additional technology, like rolling out the mobility we've rolled out over the last 2 years, but also that's obviously a core part of the M&A strategy Jeff has described a couple of times in the questions earlier tonight.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Does that -- down the road, I know you guys have not talked about G2 for a while, but down the road, does that affect how G2 eventually rolls out in your client base?","David E. Mangum","No, I really don't think so. It's an interesting question. I think it affects how we bring transactions to G2 and to our other front ends around the world. And we are happy and capable of processing -- or happy to and capable of processing any transaction coming to us in any fashion around the world. That can be coming to us on a mobile device acting as a terminal. It can come to us -- bring a transaction from a mobile device functioning as a wallet, can sort of a [ph] completely different application in mobile. We're happy to process sort of any transaction anywhere in any fashion. From there it can go to whatever authorization engine and platform we process because we'll enable that to accept transactions from any adapter or any device.","Operator","We will take the last question from Steven Kwok with KBW, after which, Mr. Sloan will close the call.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question around the tax rate. Was there anything particular in this quarter? And then I believe you're guiding to a full year of about 29%, just wanted to see what the moving pieces are, what to expect in the coming quarters.","David E. Mangum","Yes, nothing particularly odd this quarter, Steven. And in fact, we're on sort of a similar path to the flow of last year. Our -- because of the way some of the tax rates have changed, particularly in Europe, we typically will have our highest tax rate in Q1. We posted 30.8% on a cash basis, a face [ph] of the P&L tax rate in Q1. We just posted 27.8%, on the way to approaching 29%. You should see quarters similar to this one over the course of Q3 and Q4. But there are no one-timers or anything like that. This is actually the pattern we expected for the year.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks very much, everyone, for joining us this evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference will be recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Investor Relations, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane M. Forbes","Thanks. Good afternoon, and welcome to Global Payments' Fiscal 2012 Fourth Quarter and Year-End conference call. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour. Joining me on the call are Paul Garcia, Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sloan, President; and David Mangum, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary, which are discussed in our public releases, including our most recent 10-Q and 10-K. We caution you not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call.","In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these results more clearly reflect comparative operating performance.","For a full reconciliation of cash earnings to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K dated today, July 26, 2012, which may be located under the Investor Relations area on our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now I'd like to introduce you to Paul Garcia. Paul?","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, Jane, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'd like to begin with an update on the data intrusion and the substantial progress we've made to date. I'm pleased to report that our investigation is now completed, and we are actively executing the remediation plan. In regard to returning to the list of PCI-compliant service providers, a qualified security assessor, or QSA, is conducting an independent review of our active remediation activities. Please be assured that we are progressing as rapidly as possible.","In the meantime, we continue to sign new merchants and process transactions around the world for all card brands with the same high level of service our customers have come to expect. Given the challenges we faced this year, I am pleased with the revenue and earnings growth we delivered in fiscal 2012.","Revenue grew 18% to $2.2 billion, and cash earnings per share grew 15% to $3.53 over prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and debit legislation, our core cash operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 21%.","Our North American segment benefited from solid U.S. transaction growth fueled by our ISO and direct channels, partially offset by continued pricing pressure in Canada. Internationally, Europe's strong results were driven by the addition and growth of Spain, the February 2011 U.K. back-end migration and significant market share expansion in Russia. Our Asia business grew more modestly, but continued to improve its contribution to income growth in the international segment.","Additionally, during fiscal 2012, we successfully completed 3 targeted acquisitions increasing our distribution in Russia, adding a merchant acquiring business in Malta and expanding our e-commerce presence in the U.S. by acquiring the CyberSource portfolio.","We also expanded our domestic footprint in China. Recently, we added 3 new regions for China UnionPay acquiring: Guangzhou and Szechuan provinces and the City of Shenzhen. These significant geographies collectively represent over 175 million people. And we continued to make progress on adding other new regions.","It is important to note that we remain the only non-Chinese merchant acquirer licensed to process CUP renminbi transactions in the People's Republic of China.","Additionally, I am absolutely delighted to announce we have signed an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in our joint venture in Asia-Pacific from HSBC. Our partnership in Asia-Pacific now evolves from a joint venture to a marketing alliance. Our performance in Asia-Pacific with HSBC support has provided a strong foundation for long-term growth. We intend to leverage our presence there to increase our market penetration across the region. We could not ask for a more supportive partner than HSBC. The strength of their brand and reputation is unparalleled, and we look forward to playing our small part in their global strategy.","Turning to fiscal 2013. Even in a challenging global macroeconomic environment, we anticipate 8% to 10% revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Canada remains a modest headwind as we navigate through competitive market conditions. However, I want to remind you that Canada will continue to provide significant cash, which helps fuel other investment opportunities.","In 2013, we will continue our technology investment program, with the expectation that these investments will both strengthen our technology infrastructure and improve our long-term operating leverage. We will also increase our investment in Asia as we continue to execute our expansion plans in that region. We intend to use our capital flexibility in 2013 to make additional strategic acquisitions, and we also intend to return cash to shareholders through our newly authorized share repurchase program.","Now I'll turn the call over to David.","David E. Mangum","Thank you, Paul. For our fourth quarter, we delivered solid financial performance with revenue growth of 15% to $597 million and cash earnings per share of $0.97 or 13% growth. These results exclude special charges. The pretax charge in the fourth quarter related to the data intrusion was $84 million and includes an estimate for charges from the payment networks, cost of the investigation, as well as initial expenses related to remediation. We anticipate that in 2013, there will be adjustments and additional net charges of $25 million to $35 million after insurance proceeds of as much as $28 million are applied. As all of the costs are finalized, we true up our estimate for charges from the networks and we execute remediation. Other special charges in the fourth quarter included employee termination benefits and the settlement of 2 contractual disputes.","Our cash operating income increased 15% to $123 million with operating margin of 20.5%, which was flat with prior year, reflecting the unfavorable effects related to the debit legislation and the 3 acquisitions we discussed last quarter.","Now let's move on to our segment results. North America Merchant Services revenue grew 17% for the quarter, with U.S. revenue growth of 25% and U.S. transaction growth of 13%. Canada declined 9% for the quarter, with transaction growth similar to last quarter at 6%. International revenue increased 10% for the quarter compared to last year, with Europe and Asia producing 11% and 5% growth, respectively. North America operating income or EBIT dollars grew 11% in the fourth quarter. International operating income grew 17% in the fourth quarter, with another quarter of strong margin improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year. During the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, currency changes negatively affected revenues and cash earnings by about $9 million and $0.03 per share, respectively, with the most significant impact from the Canadian dollar and the euro.","The impact on revenue and earnings for the full year 2012 was slightly positive, adding $2 million to revenue and $0.01 to cash earnings per share as we had anticipated. For fiscal 2012, we generated free cash flow of $258 million. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement, assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests.","Our capital expenditures totaled $110 million for the year, about 1\/2 of which relates to data center and network infrastructure initiatives.","Now let's turn to 2013. We expect North America revenues to grow at a high single to low double-digit level. This reflects consistent growth in the United States of low double digits. And we expect Canada to decline slightly in local currency due to continued market-based pricing pressures. We anticipate that our international revenues will grow in the mid-single digits in U.S. dollars. We expect Asia-Pacific to return to low double-digit growth. We expect mid-single-digit growth rates in local currency in the United Kingdom and in Spain. We expect the Czech Republic's revenue in local currency to be about flat. Russia continues to perform strongly for us, and we expect it to grow over 20% in local currency. When you translate this performance into U.S. dollars, given the strengthening of the dollar, this results in low single-digit growth overall in a difficult macro environment in Europe.","Our fiscal 2013 outlook includes incremental technology spending, which affects our earnings growth by as much as 2 percentage points. This is a continuation of the program we initiated prior to the data intrusion and represents a transformation of our data center, network and underlying processing infrastructure, along with compliant spending related to card network initiatives like EMV and the fixed acquired network fee or FANF. Additional technology spending related to security remediation has not been included in our cash earnings expectations.","In North America, excluding increased technology spend, we expect cash EBIT dollars to be about flat compared to last year with our core U.S. business modestly increasing, offset by a decline in Canada. Internationally, we expect EBIT dollars to increase in the mid-single digits on a reported basis. We expect overall company cash operating margins to decline approximately 150 basis points on a reported basis. We expect foreign currency to negatively affect cash earnings per share this year by approximately $0.08, assuming downward pressure from all currencies, with the most significant impact coming from the euro in Spain and the British pound. We expect these currency headwinds to be more heavily weighted in the first half of fiscal 2013. We anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately 29% and our diluted share count to be about $80 million.","We expect the Asia acquisition to close during our fiscal second quarter. This transaction extends the period of our existing deal so that HSBC will provide exclusive referrals to Global Payments until 2021. The purchase price is USD $242 million. Given that we already fully consolidate the joint venture, the accounting for the acquisition will not change our revenue or operating income. It will, however, eliminate the impact of the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest from Asia. There will be no incremental purchase accounting amortization on a GAAP basis. Assuming an October 1 close date, we expect as much as $0.07 of cash earnings per share from this acquisition, and this is included in our expectations for 2013.","We expect our capital expenditures will be about $110 million. Our total available cash, including working capital as we enter 2013, is approximately $270 million, and our credit facility has approximately $370 million available.","In terms of the sequence of quarterly earnings per share, we expect first quarter cash earnings per share to be slightly down over Q1 of 2012 as a result of currency translation. We expect the distribution of quarterly earnings to be roughly consistent with that of 2012. Based on our current assumptions and including the Asia acquisition, we expect annual fiscal 2013 revenue to range from $2,360,000,000 to $2,400,000,000, reflecting 7% to 9% growth and our cash earnings per share to be in the range of $3.59 to $3.66, reflecting 2% to 4% growth over fiscal 2012.","On a constant currency basis, we expect revenue to grow 8% to 10% and cash earnings per share to grow 4% to 6% over fiscal 2012. These expectations exclude any impact from potential share repurchases.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, David. As I reflect on our fiscal 2013 objectives, I want to highlight the fact that we will be growing transactions processed worldwide at a double-digit rate in a very challenging economic climate. We will also continue to grow U.S. EBIT. And our European businesses are extremely well positioned for both organic and inorganic expansion. The data intrusion incident will soon be behind us, and we will emerge with a world-class technology infrastructure offering future operating leverage.","Lastly, and I believe the most exciting opportunity of all, is the ability to expand meaningfully across Asia. To be clear, I am not satisfied with our 2013 earnings expectation. Our company has historically performed at a much higher level, and I have every expectation that we will return to those performance levels. However, I believe it is prudent in a year in which we will be dedicating significant resources to building our systems infrastructure to be cautious in regard to our earnings growth.","Our faith in our future and our desire to return value to our shareholders is underscored by our board's approval to purchase up to $150 million of our company's stock.","I'll now turn the call over to Jane. Jane?","Jane M. Forbes","Thanks, Paul. Even before we begin the question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up in order to try to accommodate everybody in the queue. Thank you, and operator we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dave Koning with R.W. Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess first of all, I was just wondering. In North America, it looked like an almost unnaturally high both revenue growth and margin. I was wondering it almost looks like there might have been a term fee or some sort of onetime item. I'm just wondering what maybe that might have been?","David E. Mangum","Sure, Dave. This is David. It's not really onetime items. A couple of things going on there. First is strong seasonality out of the ISO channel. In addition, as you know, if you come on year-over-year rather than sequentially, you'll have the effect of debit legislation there. The beginning of the FANF filling occurred as well, the new FANF filling that's rolling out across the market right now. Also in our Q4 in the United States, which will roll to North America, you have a typical greater giving seasonality with that small business unit does 100% of its earnings for the year in Q4 alone. And I think on sort of a full quarter basis, again depending on whether you're comparing sequentially or year-over-year, remember that our CyberSource relationship evolved from an indirect net revenue relationship to a gross revenue. So all those pieces kind of come together for a very strong Q4, but really about what we expected. Really, in fact, an over-performance in revenue, but in terms of rolling it down to the EBIT line, about what we expected.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess my follow-up question, just in APAC, you are calling for a little bit of deceleration relative to the new style is to be in a theme like 20% or 15%, 20% or more. In your contra-deceleration, I know China is coming on. Is that something that you'd expect to have some sort of reacceleration in the next year or 2 or 3 years as some of those Chinese transactions came on more strongly?","David E. Mangum","Yes, that's a part of the answer. And just to make sure I'm answering your question, you're speaking to the revenue across Asia, the growth?","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes.","David E. Mangum","Yes. So if we think about Asia for the full year in 2012 was a 7% growth and in particular, 5% in Q4. We really expect low double digits as we said earlier in the prepared comments in Asia and that is -- it has to do with a number of things. One of them, quite frankly, is that comparables get a little bit easier. Remember, this past year, we were rolling over very tough comparables, large retailer, rolling out new products and the fact that we have rolled out our own new products sort of sequentially over the course of the year before. So that comparable gets a little bit easy. It gets to a more normalized year-over-year comparable, which is always helpful. We do have an accelerated roll out, and we do expect accelerated growth in China to your point. And as you also correctly pointed out, the end result of that is the additional sales folks and some other infrastructure in China as we add these new regions. So it doesn't all drop then to the operating line. And then finally, we've got a number of scheduled rollouts of new products and\/or promotions across the regions that we think fuel us back to the level of growth one would expect from these Asian markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Kissane with Credit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And congratulations on the HSBC deal.","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And following up on that, can you really discuss how you'll operate that business differently now that you have complete control? And then maybe, David, if you can give us some insight in terms of valuation, in terms of what you paid on an EBIT and EBITDA basis?","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. Well I'll take -- as you suggested, we'll do just that order. So this is Paul. The opportunity here is all about expanding our market share in some areas where HSBC had a rather small presence. Not because they lacked the desire or the intent, but they were quite frankly limited by a number of forces, China and India in particular. So we're going to be focused on expanding those markets with some additional partnerships going forward. Now how our relationship changed with them is basically just economic. In terms of referrals, in terms of partnership, in terms of all of the branches directing new business towards us, that continues. In fact, it continues to 2021. David, is that correct?","David E. Mangum","That's correct.","Paul R. Garcia","2021. So that's all terrific news. But the real sizzle to that steak, Jim, is taking advantage of these opportunities in China and taking advantage of opportunities in India, which we've been talking about for a very long time. And in not too many days from now, that's where I'm heading.","David E. Mangum","And, Jim, if I may put a final point, that's an extension of our referrals to 2021, which we're quite pleased about. Now speaking to the purchase price of $242 million, I'll probably stay away from a specific multiple, but certainly on the EBITDA, but let me characterize it a bit. I think this will help. We arrived at that number in the collegiate conversations with the bank that I think appropriately reflect the growth in Asia to date, as well as the opportunity for further growth in Asia. And double-digit growth, the opportunity policies described certainly is going to put you in that sort of a range where you expect a healthy multiple, and it is just that low double-digit kind of multiple. But without putting a precise number on it, I think it reflects the growth we've achieved and the scale we've achieved, as well as the future growth. And I think both parties are pleased with the outcome.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So low double-digit multiple?","David E. Mangum","I think that's the way to think about it, yes.","Paul R. Garcia","Jim, this is Paul again. I think you have to really listen to what David said though to get the feel for it. I mean without HSBC, we would not have been in that market. Now -- they are now participating to the tune of 44%. And the real opportunity will be forthcoming. If they won't be participating economically, they deserve to be compensated somewhat for that. And that's partly what this was in all fairness.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And you know what you're buying? I get that. And one last question, David, I was a little confused in terms of the remediation costs on data securities. So you're not including any estimate in your 2013 guidance? I mean you talked about a $25 million and that was after insurance. So it sounds like one was a charge and you've not included any estimate in terms of ongoing remediation, is that right? And maybe...","David E. Mangum","Yes. So let me try and polish it a little more clearly, Jim. We don't intend to reflect remediation costs in 2013 in our cash earnings per share as we go through the year. So it's clearly not in the cash earnings per share expectations. Now having said that, as we look to our GAAP expectations, it's difficult for us to precisely estimate the true-ups right now. There's a full process the networks go through. It's very rigorous. It's frankly incredibly impressive, as you sit on the other side of it and work with the networks at the level of sophistication that goes into this. But it takes some time to roll out as they do the right things for issuers, consumers and then in all fairness, the acquirers and the processors involved as well. So it's difficult for us to estimate any true-ups to our current estimates for charges in the networks. To that you'd marry remaining investigation costs that we have already accrued to date, as well as remediation costs. Those we can estimate a little bit better but overall, difficult for us to put a precise number on it. So we offered you, in the prepared comments and also in the footnotes that I think is Schedule 9 in the press release, is we believe the range will probably appear to be something on the order of $25 million to $35 million net of insurance. Now we have $28 million of remaining insurance capacity. So that would put you in the $50 million to $60 million kind of range gross, $25 million to $35 million net. And as we go through the year, we'll be truing those charges up and recording actuals and we'll certainly report those. And obviously, we expect a little bit of a far better feel for a more precise estimate as we report Q1. But that really -- those are the pieces. So it won't be in cash, regardless we've tried to keep it fairly clean cash year-over-year view, so you can assess the progress of the business on that side. The security remediation will be charged to GAAP but difficult to put a precise number and hence, our GAAP earnings expectation range does not yet accommodate whatever the remediation plus true ups will be as we go through particularly ahead with the first 2 quarters of 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","David, I wanted to ask on the 150 bps in margin decline for fiscal '13. Can you break that up or decompose that for us between FX. I think you say incremental tech and compliance costs. Anything you could do to break it up would be great.","David E. Mangum","Yes, be happy to, Tien-Tsin. So let me walk you through the pieces. As usual with Global Payments, the single biggest piece is the impact of the ISO channel in the United States. Now remember, that ISO impact is going to include the ongoing effect of the debit legislation changes, as well as the impact of FANF filling, which is yet -- and we're really just rolling out in now, so there may be a little risk to -- further margin issues there. But I think it's at the margin at best -- margin issue at the margins, sorry about that. Remember also related to the ISO CyberSource moves from an indirect relationship quite profitable in the face of the P&L to becoming an ISO as well. That's already implicit in some of what you saw in our Q3 and Q4 results. But that really is the biggest chunk right there. Now having said that, you have a number of other smaller things that take us the other direction as well. The continued spread declines in Canada, which we expect to be able to partially offset with some other actions we're taking in Canada, but still the spread declines are what they are. They're profit in what is a very profitable piece of our business overall. We've got investment costs in Asia which are really small, but are part of the pieces -- a part -- one of the pieces of this. We've got the tech investment that we referenced in our prepared comments on the overall infrastructure, currency as well particularly. Now as currency hits some of our higher-margin jurisdictions like United Kingdom and Spain, which has been growing in its margin nicely. And then remember we did -- and this is quite small, but we did bring in the Alfa, the Russian acquisition and the Malta acquisition at lower margins. So let me get back and summarize this a bit. Biggest single chunk is the ISO including the CyberSource change. And then also roughly the same size incrementally, Canada, the tech investment, currency with a little bit more from Asia and the acquisitions from last year to take you to your roughly 150 bps plus or minus.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. ISO the biggest and the rest is pretty much equal. So just my follow-up, the Canada component. I think the guidance seems very reasonable given what you've talked about. But is there a chance to revive growth there, maybe with new products like DCC or something else on the horizon? Or is it pretty much it is what it is?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Tien-Tsin, it's Jeff. I think there's absolutely an opportunity to do that. You'd note it in our release recently that we have rolled out DCC in Canada recently. One of our avenues of minimizing any headwind that Paul referred to in his comments, is new products, additional sales and to be honest, some of the expense actions that we referenced in the fourth quarter of 2012. And in that fourth quarter, there was a very small piece of fiscal 2012 that had the impact of those expense reductions, for example. And I also mentioned in the last call that we've actually rolled a fair amount of the operations into U.S., into the Owings Mills service center as well. Very little of that, just given the time of year, was encompassed in the fourth quarter of 2012 fiscal, and we'll have the full year effect of that in fiscal '13. So it's a variety of avenues of attack, Tien-Tsin, to make that modest headwind even less than might otherwise be. And very much as David alluded to in the fourth quarter of fiscal '12, we're very focused on growing North American EBIT dollars in the aggregate as David described. And I would say our focal point, therefore, is to turn that headwind into something that generates additional EBIT dollars in that market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roman Leal with Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So if we just look, I guess, on the share buyback. Can you give us some sense of how much flexibility you have to actually execute on that buyback? And I guess given your commentary that a lot of these pressures from currency will be heavily weighted towards the first half, would you be -- I mean I guess are you looking after potential use in that a little bit more in the first half versus second half?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes, Roman, I can -- this is Paul. I can say this that we -- I think actions speak louder than words. We have announced several of these in the past, and it's been our practice to execute upon them in a fairly quick manner. Other than that, I think we would be -- it would be inappropriate to give you kind of exact data on that. But we put these out, we execute on them. David, maybe you can follow up on that?","David E. Mangum","No, I think you've summarized it.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as we -- I guess we think what's left to be -- to do here with the breach, you're obviously still actively trying to get back on the PCI list of providers. Can you walk us through the process or maybe are you kind of -- what kind of inning are you in there and what's really left to be done there?","Paul R. Garcia","So it's a couple of ball games, to use that metaphor. We finished one game. It's a doubleheader. So we finished the -- our investigation. And now we're at a point where we are working with all the card associations, and they are taking all this data and compiling it and trying to understand any other liabilities associated with it. And as David mentioned, this process they have in place is unbelievably thorough. And quite frankly, it really works. I mean, I could tell you from someone who's seen it from a vantage point I never want to see again. But this is -- they are very professional people who are focused on this, and they're doing a really terrific job. Now with that said and done, we are so focused on getting this rock back, I can't tell you. But we will clearly, with every expectation, we'll clearly get this back before the end of the calendar year. Hopefully, we'll get it back quicker than that. But our company working collaboratively with all the brands is just ticking off all the boxes relevant to make sure that happens. So in terms of innings on that, I would say that game is probably bottom of the second.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally on the M&A pipeline, you're obviously very focused on Asia-Pacific and you also made commentary on Europe. If you had to maybe pick where you're mostly focused on or you see the most attractive pipeline, would you say it's in kind of pursuing the Continental Europe deal or something in Asia-Pacific?","Paul R. Garcia","It's a little bit -- we call it the steak or lobster choice here. I mean they're both delicious, they\u2019re both different. So the -- let's take Continental Europe. The issues in Europe -- we have a partner in Spain who is doing terrifically. They're making acquisitions. I think there'll be excellent opportunities to do some more there at very advantageous prices. There -- because of what's going on in Europe, there are opportunities in some big European countries for some brands you would recognize. And we would be foolish not to take a full advantage of that if we could. Now moving over to China and India, which I mentioned in particular, HSBC have been hamstrung, Roman, in the past from really operating. They're like limited to 40-something branches in India, for example. So we now have an opportunity to work with others, and we've had a lot of conversations that have only been notional. Now we can have real conversations about expanding our presence there and what we bring to that party and how we make that happen. If you force me, I would say those are probably the most momentous for the company. But the opportunities in Europe were actually nice too.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","I would just add to that -- Roman, it's Jeff, that we go with where the opportunity is. So a lot of this is driven by where we see the supply of good quality companies. I think Paul is right to point out the tailwinds we see for our business, in M&A, in the markets you described, I would see -- I'd also say that we see a lot of activity in the United States today to somewhat lesser extent in Canada. And we actually are now seeing a fair amount of activity in Latin America, including in particular, in Brazil. Some of that in those markets is driven by capital, some is driven by some of the changes that you've seen in some of those markets, particularly in the Brazilian marketplace. So to a certain extent, it's a function of what availability is. That I would say in all the markets that Paul described, including in the U.S., we feel like we have a tailwind, and the trend is really going in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie Holding.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","I wondered if you could clarify, the incremental technology spending, if I heard it right, it's going to be about 2% of revenue in 2013. How much of that will be kind of recurring year-to-year versus one time in nature as we think about 2014 and up?","David E. Mangum","Right. So to clarify, Kevin, it negatively affects cash earnings growth by as much as 2 percentage points. So it's not 2% of revenue. It's -- and guides your earnings growth of -- on the order of 2 points. And what we're trying to do, we're trying to complete an investment cycle related to our core technology infrastructure. So networks, data centers, transaction processing engines that we started last year as you may recall. At the end of that pipeline, the end of that process, we have to have a better, mostly fixed-cost infrastructure that's more leverageable for the long term of the company. So as we head into '14 on this specific investment thread of sort of the core processing infrastructure, physical and logical, we don't think that's a headwind in 2014. We think 2014 is where you sort of normalize and begin to see some of the benefits of that fixed cost. The fixed cost really come in for the long term. And then as you well know, that's how we're thinking about our investments whether they're strategic, technical products, et cetera. So I think that's the way to think about that specific set of investments for the core infrastructure that are negatively affecting our earnings growth this year, as they did a little bit in 2012 as well, you may recall.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess my first question for David. Just looking at the operating margins by segment, it looks like North America is probably going to be down maybe as much as 200 to 250 basis points. I guess after the fourth quarter was only down 100, I just want to see what else could be in there? What else is driving that? I know we talked about a lot of different moving pieces, but I'd be interested to know why the drop is so significant. And then the second piece to that is that the international margins doesn't look like the EBIT is growing like it used to, and what's causing that to kind of come to a halt?","David E. Mangum","Yes, sure. So with North America at the margin -- or on the margin, Bryan, the first change on a year-over-year basis since we are going say sort of relative to changes is the ISO growth that continues to negatively affect it, which is being enhanced now by the flip of CyberSource from an indirect net revenue, high-margin customer to an ISO lower margin, same customer now growing widely for us as we access that portfolio and continue to get referrals. But flipping up in terms of the accounting treatment married to the full year impact of the debit legislation from last year and the introduction of the FANF filling as we go through 2013. Then you have the FX impact on Canada and then also just the sheer sort of negative revenue performance is, of course, resulting in negative earnings performance from Canada overall. And then as you may recall, the majority of our technology spending is allocated to the North American segment, and that's a big number that's affecting that margin as well in the North American side. So that -- and by the way, your sort of back of the envelope guesstimate of that 200-plus basis points is right in the ballpark. So if you move now to international you're right, there's an implicit sort of slower earnings growth coming from international and it really has to do with a couple of features. One is as you might imagine, we're cautious on the macro particularly in Europe. We all read the same headlines, the same articles about Spain especially. And remember now, we have businesses in the U.K., Spain, Malta, Czech Republic. So we're more and more \"near-term\" year-over-year European exposure, and that'll hold things down a bit. And of course, FX materially impacts the growth rate in international. And you've several points of growth depending on your modeling assumptions. From an international segment perspective, we'd go away due to FX on a year-over-year basis.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just let me ask one follow-up to Paul. Paul, you mentioned cash EPS growth of 4% to 6% is not what the GPN story is about. So I guess, help us feel a little bit better about the future GPN story as we get past fiscal year '13. What can change? Because a lot of these issues seem like they're structural and not quick fixes.","Paul R. Garcia","Well, Bryan, I appreciate that opportunity, and David said a big piece of it. We're building a technology platform that's going to provide operating leverage. That's a big one. On the investments in Asia, which are a piece of that headwind they\u2019re going to be -- and by the way, if we didn't make those investments in Asia, you should be disappointed in us. They're going to pay real dividends. The FX, I mean who knows which way that goes, which way those winds blow. I mean that is we kind of just deal with that. And quite frankly, the more we expand internationally, the more we'll be buffeted by those winds, but I think that's a good thing. And then Canada is the last piece of that. And I think Jeff gave a pretty articulate -- sorry, Jeff, a very articulate answer as to what the upsides are there. So we're being cautious as we look at this year. But that's not our expectation. We have smart people running this, and we have every expectation that we're just not going to sit back and accept that. So, Bryan, the long answer to that question is this company will return with answers for every one of those headwind. We have plans in place, and you will see us pivot nicely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Asia-Pacific was down sequentially. That's what I see here in my table. And then Europe had a significant moderation in revenue growth. Is it possible just to touch on that what happened in Asia-Pacific? And then I'm assuming as you said you have some currency headwinds in terms of comps in Europe, but had a drop from 28% growth in February to 11% growth in May. So are we starting to see some of the macro kind of headwinds impacting growth? And if so, maybe you can talk a bit more about where we're seeing that impacting the slowdown?","David E. Mangum","Sure. So in Asia, relative to Q4, it really wasn't very far off of our expectations. There is a little bit of mix moving between our DCC and our e-commerce products. But really, the way to think about, I think, Q4 is to look forward to what changes we had into 2013, which are the rollout of some new promotions and new products that did not occur in Q4, married to getting through the easier comps of some of those kinds things and return to double-digit growth. I take your point, sequentially it was down as we thought through the programs and the promotions. We did not launch any in Q4, we're really launching earlier this year. At least their effect would be earlier this year. So that number itself didn't really strike us as sort of shockingly -- a shocking number off of whatever we might have expected. Now when you're talking about overall international growth -- and again, I want to make sure I answer the question you asked. You're preparing...","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Well, I'm talking about Europe. Europe, I think in May was up 28% year-over-year and then -- sorry in February. And then in May, Europe was up 11.4% year-over-year. That's a pretty big drop. Some of it is currency, but some of it seems to be just related to a core slowdown in the business. Maybe you can talk about that?","Paul R. Garcia","Well, I'm not sure you see a slowdown in the business. What you really find are a couple of things going on across Europe. And I'm going to over answer your question to make sure we talk about all the moving parts. Recall particularly when you look at anything related to Europe on a year-over-year basis and pick a quarter, we closed the acquisition in Spain in December a year ago. And so you've got some quarters with that comparable, some without that comparable, which changes your metrics drastically. Then also recall the timing of the United Kingdom reprice, which was effective February over a year ago. So it fully annualizes as you head into our Q4 of this year, our May quarter where before it had been fueling off a lot of growth as you may recall. So I don't think you\u2019re seeing a fundamental slowdown in our businesses across Europe in terms of their performance or the quality of the operations or the quality of how we're running the businesses. Now you do, and you raised a fair point, you do have to deal with macro realities in places like Spain and in the U.K., et cetera. But fundamentally, the businesses continue to add merchants, to add volume and they continue to grow and operate well. FX then kicks in as well on top of being maybe cautious on macro. But please recall the really material comparable changes that come out of that reprice, as well as the timing in Spain.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So if there -- if Europe slows down even more next year, isn't there more margin risk to the entire operation just given the fact that Europe is highly profitable?","Paul R. Garcia","Well I would say this. As we look out at the macro, we're not expecting anything materially better or materially worse. Certainly things get materially worse in pick a geography. Everything we're discussing could change depending on the geography, the size and the magnitude of the impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies & Company.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to circle back for a second to make sure I'm parsing the different pieces of the IT investments and make sure I've got it straight. So clearly, there was pre-breach IT investment going on. And then there is presumably some incremental ongoing, breach-related IT security-related expenses in fiscal '13. I'm not talking about the additional $25 million or $28 million of kind of one-time discharge, but just ongoing investments presumably. So I just wanted to validate if that in fact is correct. And is that post-breach ongoing IT security costs, are those in the 150 basis point decline for fiscal '13 margins or are they not? It wasn't clear.","David E. Mangum","Right. So let me parse it, Jason. It's a great question. Thanks for asking. Let me parse it a little bit more. So I think you've correctly characterized the sort of core technology infrastructure spend. It's in the numbers, part of the ongoing -- expected to create leverage for the long-term. Then there is a security remediation piece of this that will carry through 2013. Again, I think the bulk of it is obviously early in the year because it includes remediation and work on the rock, as well as appropriate remediation to make sure we've got the appropriate level of ongoing -- of an ongoing security posture. That is generally speaking all in the number that I suggested, that $25 million to $35 million net. Some of that will return as run rate probably in 2014. Our view of that is that in 2013, a lot of investments. Some of it returns the run rate in 2014, but it returns in a manageable form to 2014. So modest handful of earnings per share, shall we say, in 2014 coming out of investment level. And that's really I think the way to think about that investment. But generally speaking, yes, there is ongoing security inside the ongoing business and cash earnings, but that investment in enhancing our posture marry to remediation because the 2, quite frankly, are inseparable as we go through the remediation process with our partners. That's all set aside from the cash earnings for 2013.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just to go back to Canada. Obviously, you took the charge in the quarter, which you already told us about. The competitive conditions kind of are what they are. I just wanted to get a sense from you guys on where do you see Canada right now? Like have you kind of taken it as far as you can in terms of things you can control and now it's just kind of up to the macro environment and the competitive dynamics? Or are there Global Payments-specific initiatives that are still ongoing that you will continue to implement that will generate better performance for Canada, maybe not even in fiscal '13, but beyond? I just wanted to get a sense of are we going to be in kind of a perpetual sort of holding pattern in terms of top line in Canada just because of the market structure? Or are there some initiatives within your control that you're focused on implementing to fix this beyond the cost take out that obviously you just did? I know you talked about some client-retention tools over the last couple of quarters, for example.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Jason, it's Jeff. On Canada, I think the answer is there is a lot more we can do. So in addition to stuff I mentioned before that I think you just touched on, there are certain markets that were not really well represented in, in Canada. One would be the e-commerce or card-not-present business. So we talked about DCC which we had a release on, and we chatted about that a minute ago. But in certain markets like card-not-present e-commerce in Canada, we have a very small presence. We feel like we're underrepresented there. So we're very pleased in what we've done in the United States in that market in the last number of months. We are certainly taking intense look, Jason, at becoming bigger in that business, which will help both our growth and I think ultimately our margins. That's additional item to help the business. The other thing I'd say is that to a certain extent, the economy in Canada in our fourth fiscal quarter really was in the same place as it was in the third quarter, meaning, as we chatted about before, the third quarter we thought the economy in Canada was worse than it was in the first and second quarters. In the fourth quarter, it was really flat to the third quarter. So many of the trends that we saw in the third quarter that we reacted to are the same, they're not any worse. And we're assuming that will persist. So spread compression continues. But if -- as David mentioned before, if the economy kind of stays where it is, no better, no worse, coming out of the fourth quarter, we feel like we've taken all the right actions to make this a modest headwind or not even one as we enter fiscal '13. But I would be disappointed if we didn't do more by way of card-not-present, additional products like DCC and target sales in Canada to better position us into '14 and beyond.","Operator","We will take the last question from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus. After which, Mr. Garcia will give his closing statement.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you just give us a little detail, perhaps on both the U.K. and Spain as to where those numbers track either on a revenue or even better on a transaction basis? During the quarter, how much of a slowdown did you see through the month of May and even June if you could? And then what kind of spending slowdown is embedded in your guidance? Because as you noted, there are some pretty concerning headlines over there and we have seen some other issuers report some significant several hundred, almost 700 [ph] basis points slowdown at American Express in their Spain portfolio. Can you just give us a little color? Just wanted to figure out how conservative your international guidance is.","David E. Mangum","Sure, Chris. This is David. So if you look at Q4 on a year-over-year basis, you see 11% growth. That obviously is enhanced by the reprice as well as a few other pieces. That's the starting point. And that is obviously fueled a little bit by the acquisitions in Russia and Malta. I think the core, which is really what you're asking about, the U.K. and Spain is we expect mid-single-digit growth from each of those markets. Now that's a combination of a couple of things. Our market position in the United Kingdom, and we continue to take market share in the United Kingdom. So in local currency, mid-single-digit growth based on really good execution in the United Kingdom. We're not expecting high-single digit in some other numbers you've seen before. In Spain, we're looking for mid-single-digit as well in local currency. Probably maybe a little less than I expect in the U.K. given macro. And really in Spain, that's demonstrating the value of the partnership we built with Acacia. Their brand, their solid financial standing, their access to market and their continued growth help us as we work together fuel growth in a market where by all rights, that should be pretty darn difficult to do. So the pieces there are mid-single-digit, which reflects a little bit of assumption that macro is tough in both of those markets, but still expects good execution from our teams there. And we have seen no evidence to suggest why they wouldn't execute as well as they did the year before. Now obviously when you translate that to U.S. dollars, you're going to come back the other way and shrink that. In fact particularly in Spain, you can imagine what a huge impact on a year-over-year basis from the euro, big changes we saw. If you think about where the euro was beginning of last year and where we kicked off this year, that mid-single-digit growth is going to look the other direction in Spain on a year-over-year basis sort of by definition as you work through your model. The same thing will happen in the U.K., but you'll see a bit of a reduction. So I would characterize our view Europe is prudent and cautious, but still expecting we'll continue to take market share the way we have in the past.","Paul R. Garcia","And Chris, this is Paul Garcia, and that's where the growth is coming from. We're not expecting any tailwinds from greater card usage, et cetera, just the opposite. I mean we're getting our growth because we're signing more merchants, typically at the expense of someone else.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess I'm just wondering if the overall macro spending is falling, even if you're getting share, you're going slower. How do your mid-single digits for both of those compare to what you put up this quarter? I would hope that they would be a little bit lower. And then also in the North America region, the U.S. revenue slowdown that you're projecting for 2013, is there any assumptions for Durbin and that debt benefit's starting to weigh in, in your guidance?","Paul R. Garcia","So thank you for clarifying. The answer is yes, the growth expectations are lower for those markets in 2013 than they were in 2012. And on the U.S. side, relative to the debit legislation, it's fully in the numbers. As you've no doubt heard in your market checks, you haven't seen a lot of deterioration or attrition of that. So for us, to be perfectly frank, it's just in the numbers and part of processing for our merchants these days. And we don't think about it separately, and probably won't be talking about it much separately unless it's a margin-based conversation as we sort of annualize things over the course of 2013.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I was going to squeeze in one more, since I'm the last guy here. The acquisition of the HSBC business in Asia-Pacific, the cash you spent there relative to the cash you\u2019re spending on the buyback, can you give us a little more color? Because if I just do the math of buying back $208 million of additional stock at these levels, it's a lot more accretive than $0.08, so just the strategic benefits and the analysis that you went through in weighing those 2 options, help me feel a little more optimistic and a little more bullish on using that excess cash for acquisition at this point.","Paul R. Garcia","Sure, I'd be happy to. And I'll tell you quite honestly, that was not a difficult calculus for us at all. The opportunity in Asia, the growth available in those markets, the growth available particularly in China or in India for the long term, the value of the expansion of our relationship with HSBC and the ongoing partnership with HSBC, stands with no problem financially next to the near-term use of cash on the buyback.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So fair to say in future years, hopefully a lot more accretive than $0.07.","Paul R. Garcia","Absolutely. Fair to say.","David E. Mangum","Let also be clear, that's also for a partial year.","Paul R. Garcia","Yes.","Okay, well, first of all, thank you to everyone for joining us on today's call.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Heather, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Building on our momentum from 2017, the first quarter of 2018 was one of the strongest quarters we have ever produced. We accelerated growth across our markets, delivering double-digit organic growth in each region, 140 basis points of margin expansion, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 33%. 2018 is off to a fantastic start. These results compare favorably not only to our legacy direct peers, but also to the card networks, ecommerce providers, and other high-tech software and SaaS companies. We are immensely grateful to our customers, partners, and employees for helping us produce market-leading growth.","As we discussed at our Investor Conference in March, we are winning every day in the marketplace with the uniqueness of our model, and our evolving business mix toward technology enablement again fueled our results. Our integrated and vertical markets and ecom and omni solutions businesses continued to grow at double-digit rates in the first quarter, highlighting ongoing consistent execution.","Our technology-enabled businesses are distinct because of their distribution diversity, both by vertical market and geography, as well as through our ownership of software assets and partnership with leading software providers. In selected vertical markets, we control the full technology value stack, the entire means of production, creating deeper, richer and more value-added relationships with our customers.","We also offer a broad range of card-not-present solutions with concurrent face-to-face products in many of the most important markets worldwide with local sales, operational and technical support. As a result, we are more diverse than our peers. The results of this past quarter and really of the past five years reflect ongoing sustained share gains across our markets from these investments. No peer has a business at this scale globally with this mix of distribution and technology.","We are also pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Aspira, a Vista Equity Partners portfolio company to be its new payments technology partner. This is the third Vista portfolio company to select Global Payments as its partner in as many quarters. As we discussed in our February call, we continue to invest in leading-edge technologies to accelerate growth of product distribution and to provide seamless connectivity to our customers and partners in an increasingly complex world.","We are gratified that we have been able to deliver market-leading growth, while making significant investments across our infrastructure to provide for further scale in the future. We were also investing in partnerships to provide further growth by utilizing leading cloud platform-as-a-service providers to enrich our solutions with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. We are making substantial progress on our vision of cloud-based SaaS distribution of our technologies globally, providing further competitive differentiation of our businesses.","At the same time, we are further investing in our people, while giving back to the communities in which we live and work. To that end, I am very excited that Global Payments will host our fourth biannual Worldwide Day of Service on May 9. On that day, our 10,000 employees will serve others in need worldwide and raise awareness and funds for deserving organizations. These efforts provide an opportunity to build new partnerships with needworthy organizations and causes, and reinforces our common culture and teamwork around the globe.","We live at the intersection of technology and payments. Our outstanding first quarter results reflect the wisdom of our strategy to grow our tech-enabled businesses with software focus and sales leadership. We are doing exactly what we said we would do in October of 2015 and March of 2018.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As the results indicate, 2018 is indeed off to a terrific start. Our first quarter performance was exceptional, exceeding our expectations across our markets. And we achieved these results, while also continuing to meaningfully invest in our businesses, technologies, people and communities. Consolidated adjusted net revenue plus network fees for the first quarter was $924 million, a 17% increase over 2017. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.13, reflecting growth of 33% and adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 30.4%.","North American adjusted net revenue plus network fees was $677 million, reflecting growth of 17%. In the U.S., our direct distribution business delivered low double-digit normalized organic growth, accelerating sequentially from the previous quarter, while we saw a high single-digit decline in our wholesale business, consistent with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin in North America expanded 190 basis points to 31.6%. Margin expansion was driven by strong organic growth across our U.S. direct channels, in particular, our higher-margin technology-enabled businesses.","We again saw strong performance in Europe in the first quarter with adjusted net revenues plus network fees growing 22% or high-single digits on a constant currency basis. Local currency growth was driven by our business in Spain, reflecting ongoing strength in execution in share gains. Likewise, our ecommerce and omnichannel solutions business again grew double digits, as we continue to win in the market with our differentiated offerings. European adjusted operating margins were 45.5% for the quarter, roughly flat as compared against 2017.","Our Asia-Pacific business accelerated this quarter, reporting adjusted net revenue plus network fees growth of 15%. We saw solid trends across our key markets in Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines. Our technology-enabled businesses in Australia, once again, contributed meaningfully to growth in the region, collectively generating approximately 20% organic growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins in Asia expanded 240 basis points as a result of strong adjusted net revenue plus network fees performance, which served to further improve our scale across the region.","Excluding acquisition and integration costs, we generated free cash flow of approximately $177 million this quarter. We define free cash flows as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures totaled $44 million for the quarter. In addition, since the beginning of the year, we have reduced outstanding debt by nearly $400 million and our leverage as of the end of the quarter was approximately 3.4 times.","During the first quarter, we also completed a refinancing of our term loan B, which reduced the interest rate spread on the facility by 25 basis points. The refinancing will generate interest savings of approximately $2.8 million annually, which will help to offset some of the impact of rising underlying rates in 2018.","As a result of our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our outlook for 2018. We now expect adjusted net revenue plus network fees to range from $3.9 billion to $3.975 billion, reflecting growth of 13% to 15% over 2017. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to expand by up to 120 basis points.","Lastly, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to range from $5 to $5.20, reflecting growth of 25% to 30% over 2017.","We're extremely pleased with our first quarter results, which sets the stage for another year of strong operational and financial performance. Our unique strategy and relentless focus on execution positions us well for continued superior growth and value creation going forward.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Cameron. At our recent Investor Conference in Atlanta, we explained how our software-driven payments, both owned and partnered, global omnichannel capabilities, and exposure to faster growth markets create a differentiated model for Global Payments.","The first quarter of 2018 and our expectations to the next decade highlight the ongoing successes of our strategies and our vision for the future.","I'll now turn the call back to Heather.","Heather Ross - Global Payments, Inc.","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. And our first question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Morning, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I wonder, as you think about the long-term growth strategy for the business, are there any thoughts about building a common app ecosystem? You've seen a couple of your competitors at least in the U.S. stand up alongside their vertically integrated solutions, that kind of SMB ERP offering, and I realize you have it in specific verticals. Is there any thought about maybe pulling that all together to more deeply embed yourself with your customers?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Andrew. It's Jeff. Thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll ask David to comment as well.","So the answer is absolutely. If you think about how we go to market, for example, with our omnichannel solutions and our ecom solutions, a lot of that is driven, as you would expect today, by way of API. Those APIs are obviously exposed to our developer partners in our markets, and they do whatever coding that they would ultimately like. So we allow them to code into us, but we release those APIs in the form of software development kits that they can utilize. That's kind of one point.","Second, we obviously have our own software markets as we do in the case of Xenial, where clearly we've developed our own ecosystem, both completely owned as well as integrated with other software-related partners where that's appropriate.","So I would say the answer is yes in the sense that both the technology investments we've made, how we go to market today, PSD2 which, is coming, of course, this year, all encourages us to be an API-centric, SDK-centric source for our partners and software developers.","Now, if you back up for a second, though, what I would say, going back to another thrust of your question is, are we going to be consumer-centric in the way, for example, the Apple Store is, where you can go to Apple? The answer is our customer is really the merchant. Our customer is really not the consumer.","So if you think about how we go to market in our integrated and vertical markets businesses, we either own the software outright as you know, or we partner with people at the enterprise level.","As we talked about in our Investor Day, where we're different from a model, for example, like Square is that we get the benefit of deep integrations and rich integrations with our partners, which results in high retention. But we also get the benefit of catalyzed sales in the sense that our partner is selling and referring to us, and we're selling on top of that.","That is something that if you went back to Square's model or go to the Apple Store analogy, you really don't get because there isn't a lot of sales, you're just downloading it from the App Store. So I think the answer to the thrust of your question is yes. There obviously are differences in how we go to market that we laid out in March.","David, do you want to add any...","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, I'll add a little bit of color, Andrew. It's not as sexy, but we've been investing in what you might think of as abstraction or what would back in the day have been called middleware layers throughout the infrastructure to make it easier to plug into our infrastructure at any level, whether you're a customer, a partner, or another software provider.","So we're building what I would call mini ecosystems throughout the multiple layers, whether you're talking about the gateway level, the authorization level, the communication level, the service bus that allows and exposes all of our information to analytic partners. But I think I'd go back to what Jeff said as well. We are building the app-based infrastructures vertical by vertical as well, rather than maybe just a pure sort of generic app infrastructure.","For example, if you want to go look at our Xenial software, you can download that from an App Store and in 90 seconds you're up and running your restaurant. Now if you want to plug into that some additional functionality, feel free to do that with an app as well.","But we really believe, I think what Jeff said a moment ago, that the deep integration is incredibly powerful. So if you go to our OpenEdge business where one might think you really would have this App Store type functionality available, remember a lot of our competitive advantage there is that the payment app is in the point-of-sale system, it's fully omnichannel.","We have the dedicated support and the dedicated integration, making it all work seamlessly for the customer. We don't have a lot of partners asking us to just toss out their many apps and make them available and expose them to customers. They prefer the integration.","So we'll take that same deep integration approach whether we own the vertical or partner the vertical. Having said all that, the answer to your question fundamentally, as Jeff said, is yes, we're doing just that.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the detail. And as a quick follow-up, when you look at expanding your ecom business globally, how do you think about acquisitions like \u2013 recent acquisition of Weebly by Square?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, I lost you at the end there, Andrew, but I think you're asking about expanding ecommerce globally and acquisitions and the like.","So as you know, our model is to grow organically as well as through inorganic growth. We're very pleased with the acquisitions that we've done. We actually have a very full pipeline. We generally look at a number of criteria in how we do deals. First is the strategic fit, second is the cultural fit, and lastly is the financial returns that we can generate to our shareholders from doing transactional work. We look at ecommerce and omni acquisitions and partnerships all the time.","And the most recent one that was done without commenting on that specifically really would not have brought any added functionality to kind of what we have. For example, we have already got web store development in our core systems and have had for some time. We're already omnichannel in many markets around the globe. I think in March, we talked about 30 countries physically and doing business in a lot more than that by way of a cross border.","So, going back to where we started as a strategic matter, it really needs to advance our strategy of additional functionality we don't already have and\/or additional markets that we're not already in. And that certainly strategically is very important to us. But we're out there all the time. As Cameron mentioned in his prepared remarks, our balance sheet is in a very good position. We did exactly what we said we would do around our capital structure, going back a number of years, so we're certainly on the lookout for more ways to accelerate growth.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, Andrew, it's Cameron. The only thing I'll add to that comment and I think I made some of these remarks at our Investor Conference back in March is, as we think about ecom globally, we believe we have market-leading, at a minimum market-competitive capabilities from an ecom point of view with what you would view as best of breed. So, as we think about M&A, it's not through the lens of we need some enhancement to our existing capabilities because we have what we believe we need to be very competitive in the marketplace today. So, it's really a function of expanding geographies, expanding scale, and enhancing scale in that ecom business as opposed to buying capability, buying functionality that for some reason we don't have today.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Awesome. Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks. Good job.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, my first question, it was pretty impressive, the incremental margin in North America was the strongest in quite some time. And you touched on the mix shift towards a higher value. I'm wondering, is there any way to kind of think about like you have that benefit and how much left are you still getting from the Heartland synergies? It feels like we're probably past the heaviest part of that, so it's actually like core, very strong, like high incremental margin stuff driving that right now. Maybe just talk a little bit about the mix of those two drivers.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, so, Dave, it's a good question and thanks for asking it. There are really three drivers as I think about it impacting margins in North America in the first quarter. The first is what you just described. The mix shift benefits we see in the business by virtue of the growth we're getting in our integrated and vertical markets channels, how that's driving obviously top line, but at a higher margin than our traditional sort of merchant acquiring businesses themselves.","That mix shift is clearly benefiting margins. That's a big part of what drives, as I think about it, the organic margin expansion that we guide to as a cycle matter, the up to 75 basis points annually. As we talked about before, if North America is not growing at or above that level, the total company is not going to get there. So, clearly that's an important driver.","The second is there are incremental synergies obviously as we continued to execute in 2017 against our synergy plans. As we get into 2018, we're getting the full annual benefit of that. So, there was a little bit of tailwind to margins clearly in the first quarter in North America as it relates to synergy execution and the annualization of synergies realized in 2017. And then lastly, there is a little bit of benefit associated with ASC 606. I talked about this in the February call. That is offset by investments that we're making back into the business as we talked about really as a function of tax reform and the benefits we're seeing from tax reform.","Obviously, the tax reform benefit is below the line. The investments we're making are above the line. So, that's offsetting some of the ASC 606 benefit. But those investments, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, are obviously towards continuing to invest in our technology environment, continuing to invest in our people, our communities, our facilities, et cetera. So, those are offsetting some of the 606 benefits in the quarter as well. So, if you roll all that together, obviously, we're very pleased with the overall margin expansion for North America, 190 basis points. Obviously, positions us well relative to our overall objectives for margin expansion for the full year and obviously part of what gives us the confidence to raise that guidance on our call today from the up to 110 that we previously guided to, to up to 120 for the total company.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Dave, it's Jeff. I would just add to what Cameron said that at the end of the day as we said in March, the further we get into technology enablement in software, those are inherently higher-margin businesses. So, yes, the growth is better. That's obviously going to drive the mix on the revenue side that you're alluding to, but those are inherently more scalable, better operating margin type businesses and you should continue to see those benefits the way Cameron outlined.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up just on UK, how is the UK market looking? And is that something \u2013 do you start hitting easier comps or growth gets better later this year as that market maybe just gets a little easier?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Dave. It's Cameron. I'll maybe jump in there and I'll ask Jeff to comment as well. I don't know that I would agree with the thesis that there is easier comps as we get further into the year. I actually think it's the converse of that. You saw GDP in the UK was zero for the first quarter. Obviously, that's not a great macro backdrop for the business. Our business performed very well in the quarter, notwithstanding the overall GDP environment. But we've been saying now for a couple years, obviously, we're cautious around the impacts of Brexit. I don't know if Q1 sort of reflects some of the concerns that I think we've had as it relates to what will happen as the UK works to extract itself from the EU further and it becomes more of a reality.","But certainly, I think the macro backdrop in the UK we continue to be very cautious about as we go into the back half of the year. Very pleased with our ability to grow through that as we did in the back part of 2017 and now again in Q1 of 2018. And I would note in a particularly tough comp given that we saw Visa and MasterCard rate increases going last year, so we grew over those as well as we got into Q1 of 2018. But I think as we look at the back part of the year, we remain cautious around sort of the macro environment in the UK. I think we're confident in our ability to continue to gain share and grow that business at our high single-digit target as we have. But again, I would note that again the overall GDP environment remains a little bit of a concern.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","I think Cameron hit the nail on the head there, Dave. The share gains continue in \u2013 across our markets, but in particular for the point of your question, the United Kingdom, certainly to deliver the results we just delivered, as Cameron described, across Europe in the United Kingdom against the backdrop of GDP being flat would do nothing other than to suggest that we continue to take share which I believe to be the case. That's part of the positioning of our business in the United Kingdom.","The small to mid-sized business coupled with technology, particularly ecom and omni which is where a lot of it is, as well as integrated and vertical markets. That strategy around the rest of world is really bearing fruit, notwithstanding what Cameron said correctly about the macro environment in the United Kingdom. So, I think the story there, Dave, is ongoing share gains and you probably have seen that, Cameron, for the last six or eight quarters...","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","...in the United Kingdom. That's really more the story there, Dave, than anything else.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. The only other point I would add to that is as you look at Europe holistically, the diversity of markets that we have in Europe is a nice distinctive attribute of our business. We have exposure to faster growth markets. Obviously, our business in Spain continues to grow very, very nicely. We're very pleased with our results in Central Europe through our partnership with Erste Bank in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. Those businesses are growing very nicely. So, notwithstanding the UK, obviously the GDP environment is what it is. I think we feel good about the rest of Europe, and the mix of businesses and diversity of businesses we have in that market gives us confidence around our overall European outlook for the balance of the year.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good job.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Ashwin, are you on mute? Operator, maybe we should move.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you hear me?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Oh, Ashwin, are you there?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, can you hear me?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes, we can now.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Oh, sorry about that. I was just saying good results and congratulations.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thank you.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Let me start with a clarification on North America growth since that's always a topic of interest. But normalized double digit, that strips out ISOs which you said shrinking upper single and just to check about, what, $45 million, $50 million of ACTIVE and $17 million accounting, is that the right way to think of it?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Ashwin, I think you're on the right point. So, the ASC 606 impact in Q1 was about $17 million, roughly the same as what it was last year. If you think about ACTIVE, ACTIVE contributed about $47 million in the quarter; so in that range that we had provided kind of the mid to high $40 million level. So, again, growing normalized organic growth for ACTIVE being in that low double-digit range year-over-year.","So, our direct businesses grew kind of low-double digit organically on a normalized basis year-over-year. Wholesale was down, as I mentioned before, high-single digit, again in line with the expectations we had and provided back in February for that business for 2018. Canada grew as we expected it to in local currency and we had a little bit of Canadian dollar tailwind that drove Canadian performance on a USD basis in the mid to high single-digit range.","You roll that all together, and obviously North America had a good quarter overall. Normalized organic growth in total for North America, we have at that 9% range for Q1 of 2018, obviously with a worse sort of wholesale result relative to what we saw in Q4 2017. So, we accelerated off of Q4 2017, notwithstanding wholesale being more of a drag than it was in the last quarter.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And Aspira, that's another Vista portfolio company that you picked up, as you said, looked quickly, reservations management for campgrounds, seems like a fairly attractive niche market. Can you comment on sort of the process that you're going through as you kind of sign up more and more of these? And also, perhaps, on the performance to date of what you've picked up from Vista in terms of acceptance ramps and so on and so forth.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","So, Ashwin, this is David. I think we're really happy with the Vista relationship. It's been everything we hoped it would be. We're happy with the ACTIVE asset, as Cameron said earlier in his prepared remarks. ACTIVE is off to a very good start, doing just fine as we go through March and beyond that. More deeply with Vista, as we've said before, I mean there's nothing better for a salesperson than a warm lead and a warm relationship on which to work.","So, what you've seen with Cameron, with the guys in the business as well are ongoing negotiations unit by unit to find the right partnership opportunity, in this case with Aspira it's payments to help them with the campgrounds and some other cases with DealerSocket with Gather. It's our classic integrated payments where we're going to integrate with the software themselves that runs those \u2013 the car dealers in the DealerSocket example, you recall, from two weeks ago. So, we've got a very integrated sales process and kind of deal process with Vista where we're leading it one by one, deal by deal. Then we integrate, then we drive volume.","I think what's pretty exciting about where we are now is they're not contributing volume right now. These are all setups for future growth and enhancing future growth and some level locking in future growth for either our integrated payments business or our pure payments businesses, depending on what's the right solution for the software technology that Vista portfolio company has. So, as I said before and in previous calls \u2013 and we like nothing better than having a warm lead and a great intro, begin to figure out the right solution, the right technology solution for a partner, and that's going frankly just great for us.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's great to hear. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Condra. Your line is now open.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Oh, hey, guys. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to return to a little bit of the integrated POS and some of the discussion there. And I feel like there's maybe some data assets there that become available to you. And I wonder if you could talk about that opportunity a little bit.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, sure, happy to. So, this is David, Paul. I think you're absolutely right. The deeper you go into the technology stack, the more data is available to you. So, what you actually will find over the course of 2018, we're rolling out deep analytics products that already exist in the United States, wherein, for example, and if you go back a few months ago, you'll find an announcement about our Xenial analytics products that go deeply into restaurant daily sales, daypart sales, customer integration rewards programs, mobile wallet, all the things that come together to drive customer engagement, all based on the data we and the customer collectively capture at the point of sale and beyond.","That same set of solutions is rolling out to Canada and the UK over the course of 2018. And with each of these \u2013 the beauty of, I guess, our vertically tailored strategy is with each of these verticals, we have the same opportunity. We sell information and analytic products in our K through 12 business, in our higher ed business. Each software business is the opportunity for payments, for integration, for advice, for consulting, for analytics, and then, fundamentally, for the software that helps our customers run their business.","So you're on exactly the right point. Our strategy, as you'll recall from the Analyst Day, accelerate sales, enrich our solutions, and put analytics on top of those enriched solutions. You've captured it exactly right in your question.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I guess in addition to analytics, I mean, you have big vertical penetration and you've got SKU-level data. And I'm curious if there's other opportunities kind of maybe more on the marketing side, like from an aggregated data perspective.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's a great point, so I'd go back to what I said about customer engagement. We have the ability to go to our customers and say, let's pull your data, let's pull our data. And if you have third-party sources, we can patch \u2013 package that into one marketing module that we sell that drives campaign management, targeting and then measures the results of that campaign. So when I talk about engagement, you and I are on exactly the right theme, Paul, which is the same theme, which is how do we help our customers grow the overall pie.","We've got a great restaurant sitting over in this location, a great retailer over here. How do we help them compete with larger competitors, target folks, drive offers, drive traffic, drive a very visible return on the investment of the marketing service we offer? All that comes from that vertical specialization married to what could be this treasure trove of data we're sitting on. When Jeff and I were describing open APIs and architecture earlier in an answer to Andrew's question, that whole strategy enables our ability to go-to-market and offer marketing and analytic solutions to the same customers who are actually just doing payments fundamentally with Global Payments.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. And I guess just lastly, Cameron, any lumpiness on 606 impact this year that we should be aware of, just in terms from a modeling perspective?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","No. It's going to be relatively consistent at around that $17 million-ish, $17.5 million a quarter, Paul. It should be right in that range.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Nice results.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","I just wanted to go back to North America a little bit. I mean it was nice to see the \u2013 it looks like an acceleration in growth, the organic a 9%, despite wholesale, I think, getting somewhat worse.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Correct.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","So could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what accelerated, what exceeded your expectations? Maybe talk about across the channels, I'm thinking OpenEdge direct specifically, probably both accelerated, but just some color on what you saw there.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, I think if you compare it sequentially relative to Q4, Glenn, I think you're on the right point. So our integrated and vertical markets business accelerated relative to what we did in Q4 of 2017. Our direct relationship led, our Heartland sales channel accelerated relative to what we did in Q4 of 2017. Those are really the drivers of the acceleration relative to what we saw obviously last quarter.","Canada was pretty consistent, again low single-digit growth in local currency with a little bit of Canadian dollar tailwind. That added less than 50 basis points to North America in totality.","And obviously as you highlighted in your opening comments, ISO was a little bit worse, down high-single digit as we expected it to be in the first quarter, so trending in line with the overall expectation we provided back in February for that business for the full year. So again, pleased with the overall acceleration.","The way I look at it honestly, Glenn, is if you strip out wholesale, we grew North America 10%. That's very much in line obviously with the cycle guidance we provided in March and the outlook for the business going forward, which, we think ex-wholesale, obviously we can grow North America in that high-single digit to low-double digit range. So very much in that range, we're very pleased with that result and, obviously, we're driving the business to produce that type of performance as we go forward in time.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","All right. And maybe for Jeff, maybe just a little bit of an update on the M&A activity. I guess it's been a while actually since the ACTIVE deal. You talked about it a lot at the Analyst Day. I guess I'm surprised we haven't seen something. And is it just valuations out in the market? Or it just takes some time to get some deals over the goal line?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, I would say our pipeline's pretty full, Glenn. And we announced \u2013 we closed on ACTIVE in September. We did announce the JV with HSBC in Mexico, a new market for us, in February.","So our folks are hard at work. I wouldn't say it's so much valuations. If you go back to what I said, I think it was in response to Andrew's question, we look at strategic fit, cultural fit, and financial returns. Valuations kind of are what they are. So certainly, it's something to consider.","I would say it's more like we look at deals all the time and probably, as David and I said six or seven years ago, we may look at 100 deals and do 3.","So at the end of the day, I think our standards are pretty high. We know where the market is in terms of valuation, so to a certain extent that kind of is what it is. We're a strategic buyer, not a financial buyer, so we're really relying on what we can do pro forma rather than where the capital markets will kind of bear.","So certainly, it's one of the three constraints, but I don't view that as by itself kind of the limiting factor. Instead, what I view it as is what is the strategic fit, what's the cultural fit, and to be honest, what's the diligence telling us.","So we look at deals all the time; that pipeline remains full. Certainly, we view $1.2 billion in ACTIVE in September and then the JV with HSBC in Mexico in February as being healthy in terms of our portfolio execution. More to come as we've talked about. So we're optimistic about M&A, but obviously time will tell.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Would love to hear a little bit more about the ecom business, how it performed. Some of the metrics we heard throughout the quarter was 20-plus-percent growth rate. And then I know we talked about it at the Analyst Day, but could you remind us on ecom, how it's doing in the U.S. as you cross-sell that product through there? Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Bryan, it's Jeff. And I'll start and I'll ask Cameron to comment on some of the financial metrics that you alluded to.","So listen, as we said in our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where our ecom and omni solutions business is. Just as a reminder going back to what we said in the Investor Conference, as the rest of our business we're primarily focused on, first, SMB enablement, really in a given domestic market and really playing toward omnichannel, both the online experience as well as the offline experience. And there we think we're one of only two or three people in the world who really can do that in the markets we're in. That's kind of point number one.","Point number two, I would say, is we're very focused on cross-border enablement. Here, it's SMB, but also beyond SMB in markets where we can provide a lot of value add where there aren't a lot of other people. I think the example I used in the Investor Day was for a very large multinational in the country of Taiwan. We're doing both the online store as well as the physical store. I think as I mentioned in the Investor Day for that RFP, there were two people bidding, right, us and a local national bank. That's a very good example of where we kind of pick our places in terms of where we can add value.","So, that strategy continues as we roll through the first quarter of 2018 into the rest of the calendar year and into 2020, we expect as we described in the Investor Day. So, it really is a very, I think, sensible, defensible and distinctive strategy relative to our peers who in many markets are largely competing over a commoditized pricing which is really as you know not kind of what we like to do in our model.","Cameron, you want to comment on some of the metrics?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Bryan, I think as we look at the ecom and omnichannel business in the first quarter, the trends we saw were very consistent with what we've seen over the last couple years in our markets around the globe. Each individual market and each region is going to have its own growth rate around that line of business. But by and large, obviously, it's well into the double digits in each of our markets globally and I think pretty consistent with what we saw in 2017 along those lines. So, feel good about where we're positioned globally with the strategy, as Jeff highlighted, and I think the financial performance, obviously, is part of what's driving an acceleration of growth in the business certainly relative to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just getting ecom into the West market, how are those plans going?","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, so, Bryan, it's David. Ecom is in the U.S. market. The solution that we sell in the U.S. market is a best-of-breed series of technologies that combine the best of Global Payments and Heartland into what we just call U.S. ecom solutions at this point without any sort of specific brand name. A core part of the numbers Cameron is describing where we're outpacing market growth, whether it's U.S. or Spain or UK is these ecom solutions, are these ecom solutions, whatever the right phrasing is. So, core part of the growth in the United States which is well into the double digits as it has been for several quarters in the U.S. is continued ecom sales.","Our ability to sell ecom continues to get better and better in and amongst that large 1,600-person person sales force. We're selling, of course, omnichannel solutions across all the vertical markets as well, so don't miss the idea that an OpenEdge sale is an omnichannel, but includes some ecom as does our TouchNet sales in the university software business. But fundamentally, the same trends Cameron described where we're beating market around the world apply to the U.S. as well. We're beating market with a combination of face-to-face in app and ecom sales that is omnichannel itself.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, helpful. Thanks for the color, guys.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Bryan.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning. The industry, Jeff, has obviously been changing pretty radically with software companies being payments companies and integrated payments. And I mean, are you seeing \u2013 how are you seeing the competitive environment adjust? Whether it's a spa that becomes a payments company, a big spa software shop or the website building companies doing payments, how is that affecting your outlook globally? And I mean, I know you've been on that track for a while, but it's getting a lot more vertical and I think you're competing against a lot of new players that may have not been in the payments business in the past.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question, Bob. What I would say is that our business has always been intensely competitive. And as you've seen from our results recently, including today as well as our guidance, our results are accelerating. So, I would say certainly we feel like we're taking share relative to where the market is generally, we wouldn't be able to do that if we had to make those investments in the technology-related assets that we've been describing. So, to parse what you said in a few different ways, so on the comment about a spa or a software provider or someone like that, so when we bought APT in October of 2012, we worried a lot about the advent of the VAR ISO, meaning an ISV or a VAR becoming more of a payments facilitator, if you will, at the gateway level and where that put us relative to the value chain.","To be honest, we haven't seen that. What I would say is that most companies go deeper into their vertical markets as you're describing. They stick kind of with their knitting, at what they're best at. And even among the largest VARs and ISVs, we really have not seen a trend toward, okay, now I want to be a more proper payments company. That's where I think our value add really is. We're also very careful in not competing with our customer base. So, when we go deeper into software, we tend to differentiate that based on geography and vertical market in our OpenEdge model in terms of where we're competing. So, I think what I would say, Bob, is factually while we worry a lot about disintermediation and commoditization, we haven't really seen the advent of the VAR ISO that we've been describing.","Now, I'd say if you step back for a second, nonetheless it's something we think about, hence are pushing to owning more of the vertical stack in software in the first place where it doesn't compete or conflict with our partners as you know and as we articulated back in March. I think we're nicely balanced there in terms of where our investments have gone, but as a matter of fact, we certainly haven't seen it.","If you step back further and you say, well, what about an Amazon, for example, and some of the stuff they've announced, including yesterday and more recently, what I would tell you is I think that validates our push deeper into software and deeper into owning more of the vertical markets and the value stack. I think as much as anything, we're very focused, particularly in the United States which is really three-quarters of the company and markets that are primarily face-to-face like dental and veterinary where those are very hard to disintermediate or commoditize.","I'd also say, at the end of the day, I think as much as anything, that's a reaction to the Secure Remote Commerce that Visa and MasterCard announced at the ETA a couple weeks ago, more so than anything else. I say that because it shows you where the playing field sits relative to our value proposition. So, yes, the industry is changing. I think to be honest, I hope \u2013 I like to believe that we're leading that changing industry. But I think it's a validation of the investments that we've made and where we're heading and I think contrary to maybe where we were as a company 10 years ago, we're very balanced really and sober in our view of distribution strategies.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","And, Bob, this is Dave. Maybe a little more color. I'll point you back to the Investor Day, as well as we've done a few times here. I think that if you think about our sales strategy, you're exactly right. This is becoming a more complex technology sale. That's why we've customized sales and distribution strategies for each market, so we can tailor solutions and the sales effect vertically, locally as well as globally and then marry it to excellent customer service.","I think if you look at some of the tech competitors around the world, that's the missing element here and there's almost always a face-to-face element as well as an omnichannel and ecom element that requires service. Something is going to go wrong, whether it's a phone line or something else and it sure does stink when you have no one to ask for help at that moment. So, vertically, locally, globally, marrying great service to great technology, we think we're very well positioned, just as Jeff described.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. And just as it relates to that, the ACTIVE acquisition kind of as a test case, have you moved \u2013 has it \u2013 are you getting the synergies integrating that software with the Global Payments' payments network? And have you \u2013 I mean, is Global Payments processing their payments at this point? And I mean talk about synergies, I mean I expect we're going to see more acquisitions like that.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, sure, happy to talk. We're right on track with the synergies. Did a lot of things in December\/January to set the business up for success in 2018. We're not as of yet processing payments. That will take a little bit longer. Recall that's not an enormous synergy in our plan. So, I think Cameron talked about that two quarters ago.","I can tell you something that's pretty exciting for us though. We'll be doing customer service for that business in our Philippines Global Service Center next month. So, you can see we're making really nice progress with the infrastructure. On the sales side, where we think we have really long-term benefit, we're beta-testing two or three different referral techniques in and around our school solutions, K through 12 business, as well as our broader U.S. sales force as we speak. So, a lot more to come on that front. Great question.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","And, Bob, it's Cameron. Let me just maybe add one more comment to that. When we talked about ACTIVE in the context of synergies we expected to realize, there was more on the revenue side really than it was on the expense side of the equation. As David highlighted, there are things we can do on the expense side to improve the overall scale of that business, we think, by leveraging Global Payments' capabilities in the area of payments as well as other support functions.","But as David described, where we really see the value in the synergy opportunity is really on the revenue side of the business, being able to scale that business more effectively, globally cross-sell it through our existing channels. And one last area of synergy opportunity we saw was really leveraging some of ACTIVE's offshore development capabilities to benefit our existing businesses and we're doing that today to some degree as well. So, I think we're very much on track realizing the synergies that we expected to see coming out of that transaction.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, guys. Good results. I had a question around maybe the long-term potential M&A strategy coming out of Vista. So, the question that I have is as you sign up these partnerships, as you've done recently, like you said three in as many quarters, is there a strategy potentially where you'll act as processor for them for some time, but then over the course of 9, 12 months or whatever it may be, you want to actively own the software and therefore you'd be willing to buy that in? Or is that just not part of the long-term M&A strategy for you guys?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Dan, it's Cameron. What I would say on that front is it's certainly always an option. As we think about the portfolio Vista company that they have today and the ones that we're engaged with already, as David described, and the ones obviously that we have in the pipeline in conversations, it's certainly an option longer term. I think our view, and this is really irrespective of the relationship with Vista, is we tend to look at the market on a vertical-by-vertical basis and we make decisions around whether or not we want to own or partner in the vertical really based on the attributes of that underlying vertical market.","So, there may be situations where we start with a partnership with a Vista portfolio company that may lead to an acquisition because the attributes of the vertical market itself we find attractive and we think we can better penetrate that market, drive faster rates of growth, scale the business more effectively by owning the underlying software as well as providing the payment capability. But that's not again unique to the relationship with Vista. That's really how we think about the vertical market landscape itself and how we want to position ourselves around the vertical market.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Dan, it's Jeff. I would just add to what Cameron said that while those two strategies aren't necessarily linked, the truth is the better you know something, the more you have an opinion of what you'd like to do as a strategy matter. So, everything that Cameron said is exactly right. It starts out with the target addressable market, et cetera, the verticals we want to be in. But there's no doubt that knowledge of how a partner works, the operating engagement, seeing it over a period of time, that's just another data point that you take in and everything else when you assess the quality of a counterparty. So, it's kind of a necessary thing, but really not sufficient by itself.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, it just seems to be a lower risk capital, I guess, equation.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Well, as I say, more information in these decisions is always a better thing. So, I agree with your thesis there. But I wouldn't look into, gee, we have three relationships in the last three quarters and that means those are three deals that we're doing. Vista's going to do what's best for Vista and their companies, and their companies will too and so will we.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Can you guys just talk about Asia's demand and where all that's coming from? You've hit the other kind of geos up to this point, but if you could do that, that kind of pinwheel, that'd be great. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, Dan. It's Jeff. So, I would say Cameron will keep me honest here in terms of the number of quarters, but it's probably been eight \u2013 maybe six or eight quarters of sustained macroeconomic growth around pretty much all of Asia. For the last number of quarters, the Philippines has probably posted one of the best, if not the best GDP rates of growth throughout our Asian markets. Cameron, I think in his prepared remarks, highlighted some of the markets where we're particularly pleased, including in the Philippines with our partnership with Bank of the Philippine Islands.","So what I would say in Asia is we're very pleased with the acceleration of the growth in the first quarter of 2018 versus the fourth quarter of 2017, but we're also pleased with our ability to grow our businesses in a very healthy manner as we did in Australia, even though GDP there is pretty muted and has been sometime. I think Australia has the notoriety of having gone \u2013 again, Cameron will keep me honest \u2013 more than a decade without GDP contracting in that market, yet our business continues to grow now for a number of years there right around 20% organically in terms of revenue.","So we continue to see a very benign macro environment around most of the parts of Asia that we care about. We haven't spent a lot of time on this because it's not a big piece of our company financially. But as a strategic matter, Mainland China, and we view China again as a sum of the parts of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. We've actually seen pretty good stability improvement in China proper over the last number of quarters.","So feels pretty good where we are in Asia, but I would say it's probably continuation of a trend that we've seen probably for the last eight quarters.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff, Cameron and David. I hope you're well. Couple questions from me. Can you talk a little bit more about margins or unpack those in North America? You mentioned them before, but I'm curious what the puts and takes might have been from any drag from ACTIVE and what the drag from wholesale declining more is. My point is, is there a way to get visibility into more of the underlying core kind of tech-enabled and direct margins that might be useful for us to think about?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","So I think we've given a decent amount of granularity as to what we view as the drivers of margin expansion in North America, certainly for the first quarter as well as what we foresee being drivers of margin expansion going forward in the totality of our business, including what is happening in North America. I think we gave a lot of color on that at the Investor Conference back in March.","As we think about ACTIVE, ACTIVE does contribute to margin expansion in 2018. ACTIVE is a little more seasonal than some of our other businesses, so Q1, Q4, it's sort of weaker, for lack of better term, quarters from a revenue seasonality standpoint. Q2 and Q3 are better. So, Q2, Q3 is where we would see in the margin expansion pulling through from ACTIVE perhaps more and to a lesser degree in Q1 and Q4. So just bear that in mind as you're thinking about the relative components.","Obviously, the wholesale business is a lower-margin business, so the quicker it declines, the more that is a benefit from a mix standpoint and the more obviously we're going to be positioned to continue to drive margin expansion in the business organically. And as Jeff highlighted earlier, the tech businesses are inherently higher-margin businesses. So the more software we're selling through those channels, the more we're linking obviously payment capabilities with deep integrated software capabilities, the more value-added proposition we have for our customers. Obviously, the pricing associated with that is better and the margins associated with that are better.","So beyond that I would say those are really the core drivers and, as I mentioned in response to I think Ashwin's question earlier, there's obviously some synergy benefit flowing through in 2018 as well, as we annualize a lot of the actions we took in 2017. There's a little bit of incremental synergy around actions we're taking in 2018, but the vast majority of the work around Heartland is done at this point.","And really, what you're seeing in 2018 is just the annualization of actions taken in 2017. So I think that's about as granular as we can really get at this stage, but hopefully that gives you a decent road map as to what the drivers are.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's really helpful. And then cross-border is a question I had, both the networks had really good cross-border volume. Wondering if you guys saw that in your business. And also related, any action on India as you guys think about international or maybe additional cross-border asset expansion? Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Brett. It's Jeff. I'll start and I'll ask Cameron to provide additional color. But I would say our cross-border activity is very good. If you think about Europe, which Cameron talked about in his prepared remarks, yet another high single-digit constant currency kind of organic number in Europe. Obviously, we're diverse across Europe as we've talked about, not just in the United Kingdom, but in Spain, in Continental Europe, et cetera. Not surprisingly, because of SEPA, because of the coming of PSD2 and everything else, that's where a lot of our cross-border activity resides.","I don't think it's that different from the network space, my reading of their KPIs to be candid, really either. There's a little bit of that for us in Asia-Pacific. Cameron described how that growth accelerated to 15% organic constant currency in \u2013 well, actually U.S. dollar in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. So clearly, many of the trends I think you're seeing in the card networks, you're seeing in our European results and you're seeing in our Asian results flow through.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","And you had a question about India that I didn't quite pick up. So do you mind repeating that?","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah, just curious, there's a lot going on in India in payments. And I know as you guys \u2013 Jeff, you mentioned that one way you guys think about ecommerce assets is via cross-border acquisitions like you've done in the past, and wonder if India is a potential source for one of those.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, listen, Brett, absolutely. Of course, our business in Asia really has been a tale of organic growth supplemented by technology enablement as we've done.","We are in India today. We think we're subscale in India, meaning we'd like to be bigger really in India, so we've looked at a bunch of assets in India over time. I would say our strategy is a little bit different than Alipay and Paytm, because we're not driven by consumer wallet points of adoption, so you're not likely to see us as an M&A strategy or otherwise go after kind of the wallet the way someone like an Alipay would. But you are very likely to see us go after additional technologies that enable acceptance like QR codes and things that we've talked about in Asia, including in India in the past.","You're also likely to see us go deeper into nativization of our technologies in India. So a good example of that is RuPay, which is the Indian payment scheme domestically in India which we enable. And it doesn't reside just in India, we have similar schemes like that around the world.","So yes, India is a market, along with Mainland China that we'd like to be bigger in. We recognize that that's probably going to take a mix of organic and inorganic things, a little bit different than what you might see from Ali, but it remains high on our list of priorities.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Thank you. Good balanced results here. Just wanted to ask about spreads and if you're seeing that benefit from a favorable mix in channels, and I'm just wondering if the macro conditions are also making it easier to drive better spreads.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Tien-Tsin. It's Jeff. So, I would say spreads as they have been for probably a period of years now are very stable. I think as David and Cameron described, for us it's really monetizing the technology investments we've made, selling more software along with payments as well as data analytics. So, I view that less as a spread question for us, Tien-Tsin, and more of a cross-sell and value-added products and services. And as I think David described in March, wrapping more value around that transaction rather than changing the price of the transaction itself. So, I would say more of the same. It's a continuation of stability on the pricing environment which is nice to see, but as you know, our strategy is to really add more value added around each transaction rather than really just change price.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. And, Tien-Tsin, it's Cameron. As I look at spreads in the individual channels of the business, obviously our overall spread is improving by virtue of the mix of businesses that we're growing, as we talked about before. So, the more we grow the integrated and vertical markets businesses, obviously the mix is improving, the spreads are better in that business. So, our overall spread is improving. As you look at the overall market, in general, to Jeff's earlier comments, I think spreads are pretty stable. And they're stable also in sort of each of the individual channels that we would look at as a business matter. So, I think the overall market is relatively benign, I would say, around spread compression and, obviously, our mix of businesses and the attributes of those businesses allowing us to obviously reap more value as we continue to provide more value-added services to customers.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. That's clear and encouraging. Thanks for that. Just a quick follow-up on the cross-border piece, I asked MasterCard this last night, so yesterday, so I'll ask you guys, too. The proposed changes to the euro cross-border and the DCC, the dynamic currency conversion, any potential impact for Global Payments? Any new thinking there?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Tien-Tsin, it's Cameron. Certainly on the cross-border piece itself, we don't really see an impact. That's really non-card sort of cross-border activity from a money flow standpoint. Around the DCC, I would say relatively the same thing. We don't see much impact on our business going forward. The DCC aspects of those new regulations are really designed to drive more transparency at the point of sale, so consumers have a better understanding of the cost of DCC versus the cost of their issuing bank converting that euro-based payment into whatever their local currency would be. We obviously already provide great transparency at the point of sale.","To be clear, those actions or that product is governed by the networks already, and there's already a great deal of regulation around the level of transparency that has to be provided from a DCC product standpoint. So, the impact is really more on the issuers to be able to provide that same level of transparency to the consumer at the point of sale, so they can make an important decision about which path to pursue from a currency standpoint. And I think we feel very good about how we stack up and how our DCC product stacks up relative to the alternative consumers have.

Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We are delighted to deliver another quarter of strong performance and to again raise our fiscal 2015 revenue, margin, and cash earnings per share guidance.","By remaining intensely focused on execution, we achieved revenue growth for our fiscal second quarter of 10%, cash earnings per share growth of 19%, and operating margin expansion of 100 basis points.","Our performance for this quarter resulted in the largest core operating margin expansion of any quarter over the past several years. Additionally, this is the first time in our history that we have achieved an annual free cash flow run rate of over $400 million.","These milestones are driven by the strong momentum we have achieved worldwide across our direct distribution businesses, and are particular noteworthy given significant foreign currency headwinds.","Consistent with recent trends, our US business delivered impressive results led by our direct channels, which generated double-digit organic revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter. Canada also maintained stable performance in local currency with consistent business fundamentals.","Our international results reflect solid business performance across most of our markets, with particularly strong revenue growth in Asia, Spain, and our eCommerce channel. Additionally, we experienced markedly better than expected margins in our international business, largely from outstanding execution, augmented by market based pricing changes in Spain.","We also continued to make progress on our strategic goal to expand our worldwide footprint. During our fiscal second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Ezidebit, which provides us with distinctive distribution in Australia and New Zealand, new direct markets for Global Payments.","We also recently announced an agreement to establish a merchant acquiring joint venture with Bank of the Philippine Islands, one of the country's largest banks. With this new partnership we will increase our existing distribution in the highly attractive Philippines market, and bring our innovative products and services to a significant additional merchant base.","These transactions will enhance our position in some of the fastest growing payment's markets in Asia Pacific and demonstrate that we are making significant progress on our strategy in that region, executing on our vision that we set forth in 2012 with the purchase of HSBC's remaining interest in our then Asia Pacific joint venture.","Our performance in the first half of fiscal 2015 reflects the consistent and sound execution of our strategy to expand technology enabled direct distribution in our markets, augmented with disciplined capital deployment. We continue to reinvest in our businesses, pursue our global corporate development roadmap, and efficiently return capital to shareholders.","Now I will turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. Before reviewing segment results for the quarter, I would like to first provide an overview of the key drivers of our performance for the second quarter relative to our expectations.","In the United States, all of our direct businesses continue to perform quite well, generating year-over-year organic growth rates that have trended above our expectations. Our business in Canada remains stable, although our local currency performance was more than offset by FX for the quarter.","In Europe, Spain performed exceptionally well, driven by double-digit transaction and volume growth, as well as market based pricing impacts. Our eCommerce channel also continues to perform better than we expected, which has contributed to our European top line growth.","Similar to Q1, this strong European performance was partially offset by our Russian business which continues to be impacted by the overall economic environment and the effect of FX which were an even greater headwind than we anticipated.","Our Asia-Pacific business generated organic revenue growth in the high single digits, accelerating from previous quarters and outperforming our expectations. Of course, reported Asia results were further bolstered by the addition of Ezidebit, which performed in line with expectations.","Now for the quarterly segment details. Total company revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 grew to $697 million, reflecting 10% growth over fiscal 2014, and cash operating margins expanded 100 basis points to 20.4%. Diluted cash earnings per share increased 19% over the prior year's quarter to $1.27.","Our underlying business demonstrated strength during the quarter, even after normalizing our revenue growth for the addition of PayPros and Ezidebit. Assuming we own the PayPros and Ezidebit businesses in our current and prior year second quarters, or normalizing for their effect, total company revenue growth would have been 5% in line with our long-term core organic growth expectations, despite the impact of significant FX headwinds. On a constant currency basis, total company revenue growth was approximately 8% for the quarter.","North America's segment revenue grew 9% for the second quarter, with US growth of 12% over the prior year. On a normalized basis, organic US revenue growth was 5%, which was comprised of growth in our direct channels of 12% and growth in our ISO channel of less than 1% during the quarter. As anticipated, growth in our ISO business continues to decelerate and this channel is becoming an increasingly smaller portion of our business.","Our ISOs now contribute approximately 15% of our North America operating income, and approximately 8% of total company operating income, which compares to approximately 20% and low double digits respectively as of Q3 of fiscal 2014.","Despite local currency performance of 6% revenue growth, Canada revenue growth in US dollars declined 2%, resulting from an unfavorable exchange rate. North America cash operating income grew 10% to $85.4 million, and cash operating margins were 17.5%, up from last year, driven by growth in our direct channel, partially offset by unfavorable Canadian FX trend on a year-over-year basis.","International revenue grew 11% for the quarter in US dollars. Europe delivered strong revenue growth of 9%, fueled by performance in Spain and eCommerce channel, offset by continued under performance in our Russia business in light of the general economic environment and ruble devaluation.","As a result of strength in the rest of our business, Russia now represents approximately 2% of total company revenues, down from approximately 3% last quarter.","Asia-Pacific revenue grew 21%, driven by strong organic revenue growth and the Ezidebit acquisition, which contributed approximately 12 percentage points to the growth rate.","Our organic growth in the region was primarily a result of a combination of increased volumes, growth in dynamic currency conversion, and selective pricing initiatives. International cash operating income grew 20% to $83.5 million, and cash operating margins increased to 40.1%.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter on a cash basis was 26.7%. We generated approximately $105 million of free cash flow this quarter, which we define as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non controlling interests.","Capital expenditures totaled $15 million for the quarter and our total available cash, including working capital at the end of the quarter was approximately $225 million. Lastly, we repurchased a total of approximately 700,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $47 million.","Now I'd like to turn to our expectations for fiscal 2015. Based on our results for the first half of fiscal 2015, we are increasing our outlook for the full fiscal year. We now expect reported revenue to grow 8% to 10%, and range from $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion.","Similarly, we are raising our cash earnings per share expectations to a range of $4.75 to $4.83, reflecting growth of 15% to 17%. We also now expect core cash operating margins to expand by as much as 50 basis points in fiscal 2015, with margin expansion in both our North America and international segments.","It is important to note that these expectations also reflect further strengthening of the US dollar against most of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure, which represents a more meaningful headwind to our financial results for the remainder of the year.","Additionally, our expectation for our Russia business is further tempered from our last quarterly update as a result of the challenging economic environment there. As usual, these cash earnings per share expectations only reflect share repurchases that we have completed prior to this call.","By way of update, during our Q4 fiscal 2014 earnings call, we made reference to the June 2014 acquisition of one of our largest US sales partners. At that time, we noted that our fiscal 2015 expectations assumed no change in the nature of our relationship with this customer resulting from the transaction.","We have recently amended our agreements with this partner, and can confirm that this transaction will not have any impact on our fiscal 2015 expectations for GAAP revenue, operating income or total company cash earnings per share. In addition, we do not expect any meaningful migration associated with this partner during calendar 2015.","We currently have approximately $875 million of capacity to fund future initiatives, including approximately $650 million of availability on our corporate credit facility. As a reminder, we expect the FIS transaction to close toward the end of our fiscal 2015, and we intend to fund this acquisition from operating cash flows and do not expect it to have an impact on our near term capital allocation plans or facility availability.","Lastly, our Board has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $300 million in the aggregate, further demonstrating our ongoing commitment to prudent capital management on behalf of our shareholders.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you, Cameron. This is yet another quarter of transparent, consistent execution of our strategy to grow and control direct distribution, deliver innovative products and services, and leverage our worldwide technological and operational advantages. We are delighted to again raise guidance. Finally, we remain committed to driving sustainable growth in our markets and are dedicated to creating value for our shareholders, partners, customers and employees.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jane.","Jane Marie Elliott","Thanks. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, I\u2019d like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow up, in order to accommodate everyone in the queue.","Thanks you. And operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dave Koning of Robert W. Baird and Company. You may begin.","David J. Koning","Can you hear me?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, Dave, we can.","David J. Koning","All right. Great. Okay. So I guess first question, just on Spain, is there any way to isolate either the revenue or EBIT impact or in rough terms, because international was so strong. And just wondering how much of that beat really was isolated to the Spain pricing movement?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Hey, Dave, it's Jeff. I'll start and Cameron will add to this. I would say, and we try to say in our prepared remarks is, while we're not going to break out the changes from growth in the core business versus interchange. We did say in our prepared remarks that we had 13% transactional growth in Spain in the quarter.","So I think it's fair to assume at a minimum that we would have had double-digit local currency growth in Spain, notwithstanding any changes to interchange. I think that's how we think about it, Dave.","David J. Koning","Okay. That's great. And then I guess just the follow up then. International EBIT, $83 million to $84 million this quarter, is that generally sustainable? Or \u2013 I know there's a little bit of seasonality to that that comes down off in the back half, but is that largely sustainable, given all the things that are going on?","Cameron M. Bready","Well, I - you're right, Dave, its Cameron, in that Ezidebit is included in there, but only for a partial quarter. So I would caution you to bear that in mind as you think about the going run rate.","The only other thing I would comment on is FX. Obviously, the performance in the quarter was good despite the FX headwinds, but we are forecasting incremental headwinds for the balance of the year as well.","So I think by and large, it's generally going to be a good number going forward after you normalize for a full quarter of Ezidebit. But you'll have to take into consideration FX as well.","David J. Koning","Got you. Great. Thanks. Great job.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Dave.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citibank. You may begin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. Morning, Jeff. Morning, Cameron.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Good morning.","Cameron M. Bready","Good morning.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Congratulations on the quarter. Happy New Year. I guess a couple of questions. One is, I wanted to \u2013 I may have missed this with regards to the full impact of the FX headwind, what are you overcoming in dollar terms for the year?","Cameron M. Bready","For the year, Ashwin, we have not provided a specific estimate as to how much of the FX headwind is impacting our numbers. What we can tell you is, obviously when we provided our guidance back in October, we thought that FX was going to be a more meaningful headwind than we did at the beginning of the year. As we sit here today, we expect it to be an even \u2013 an increased headwind relative to where we were three months ago with the expectations for the full year as well.","So I can tell you, sitting here today, we've been able to overcome a fairly meaningful amount of FX headwind on a both revenue, operating income and cash earnings per share basis, but haven't given a specific estimate as just how much is embedded in the numbers.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. And Ezidebit seems to be tracking to the $25 million full year revenue impact that you had guided to earlier. I want to ask also about the Philippines impact with regards to full year, how much is that going to be?","And then if I could sneak in an extra question. Oil prices going down, are you actually seeing consumer spending rising on the back of that, consumer transactions?","Cameron M. Bready","I'll start with the first two, Ashwin, and I'll maybe ask Jeff to chime in on the third. Certainly on Ezi, that remains our expectation for the full year. As we noted in our prepared remarks, the company is performing in line with our expectations thus far. And the outlook would suggest that they're going to be on target for the full year expectations as well. I will note, the Australian dollar is a little weaker, but again, we still feel the business is going to perform in line with our expectations for the year.","On the Philippines, there is nothing in our guidance currently reflected for the Philippines joint venture that we recently announced. Although, I would note at the time that we made that announcement we did indicate whatever impact there will be in FY 2015 will be relatively immaterial. And then lastly, I'll ask Jeff to jump in on your question regarding consumer spending.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, I think you're right in what you said, Ashwin, on consumer spending. We \u2013 as you heard from us before, we generally view our business as a GDP plus growth type of business. A lot of that depends of course on consumer spending.","To the extent that oil prices either stay where they are or come down further, we view that as a positive to our business. Because it has the effect of a tax cut effectively for consumers.","So we view that in general as really nothing but \u2013 nothing but upside for the health of the consumers on whose businesses we depend for our financials.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. Thanks. Congratulations. Keep up the good work. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Can you hear me all right?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes.","Cameron M. Bready","Yes.","Bryan Keane","Just wanted to follow up on that international margin growth, because that was the real surprise in the quarter. I'm just trying to figure out was that all mostly due to Spain? And then when you get pricing like that, like you're getting in Spain, how sustainable is that when we look into next year or does that get competed away?","Cameron M. Bready","Bryan, it's Cameron, I'll jump in and I'll ask Jeff to add any additional color. Let me just step back for a second and note some of the drivers for the international performance that we touched on in our prepared remarks.","First of all, Spain obviously is an important driver, but again recognize a good portion of that is execution, as Jeff mentioned, with double-digit transaction and volume growth. Notwithstanding the nice tailwind we're seeing from the lower interchange, we're clearly pleased with the execution in the Spanish market.","The rest of the international businesses in Europe continue to perform well also, but for Russia, which we talked about, which continues to be a bit of a headwind for that business.","In Asia, you had organic revenue growth of 9%, which accelerated quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, which is obviously contributing to the margin performance for the international segment as well. You couple that with the addition of Ezidebit, which contributed 12 percentage growth \u2013 points to growth on a revenue basis, you're obviously driving operating income and margin expansion as well, given that Ezidebit's coming in at a higher margin than our average.","So when you roll all those pieces together, I would say a lot of it is execution and performance, the addition of Ezidebit and naturally the regulatory changes in Spain are helpful, but I think a lot more about it is the execution we're seeing in the business.","David E. Mangum","And Bryan, this is David. In terms of the tail on something like the interchange reductions, what we typically see and what we assume certainly now in the case of Spain is that will dissipate over time.","If you think back to the Durbin days here in the United States, which is just going back a couple years ago, you had a year maybe a little less than a year of benefit from changes in the regs as well as the interchange. Remember though, that was a steadily decreasing benefit as time went on.","So it's a really nice benefit right now. It will decrease over time. I would say this, though. I think what's really tell tale about Spain, setting aside interchange for a moment, is the volume growth and the transaction growth that Jeff mentioned a little while ago. 13% transaction growth this quarter, double-digit volume growth implied or implicit in that double-digit revenue growth as well, similar metrics in Q1, similar metrics we expect for the rest of the year.","It\u2019s when you combine that with this interchange benefit that you really get the outstanding performance and see it, the list of items that Cameron just went through in terms of overall international margins.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And I assume you're taking share in Spain to get those kind of transaction growth rates. And then finally just Cameron on operating margins international, what does the back half guidance then imply for that, what should we put in our models or expect?","Cameron M. Bready","Bryan, we absolutely are taking share in Spain. We are \u2013 remember this, that what's really interesting about that we are the largest provider in Spain, we have the largest market share, 25%, 28% depending this time. But certainly with growth rates like that we are absolutely taking share and we're very happy with performance in Spain.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, and Bryan on your last question, I think we would expect a little bit of margin degradation relative to what we saw in Q2 for the international business in the back half of the year, as David highlighted with some of the benefit from the interchange reduction in Spain beginning to dissipate, you'll see a little pressure on that relative to what we just reported.","But obviously we're still for the full year guiding toward margin expansion for the international segments, as well as the North American segment and the total company in total totality.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Congrats on the results.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Bryan.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. You may begin.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great. Thanks. Good results here. I just wanted to get some clarity on what's driving the guidance raise. I caught the JV, the Comerica push out and migration. Obviously had some upside here, but can you be more specific?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Sure, I'll just add something Tien-tsin and Cameron can comment on the financial modeling around the guidance. There's no impact in the guidance as we said back in July as it relates to Comerica which is material\u2026","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","I think you might be asking about Comercia which is the Spanish joint venture, the name of our Spanish joint venture that David and Cameron just described in terms of its performance. So obviously double-digit organic transaction and volume growth is going to substantially enhance the revenue, but also increase the minority interest line because that's the primary source of our minority interest, the 49% share that CaixaBank has in that joint venture. Cameron, you want to go through the \u2013 any more specifics on the modeling?","Cameron M. Bready","Yes, I'll be happy to. Just a few comments, we're obviously reflecting in our guidance the performance we've seen for the year-to-date period coupled with our changed expectation for the balance of the year. I mean, we're continuing to expect trends in the US direct business to be strong as they have been in the front half of the year.","We had US direct growth of 12% in the second quarter which we expect that to continue to be strong in the balance of the year. We remain bullish on the prospects for Spain for all the reasons that David highlighted a moment ago. That's somewhat offset by again tempered expectations for our Russian business, as well as increased headwind associated with FX for most of the major currencies to which we have exposure.","When you roll all that together, again, we're upping our revenue op margin and cash EPS guidance for the full year.","Tien-tsin Huang","All right. That's good. So just as my follow-up, just on Canada with the interchange there coming down. I know there's been some debate on the MDRs and how that might get reflected. Any thoughts on that as an opportunity and your ability to reprice in Canada? Thanks. That's all I had.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. Tien-tsin, its Jeff. What I would say is that's expected to occur in the spring in April of 2015. Our assumption is that all of that is going to be passed through based on our current understanding of the regulations related to the changed reduction in Canada. But as we've said before to you over time that at the end of the day any reduction in the cost to our merchants of acceptance is good news for our business. And the reason it's good news for our business is it should increase the number of merchants who want to take cards because it lowers the cost. That should help.","In addition, to the extent we take any other pricing actions over time not related to the interchange reduction, that takes Tien-tsin some of the pressure off from other actions that we may take. So even in environments where everything is passed through, we've seen good growth implications to our business as a tell tale sign of those changes. So really at the end of the day it's nothing but good news for our merchants and we think the same for us.","I want to add even though it's not in Canada, that there have been changes to the EU legislation since we last talked on our last call and it does look like the EU this month is going to be proving, Tien-tsin, changes to affect what we used to know as SEPA by way of interchange, both cross-border as well as domestic.","And as those rates come down in EU, we do expect to see benefits from that which we expect to start really in the summer. So really start early in our fiscal 2016. I think in addition to the Canadian changes that you just asked about, I would say that we would anticipate positive effects from the EU changes starting this summer.","Tien-tsin Huang","Yes. Thanks for that, Jeff. Lot of positives there. Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. I want to just go back to I guess Europe broadly for a moment, if I could. So I don't know, I think this was the first time that you gave the Spain actual transactions. I know in the past you talked about double-digits. So I don't know if that's actually an acceleration materially or if it's just continued good execution there.","But when I think about the margin argument and I hate to kind of harp on it, but if Spain's kind of been doing double-digits and eCommerce has been strong which is typically pretty much lower margins let's just say. Is the combination of Ezidebit coming on and then pricing, because Ezidebit I thought had lower margins than what you actually produced this quarter even in international?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Dan, its Jeff. So what I would say is when we announced the acquisition and then closing of Ezidebit what we had said at the time is it's above our international margins Dan before we even brought it into Global Payments.","Dan Perlin","Okay.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","So Ezidebit really from the initial acquisition is accretive to our international margins. So as Cameron referenced it's obviously helpful to the economic model number one. Number two, I would say that our objective as a company as you know is to grow overall margins.","So we run a portfolio of diverse businesses, but we don't see as changes come down the pike in Spain or elsewhere, we don't see a reason why we wouldn't be continuing to grow in the totality of our international margins over time. So I wouldn't view it as a temporal move in margins. I would view it as this is a plan that we're executing against.","Dan Perlin","Yes. And then my follow up is really in relation to kind of the OpenEdge kind of go-to-market strategy and re-branding. I'm wondering is there any updates you can kind of give us in terms of cross-selling new products, what kind of uptake you're seeing. And then to what extent have you made that push geographically, kind of north of the border? Thanks.","David E. Mangum","Yes. Dan, its David. Thanks for asking that question. OpenEdge first off is hitting its numbers. It's growing just as we expected. The initial cross sales are moving well. Remember, what we started with was integrating the entire sales force and then affecting the re-branding, where we really expect to begin seeing momentum as you recall from a quarter ago, maybe two quarters ago, as we get into the second half of this year and then early 2016.","We'll see that momentum on two sides. One is the actual expense benefits from platform integration, some of the usual integration that we see, but the other is the cross-selling. So early days, the early signs are good. What you'll see from that business particularly is the consolidated roll out of the security that includes EMV tokenization, as well as point-to-point encryption into one bundled security solution, which really is the way to think about security particularly as you're dealing with small to medium size merchants around the country.","And yes, we're focused very discreetly on taking that business into Canada. We already have a small Canadian presence there. We have a dedicated sales staff which is one of the counter synergies, the negative synergies we're affording this year on a way to hopefully improve performance in 2016 and growth in 2016.","But everything at OpenEdge is right on track. We're also executing the technology and platform integration plans as well. We're boarding new customers to Global Payments platforms as we speak. So everything going very well and OpenEdge is delivering its income numbers just as we expected.","Dan Perlin","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Dan.","David E. Mangum","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Georgios Mihalos of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your may begin.","Georgios Mihalos","Great. Thanks, guys. And congrats on the quarter. Wanted to start off on the US side, it looks like you mentioned the 12% growth in your direct business, ISO slowing a little bit. It sounds almost like OpenEdge is sort of continuing to grow in sort of the high teens as opposed to the mid-teens that I think you had originally sort of baked into the model, can you confirm that?","And then related to that, as we go through 2015 and the EMV migration really starts to accelerate. Do you think you would be able to maintain this current rate of growth in the high teens?","Cameron M. Bready","Hey, George, it's Cameron. I'll jump in on that and I may ask David to comment on the EMV rollout specifically. As it relates to the growth expectations for the OpenEdge platform, I think you're correct in that we have been seeing obviously growth trends that are higher or slightly higher than I think our expectations were for the business.","As David noted, it continues to perform very much in line with our expectations from both revenue and operating income perspective. But on a top line basis, I think the growth has been strong and it certainly contributing to the 12% growth that we've seen in our direct business for the quarter which is a fairly consistent trend from the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as well.","As far as momentum, certainly I think we see opportunities to continue to expand and grow the business in the back half of the year and as we look to FY 2016 as well, I'll let David maybe jump in on some of the specifics that you referenced around EMV and whatnot.","David E. Mangum","Yes. I think George, we expect to be selling an integrated security solution with a very easy path to get live for our partners. We expect to deliver American Express through open areas which is really in the early stages there of delivering that. There is series of verticals or there isn't necessarily a lot of American Express penetration to date.","So we are teeing up that combined with a question Dan asked a moment ago which is cross selling the products like Decline Minimizer into the APT base, the legacy APT base. We think we set ourselves up for another strong growth year in 2016 and more to come as we talk going forward.","Georgios Mihalos","Okay. Great. And just final question from me. Just want to ask are there any additional pricing initiatives assumed in your guidance for 2015, anything new? And it sort of sounds here from your comments that you expect any significant upside or any real upside coming from additional pricing to hit the P&L more in 2016 than 2015. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly?","Cameron M. Bready","Yes, George, I would say that we continually look at pricing. We're in very competitive markets all over the world. I was really referring to was the April change in the interchange in Canada that's been announced. I was also referring to the EU changes which we expect to be adopted this week by the EU Parliament b y this month, but to be implemented over the summer.","I would say in general most of the industry, including Global Payments looks at pricing twice a year as a systemic matter George and that\u2019s tied to or generally is around the MasterCard and Visa announced changes which are typically done in October and April. It so happens that the Canadian change is around the same time, in April.","But in general, most of the industry looks at that because those are clear notice periods where we have to go back to merchants anyway. So what I would say, George is those are regulatory changes that don't happen all the time which is why we call them out. But we continually look at pricing in all of our markets to make sure that we're striking the appropriate balance.","Georgios Mihalos","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. You may begin.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks, guys. Just wanted to pick up on one of the comments that David made a little while ago around the platform consolidation in the US and the OpenEdge business. So with PayPros and APT coming together, can you just give us a little more detail on the timing of when you think that platform consolidation will be done and will that be a noticeable margin tailwind as we get into fiscal 2016?","Cameron M. Bready","I think to take your question reverse, Jason, I don't think it will be noticeable in the face of the income statement because the sheer size of Global Payments much less our North America business as well. Instead what you have is one of the tactics that will help us continue to deliver operating income growth and margin expansion over time in the United States, North America and then by expansion globally.","The way we're thinking about migration now is the first, and maybe the most important step is we're boarding new customers to Global Payments. Probably the best thing I can tell you right now is we have a good long-term frosting [ph] relationship with a third party provides processing now. We're happy with the pace of integration, more to come and we'll feed in those integration benefits over time over the next year or year two.","So we can keep chatting about it. But we like the idea of having that as another tactic to help us with 2016 and beyond from a margin expansion perspective.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. So just kind of more incremental it sounds like?","Cameron M. Bready","Yes.","Jason Kupferberg","And then just as a follow-up on the Philippines joint venture, can you give us a little bit more detail on the size and growth of that market, maybe competitive landscape and just kind of how many merchants did Global Payments as well as Bank of Philippines have prior to the JV, just to help us with some sizing?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. Jason, its Jeff. So we're very pleased with the partnership with Bank of the Philippines. It's one of the largest banks as I said in our prepared remarks around the country. We're already in the Philippines market in two significant ways.","One, we have a direct acquiring business in the Philippines market already. And number two, we have our service and our global service center in the Philippines with about 600 employees. So, we think we're very well positioned alone and even better positioned in combination with our partners at Bank of the Philippines.","We're adding 34,000 additional merchants, Jason, through the joint venture. I think as we said publicly, Bank of the Philippines has 800 branches. So we're picking up an additional 800 branches in market.","And in terms of the growth rate, while we don't break out the financial separately for our submarkets of our 13 markets in Asia, what I would say is if you go back to one of the earlier questions about, from Ashwin, is to what drives our business, we're generally GDP plus derivative type of company. And if you look at GDP Jason in the Philippines it's growing really in the high single digits. It has in the last number of years, and expecting to do that today.","So I would say high single digits plus on an organic basis in that business is a good estimate, Jason. And then when you combine the two, I think each one of us is probably in the top handful of folks as a share point in the Philippines already. So I think on a combined basis we would expect to be the second largest player in the Philippines.","Jason Kupferberg","Very helpful. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. You may begin.","Glenn Greene","Thank you. Good morning. A couple questions. Just wanted to go back to the US growth, the 12%. I know it's early, but you've sort of embarked on participating in the OptBlue program. I wonder if you could quantify how meaningful a benefit that might have been to the US growth and maybe talk about strategically how important that is to you?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. Glenn, its Jeff. I'll start and Cameron can add some additional color. I think as a tactical matter it's very important to us. As I said before, we believe that we are the first large transaction processor in the United States to enter the market with OptBlue. We started the market in May of 2014. You saw this of course really fully in our first quarter.","If you go back to the first quarter prepared remarks, I think where in Cameron's section what you would have seen for the first time for a number of reasons, but OptBlue being a primary reason, is a substantially higher revenue growth rate relative to transaction growth rate.","And at least some of that is attributable to the fact that we're getting better traction, capturing share at better marginal economics on OptBlue versus our traditional, some of our traditional programs. I think that's probably one of the ways to think about what the benefit is to Global Payments is a better yield per transaction. As we move away from just a pure switch fee which is what we used to get through American Express or programs like it into more of a traditional acquiring mode where we get basis points on volume. And I think that's probably as much as we can say about the economics to us from American Express.","Glenn Greene","Okay. Understood. On Canada, I think what you said it was 6% constant currency growth and I think last quarter you did have some pricing benefits. And I'm not talking about international change related. How much of the 6% constant currency growth this quarter was transaction based versus pricing?","Cameron M. Bready","Last quarter you'll note we did make reference to some pricing initiatives that we did have in Canada and that was a contributor to the growth that we were seeing on a local currency basis. Obviously that continues to be a component of it.","But I'd say more importantly what we're seeing in Canada is stable business fundamentals. When you look at transaction growth and spread, we're seeing a relatively stable fundamental basis for the Canadian business which is really contributing to the local currency performance we're seeing. Naturally we saw 7% roughly decline in the Canadian dollar and that's why you're seeing the US dollar results that we're seeing.","Glenn Greene","And if I could slip in one more. The 50 basis points of margin expansion for the year, could you just delineate North America versus international expectations?","Cameron M. Bready","We haven't provided specific guidance for either of the two segments in terms of what we expect, other than to say we expect margin expansion for both of those segments which is going to contribute to the overall roughly 50 basis point expansion we're anticipating for the total company.","Glenn Greene","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Glenn.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. You may begin.","Darrin Peller","Thanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter. Just want to start off on capital structure, if you can give us a quick update on your strategy. You've obviously been much more [indiscernible] buybacks. But, I know Jeff you mentioned looking for more deal opportunities internationally especially. So where do we stand now on that?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, I'll start Darrin, with the strategy question and I think Cameron will put in a lot of the financial details. So we announced three transactions in the last four months really. Two of the three of which were outside of North America, those being Ezidebit and the JV with Bank of the Philippine Islands.","So I would say Darrin as it relates to corporate development and pipeline, we're now in the mode having just announced three deals in the last number of months of really rebuilding the pipeline. In terms of location of the pipeline, we're opportunistic. So as we've said before, we've got to find something that's for sale with a good partner with attractive returns to our shareholders and we do measure that relative to repurchase. So we're very focused on the IRR, as well as the cash earnings accretion from the repurchases, relative to the acquisitions to the extent that we can risk weight them. And that's how we think about the balance between the two. Cameron, you want to comment on the capacity and repurchase.","Cameron M. Bready","Sure. I'll be happy to. As you'll know and I'll just remind you of the comments I made in my prepared remarks, which is we did increase our share repurchase authorization to $300 million. We did execute some repurchases in Q2, although relatively minimal compared to things we've done historically.","As you look at our capacity today we have roughly $875 million of available capacity to pursue strategic initiatives. That's a combination of roughly $250 million of cash on hand and the balance being capacity under our existing revolving credit facility.","So as we sit here today we have roughly gross debt of $1.6 billion, net debt of something south of 1.4. We're sort of 2.5 times levered right in the sweet spot as we see it for continuing to move forward and execute on the capital allocation plan that we've been discussing now for several quarters, ample capacity to pursue both strategic acquisitions that meet our criteria, as well as continuing to be a relatively consistent buyer of our stock in the market.","Darrin Peller","All right. That's very helpful. Just one quick follow up. One thing I didn't hear mentioned much on the call around pricing potential is the Visa and MasterCard place changes going to effect in the US market, the increases in their assessment fees, although mild. I know there's been some opportunity for you guys in the past, not just to pass it through.","So, is that also something that might perhaps go into effect in January, April, and give you guys a little bit of a lift in the US market going forward?","David E. Mangum","Yes. Its David. The answer is yes, although I would point you back to Jeff's comments earlier. Those are the kinds of compliance releases that happen a couple of times a year. They're almost always baked into how we think about the business as the year starts.","But you're absolutely right, that's a little bit of help or little bit of air cover as we think about any operational things we might want to do in the second half of the year.","Darrin Peller","Got it. All right, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. You may begin.","Andrew W. Jeffrey","Good morning. Happy New Year, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Cameron M. Bready","Sure.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Good morning.","Andrew W. Jeffrey","Could you generally discuss sort of the couple I guess competitive questions, one, in terms of the North American OpenEdge competitive environment, US, any changes that are notable in terms of competition within the channel or from other providers?","And then as a follow-up, eCommerce, we're hearing about a lot of companies being funded in the eCommerce space, especially in Europe. Any sort of competitive thoughts on that front?","Cameron M. Bready","Yes. Andrew, I'll start with the US, North America view around OpenEdge and integrated. I think there are a couple ways to think about competition. First off, it's not notably different from maybe six months ago if we had the same conversation. There are more folks using the words integrated payments as they describe their offerings. Often those are ISOs without fully integrated payment solutions that really do embed themselves into the software that runs small businesses around the country.","So, when you get down to brass tacks from a solution perspective, there really is no change. But you see a little more marketing, a little bit more noise. Obviously, given the success, and the fairly public success of integrated solutions, particularly the solutions that we've been selling for the last year and a half when we finished off the APT transaction.","But again, if you reset yourself and say: Okay, is the list of competitors different from what it was six or nine months ago? No. Is there a noticeable change in the economics of the market from six months ago or nine months ago? The answer is no.","And, in fact, hopefully we're driving the opposite, which is rolling out more solutions, making us more and more the partner of choice obviously, but also driving more sustainable competitive advantage for us and our partners. As we work with the merchants themselves, we're doing more and more to solidify those relationships.","So, we feel very good about our competitive position in integrated in the United States, and feel very good about the prospects of rolling it out over time internationally, broader than just Ezidebit, with its Australia, New Zealand and Asia presence.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","I'd say, Andrew \u2013 it's Jeff. On the question about eCommerce, we tend to think about it, especially in Europe, as really an omnichannel offering. So, we tend to think going forward it's going to be less about how the transaction really came into the merchant, and more about our ability to service people on both a card not present environment, as well as a card present environment.","That's particularly true, as I mentioned before to Tien-tsin, as we move into a post-SEPA environment. So, as you think about the implications of domestic and cross-border rates being lower across the EU, it really shouldn't matter where a merchant is based and how a transaction comes in.","So, we're actively positioning our Business, and repositioning our business in the case of Global Solutions, to really deal with omnichannel customers, to provide better value-added analytics and services in an environment where we think merchants will be more inclined to accept a transaction however it comes in, as rates are reduced.","So, I think we think a little bit less along the lines of eCommerce, and more along the lines of can we capture share by offering value-added solutions that are almost channel-agnostic.","Andrew W. Jeffrey","Very helpful. Thanks a lot. ","Jeffrey S. Sloan","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens, Inc. You may begin.","Brett Huff","Can you guys hear me okay?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes.","Cameron M. Bready","Yes, we can hear you, Brett.","Brett Huff","Good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter.","Cameron M. Bready","Thank you.","Brett Huff","I had a quick question \u2013 two quick questions. One is, can you give us, apprise for us the pro forma or the cash EBIT dollars, percentage-wise that Canada contributes now? And then, can you talk a little bit about what the DCC offering there might help? That's one question.","Then the other is a little bit bigger picture, looking into fiscal 2016. Can you just go over generally what kind of the pros and cons or puts and takes are as we think about more sustainable margin expansion for you all? I know it's going to be about 50 basis points this year, as we think about the interchange changes, SEPA [ph] changes, APT and PayPros integration and things like that. So, those are the two questions? Thanks.","Cameron M. Bready","I'll jump in. And I'll ask either Jeff or David to provide any additional color commentary if they'd like to. First, as it relates to Canada, we're really not going to provide any more disaggregated data relative to its total contribution on a cash EBIT or operating income basis for North America.","I would note on the second part of your question around DCC, it's a relatively small opportunity for us. It's obviously something we are prepared to offer to merchants in that marketplace, but we just don't really see that as being a significant driver for the business as we look to either the balance of FY 2015 or the years beyond.","As we talk about the second part of your question, as it relates to margins for 2016, let me just start first at a high level. I think what we've traditionally said is we anticipate organic margin expansion in this business of 30 to 50 basis points annually. And that's going to be driven by a variety of factors, and it's going to ebb and flow a little bit depending on the year, and depending on what some of the headwinds and tailwinds may be.","We're obviously not in a position to provide 2016 guidance as we sit here today. But we certainly are pretty pleased with the performance we've been able to generate thus far for the year, and we're guiding up 50 basis points for the full FY 2015 fiscal year.","As we look forward to 2016, we expect some of the tailwinds that we're seeing in 2015 to continue. And certainly, the pricing initiatives that you referenced, the lower interchange are going to be positives. But we also expect to see continued headwinds for FX.","We're going to continue to have to endure those, at least till we get to the middle part of next year, given that a lot of the deterioration we've seen, or strength in the US dollar we've seen, has been in the recent months, not so much in the first half of fiscal 2015.","So, I think we do expect certainly the business fundamentals to remain strong as we roll into 2016, which I think will present a nice tailwind for margins. We expect the pricing initiatives to be positive. But I think we also expect FX to be a continued headwind, certainly at least for the first half of the year.","Brett Huff","Okay. Great. That's what I needed. Appreciate your time.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Tim Willi","Thanks, and good morning. I just had one question for Jeff, David. Obviously, you're off to a strong start. You've let some of the upside come to the bottom line in terms of revised guidance?","But I'm just curious, Jeff or David, when you think about areas of the business that you would have liked to have had more dollars to spend on, when you originally set out on this year, where are you going to spend extra money or where are you most encouraged about allocating some of this extra earnings power that's emerging?","Is it geographic, is it product? Just sort of curious if there's anything that really highlight that's going to get a bit more focus than maybe it otherwise would have?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, Tim, it's Jeff. I'll start at answering your question. It's a very good one. What I would say, and I take it more in the corporate development area versus the product area, and David may augment that with his thoughts, too. But on the corporate development side, we always start with, what types of partners are really available, and are they partners that we're comfortable with? ","So, one area of the company that I've mentioned before that, if I had all my wishes kind of come true, would be an expanding presence in Latin America. So, as you know, we have our business that we started De Novo about a year and a half ago in July of 2013 in Brazil. We're currently up to 6,500 merchants, and our partners at Caixa [ph] we are pretty pleased with where we are.","But I think we've also acknowledged that, in the context of a business of our size, it's not enough to make a meaningful increase in our revenue or our EBITDA or our cash earnings in the immediate term.","So, sitting here today, I would love to be in a position, Tim, over the next 6 or 12 months to be able to say that we've significantly increased the size of our business in Latin and South America. Part of that, of course, is Brazil, which we're in already today. But we've talked a lot about other Latin American markets like Mexico, given its size and its prominence, that we're not in directly, that we really wish we could be.","So, if I could snap my fingers and find a place to substantially expand the footprint of the business, I would certainly say that additional investments in Latin America, in those markets in particular, would be most welcome. Dave, do you have any comments on the other?","David E. Mangum","Yes. I think, Tim, you asked a great question. And I think - I'm glad you did, because it allows us to say: We are repurposing some of this solid year into other, more tactical things, even beyond what Jeff said at the strategic level in terms of entering new markets.","We are putting some of the money actually back into new product, into new solutions. We're accelerating some solutions that were already on the drawing board. We also are taking some things that we've been discussing, at least in this room in which I'm sitting now, as long-term initiatives, bringing them forward a little bit as well. Things like reengineering the way we interact with customers themselves to drive both a better customer experience, as well as drive improved opportunities for compliance, and also improved economies over some period of time.","Renewed focus on organic growth to the extent we can with better tooling and better product drive more and more organic growth. These are all sort of examples of investments that we have brought forward or initiated in the last few months that we had on the drawing board for the future that will help us drive long-term growth and help sustain the model development the way Cameron has described it to you this morning.","Tim Willi","Great. Thanks very much for the thoughts, guys.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, Tim.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Tom McCrohan of Sterne Agee. You may begin.","Thomas McCrohan","Hi, guys, and an apology if this question was already asked. But could you just give us a feel for the impact this quarter on the lower oil prices, and how we should be thinking about that going forward in certain markets such as Canada? Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Hey, Tom, it's Jeff. So, we answered that a little bit, but not probably as head-on as you just asked it. I would say in all of our markets, we are a GD plus derivative business, meaning we should grow north of GDP. And we look really at the Visa and MasterCard and local statistics on a transactional basis is what the target is for our rate of growth.","To the extent that consumers, for example, or businesses, but especially consumers are paying less for some of their costs like oil, that has the effect of a tax cut, and should increase their ability to spend on a volume basis in those markets. So, it's really nothing but good news.","I would say, as a corollary, we really don't have, really in any of our markets, a very large fuel presence. So, there really is no offset, because we're not really present at the pump in any substantial way in most of our markets.","So, to go back to one of the previous questions, Tom, it's really nothing but good news for our markets as it gets reflected in better organic GDP rates.","Thomas McCrohan","Great. Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks a lot, Tom.","End of Q&A","Jeffrey S.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Winnie. We are delighted to report that the strong momentum we saw in the first half of this year continued through the third quarter. We again delivered double-digit organic growth across our markets at the high end of both our expectations and our raised cycle guidance set in March 2018. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points and delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% in the quarter, highlighting ongoing outstanding execution globally.","We also made a significant progress in all three components of our growth strategy. First, we expanded our own open software portfolio with the acquisitions of AdvancedMD and SICOM as we continue to successfully deploy our capital to build out our technology capabilities in attractive vertical markets. As a result, our business mix is shifting further toward technology enablement, which we expect to be nearly 45% of our total revenue in 2019, up from 40% in 2017 and 30% in 2015.","We are pleased to announce that we recently closed our acquisition of SICOM, a leading worldwide cloud-based, enterprise software provider for the restaurant and food service management vertical markets. SICOM's solutions are highly synergistic with our existing Xenial platform and the two combined provide us with end-to-end offerings for small, medium-sized, and enterprise-level restaurant customers globally, one of the largest vertical markets that we currently serve. More specifically, SICOM adds middle-of-house and back-of-house software and other technology capabilities to Xenial's front-of-house platform.","The combination creates a leading solution that includes point-of-sales systems, kitchen and drive-through management, data and analytics, as well as payroll scheduling and procurement capabilities.","Our ability to now deliver a complete solution to the entire restaurant vertical uniquely positions us as a one-stop shop for software and payment services for customers in this $4 billion target addressable market or TAM. Through Xenial, we currently provide services to over 25,000 quick-service restaurants in the United States. SICOM adds a worldwide footprint to our QSR markets with enterprise solutions that double our restaurant base across 60-plus countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.","The acquisition of SICOM also provides entry into the food service management vertical market, a $2.5 billion account. SICOM is already leading this market by providing solutions for customers like Compass Group and Sodexo. We are very excited about the potential for accelerated growth in this new owned software vertical.","We also closed the acquisition of AdvancedMD in early September. We're off to a great start with AMD seeing strong bookings momentum in the most recent period, and we are beginning to leverage Global Payments' corporate capabilities as well as our leading distribution network to penetrate the 80% of AMD's $3 billion payment opportunity we do not capture today.","In addition, we see immediate opportunities across payroll and enhanced position referrals from our Heartland business.","Finally, ACTIVE achieved record bookings last quarter as it continues to acquire new logos and expand business with existing strategic partners. Including ACTIVE, we have successfully executed three software acquisitions over the last 14 months just as we said we would do.","In the aggregate, our own software businesses now have exposure to vertical markets, representing roughly 25% of U.S. GDP, the largest economy in the world.","Further, our global pipeline of opportunities to invest in businesses that will enhance our tech-enabled, software-driven payments capabilities remains full. The vertical markets we target are sizable, distinctive, defensible and relatively insulated from disintermediation. These businesses tend to be less susceptible to broad-based macroeconomic concerns and have resilient, predictable and highly recurring revenue characteristics. We remain confident our differentiated approach will enable us to continue to gain market share by widening the competitive gap with our legacy competitors.","Moving to the second leg of our strategy, we are pleased to report that we now expect our ecommerce and omni-channel solutions business to generate approximately $520 million in adjusted net revenue plus network fees in 2018. This represents high-teens organic growth in constant currency, ahead of the mid-teens target we discussed in March.","As a reminder, this business produced $250 million in 2015 and $450 million in 2017, so we have more than doubled these lines in three years with performance consistent with many of the fastest-growing companies in the online technology space and ahead of the card networks. We are well represented in this rapidly growing channel and on track to achieve a 20% share of total revenue target we set for 2020.","We believe we are overweight ecomm\/omni across Continental Europe and Asia-Pacific relative to the markets that we are in, and that we are more than proportionately represented in this channel in the United States. On a global basis, we are already a market leader today.","How do we achieve these results? First, the market is segmented by customer size so we are distinctive and that we stick to our knitting with our value proposition by focusing on small- to medium-sized or F&B customers looking to go ecomm or omni within a given domestic market or cross-border.","Second, the market is further segmented by geography and we also serve larger customers, like multinational corporations looking for cross-border acceptance in hard-to-serve markets like Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, as well as across Continental Europe.","Third, we provide not just local sales offices, but also operational and support resources with local and multinational expertise in 31 countries, and domestic licenses and processing capabilities in nearly 60 countries. Our localized solutions produce higher acceptance rates and lower fees for some of the most complex, demanding and technology-savvy customers worldwide, a list that includes preeminent global brands like ZARA, Swatch, (00:09:50) and LVMH, and some of the largest payments facilitators globally.","Fourth, we're also fortunate to have distinctive partnerships across our geographies with leading institutions, including CaixaBank, HSBC, Erste Bank, CIBC, National Bank of Canada and Bank of the Philippine Islands. These partnerships provide us leverage to access to faster-growth markets, enabling us to catalyze penetration by delivering market-leading technologies to scaling digital economies.","Fifth, we have made substantial technology investments in these businesses to expand our competitive moat. We expect to continue to differentiate our omni-channel offerings over the next 12 months by making additional enhancements to our next-generation omni-channel platform and further developing our cloud-based SaaS modular systems, which are already in production. When combined seamlessly with our ability to support processing in nearly 60 countries, we expect our unified technology offerings to continue to lead the market over the coming years.","The third and final element of our strategy is to expand our industry-leading footprint and technologies into faster-growing markets, where strong secular trends, distinctive partnerships, and our innovative software and services are driving substantial and sustained revenue momentum. The organic revenue growth rates we achieved in key markets like Spain, Central Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines this quarter were again well into the double digits. We look forward to entering Mexico in the near term as we continue to extend and expand our relationship with HSBC globally.","The unique combination of our market-leading software, partnered and owned, ecomm and omni businesses, and faster growth geographies has enabled us to meaningfully outgrow our legacy peers in 2018. And we have achieved record margin expansion in free cash flow, while continuing to make investments today to provide for future growth. We're on a trajectory to accelerate our transformation to 2019 and beyond as we continue to transform our business to more closely align with our high-technology and pure ecommerce peers.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to have delivered another quarter of exceptional financial performance, driven by continued strength in organic growth across our key channels and consistent execution of our growth strategies.","Total company adjusted net revenue plus network fees for the third quarter was $1.025 billion, an increase of 12% versus the prior year's. Adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 33%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $1.44. We achieved these results while also successfully closing two strategic acquisitions, AdvancedMD and SICOM, meaningfully expanding our software-driven payment strategy and vertical market footprint.","Our ability to consistently execute and deliver organic top-line growth, margin expansion and earnings growth at the high end or above our cycle guidance, while also investing in the business for future growth, remains a hallmark of our success over the past several years.","Turning to our segment performance, adjusted net revenue plus network fees for North America grew in excess of 13% to $756 million for the third quarter, which includes an approximately 100-basis-point headwind from adverse foreign currency exchange rates. Adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 34.3%, despite the negative impact of foreign currency and modest pressure from the acquisition of AdvancedMD. North America margins continue to benefit from growth in our technology-enabled portfolio and increased scale in our business.","We successfully closed the AdvancedMD transaction on September 4, which contributed adjusted net revenue in line with the forecast we provided at that time. As a reminder, we also anniversaried the ACTIVE Network closing on September 1. ACTIVE Network contributed adjusted net revenues of approximately $50 million in the third quarter.","Our U.S. direct distribution business again delivered low-double-digit normalized organic growth at the high end of our targeted range, as it has each quarter this year. Our wholesale business revenue declined at the high teens rate this quarter, in line with our expectations and guidance as we continue to emphasize our direct distribution businesses and actively pivot away from this channel.","Our Canadian business grew low-single-digits in local currency, although that was more than offset by adverse foreign currency exchange rates. This resulted in Canada declining low-single-digits in U.S. dollars.","Moving to Europe, adjusted net revenue plus network fees grew 10% or approximately 12% on a constant-currency basis. The UK grew in the high-single-digits as good execution and share gains once again drove solid performance. Our faster growth markets in Europe continue to contribute meaningfully to top-line growth in the region.","Spain grew in the mid-teens in local currency, driven by a stable underlying economy and the strength of our partnership with CaixaBank. Likewise, our Erste joint venture also delivered mid-teens growth, reflecting favorable secular trends and benefits from the introduction of new products and services in our Central European markets.","Lastly, our ecommerce and omni-channel solutions business grew in the high teens as we continue to scale in the pan-European market, leveraging our unique ability to combine our online and physical brick-and-mortar capabilities.","Adjusted operating margin in Europe expanded 60 basis points to 47.6%, driven primarily by the strong top line performance partially offset by the impacts of foreign currency translation and continued reinvestment in the business.","Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we reported adjusted net revenue plus network fees growth of 10% or approximately 13% on a constant-currency basis. Local currency growth in the region was driven by broad-based strength across our key markets, including Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Ezidebit and eWAY continued to see good momentum and once again delivered strong double-digit growth in local currency.","Adjusted operating margins in Asia expanded 140 basis points to 33.7%, primarily as a result of strong organic growth despite the negative impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rates.","Our ability to consistently drive core top line growth and deliver margin expansion across our businesses allowed us to generate strong adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of approximately $260 million, excluding acquisition and integration costs. This reflects continued disciplined capital investment in the business, which totaled $53 million for the third quarter.","Our highest priority from a capital deployment standpoint remains reinvestment in the business to support our growth initiatives, including M&A. As we highlighted, we closed the $700 million acquisition of AdvancedMD in September and the $415 million acquisition of SICOM earlier this month. We financed these transactions using a combination of cash on hand and our existing revolving credit facility.","As a result of these acquisitions, our pro forma leverage currently stands at approximately 3.8 times, a comfortable level that provides a clear line of sight to our targeted 3 to 3.5 times range given the strong cash flow generation profile of the business. We also maintain sufficient dry powder to continue to pursue our organic and inorganic strategic initiatives going forward.","To that end, we improved our liquidity position in October with the execution of a $500 million term loan B. The proceeds of which were used to pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility. Once again, we were able to execute this term loan B offering at LIBOR plus 175 basis points, a best-in-class rate for our current credit rating.","In addition, we recently entered into a new $250 million notional amount interest rate swap to further hedge our exposure to floating rates. As we continue to implement our interest rate hedging strategy, we expect roughly 40% of our debt portfolio to be hedged by the end of 2018 and nearly 50% by the end of 2019.","Looking ahead, the momentum we see in our business, coupled with our consistent execution, has us on track to yet again deliver strong financial performance in the fourth quarter despite pressure from foreign currency exchange rates.","For 2018, we're delighted to raise our adjusted net revenue plus network fees expectation to a range of $3.96 billion to $3.98 billion, reflecting growth of 15% over 2017. We expect AdvancedMD and SICOM to contribute adjusted net revenues of $45 million to $50 million for the fourth quarter, which essentially offsets foreign currency headwinds for the back half of the year relative to our original expectations.","Further, for the fourth quarter specifically, we expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind to adjusted net revenues plus network fees of approximately 100 to 200 basis points. In addition, we expect our U.S. direct business to again achieve double-digit organic growth, while we anticipate our North American wholesale business will decline at a \u2013 similar to Q3, which is in line with our expectations for this channel.","For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by up to 120 basis points, unchanged from our prior outlook, despite the significant impacts of unfavorable foreign currency translation and the modest pressure in the quarter we expect from our recent acquisitions.","Pro forma for M&A financing, we now expect net interest expense to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, bringing our forecast to approximately $180 million for the full year. Further, we anticipate our effective tax rate for 2018 will be 20% to 21%.","Putting it all together, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $5.12 to $5.22, reflecting growth of 28% to 30% over 2017.","We cannot be more proud of our performance in the third quarter and year-to-date period. As we close out 2018, we're pleased to be in a position to exceed the expectations we had at the start of the year. Likewise, as we look forward to 2019 and beyond, we remain excited about the momentum in the business as we advance our technology-enabled software-driven strategy worldwide and our ability to meet or exceed the increased cycle guidance targets we established in March.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Cameron. As we said in March, let's look at the facts. We have delivered compound annual growth of 25%-plus and reported adjusted EPS over the last three years, while expanding margins and delivering record free cash flow annually and all the while, generating sustained and in many cases accelerating revenue growth. This was all done without financial engineering as revenue and margin flow through to operating income and free cash flow, and 2018 is no exception.","The proof of any model is in the consistency of the results. You don't have to take it on faith that we will deliver on our commitments that revenue will one day accelerate, that margins will one day expand, that synergies will one day materialize, that our partnerships will be durable, that we will be good stewards of capital, or that our technologies will one day be market-leading, rather we are already there today and we are now building on those achievements. The momentum across our businesses plainly continued through the third quarter and now persists into the fourth quarter, which we expect will round out an outstanding 2018.","We could not be more excited about our trajectory heading into 2019, 2020 and beyond. The best is yet to come.","I will now turn the call back to Winnie.","Winnie Smith - Global Payments, Inc.","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is open.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask, Jeff, you spent a lot of time talking about the restaurant vertical and obviously, we've got the SICOM acquisition in there. Can you just maybe refresh for us again what is sort of the big competitive advantage now that Global has in that vertical given all the competition that's coming from some of your peers focusing more aggressively on it?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, George. I appreciate the question. So, I think the primary advantage that we have is we have an end-to-end enterprise-level cloud-based technology solution across the entire spectrum of the restaurant vertical market. So I think it's very consistent with our technology-enabled software-driven payment strategy.","If you think about the combination of Xenial and SICOM, we have front-of-house solutions; we're interacting with customers at the point-of-sale; we have middle-of-house solutions like order management and drive-through; and then we have back-of-house solutions, so like data and analytics for franchisors and franchisees. A lot of this, of course, is on a Software-as-a-Service or on a SaaS basis, and we're in the market and in production today.","The other thing we have, as you know, given our footprint is a multinational perspective on the restaurant business. As we announced in our prepared remarks, we're now present with those enterprise solutions in 60 countries around the globe in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific. So, if you take a step back, it's the breadth and depth of the technology solutions that we're selling primarily on a Software-as-a-Service recurring basis, and it's also the breadth and depth I think of the geographic coverage and scope that we're delivering in all the markets that I just described.","We were delighted to see a number of our competitors announce that they intended to going into these types of markets. But these are businesses, George, as you know, that we were already in with Xenial and Heartland Commerce, and now have gone deeper into with SICOM and are in production today. So I think it's gratifying to see that folks think that vertical market software is an attractive place to be in restaurants, but really we're already there today.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, George. It's Cameron. The only thing I would add to that is we also have solutions that's geared to everything from enterprise-level customers, so some of the largest quick-service restaurant names you can think of, all the way down to small single-shop or multi-shop units all SaaS-driven. Again, all of that can be tailored to the specific needs of the specific segment of the market that we're targeting whether it's a small customer needing customer, medium-sized customer, all the way again up to that enterprise-level customers.","So we have a breadth and depth of solutions across front, middle and back as well segmented by size of merchant from enterprise down to the small single-shop operator.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's great, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, Cameron, if you could just size for us on an annual basis what the contribution, both from a revenue perspective and margin perspective for SICOM will be.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, George. So, SICOM on a revenue basis for 2019 we expect to be around $100 million, growing in the low-double-digits. From a margin standpoint, given that we're able to combine this business with our existing Xenial operations, we expect margins in 2019 to be roughly consistent with overall corporate margins and then accretive to margins thereafter as we realize synergies from combining the two existing businesses and platforms.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, George.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter. I just want to start off first if you can help us...","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, thanks. I mean, just more granularity on the direct business. Obviously, (00:27:57) were down on the high teens, which I know you guys expected. But outside of that, it seems like the core direct keeps going extremely well. And I'd just be curious to hear a little more granularity in \u2013 whether it's by vertical, what happened with other underneath in terms of education and gaming. Maybe a little more color will be great.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Darrin, it's Cameron. And first of all, thanks for the comments. So, I would say U.S. direct growth in this quarter, very consistent with what we saw in Q2. And like that strong Q2, as you recall, it's probably one of the best quarters we've seen in the business. So, I would say fairly close to Q2, better than Q1 quite frankly from an organic growth standpoint.","So if you break it down into its constituent parts, integrated and vertical markets again grew in the low-double-digits, continues to provide obviously a nice tailwind for growth in the U.S. business. That's a combination of our partnership model obviously with OpenEdge, as well as our owned software assets and the distinctive vertical markets that we're in today. We do target low-double-digit growth for that business we've seen through the course of this year and we're obviously delighted with the momentum we have in that channel.","If you look at our U.S. direct more traditional relationship-led distribution platform, it grew again high-single-digit again, consistent with the level we saw in Q1 and Q2. So again, you combine those two channels and I think U.S. direct growth in the third quarter was around $10.6 billion, $10.7 billion (00:29:20) in that ballpark versus $11 billion (00:29:22) in Q2. So right in the same area that we saw in Q2 and again at the high end of our expectations for that channel. As you know, we target high-single-digit to the low-double-digit for the U.S. direct channels.","ACTIVE contributed about $50 million for the quarter. It grew low-double-digits relative to its number from Q3 of last year. And as Jeff \u2013 or as I noted in my prepared remarks, Jeff noted in his prepared remarks, AdvancedMD had a good strong month consistent with the expectation we provided at close. So, I think when you break it down without getting into any individual channel, every business in the U.S. really performing kind of at the higher end of our expectations for those channels in the third quarter. Again, good consistent momentum as we've seen throughout the course of 2018, which we think positions us very nicely going into the fourth quarter, and of course 2019 is right around the corner as well.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. That's great detail. And then, just a quick follow-up on margins. They came in better than our model. And I think it's still, to some degree, the mix, right? I mean, your ISOs being down obviously is helpful to your margin. What else is in there in terms of mix that's driving the margin expansion being particularly better than I think even you guys may have expected?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, it's a great question, Darrin. So, I think you're on the exact right point. The mix is really the biggest thing that we're seeing from a margin standpoint as well as I think good execution and obviously disciplined expense management in the business. But I would say, mix is the biggest driver. You're right in pointing out the ISO business declining, the wholesale business declining in the high-teens, that's obviously a benefit to margins in the quarter. And again, our integrated and vertical margins markets business being higher-margin portfolios for us, those growing more quickly than the rest of the business also create a nice tailwind from a margin standpoint as well.","I would say that the really nice thing about margins particularly in North America this quarter is we delivered 180 basis points of margin expansion, notwithstanding currency and notwithstanding the investments that we're making back into the business from the benefits we've seen now from tax reform. So, I think if there's one thing I would call out specifically this quarter that we're particularly delighted about, it's the margin expansion that we experienced despite those two headwinds.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. That's great, guys. Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Kwok with KBW. Your line is open.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, could you elaborate on your comments around making enhancements to the omni-channel offerings? Would this be done all in-house or would you look to supplement that with perhaps a good acquisition or a tuck-in one? Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Steven. So, of course, this quarter is the one that we traditionally give kind of an update on our ecommerce and omni business. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're delighted with the growth in that business, which is high-teens for the quarter and we expect high-teens for the year as the guidance implies. So, the first thing I'd say is we have a complete solution today and we're obviously in market that generates the results that we've been describing both for the quarter as well for the year. The enhancement we're looking at is making it even simpler to go into more markets with Global Payments around the world with a single omni-channel API interface no matter where you are globally, a single terminal API no matter where you are globally. Those are all being done in-house and those will be rolled out on a rolling basis and being rolled out really now, but on a rolling basis throughout 2019. So, we've been able to generate the results that we've reported to-date as well as our expectations for the year through our enterprise hub and the other technologies that we have today. Those are being further enhanced and are already in the run rate that we've been describing. So, expect to continue to gain share as we have been as we head into 2019.","I would tell you it's a competitive matter. And we're now pitching for new business for some very large and sophisticated potential counterparties. I think we're already market leading today. I think this is going to put us really \u2013 when these things roll out throughout 2019 internally really put us in the driver's seat in terms of growing this business going forward.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And this actually fits right into my next question. Just around \u2013 if you could talk about the competitive landscape both on the offline and ecommerce space. One of your ecommerce peers has announced this morning that they are looking to expand into Canada and signed up a number of merchants. Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, of course, all of our businesses are intensely competitive, not just in an ecommerce anatomy, but in any created vertical markets and in all the geographies that we're in around to the world. If you go back, Steven, to kind of my prepared remarks, we really compete in a number of distinctive ways. First, we're primarily focused on small to midsized businesses or SMBs within a domestic market or those SMBs looking to go omni-channel cross border. Great example is Canada where it made very attractive headway in ecomm and omni over the last several years and it's a meaningful part of the growth really in our business in Canada. You can see in some of the materials we posted today on our website that we believe we're over-represented in North America, including in Canada relative to the size of those ecommerce and the omni-channel markets.","The second thing I'd say is we look to go global with multinational corporates in markets that are harder to serve. I gave a list of those in my prepared comments. In many cases, there's only one or two folks including us who can really provide those services in the markets that we're looking to compete in. We also have a very healthy payment facilitator business globally. A great example of that is a recent renewal we've had with PayPal globally in our business, and I think it's really a testament to the quality of our ecommerce and omni businesses globally much of what they're doing around the world outside of North America where they do it themselves, particularity in Europe and Asia, and to my point, Steven, the harder served markets, it's really with Global Payments. So, I think it's a tribute to the quality of our technology and really the extensibility of our geographic markets.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. So, just...","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, Glenn.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","...want to go back to the SICOM acquisition. I know you sort of talked about the low double-digit sort of organic growth, but could you talk about more broadly over time the cross sale or revenue synergy potential and if there's any sort or cross synergy potential we should be thinking about?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Glenn, this is Jeff. I'll start and I'm sure Cameron will add to this. So, if you think about where Xenial really is which is the Heartland Commerce business in the restaurant vertical market, Xenial offers a lot of really good things, but particularly in royalty customer management, gift cards, mobile application. So, ordering your hamburger on your phone, paying with your thumb and going to pick it up. Those are things generally that SICOM is really not in in terms of by way of product offering. So, I think the most obvious cross sell initially is to cross sell the Xenial solutions into the SICOM base and to cross sell the SICOM solutions which I described at the beginning of the call with George are primarily front of house, middle of house, and back of house delivering those into the Xenial customer base, that's probably number one.","Number two would be bringing the Xenial solutions globally. So, SICOM, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is present in 60 markets, essentially doubles our restaurant base by another 25,000 locations. The ability to catalyze Xenial growth outside the United States and bring that into those existing markets where SICOM is already present is another real attraction by way of cross sell, Glenn, in revenue.","And then, lastly, I would say that while Xenial and Global Payments are among other things payments-related businesses, historically SICOM was much more pure software and a lot less payments. Our ability to go into large chains and SICOM has four of the top 10 QSRs in the United States and some outside the United States like Tim Horton's for example in Canada but in the U.S. Burger King, Jamba Juice, et cetera, our ability to cross sell payments are kind of the core part of Global Payments into the SICOM base is another revenue synergy that we're very excited about very similar to what announced, Glenn, as part of AdvancedMD. So, those are the three that we're most focused on in the near term.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And then, Cameron, just a clarification on the forward full-year guidance and it's sort of in the context of I think you made a comment about the acquisitions adding $45 million to $50 million of revenue in the fourth quarter being offset by incremental FX. Can you just sort of go through that? What I'm trying to get at, has the constant currency organic growth expectations changed at all?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Glenn, that's a great question. So, I think the constant currency organic growth expectations have increased. So, if you look at the, call it, roughly a point. So, if you look at the guide that we've provided today, the new acquisitions we expect to contribute $45 million to $50 million in the fourth quarter, that roughly offsets the FX headwind that we expect now in the back half of the year relative to what we originally anticipated coming into the year. So, if you look at \u2013 stripping out the acquisition and adding back sort of the FX headwind, you kind of get to a number that I would say puts you towards the high end of the original guidance that we've set forth at the beginning of the year, which again I would say suggests organic growth at about a point better than we would have anticipated kind of coming into the year from the original guide.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi, guys. To get to the 60% revenue target for software enabled, do you have to get into other verticals and if so what other verticals might they be?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","So, I'll start, Tom, and Cameron can comment as well. I don't think we have to get into other vertical markets, but clearly if you go back to some of my prepared comments, Tom, the way we think about attractiveness of vertical markets is across a number of criteria. The first thing is what's the target addressable market? How big is the opportunity? In the case, for example, restaurants, we think it's $4 billion of revenue a year. In the case of the food service vertical market where we try to (40:02) Compass and Sodexo, coming of the SICOM acquisition, we think that's $2.5 billion a year. In the case of AdvancedMD in the healthcare side, we think that number is growing to the billions as well.","So, if you step back and you look at my prepared comments, Tom, we have exposure now post the deals that we've done to about a quarter of U.S GDP. We don't need to do more deals in terms of more vertical markets to get to the 60%, but clearly there are other markets that we've looked at that are sizable in the United States that we're are not directly in as an own software managed. Two most obvious ones that I think we've talked about before are real estate, for example, and government business and we're already in a little bit of the government businesses. But paying your taxes or your fees online, paying your condo association and property fees and insurance fees online are both attractive opportunities, as we see it, I think generally follow many of the characteristics that we've enumerated before.","Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great and just as a follow-up \u2013 and thanks for giving us the update on ecommerce and omni. Is there a way to break out how much of the revenue today from that ecommerce and omni channel is going over mobile devices.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","We don't have that level of detail today, Tom. It's Cameron. So, I can't give you a specific amount that's coming directly from mobile devices. So, as we think about our omni-channel business, it's going to be the combination of where we provide both online capabilities to our merchant customers, that's going to be a combination of traditional Web based ecomm \u2013 ecomm or mobile offerings with the brick-and-mortar capabilities as well. We don't further disaggregate it between mobile and what's coming through more traditional ecomm portals.","Thomas McCrohan - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Tom.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Hi, Cameron. Congratulations on the quarter.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So far, the three larger software ownership acquisition that you've made, they kind of make sense. The common question I get from investors though is not so much about your ability to make the acquisitions work in the short term which very few people doubt I think, but it's about the ability to evolve and run multiple software stacks over time. So, could you comment on that and maybe sort of talk to some of the things that you may have learned from a year of running ACTIVE?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Sure. So, I'm certainly happy to start, Ashwin. And I know Cameron will join in. So, at the end of the day, whether it's software business like the three that we've acquired over the last 14 months or whether it's an ecommerce or omni-channel business like Realex or Ezidebit or eWAY, that we acquired over the years, I think the most important metric on how we're doing is the ability to produce over a period of years sustained and accelerated revenue growth.","So, I think the most important thing is not, to your point, can you make a number one quarter, what does it look 12 months' out. It's what does it look a few years out in terms of building out a better business that has permanently changed upward, revenue acceleration margin and earnings contribution. I think we've been able to do that, to be honest.","If you look at our ecommerce acquisitions in Europe and in Asia-Pacific, if you go back and look at our integrated acquisitions with APT and PayPros, all those date from six years ago to three years ago to four years ago, and that's what we've been able to deliver. We're only a year and year and half in to ACTIVE in some of these more recent deals. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the bookings numbers coming out of ACTIVE, a year and a couple of months after that transaction closed, are at record levels which I think is a testament to our view of our ability to maintain and accelerate revenue growth.","It's early days, but I also mentioned that in AdvancedMD in a limited period of time since we closed that transaction booking there running at very high rates. So, of course, time will tell. But I think if you look at that metric which I view as the primary criteria on how we're doing in these partnerships, those numbers look really good and retention customers and retention of those personnel is really high.","At the end of the day, if you step back further and you put aside metrics and productivity, and you just look at what I think we're good at and what I think we're not good at, what I think we're particularly good at is providing an environment where technologist can flourish. What does that mean? It means we're good at things like infrastructure, compliance, regulatory, accelerating sales, not just in the United States by way of channel, but outside of the United States. And that's what you're seeing with some of the benefit on the deals that we've done.","What do I think we're not particularly good at? Well, we like to leave the management and the technologist, and the software folks in place because that's the expertise that they're providing. A great example of that, I went to the closing town hall at AdvancedMD in Salt Lake a couple of months ago and what I said to the folks there is, listen, I don't know all that much about the healthcare, I'm not starting now. That's what you guys do. You know healthcare by way of vertical market, that's a lot of where the value lies. And what you're doing, I think, we can help you get there more quickly.","In the case of AdvancedMD to follow up on what \u2013 for example, Glenn was asking in terms of revenue enhancements and what we can bring. AdvancedMD is very excited about our ability to bring to Heartland payroll solutions, our ability to bring more physician residences by knowledge of local markets in which we operate and our ability to get the close rate up in 80% of payments that we don't own. Those things are generally really good news to the partner businesses that we're acquiring and the stuff that software people and sales people like to hear because we're growing the pie. And that's where I think, Ashwin, that points of demarcation are. But you have to believe me, you can just look at our track record over the last six years and see how that's gone.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Ashwin, it's Cameron. I would just maybe add just a couple of comments to that as well. So, if you think about our entire M&A approach, we're very deliberate in terms of the type of businesses we buy. We buy quality management team. We buy assets where we think the cultural fit is very strong largely for the reasons Jeff just described. We want those management teams to continue to run the businesses as they've been running successfully, leading us to our acquisitions.","So, we run our businesses more on a core and edge strategy where the edge businesses continue to develop in the core software platforms that they had developed and they continue to invest in those to keep them contemporary and ensure that they meet the needs of the market going forward and remain market leading in whatever specific verticals that they're in today.","So, that's a big part of how we approach the business to begin with. We look to get scale out of these assets through traditional corporate support services, technology infrastructure as Jeff just described, compliance activities, et cetera. And we're also looking at other areas where it can drive more scale including leveraging ACTIVE's offshore R&D capability to provide services to other software businesses as well. So, we're doing more of the development through our own in-house resources as opposed to either outsourcing that to third parties or having to do it each individually within the businesses themselves. So, we do find those opportunities create scale in the business, but largely what we provided the software businesses themselves is the right environment in which the (47:37) described and the investment to continue to build the products set and the solutions to drive that top line revenue growth.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. No, that's very comprehensive. I guess one other question, the follow-up, is with regards to lot of strength underlying here. Is there any reason why we should not carry this into 2019?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","No, I would say absolutely not. As we sit here today and I think I covered some of this in my prepared comments, I feel very good. We're sitting here at the end of October, certainly feel very good about the momentum we have going into Q4. And I think quite frankly, our guidance for the full year reflects we have a tremendous amount of confidence in the momentum we have in the business in terms of where we think we'll end up for a full 2018 basis. And as we look forward to 2019, it sort of foreshadowed where we thought we would be earlier in the year for 2019 and beyond very consistent with the cycle guidance we've provided back in March, but still feel very good about how we're positioned to meet or exceed those expectations heading into 2019 and beyond.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Good to hear. See you in a couple weeks.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Ashwin.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the acquisitions as we start to project the 2019 contribution here. I think you said SICOM about $100 million in revs. We're thinking AMD, I guess, in the $140-ish million range? And then, any color perhaps on EPS accretion, how we should start thinking about modeling that for 2019 on an adjusted EPS basis?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Sure, Jason. It's Cameron. So, one quick correction and then a little bit of color. So, as it relates to AdvancedMD, and I think we said this on our Q2 call, we expect them to contribute $125 million next year...","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Oh, next year?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","...under ASC 606.","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Sorry. I think that was...","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","So...","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","If it wouldn't have been of (49:33) ASC 606 impact on their business which they had not yet adopted when we acquired them, so around $125 million for AdvancedMD. You're right that SICOM at around $100 million.","Just a little bit of color around margins. As I mentioned before, we expect SICOM to come in at or around corporate margins in 2019. And again, as we begin to merge our existing Xenial business with SICOM, we expect to realize synergies. And as we scale that business heading into 2020, we expect it to be accretive to margin.","AdvancedMD, we expect to be \u2013 to modestly pressure margins in 2019, so it will be a little bit of a headwind to margin in 2019 and we expect it to be kind of at corporate margins or above corporate margins kind of 2020 and beyond as we scale that business.","From an earnings standpoint, the combination we expect to be accretive to 2019 EPS estimates for our business based on our own kind of internal expectations. Both would be kind of modestly accretive kind of heading into 2019 and obviously more expansive thereafter.","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. And do you have kind of a clean specific number for a constant currency organic growth across the whole North America business in Q3 as well as what it was in Q2? I had a number in kind of the low 9%s for Q2, so just wanted to check on that if we include the entirety of the North America business.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, constant currency normalized organic growth for North America in total was around 9% for Q2, and it's around 8.6% for Q3 in that ballpark, so very similar. The difference largely being wholesale was a bigger drag in Q3 than it was in Q2.","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Exactly. Okay.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","If you exclude wholesale, North American grew on a constant-currency basis roughly 10% in Q3 and a pretty consistent amount in Q2, a little north of 10%, so right in that ballpark.","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. It's Jamie at Susquehanna.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Hello.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Good morning, Jamie.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I'll just ask my two upfront, one for you Jeff and one for you Cameron. Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you had commented on markets where you characterize yourself as over-indexed ecommerce. I'm just wondering what advantages you like command when you're over-indexed, that's one question.","And then, Cameron, I want to ask about cross border. And thank you for the slides, they're helpful. But with regard to cross border being that you typically but not exclusively are heavier in SMB, how would you characterize if they're cross-border opportunity for SMBs? So, one on the index and the other on the cross border. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Jamie, it's Jeff. I'll start on the relative share of the market. So, I think if you look at those slides, we think we're overweight ecomm\/omni in all three of our regions, such that \u2013 one of the points we really wanted to get out there because we do get asked what our footprint is. So, I would say, in every one of our markets \u2013 you can see on the slides, all three of our reporting regions, we have a greater share of our business in ecomm\/omni than the market implies for itself, that's kind of one point.","The second point I'd make though is if you break it down further, we're particularly overweight ecomm\/omni in Asia-Pacific and Europe, and we think that's a really good thing. Now, why is that the case? And I think it's because of the breadth of our geographic franchise. If you think about the 13 markets we're in in Asia-Pacific, in some of those markets I had listed some, Jamie, in my prepared remarks like Malaysia and Singapore, the Philippines, those markets are always competitive. But there is not a tremendous number of commodity based providers provide the quality of services that we are in each one of those markets. I also mentioned it's not just providing processing, Jamie, but it's providing on-site support in all the things that we do globally. So, for example, I won't mention who it is, but a very large multinational, one of the largest in the world, did an RFP a couple of years ago in Taiwan. The people who bid on that and ended up winning it were us and one other entity, and that was a bank that was native to Taiwan. Now, why would that be? Because that's a really hard service in a really hard market to provide. So, it doesn't mean that our businesses aren't competitive. It doesn't mean that we don't have to be very good in what we do, but it does mean that we like our odds when we're one and two in a market that's really hard to service. That will be a very have good reason why we think we're overweight ecomm\/omni in Asia-Pacific and the markets that we're in because the markets that we're in are hard to service multi-nationally.","And of course, I also mentioned the PayPal renewal. And in some of those markets, that's a very good example as to why we feel that we've got an in-depth relationship with one of the largest payment facilitators in the world. The same thing would be true in the context of Europe. If you think about SEPA and the conversations we've had, Jamie, over the years, our view of a single market and provide not just ecomm solutions but also physical acceptance on an omni-channel basis, our footprint, our physical presence in 31 markets in particular in Continental Europe for these purposes is really helping to drive a double-digit growth that Cameron described in Central Europe. There were not a lot of people who are in those markets doing that, which is why we think we're overweight in the EU and in \u2013 by way of SEPA in those markets. Cameron, you want to comment on the second part, the cross border?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Jamie. And I think it's a good question. It really depends on the region in which we're operating. So, naturally here in the U.S. the small to medium-sized merchant space, there is not going to be a tremendous amount of cross border. There will be some, but predominantly small to medium-sized merchants who were using our omni-channel capabilities today want to sell it online in the brick-and-mortar location and kind of in the U.S. market. As you begin to move towards Europe, you do see obviously an increase in the level of cross-border activity particularly even at the small to medium-sized merchant levels, because frankly that's what partially the EU is designed to accomplish and SEPA is designed to accomplish. It's lowering the barriers for commerce around the EU market. So you do have more smaller to medium-sized merchants selling on a cross-border basis on a Pan-European basis, and obviously we do see higher levels of cross border volume with our small to medium-sized omni-channel merchants in those markets as well.","Asia is a little bit of a mixed bag. You do see between certain markets, particularly the, call it, Chinese-centric markets, more cross border activity. So, whether it's between Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao, you're going to see more cross border activities. Whereas within other markets where we're serving small to medium-sized merchants on an omni-channel basis, it's going to be more domestically oriented as well. So, hopefully that gives you a little bit of color as we think about it around the globe. It's a little bit of a mixed bag just given the different geographies we're operating in. As Jeff noted, obviously at the multinational level, it's all about cross border. It's our ability to provide a seamless solutions in up to 60 markets around the globe where we can blur the lines between obviously the physical brick and mortar, point of sale acceptance and ecomm and omni for those customers.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Cameron, Jeff, thank you very much.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thank you, Jamie.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie. Great to see you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, guys. I just wanted to ask a bit more on Europe for a moment. I didn't hear a lot on the UK and just kind of given all the kind of up and down rhetoric around that market. I'm wondering what you're seeing. And then, secondly in and around Europe, is this more a function of market share gains? You talked a little bit about this just a second ago, but I'm trying to make sure I can fully reconcile kind of what's underlying demand versus share gains, and how sustainable that is as we think about kind of 2019.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Dan. It's Jeff. I'll start and I'm sure Cameron will jump in. So, I think it depends on the market that you're in in Europe, but let me just start with United Kingdom. Point blank, it's share gains. If you look at our consistent growth in Cameron's copy, at least the three quarters of this year and probably going back through next year, if you look at any metric, Dan, Visa, Mastercard numbers in the UK, if you look at GDP in the UK, if you look at same store sales growth in the UK, those numbers tend to be zero or one or whatever the numbers are on a given day. And so, I think Cameron said in his prepared remarks, it's another high single-digit quarter growth for us. So, there is no doubt in my mind it's share gains. I would say, that's augmented by our focus on the small to midsize business and leading with technology.","UK, in particular, is a big place for us to have our ecomm and omni business. That's been true for a number of years, so there's no doubt leading with technology there as well as with integrated and semi-integrated solutions has been very beneficial to us. But that's just another way of describing why we're taking share in that market relative to the size of the market.","I think if you back up and look more broadly across Europe, and now I'm thinking Spain, our Erste JV in the Czech Republic and across four markets in Continental Europe, that is a bunch of things. First, I'd say, there is a no better partner thank I think you could have in Spain and across Europe than CaixaBank. As Cameron called out in his commentary, that business for the \u2013 probably for the eight years now nearly that we've been in partnership with Caixa, continues to grow 50% to 100% north of what the market reported rates of growth are. I really chalk that up to how good a partner Caixa is in that business and across Europe.","I think the same thing is prudent to be true with Erste Bank in Continental Europe. Of course, in Continental Europe, (59:28) better demographics in terms of rising middle class, better receptivity to newer technologies because ecomm and omni and DCC just have an existence there. Until more recently, Spain is obviously further down the path technologically than perhaps some of our other markets in Continental Europe. Nonetheless, however you slice it, Dan, when you look at the UK, you look at Spain or you look at the Czech Republic, our businesses in those markets are all growing faster than the rate of market growth. And again, I chalked that up to share gains.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Not a lot of color to add there, I think that covers it pretty well. Just a couple of other data points I would mention. On UK, in particular the market growth you're actually seeing is largely debit contactless.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","There is not that much market growth in the UK. So, if you look at the performance we've been able to achieve, I think it's pretty clearly attributable to share gains in that market. And obviously, as Jeff highlighted, the continued expansion of our ecomm and omni capabilities in that domestic market as well as on a Pan-European basis.","The other thing I would call out is Spain. Spain, again, mid-teens growth this quarter off of the summer where tourism was not nearly as strong as it was last summer quite frankly. So, what we saw in Spain this quarter is even better domestic trends than we've seen quite a while. Tourism was down year-over-year relative to 2017, so very impressive kind of domestically oriented performance quarter in Spain this year. And I think that summed up Central Europe really well. I think we're starting to see not only the revenue growth coming from our ability to bring new products and services into end markets that has better secular trends, but also to scale benefits with now having that operating on our technology platforms now that the migrations are complete in our joint venture. So, again, positioned very well, I think as we head into 2019 for Europe. Obviously, time will tell what manifests from the Brexit activities, but I think we feel very good about how we're positioned in that market.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will open the lines for questions and answers. And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.","Isabel Janci - Global Payments, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to Global Payments' second quarter 2017 conference call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-KT and any subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.","Some of the comments made on this call refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net revenue and adjusted earnings per share, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our trended financial highlights, both of which are available in the Investor Relations area of our website. You can also find a few slides that describe the ACTIVE transaction at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Isabel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We again delivered double-digit organic net revenue growth this quarter on a consolidated basis with continued strong execution across our markets. In addition, we grew adjusted earnings per share of 24% and expanded operating margin by 130 basis points. We could not be more pleased with the progress we have made against our strategic objectives, and we believe the best is yet to come.","At our investor conference in October 2015, we outlined two key strategic initiatives to accelerate transformative growth: expansion of both our integrated and vertical markets business, and our e-commerce and omnichannel offerings. A bit less than two years later, we have made substantial progress on each of these initiatives. First, our integrated and vertical markets business continues to grow at a double-digit rate, driving an outsized quantum of our overall growth. Our landmark partnership with Heartland enabled us to enter the education, university and hospitality verticals. In addition, we've expanded our offerings into additional geographies, including Canada, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico, and will soon bring them to Spain and Hong Kong, further differentiating our competitive position in these markets.","And this morning, we're delighted to announce a definite agreement to purchase the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network from Vista Equity Partners. ACTIVE is a global leader in delivering cloud-based, mission critical, enterprise software, including payment technology solutions, to small-to-medium sized businesses, targeting at events in the communities and health and fitness verticals.","Over the last several quarters, we've been highlighting our technology-enabled, software-driven strategy. This acquisition dovetails with our thesis, to expand our integrated and vertical markets business by owning more of the value set in specific verticals, where we see opportunities to meaningfully increase payment throughput. ACTIVE has high rates of recurring revenue and operates in a fragmented and underpenetrated market with attractive growth fundamentals. It also has no channel conflict with existing Global Payments businesses and partners, and has a complementary global footprint. We expect to realize revenue and expense synergies over time, as we seek to leverage our extensive distribution assets and further scale the business globally.","We are also delighted to announce a strategic partnership with Vista that creates new opportunities for us to offer payment technology solutions to the worldwide portfolio of businesses. Vista is the preeminent global investor in enterprise software, data and technology, with a current portfolio of over 40 platform companies that in aggregate represent the fourth largest enterprise software company in the world. While Vista has transacted with other companies in our sector historically, we are delighted that they have chosen to pursue this key strategic initiative with us, and will be an equity-holder going forward. Their imprimatur speaks for itself.","Second, as you know, our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions business generated roughly $250 million of annual revenue at the time of our October 2015 Investor Day. Today in less than two years, that business has increased substantially to nearly $400 million of annual revenue and continues to grow at a double-digit pace. And we've only just begun penetrating the $30 billion global market opportunity in this space by capitalizing on our market-leading technology and worldwide online and offline footprint.","Over the last couple of years, we have integrated Realex's e-com technology with our omnichannel capabilities to create feature-rich solutions in the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, and together with Heartland, the United States. In 2018, look for us to combine this business with our eWAY offerings in Asia Pacific, and provide unified worldwide solutions. At the same time, we have continued to further enrich the platform with over 100 additional alternative payment methods, security or fraud management tools and enhanced shopping cart integrations to provide market-leading capabilities to our customers.","Unlike a number of our online competitors that have tried to move offline, we have successfully penetrated a broad range of markets with our omnichannel offerings. And today we provide these solutions to merchants in over 50 countries across five continents. In fact, we have a long history in payment facilitation with some of the most sophisticated technology companies leveraging our solutions globally. Our unified worldwide offering in technology platform, together with our extensive relationships, make us the partner-of-choice for merchants globally.","Finally, it is worth noting that on a pro forma basis for the ACTIVE acquisition, over 40% of our net revenue now resides within our integrated and vertical markets business, and our worldwide e-com and omnichannel offerings. And of course that is generating a substantial portion of our growth. Further, small-to-mid sized businesses remain our core focus and we make the vast majority of our profit worldwide in the SMB market. Just a few short years ago, we set out to differentiate our company as the leading provider of payment technologies worldwide by changing the game. The extension of our strategy into software solutions further paved the way for us to deliver more comprehensive, vertically fluent solutions to customers worldwide, driving continued momentum and growth in our business. We think our results and partnerships speak for themselves.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter performance was once again exceptional and meaningfully exceeded our own expectations across our key markets. We are pleased with the consistency of execution worldwide as we continue to advance our strategy. Total company net revenue for the second quarter was $848 million, an 18% increase over 2016, driven by double-digit organic growth in each region. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.94, reflecting growth of 24% or 29% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin for the quarter expanded 130 basis points to 29.2%.","The success of our Heartland integration efforts provides the backdrop for an outstanding performance in our North American business this quarter. Net revenue grew 20% to $624 million, driven predominantly by low double-digit normalized organic growth in our U.S. direct distribution channels. This was primarily attributable to continued strength in our Heartland sales channel and our integrated and vertical markets business. Canada also delivered better than expected performance with mid single-digit growth in local currency. North American operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 29.7%. Margin expansion was driven by the strong net revenue performance across our U.S. direct channels and the realization of expense synergies from Heartland.","In Europe, net revenues grew 13% to $159 million or 19% on a constant currency basis, led by double-digit organic growth in our European e-commerce and omnichannel solutions business as well as our United Kingdom and Spanish businesses. Our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions business continues to generate strong growth as we execute against our pan-European strategy while the UK and Spain both benefited from resilient domestic trends and robust tourism seasons. European operating margin of 45.5% declined 200 basis points from the previous year as expected, primarily due to foreign currency impacts and integration costs associated with the Erste transaction as well as higher costs associated with increased cross-border volumes. As a reminder, we anniversaried the closing of our JV with Erste in June and much of the integration work is now behind us positioning us well to bring the full breadth of our payment solutions to our Central European markets going forward.","Our Asia-Pacific business continued its strong performance in the second quarter. Net revenue grew 15% driven by solid trends across our key markets including Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and China. And Ezidebit once again contributed significantly to results in the region continuing to generate over 20% organic growth. Nearly three years after closing this partnership, we could not be more pleased with the performance of this business. Asia-Pacific operating margins of 30.2% increased 330 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong net revenue growth across the region.","Excluding Heartland integration costs, we generated free cash flow of approximately $130 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests. Capital expenditures totaled $44 million for the quarter. In addition, since the beginning of the year, we have reduced outstanding debt by approximately $180 million, resulting in gross leverage of under four times at the end of the second quarter.","As Jeff discussed, today we announced that we had entered a definitive agreement to acquire the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network from Vista Equity Partners in a transaction valued at $1.2 billion. Net of a tax asset, the purchase price is roughly $1 billion. Vista will receive $600 million of Global Payments' stock and $600 million in cash as consideration. We expect to finance the cash portion of the consideration with our existing credit facility and cash on hand, and anticipate the transaction will increase leverage very modestly. We expect to close the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2017.","We are very pleased to be adding ACTIVE Network to our integrated and vertical markets business as we look to further our technology-enabled, software-driven strategy globally. Not only is the transaction immediately accretive, but we also see opportunities to enhance returns by leveraging our worldwide distribution to accelerate growth and further scaling the business. Likewise, ACTIVE Network brings state-of-the-art software development resources, data and analytics platforms, and machine learning capabilities to Global Payments that we expect to significantly benefit the company more broadly.","As a result of our strong performance for the second quarter, we are raising our outlook for calendar 2017. We now expect net revenue to range from $3.40 billion to $3.475 billion, reflecting growth of 20% to 22% over 2016. Operating margin is now expected to expand by up to 120 basis points. Lastly, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to range from $3.85 to $4, reflecting growth of 21% to 25% over 2016. Our updated 2017 guidance does not include any impact from the acquisition of ACTIVE Network, which we expect to be immaterial to 2017 adjusted earnings per share.","We are extremely pleased with our performance in the second quarter, and thus far in 2017. Our continued strong execution across the business, positions us well to achieve our financial expectations for the year, while we also invest in the business to deliver differentiated solutions to our customers worldwide.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Cameron. We are delighted with the strength and consistency of our execution in the second quarter, which we believe to be our strongest to-date. We are most excited about the investments we've already made in our operating and technology environments over the last 18 months to provide further scale to our businesses as we approach calendar 2018. Our partnership with Vista and our acquisition of ACTIVE Network further distinguish Global Payments from our peers. We expect these investments to provide additional catalysts for continued market share gains over the coming months and years.","As we celebrate our company's 50th anniversary this year, we're struck by just how far we have come as a business, particularly over the last several years. As I noted, we continue to believe that our best days remain in front of us, and that we're better positioned than ever to grow our business and deliver exceptional value creation for our shareholders. Isabel?","Isabel Janci - Global Payments, Inc.","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you.","Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Congratulations on the good quarter and what looks like a very interesting acquisition. Let me start with the acquisition. Could you size both the Vista and ACTIVE opportunities sort of separately and the timing actually of how it might layer in? It seems like a very wide range of verticals that are represented within the Vista portfolio, healthcare, automotive, insurance. I mean, do you need to actually develop now APIs and solutions and connections to each of those and what does that mean for development cost going forward?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Ashwin. It's Jeff. I'll start and I'll ask David and Cameron to join me as well. This, as we said in our prepared remarks, is across its entire portfolio is the fourth largest enterprise software company in the world across 40 companies, really worldwide, in a bunch of geographies. Our opportunity to try to offer our payment solutions to Vista in terms of how we thought about that, the annual process volume across all those markets and all those companies is around $50 billion of volume per year.","So, as we thought about the opportunity, we need to look at each one of those discretely and determine what our desired markets are, what we can offer to those companies, and how that may play out over time. But certainly, as we thought about it, it's relatively unique in our industry to find one partner like Vista who has that many opportunities in our sweet spot, which is to say multinational corporations growing quickly enterprise software in so many markets around the globe. I also think we're uniquely positioned to offer those solutions as there aren't many people in our industry with the size footprint we have, worldwide as well as the type of technology solutions we can offer to someone like Vista and their companies.","Cameron, do you want to add anything to that?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","No. The only thing I would add, Ashwin, is this is a relationship where we will go portfolio company by portfolio company to determine the right solution for that particular entity. In some cases, there is maybe instances where they become a part of our OpenEdge business and we integrate into their technology environments. In other cases, we may just provide payment services in a semi-integrated format as well. So, we really have to look at each individual business. So, it's something that's going to scale over a period of time. I think to Jeff's earlier comment, the value here is having an extensive relationship with someone who owns obviously so much enterprise software around the globe that perfectly aligns with our strategy again to be in businesses and align with businesses where a software can drive faster rates of payment throughput.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","And to be specific to your question, Ashwin, I don't anticipate us doing anything other than we've otherwise been doing in terms of growing our company. So I don't envision there being additional investments beyond what we do ordinarily, in the ordinary course for Global Payments to service complicated customers like that worldwide which we do every day.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, Ashwin, this is David, just a little more color on what Jeff is saying, that as we build the sales strategies, it's about sequencing these deals and over some period of time, over a number of quarters, calling on these one by one and creating the right kinds of solutions that Cameron described for each instance.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. No, that color is very useful. A follow-up in terms of the results themselves, you got the beat today here, any commentary with regards to 3Q versus 4Q guidance in terms of segment revenue trends, profitability?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Ashwin, I didn't hear \u2013 unfortunately, couldn't hear you very clearly. Could you repeat your question?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, sir. I'm asking about 3Q versus 4Q guidance in terms of segment revenue trends and profitability.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Sorry. Okay. So, Q3, Q4 guidance, I would say a couple of things. First and foremost, we're halfway through the year, and we recognize the game doesn't end at half time, so we still have a lot of work to do in the back half of the year to make sure that we deliver on our financial expectations for the year. I think as you all know, we raised our revenue guidance by roughly $18 million at the midpoint that's on top of the $20 million raised last quarter. So, we've already raised our revenue guidance for the full year by an entire point-plus, so I think we feel very good about how we're positioning obviously revenue growth for the overall year.","We also raised our margin guidance again by another 10 bps on top of 20 basis points last quarter, so we now anticipate margin increasing or expanding up to 120 basis points for the full year. And then lastly, we raised our earnings guidance by another $0.05 at the midpoint on top of $0.07 last quarter. So again, we now expect earnings per share in the range of $3.85 to $4, 21% to 25% growth year-over-year, 23% at the midpoint, we're obviously very pleased about that outlook.","As it relates to each of the individual segments, I would make a couple of comments. One is, generally our expectations remain relatively the same. For North America, we expect and we manage the business to drive high single-digit rates of organic net revenue growth. In that particular segment, we obviously do from time-to-time have the ability to exceed that as we have done in Q1 and Q2. We certainly don't manage the business day-in and day-out with the expectation that we're going to achieve that level. So, the outlook for the balance of the year is in line with our overall expectation for that business.","In the case of Europe, we still expect to produce net revenue growth on a reported basis in the high single-digit range. Again, we've now fully anniversaried the Erste transaction in June. So, as we look to the back half of the year, we would expect revenue growth in Europe to be in that high single-digit range, which is up from the mid-to-high single-digits, previous guidance. And then in Asia, we still expect double-digit organic growth for the full year. We anniversaried the eWAY transaction in Q1 as a reminder, and we do expect double-digit organic growth in the back half of the year in our Asia segment as well.","So, that's generally what's embedded in our outlook for the balance of the year. The only other note I would make around FX is sitting here today we have seen the dollar weaken a little bit here over the last month or so in particular. Our outlook for the balance of the year doesn't anticipate that that strength continues. We actually expect rates to weaken slightly relative to current spot levels. So, our forecast would not assume that the current rate environment that we've seen over the last couple of week persist into the back half of the year as well. So, to the extent it does, that's obviously good news for our business, but then today I don't think that we have embedded current spot rates into our outlook for the balance of the year. So, hopefully that helps give a little bit of color on what's in the guide?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, that's very useful. Thank you very much. Great job, guys.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, guys, and congratulations on the transaction. Cameron, you did mention the transaction is immediately accretive. I'm just wondering if you can help us reconcile that statement a little bit with, I don't know, maybe some idea about the financials at ACTIVE? Then I had a follow-up.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Dan, a couple of things. One is, the business today for 2017, we expect to produce net revenue approaching $200 million on our revenue convention, our net revenue convention, so that gives you a little bit of size around the revenue. Obviously anticipating a close in Q4, there is not much time for it to be particularly additive to 2017. As we think about 2018, we expect it to add a point to point-and-a-half to earnings growth for 2017 from an accretion standpoint. It's also accretive to our rate of net revenue growth, as we mentioned previously and it's also accretive to our operating margins.","So, it's a very nice business, I think financially on top of strategically dovetails nicely with our integrated and vertical markets growth profile. So, it's a double-digit grower top-line, consistent with our integrated and vertical markets business, it has margins that are above our corporate average and our scaling, and obviously our ability to leverage our distribution worldwide and to leverage obviously Global Payments infrastructure, can help the business scale more quickly. So, from a financial profile standpoint, it really aligns nicely with our strategy and the financial profile we're driving for the overall business.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. That's great. Thank you. The follow-up is just as you think about this strategic relationship in the portfolio, Jeff, are you viewing this somewhat as a feeder pool for other acquisitions down the road, as part of the strategic partnerships you get right of first refusal to the extent that some of those assets would be sold out of that portfolio? Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Dan, it's good question. I would say we view our partnership with Vista as one like rest of our partnerships we really have to earn or keep and earn our business every day. So, no, there is no right of first refusal to buy other companies with Vista. They're obviously in the business to maximize value just like we are, so I don't think that really changes anything.","What I would say though that is a little bit different here with Vista. In prior deals they've done with some of our peers or the way that we've interacted with some of our peers historically is, first they've chosen to take equity in Global Payments, and I think that's a real sign of endorsement in their view of the strength of the model. So, that's one point that is somewhat different for us in dealing with a private equity firm from whom we bought assets in the past. APT for example was from a private equity firm, Great Hill, that we paid all cash for it, so I think that's a little distinctive to this partnership.","Second, I think part of the reason Vista looked to take an equity stake as part of the consideration in Global Payments was for exactly the reason you're asking, which is how do they participate in the value creation over time in the revenue stream and the profit stream that might occur from additional processing and technology relationships that we have with our portfolio of companies over a period of time. So, for example, when they've done other deals in our sector with other people with whom they compete, they did not take equity as part of those deals and rather they chose us to do that. So, I do think that that piece is distinctive.","The third, to go back to where we started, at the end of the day, we have to earn our business every day. We're going to sit down and go through those companies with the companies themselves and determine what's in the best interest of Global Payments, and of course, we'll do the same thing for their businesses. But I do come back to Ashwin's question, which is what's somewhat unique about this is the strength of our global footprint, our knowledge of their businesses in terms of enterprise software, our ability to deliver really e-com, omnichannel, any product, anytime and anywhere, I think is somewhat unique to us and there is very few people who fall in that category.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jeff, I appreciate the strategic differentiation that Global has established here. I wondered if you could just comment from a high level especially given all the M&A that's taking place worldwide in payments, sort of how you differentiate Global's long-term approach versus some of your competitors. I'm specifically thinking about the ACTIVE deal and the move into enterprise vertical markets as opposed to maybe a horizontal omnichannel push, which I know you're pursuing in some parts of the world too. But just big picture, I wonder if you could do a little compare\/contrast and how you think about Global's role in the consolidating industry?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Sure, Andrew. That's a great question. So, what we tried to say in the prepared remarks is, actually we feel like we've laid out a fair amount of the roadmap in our October 2015 Investor Day. So, if you step back for a second and you're asking where are we going, I think more broadly we think about our business as really two pieces: one is technology because we're a technology company; and the second is distinctive and defensible distribution where we continue to capture share gains. So, most of our partnerships and acquisitions falls in one of those categories, if not all, although the latter is a little bit more rare than the former.","When we think about ACTIVE for example, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, this gets us to over 40% of the combined business being in the technology-enabled, high end of our distribution the way we described our distribution in our October 2015 Investor Day. We think our ability to build defensible distinctive distribution is enhanced when we own more elements of the value stack, as we do, not just and will with ACTIVE when it closes, but as we do in TouchNet, in the case of the university business, in the K-12 business in Xenial and Heartland Commerce in the case of their QSR business. So, what I like about where we are is that we continue to build on that theme of technology enablement and distinctive distribution where we're competing on the basis of other than price. So, on the basis of value-add, around the software stack and the quality of what we're distributing.","While we've done that, the other element of technology enablement, Andrew, is the e-com and omnichannel business and while we're very excited about ACTIVE, I don't want to lose the messaging we had in our prepared remarks that we've taken the e-com and omni business from $250 million of net revenue back little bit less than two years ago in October 2015, up to $400 million is our expectation this year, with a growth rate of 60% in less than two years. So, as we look at that business, I don't view either of these integrated and vertical markets business or e-com and omni as mutually exclusive, rather we're growing them both well into the double-digit rate.","If you look at some of our peers by way of comparison, I think you are right in what you said. They are much more horizontally focused. Some of the markets in which they're contemplating going into narrower markets that we've been into since the last decade. Those are attractive markets that we very much like the footprint, as we described in our results, Europe being a very good example and Asia as well. We very much like the footprint that we have in those markets today. We think in some of those markets, in particular that we're right-sized for this moment in time, and I think you can see that in our financial results that notwithstanding some of the currency impacts, notwithstanding issues around macro, as it relates to Brexit, we continue to deliver very good operating results in those European markets, and that's my perspective on how this stuff fits together.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. And could you just comment when you look at ACTIVE's business on, who you think the primary competitors are?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Sure. It's really a bunch of fragmented smaller private companies. So one of the things that we really like, Andrew, about ACTIVE and businesses like it, is that we have the ability to partner with the leader in the market space. As we said in the slides that we attached to our website this morning, we think we only have with ACTIVE 5% to 7% of the addressable $60 billion a year of volume market opportunity. The next is far slower than that. So, we like businesses where we could adopt a strategy of partnering or buying the number one competitor and then everyone else is much smaller and we'll either choose to just continue to gain share on that business organically or look to partner further. So, we like businesses where we're one or two where everyone else is much smaller. So the answer to your question is, smaller privately owned companies in that segment.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Terrific. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Good morning, Glenn.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Good morning.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","I guess on ACTIVE, a couple more questions, I don't know how familiar we are all with it. So, I was just wondering if you could help us with the business model, how do they drive that $200 million of revenue, I saw on the slide presentation, $3 billion of volume, I don't know how relevant that is, but maybe the drivers of the revenue growth and then also how did you sort of rationalize at a high level, the $1.2 billion or $1 billion sort of net valuation?","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Glenn, it's David. In terms of the business model, think of ACTIVE as the exclusive interface between consumers and the folks who manage events in the communities and the health and fitness industry, so let me drill into that just a little bit. In communities, that means we're the system of record and we're the engagement engine as well as the registration and payment engine for parks, kids camps, YMCAs, program registrations, all sorts of payments that all those types of institutions have to actually drive.","So being the system of record, we are enterprise class in the cloud, helping them drive engagement with the consumer, or say with a mother or father who's registering a kid for that camp or someone who is actually joining and becoming a member of the YMCA. And the payment is central to that transaction, right. The payment is actually the registration. So, think of this as software revenue that's expressed in terms of the fee we charge for the payment and the registration for the interaction with the consumer. We also have ancillary services around demand generation and marketing. But really we are the system that drives camps and YMCAs in the community business.","In sports, think of the exact same interface with even larger deals, larger opportunities for demand generation, and other ways to monetize the payment. In this case, you're talking about anything from a local 5K, all the way up to a marathon or a triathlon. So, all the software in the cloud that drives those enterprises, all able to do that on a global basis. So, we already operate in 74 countries, maybe greater than 74, depending on the count. That $60 billion of market opportunity we take in all those countries, the software operates in 30 languages. So, you can see already, it's ready for Global Payments, to scale it around the world, given our world-wide direct distribution.","On that theme, it's sold by a direct sales force. There is some telesales elements, there is a lot of direct sales elements. We think we can amplify that, but as Jeff described a little bit ago, we're into the direct distribution business. This is a directly distributed software product, out to the end user, who is the person who's managing or organizing a community event or a large event, all with our enterprise, again great software, SaaS based software, where the payment again is central to the action we like, as you can see from the slides, available where payments drag software and software drags payments. We know payments very well. We're in the business now, and another way of describing what Jeff described, of wrapping more and more value around that payment, owning more of the value stack, owning more of the value chain, having multiple ways to make money, but better still multiple ways to delight customers. So, all-in, at the end of the day, and I'll let Cameron talk about the actual numbers and the opportunity, it's a pure software business, it's critical to running the vertical we're serving, the vertical again being event management and communities in the health and fitness business, all running at enterprise scale with a direct distribution model, it's a perfect fit for our tech-enabled software-driven strategy.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","And Glenn, it's Cameron, I'll talk a little bit about valuation. You're right. The focus on the $1 billion is obviously net of a tax asset, that's really what we're paying end of day for the business. As you think about it on an EBITDA multiple basis, we really view it as a sort of 12 times, 12.5 times multiple transaction on an NTM basis, which we think obviously is fair, but compares very well against other software-oriented deals with similar characteristics as a company like ACTIVE and view that multiple as attractive, frankly relative to where other assets in the market have traded. So, when we're acquiring a business, again that's a double-digit top-line grower with margins well above our corporate average with good growth potential and our ability to scale that business over time, acquiring that at a 12, 12.5 times EBITDA multiple on an NTM basis feels like a good value, I think good value for us, and frankly good value for Vista.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","All right. That's all very helpful. Just one more for \u2013 back to the partnership with Vista, maybe for Jeff. I guess I'm just a little bit unclear on exactly how this works. My guess is, you're still going to have to go out and fight every day to win business within each of those 40 portfolio companies. Or does this give you some sort of leg up on the competition. I guess I'm just a little bit confused as to what the partnership brings you?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","No, Glenn, we're still going to have to fight for that business every day as we do around the world with all of our customers globally. But what I would say is like every other proposal we make to new partners, the fact that we have a relationship with Vista, the fact that we know their strategy, the fact that we have equity ownership in common, and that we understand at the very highest levels, their philosophy and where they would like to take their companies and they understand our technologies in depth, I think does nothing but really help us at the end of the day. I don't think that they're going to find many people who have the potential and the breadth that we have in our solutions and technologies. We're not going to find very many people who have the breadth and depth of ownership and understanding that they have. So, I think this is the \u2013 they started it. But no matter what we do, Glenn, whether it's a partnership with Vista or partnerships with other large FIs globally that we've done for many decades. We always generally think with the perspective that we have to earn our business every day. We don't really rely on contracts or anything else to kind of get us there.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Glenn, it's David. From a sales perspective, every sale is easier if it starts with a warm hand off, a warm introduction. We get a very warm introduction and all that and from there we expect to earn a fair amount of business over time.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Fair enough. That's all very helpful. Thanks, guys.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Good morning, guys, and good job on the quarter. Jeff, I just want to stay on this M&A theme a little bit longer. You've obviously had impressive growth on the e-com side that you've laid out. But as you think of the e-com market and the evolution there, and I guess what I'm getting to is sort of the growth of more facilitator models, growth of marketplaces and the like. Do you think your technology is up to par with competing against some of those entities, and quite frankly, do you foresee in the future the need to potentially acquire some of these facilitator assets in an online world?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, George, it's a great question. What I'd say on the facilitator side is that we already have one of the largest payment facilitators in the world using our technology for a very long time. So, clearly, if it were not the case that our technology were competitive, that partner would not be a part of it. We're signing up new partners all the time worldwide using our existing technology. So certainly, I think what we have today is very market competitive. As we said in our prepared remarks, if you look at our investments in online as well as offline, which we call omnichannel, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, I think we're relatively uniquely positioned based on what we know from the online providers who had a lot of trouble going into offline omnichannel acceptance, especially cross-border, particularly as a licensing matter, as a servicing matter, especially worldwide, given their economic model.","So, I think the proof is in the pudding. The first thing I'd say is we have large facilitators using us for a long time. The second thing I'd say is we've been able to grow that business as much omnichannel as it is e-com really. I would say that the mode of competition is going to shift, George based on my view of the industry, that increasingly the world has moved from online-only into any payment, anywhere, anytime no matter how it comes in, which is why I think having a face-to-face element that couples with online acceptance is so critical.","So, if you look at what we've done with Realex since we partnered with that business just about three years ago now, bringing that company from just the UK and Ireland, which is where it was with us initially into Spain, into Canada, into the United States in partnership with Heartland and as I said in my prepared remarks, plans are to bring into Asia through an integration with our eWAY business in 2018, we obviously continue very much to invest in that business. And I think that's a good indicator, George, is where we think the mode of competition is going, the ability to have a unified worldwide platform not just in one country or a couple of countries but worldwide. And lastly I'd say, as we probably have said previously but not recently, we're a direct member in almost all the networks, and into the financial intermediation markets, pretty much everywhere in the world with the exception of a few markets we really can't be, Mainland China being one example and here in the United States, just given the histories of regulatory environment here, as you know, we're not a bank here in the United States.","So, I would say, you couple that George with the direct licensing that we have by way of footprint in all those markets that David described. So, we have the technology element, a distribution element and a licensing and operating element. I would tell you, there aren't a lot of people online or offline who have that cross-border in the way that we do.","Lastly, in terms of whether we would do more deals, as I said, the last number of quarters, it's relatively rare for Global Payments to go a year-and-a-half and not really announce anything of size. Obviously, there's a lot going on in the industry. Clearly, we think we have critical mass into e-com and omni businesses as we do in integrated and vertical markets. But obviously, as you know, we're opportunistic. We're very much driven by strategy, culture and returns to our shareholders from doing deals, I think ACTIVE is a very good example, other type of profiles, and the slides I think lay that out of what we're looking for. So, certainly we expect to do more over time, but it's from a position of strength, I don't think we need to do more to be competitive and lead the market with what we have.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","On that point, Jeff, George, you asked a couple of specific technology questions in your question. I want to go back to that as a solutions against that marketplaces, just to be clear we have the technologies to operating marketplaces now around the world. We have an omni strategy that Jeff described. We have all the capabilities Jeff described in the prepared remarks. But whether you're talking about marketplaces, shopping cart integration, software integrations, alternative payment methods, all of that solution exists within Global Payments, we're selling it today.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company, LLC","That's pretty comprehensive. Thanks, guys. And just one quick one, Dave, the overview of ACTIVE, really appreciate that. In very simplistic terms, is ACTIVE doing in the event organizer space effectively what MINDBODY is doing in spas?","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's a perfectly reasonable analogy, right. This is the software that runs the business. Maybe I will relate it to the way we describe software within Global Payments, whether you are in out TouchNet university system or school solutions K-12, we like to be in the middle of helping our customers run their businesses. We want to create more value for them, and obviously have stickier and more valuable solutions for us to market overall and turn into the results you saw today. So, yes, it's absolutely fair to think about ACTIVE relative to MINDBODY, relative to TouchNet, school solutions and our Heartland Commerce business that Jeff described earlier.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you, guys.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys, thanks. Nice job.","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Good morning, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. So, I guess on the acquisition maybe could you just talk a little bit about the geographical mix where the different revenue streams land and then the tax asset, is that couple hundred million of benefit, is that actually going to help your reported tax rate kind of as we go forward in your adjusted earnings?","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yes, Dave, it's David. I'll start on the first part, and obviously turn it over to Cameron on the tax side. So, this business is almost entirely U.S. revenue. 90-some-odd percent without quoting the exact number. What's great about that obviously as you sit here with Global Payments is, it has as I said earlier, already makes some sales in 74 countries, obviously quite small, 30 languages, the platform is fully enabled for global use, and we can follow customers around the global large marathon or a large triathlon like provider we can follow around the globe. So, obviously job one for us to think about growing this thing even faster, is how to take advantage of our direct sales presence in 30 countries around the world. Great fit, we have the scale, we can drive that as well. I'm going to talk about a couple of other things where we can add value that are very exciting as well.","Think about even within that U.S. business, we have a sales force that calls on thousands of customers a week around the country. There isn't any reason that can't turn into more leads passed over to ACTIVE for more communities, more lives, more clubs, more events, et cetera. We obviously talked about global. We also have existing vertical markets in charitable giving, K-12 and universities where they are a direct fit between activities, running camps and some of the smaller things you can see in our communities business.","And then finally, ACTIVE itself, I mentioned earlier there is an engagement element to ACTIVE helping with demand generation. They have world-class data analytics, data scientists, user interfaces, remember this is consumer-facing software, so there's even sort of reverse leverage across Global Payments as we think about applying that technology. But fundamentally, the most obvious thing staring us in the face is how do we more rapidly globalize this fantastic software. Cameron?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Just couple comments Dave on the revenue side. The majority of the revenue today does come out of the U.S. markets. Although they have obviously international scale and scope in their business, the majority of the revenue is coming out of the U.S. today. As it relates to the tax asset itself, it's effectively a cash tax benefit. We'll pay less cash taxes over the course of time by virtue of getting the basis step-up in the transaction, being able to amortize that through our tax rate, so that we get that cash tax benefit and effective tax rate benefit over time.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And just one quick follow-up. North America will be all organic in the back half of 2017. Now that we'll just see that they are clear organic numbers, is it kind of high single digit revenue and close to mid-teens EBIT growth?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","For North America?","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Before ACTIVE, we're targeting again high single digit rates of organic revenue growth for that business, which will be Q3 and depending on obviously the timing of ACTIVE closing, maybe some part of Q4. That with margin expansion in the business gets you to double-digit EBIT growth for the North America business in the back half of the year. We expect, depending on the timing of closing of ACTIVE as we mentioned before, we're targeting Q4, we expect Q3 to be entirely clean. I would argue, Dave, Q2 was effectively clean as well. I mean we've said time and time again how much the contribution from Heartland was last year. If you add that back to last year's numbers, if you look at our North America growth rate, it was sort of 10%-ish with currency headwinds almost 11% without. So, again, we're double-digit for North America for Q2, which I view as effectively clean.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's great. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Nice job. Just want to start off first, the growth rate of ACTIVE on the top-line, maybe I missed that, but if you can give us a little color around that? And then Europe obviously outperformed, well, it outperformed our expectations meaningfully, can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing there in terms of the card acceptance and more regulated environment and just how the trends should be there organically going forward given what we're seeing now is a pretty strong organic environment?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Darrin, good morning. It's Cameron. As it relates to ACTIVE as I mentioned before, it's a double-digit grower on a top-line basis. So, very consistent with growth with what we would expect to see out of our integrated and vertical markets businesses in both of the channels of the business. So, we think it fits again very nicely with the growth profile we're trying to achieve as a company. Is it accretive \u2013 it is accretive, excuse me, to our rate of net revenue growth that we're driving in the business. So again, very consistent with what we would expect coming out of our integrated and vertical markets business.","As it relates to your second question, Jeff, do you want to cover that?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah Darrin, it's Jeff. So, I would say that overall across Europe, the macroeconomic trend is actually very good. Of course you have places in a better position, France, and some a little bit lighter, but having just been there myself, I would say that the optimism in Europe is high, reasonably high than it has been since the financial crisis across Europe. Tourism is very good in our business, particularly in Spain, and in the UK, it is fairly sensitive to tourism over the December months, that you can see a little bit of that obviously in the June quarter, of course July and August tends to have similar tourism trends. But certainly what I did there, you've seen a lot of tourism coming in there and really a return to optimism mostly across Continental Europe, so when you spend time in Spain with Caixa or with Erste in Austria and Czech Republic.","Certainly our partners across Europe are fairly optimistic. I would say that we remain cautious, particularly in the UK market as it relates to Brexit. I think tourism is very strong there right now, given the movement of the pound that you've seen year-over-year. So I think that quite helps. I would say though that people as we get closer to the first calendar quarter of 2018, looking ahead at the March 2019 Brexit date, certainly I think business leaders have become more concerned than they were in the last year, when I was over there about four to six weeks ago, there was an announcement every other day about a relocation of employment from the City of London into elements of Continental Europe, primarily Germany and France.","So, certainly I think as we get deeper into the Brexit and earlier into calendar 2018, we remain a bit cautious on the UK market for that reason. But I would say overall in Europe, if you step back, is fairly positive and I would say that it really is a distinctive uptick versus where it's been over the last couple of years.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","And Darrin, maybe just a couple of specific comments reflecting back to our prepared remarks. Obviously, we saw a good double-digit growth in the UK that again echoing of off Jeff's comments was certainly better than our expectations.","We obviously can't say enough good things about Spain and the growth that we're seeing in that market, a market again where we already have 26%, 27%, 28% depending on the exact measure. Market share continued to grow well into the double-digits with very strong tourism this season, which is certainly benefiting results in that region as well.","And again, Jeff did mention it a moment ago, but our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions business continues to grow very nicely, and that's a nice tailwind for growth for the European business in aggregate as we continue to expand the Spain European strategy. And then, lastly, our Erste joint venture organically is growing quite nicely. Those are good fundamental markets with high rates of market growth; albeit relatively small, they are obviously tailwinds to growth for the European market.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's helpful. Just one quick follow-up. I mean, in the backdrop of a mix shift in your business to the fast growth channels and obviously with areas even that are developed markets like Europe that are still doing pretty well, going forward is there any reason in the second half why you wouldn't be able to organically do similar growth to the first half that we should just bear in mind in terms any unusual number of days or anything else, just because again your mix of the highest growth channels keeps going up, so obviously that should benefit you?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, in general, we have very positive momentum in the business, I think that's a very fair observation. As I said earlier in response to a previous question, we don't manage the business for double-digit top-line growth. Obviously, the business has the capability to produce that as it has the last couple of quarters, which is terrific. But we're not managing the business to drive that particular outcome, we're managing the business to high single-digit rates organic growth.","So, yes, obviously we have the capability to perform at that level, but as I said, day-in and day-out, we're not managing the business to try to achieve that particular outcome. So I think we have good momentum. Obviously, our businesses are executing extraordinarily well around the world, that doesn't mean everything's going perfectly well in every individual market that we operate in, but by and large the businesses is firing on all cylinders today. And I think that obviously positions us well to increase our guidance today, to raise our outlook for the year and feel confident in our ability to achieve that expectation for the full year.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. It makes sense, guys. Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the strong results.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Jeff, I'd like to ask about Europe. You've had a lot of success there. You're an early mover there both through acquisition and bank partnerships. I'm curious how you think about Europe over the next few years both in terms of potentially adding more bank partnerships like successful ones you have with Erste and la Caixa versus doing tactical or strategic deals?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. David, I am pretty optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the European business both organically, but also through additional partnerships. I would say that while banks across the continent of Europe are certainly much healthier today than they have been financially in some time and that's mostly true although not universally true. Nonetheless, we still have a very full pipeline of dialogue going on about partnerships in those markets.","So, our classic model David that you know very well of, finding good distribution partnerships in new markets and then layering our technology like e-com and omni into those markets still remains a very good source of additional opportunities for us. So, I'm fairly optimistic on that. I would tell you something you've asked a lot about which I think is very much related to your question is PSD2. So, PSD2 is rolling out across Europe in various forms in calendar 2018. I would tell you as PSD2 drives more traditional financial institutions to think about opening up their access to their bank accounts and non-bank providers like Global Payments when it makes sense, think about opening up their systems into new APIs that are more open, which is really the mode of competition for us. Coming out of Realex, I think that's only going to stimulate more discussion from traditional financial institutions into partnering with people like us and those are getting effective throughout calendar 2018. I think the fact that they're complicated, because every member of the EU has to adopt its own form of PSD2, really plays to our advantages given our footprint in those markets in the first place. So, we sat down with our bank partners, David and I in particular, in Spain, in Austria, and talked about, well, what this means for them.","I can tell you one of the things that they're most interested in is, what new technologies can you bring to me to enhance the rate of revenue growth I can't otherwise do myself, and I think that plays right into the traditional strength of Global Payments.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Yeah. I'm glad you brought that up, because is there an opportunity for you to actually generate significant revenue, helping the banks, as opposed to historically the merchants?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. I would say David, I view our relationships in all of our markets, but especially Europe, since the focal point of your question has really been our partnership. So, obviously our core is to focus on merchants, the vast, vast majority of the company as you know today, pre and particularly post ACTIVE is directed right at the merchant base. But of course we go to market with partners like Caixa and Erste and HSBC and CIBC and Bank of Philippines Islands in Asia et cetera. We go to market with a lot of our partners.","So, I don't think about it so much as is it any different than our merchant focus. I think about it as what's the most effective way to catalyze our continued market share gains in those markets and finding the best ways to distribute our technologies most efficiently. That's worked very well in Spain, very well across Continental Europe, and I think of course, we'll follow that playbook as we look at additional markets.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","This is Cory on for Bryan. I was just curious, if you could maybe just go back to the quarter in terms of the margins, in particular in North America, very strong margins there. Can you maybe help us parse out sort of the drivers there in terms of synergies versus core operating leverage. And then on Asia-Pacific, those margins obviously came in very strong. But what are sort of the core drivers there and is that kind of sustainable going forward?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Cory, it's Cameron. Thanks for the question. So for North America again, our direct distribution channels continue to be the tip of the spear for growth for us in the North American business. But our integrated and vertical market solutions business, as well as our Heartland direct sales channels grew double-digit this quarter. We're seeing a very good growth obviously across not only OpenEdge, but campus solutions, school solutions in particular as well as Heartland Commerce continues to perform exceptionally well. We've been delighted I think with the execution of the strategy, the product rollout, and how that business has been able to help accelerate growth in our integrated and vertical markets business over the last six months in particular.","On the Heartland sales channel side, again, we continue to see very high levels of new merchant adds. We've seen very stable trends for the first six months of the year, as it relates to same-store sales growth. It's been very consistent. It's not 3%, 4% that it might have been a couple years ago. But it's certainly kind of 1.5%, 2% in that range. And perhaps more importantly in that channel, we continue to see attrition rates that are trending at the levels they were or had been for the last six months, I should say. So, near record low levels of attrition in that business continue kind of going forward.","The other thing I'd say about North America in particular, we're delivering all that without any really incremental pricing edge to the Heartland portfolio. So, the results that we've achieved for the first six months of the year are really without any pricing for the Heartland portfolio. And frankly, our perspective is, we're growing double-digits in our direct distribution channels without having to do anything from a pricing standpoint. So, it's not perhaps realistic to expect. We're going to put more fuel on the fire on top of what we view is very attractive growth already by looking to do so.","Our Canadian business had a terrific quarter again, mid single-digit growth in local currency, certainly above our expectations. Economic growth in Canada has actually been a little bit better. I think they printed 2.7% in Q1, something along those lines, and I'm expecting something similar in Q2, when they ultimately release those numbers. So, the economic backdrop in Canada has been a little bit better. I think on the margin as well we're benefiting from some of the actions we've taken strategically over the course of time to bring OpenEdge to that market, to introduce Realex to that market. Again, these aren't huge, but on the margin, they're certainly helpful and obviously give us confidence in our ability to continue to drive our targeted growth in Canada over a sustainable period of time.","And then, lastly, our wholesale business in the North American segment was relatively flat for the quarter. As it relates to Asia in particular, again, we saw a very good strength this quarter coming out of Ezidebit not surprisingly. We continue to highlight that, that is a significant driver of growth in our Asia-Pacific region, again, producing over 20% organic growth in local currency for the quarter, three years after or nearly three years after, I should say, closing that transaction, we continue to grow at 20%-plus, which is above the rate of growth that we bought when we made that transaction, so we are delighted with the performance there.","In our more traditional Asian markets, those also grew double-digits, in aggregate we saw particular strength in the Hong Kong market, in Malaysia, Singapore and China as well. So, again good operating performance in Asia. I would particularly highlight in addition to the net revenue growth in that market, the margin expansion in that market was terrific, again, driven by Ezidebit growing top-line at 20% which comes at a higher margin the rest of our Asian markets does. But also obviously I think it reflects the investments we've made over the course of the last several years in Asia to improve scale, and I think we continue to execute well in that region.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks very much. Appreciate the color. And I know we're running out of time here, so just a quick follow-up. I appreciate the color on sort of the revenue guidance by segment. Any kind of change to the margin guidance by segment going forward?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Cory, we can't hear you at all. I apologize.","Unknown Speaker","No, the question was really just, you guys gave good color on the segment revenue growth, but just curious going forward in the second half. Any change to the margin guidance by segment?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","So, I would go back to my earlier comments. We've increased our margin expectations for the full year by 10 basis points. So, we now expect margins to expand by up to 120 basis points for the full year. I'll remind you in the first half of the year, we've expanded by 110 basis points, so that influenced obviously some increase in the second half of the year to get the full year average up to approaching 120 basis points. So, again I think margin expansion for the balance of the year I would expect to be reasonably consistent with what we produced in the first half of the year, obviously driving towards that overall expectation we've said.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","On behalf of Global Payments, thank you all for joining us this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program.

Please go ahead","Isabel Janci","Good morning, and welcome to Global Payments\u2019 fiscal 2017 first quarter conference call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today\u2019s conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and any subsequent filings.","These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially.

Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks Isabel and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are delighted to report a strong start to our fiscal 2017 continuing the positive momentum we have seen in our business. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets during the first quarter with particular strength in Heartland, OpenEdge, and our United Kingdom and Asia businesses. While delivering these results we also made substantial progress integrating Heartland and are ahead of our expectation in realizing synergies from the merger.","For the first quarter, we delivered high single digit organic direct net revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% on a constant currency basis. We are also particularly pleased with our ability to expand operating margins in North America, which includes the addition of Heartland for the full quarter.","Our North America businesses performed very well in the quarter led by our U.S. direct sales channels, which generated high single digit organic net revenue growth. This was primarily driven by strength in new sales of Heartland and OpenEdge, each of which accelerated sequentially.","Further, Heartland achieved an all time new sales record in August, demonstrating continued momentum in that channel. In Europe, we generated strong local currency revenue growth in the first quarter, including double digit growth in our U.K. business, which accelerated from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Spain impressive results and we again saw double digit volume and transaction growth well in excess of the rate of market growth.","We also continue to make strides advancing our e-commerce and omni solutions businesses in Europe and I am delighted to announce that we are now live with Realex in Spain. Our businesses in Continental Europe, including our joint venture with Erste Bank in central Europe that closed in early June performed in-line with our expectations.","Lastly, Asia\u2019s performance in the first quarter was exceptional. We accelerated organic net revenue growth to the low double digit, resulting in the highest rate of growth in this market in several quarters. Our traditional Asian markets performed very well and once again, our Ezidebit business contributed meaningfully to results in the region, with over 20% organic growth this quarter.","Just five months into closing in our partnership with Heartland, we\u2019ve established our go-to market strategy across distribution channels and verticals. Identified new opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and have begun rationalizing corporate support, operating and technology environment. The progress we have made demonstrates our continued relentless focus on execution, which positions us well to achieve synergy targets and importantly to drive a number of incremental growth initiatives.","We are already realizing revenue enhancements to our various distributions channels here in the United States and abroad. In addition to the initial cost sales in Canada we discussed in July, we are now sharing sales leads from Heartland with all of our regions around the world. In the U.S. we have combined our traditional direct sales forces and have configured our platforms to be able to sell either Global Payments or Heartland Payment Solutions to new customers.","We have also enabled both our campus solutions and Heartland commerce point of sale software products on Global Payments platforms in Canada opening up opportunities for new sales and the migration of existing Heartland Software customers to Global Payments. Finally, our investment enhancing our school solutions technology platform supported record payments volume growth and flawless execution during the peak school enrolment season.","Given our extensive planning focus and strong execution we are also realizing expense synergies ahead of initial expectations. We have made significant progress of merging corporate functions consolidating facilities in operating centres and developing our future state technology architecture model for key systems across the combined organization. As part of its effort, we selected Heartlands Heartland\u2019s Jeffersonville facility as our go-forward US operating center and plan to close our Owings Mills facility by early calendar 2017. This allows us to leverage global payments worldwide, unified operating environment in the Jeffersonville facility to create a scalable world class service center to support our global operations.","Lastly, we are completing migration plans to consolidate our technology environments to achieve our future state model, which is critical to achieving our full extent synergy expectations.","Now I will turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron Bready","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. We reported another quarter of strong financial performance while also making significant progress on our Heartland integration efforts in executing synergy plans ahead of expectations.","Total company net revenue for the first quarter was $817 million, a 52% increase over the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. Operating margin was 29.5% or 29.9% on a constant currency basis consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 for the first quarter reflecting growth of 9% or 15% on a constant currency basis.","Our North America segment grew net revenues by 79% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and operating margin expanded 80 basis points despite the inclusion of Heartland, which has a lower margin profile relative to Global Payments historical levels. We are particularly pleased with our ability to expand margins in North America as this is the first period that includes Heartland for the full quarter.","Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct sales channels calculated as if we owned Heartland in both this period and in the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 with high single digits for the quarter. This was primarily driven by our Heartland sales channel, which generated high single digit organic growth in OpenEdge which produced yet another quarter of mid-teens growth.","Canada again delivered solid performance with low single digit growth in local currency consistent with our expectations. The Canadian dollar remained a headwind in the quarter, albeit less severe than we experienced in Fiscal 2016. Our European business performed very well this quarter delivering 11% net revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Reported growth for Europe was 2% compared to the prior year due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound which declined nearly 14% year-over-year.","Growth in Europe was primarily driven by low double digit net revenue growth in the United Kingdom and the continued expansion of our ecommerce and omni channel solutions businesses as well as the addition of the Erste joint venture. European operating margin of 47.9% declined from the previous year as expected due primarily to integration costs associated with the Erste transaction in foreign currency impacts.","As we noted in our July call, we anticipate a significant portion of these integration cost in currency headwinds will be realized in the first half of fiscal 2017. As expected we are yet to see any real impact on our business resulting from the UK, EU referendum, except of course for the devaluation of the pound.","In fact as Jeff noted, our business in the UK accelerated this quarter despite the outcome of the referendum. We will continue to monitor developments going forward to access potential implication for our business. As Jeff mentioned, Asia-Pacific had an outstanding quarter with 17% net revenue growth and operating margin was 28.4%, an increase of 50 basis points year over year.","Growth in Asia was primarily driven by low double digit organic growth in the region including Ezidebit, as well as the addition of the BPI joint venture and eWAY. Excluding heartland integration cost we generated free cash flow of approximately $107 million this quarter. We define free cash flow with net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling insurance.","Capital expenditures totaled $38 million for the quarter. In addition, we reduced outstanding debt during the first quarter by $44 million and since the date of our last call we repurchased an additional 379,000 shares for $28 million. Our current share repurchase authorization capacity is $191 billion. As a reminder, we continue to expect to use the majority of our free cash flow this year to support debt reduction. As Jeff mentioned, our integration of Heartland is tracking ahead of schedule and we now expect to realize over $60 million of expense synergies in fiscal 2017, as compared to our prior estimate of over $50 million.","We are delighted with the progress we are making and have been able to execute on planned synergies more quickly than previously assumed further positioning us to achieve our full expected run rate synergies from the merger. Given the strong performance in the first quarter and our updated expectation for synergy to realization for the year, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2017. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, reflecting growth of 16% to 19% over fiscal 2016.","In addition, we now expect operating margin to expand by up to 50 basis points for the year. We continue to expect net revenue to range from $3.2 billion to $3.2 million or growth of 47% to 52% over fiscal 2016. It is worth noting this outlook reflects our expectation that foreign currencies will be marginally weaker for the remainder of the year relative to our forecast when we guided back in July.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks Cameron. From the outset, the goal of our integration has been to ensure of frictionless combination of the two businesses. Building on the momentum that Global Payments and Heartland have each had individually. Although we are still early in the process, we could not be more pleased with the progress we have made. Not only are we ahead of our expectations with respect to integration, we have accomplished this while accelerating revenue growth at Heartland, which will help drive overall revenue and earnings per share growth for the combined company. Isabel?","Isabel Janci","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I would like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one, and one follow-up in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the European margins, what kind of an impact did Erste JV have? Can you quantify that and the currency headwinds in the quarter? And then is the outlook for margins to stay basically sequentially similar in the second quarter and then improve in the second half? And if it improves in the second half, what drives that? Thanks so much.","Cameron Bready","Hi Bryan it is Cameron good morning. I will start and then ask either Jeff or David to add any other thoughts they may have. So, I would say in the first quarter, the margin declines in Europe were pretty much exactly what we anticipated, and if you look at the two primary drivers one being Erste integration efforts, specifically around Erste joint venture and the second being currencies, say probably each contributed about half of the decline in margin that we saw in Europe that 450 basis points in the first quarter.","So about half and half coming from our Erste and currency. I think as you work through the year, I would expect that to get progressively a little bit better. Some of the FX headwind will begin to update as we get into the back half of the year, and as we continue with the integration efforts on Erste, I would expect most of that work to be done in the first few quarters of the year such that by the time we get to Q4 sitting here today, I would anticipate we\u2019d be back to flat to extending margins in Europe, which as we\u2019ve talked in the past with margins nearing 50%, our objective in Europe is really to stay in that level of margin not really looking to expand those margins for that particular segment.","Jeff Sloan","Bryan, this is Jeff. I would just add to what Cameron said that as we mentioned in our release, our businesses in Europe performed exceptionally well this quarter. Our UK business accelerated its revenue growth into double-digit you may also recall that Spain has now double annualized the interchange reduction as of September 1. So going forward to Cameron\u2019s point, we expect to see continued growth in revenue profitability in our Spanish business, which has been a bit of a headwind over the last 12 months.","Bryan Keane","Okay, terrific. And just a quick follow-up, on the synergies from Heartland, I think you guys increased those $10 million for this fiscal year. Just to clarify, is that just a pull forward from the total run rate of synergies or is that an additional increase in synergies for what you think you\u2019re getting out of Heartland, and maybe what is causing the pull forward? Thanks so much and congrats on the first quarter.","Cameron Bready","Yes, thanks Bryan. I will jump in there. So, I would say as it relates to the expense synergies themselves what we are really seeing as far as an acceleration of our plan so we are realizing synergies in fiscal 2017 more quickly than we otherwise anticipated that we could. I think it is a little pre-mature to suggest that the overall run rate, the full expected run rate synergy that we expect from the merger will be higher than the target we provided when we announced the deal last December, but I would say obviously the progress we are making gives us a tremendous amount of confidence that we have the right momentum towards achieving that target and potentially exceeding it over time.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Thanks Byan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hey Jeff, hi Cameron. Congratulations on the quarter.","Cameron Bready","Thanks Ashwin","Ashwin Shirvaikar","The question I have, you have pretty good revenue performance coming out of multiple parts of the business. Is it just basically too early in the year to detect any obvious thing [ph] or is it primarily the FX that offsets expense in the underlying business? Any color with regards to how comfortable, upper versus lower part of the range.","Cameron Bready","Yes Ashwin, it is Cameron. I will jump in and I will just note, we had little trouble hearing you, I think you are asking about the revenue guide and why the revenue guide perhaps wasn\u2019t increased in the quarter, I think inherently you can think of it as a increase because we are now forecasting more FX headwind than we were when we guided in July, So, I think you can essentially look at it as an implicit increase. We are observing more FX headwind on the topline yet maintaining that overall revenue guidance at 3.2 billion to 3.3 billion. We did obviously increase our expectation around margin expansion for the full year as well, which is driving obviously the increase in earnings per share guidance as well. So, I think we do see obviously revenue tracking ahead of what we would have anticipated, but we are also currently forecasting more FX headwind that we were back, it implies the short answer.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And then with regards to OpenEdge, at what point might you expect to see some benefit to the Canada growth rate? You\u2019re rolling out OpeEdge in Canada, are you beginning to see some benefits in terms of market share and so on?","David Mangum","Ashwin, it is David on this one. It is a great question. We are beginning to see real progress and tangible progress in Canada. We got the full rollout now and integrated solutions there. We actually have signed new partners for building the pipeline. So, what I would say to you is we really feel good about the season we are planning to accelerate revenue growth in Canada. We expect to see the benefit of that really this year and certainly in calendar 2017 we begin to see some of those trends stand upward in our favor.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Thank you, guys.","David Mangum","Thank you.","Cameron Bready","Thank you, Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen. Your line is now open.","George Mihalos","Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I want to start off piggybacking a little bit on Ashwin\u2019s question. You started the year with the revenue growth rate of 52%, the upper end of the 47% to 52% that you guided to. And then I would think the comparisons, as we go to 2Q and 3Q, get a little bit easier year-over-year than what you had in the first quarter. Is there any reason why at least over the next two quarters, the revenue growth rate shouldn\u2019t increase from the 52%?","Cameron Bready","George, it is Cameron good morning. I think your thesis is right. I would remind you that when we get to Q4, we obviously are going to annualize Heartland or part of Q4 so naturally the growth rate in Q4 is not going to be at that 47% to 52%, but I think it is fair to say as you look at Q2 and Q3 you need to factor in currencies. I\u2019ll remind you of that, but the comps are easy relative to Q1, but I think your overall thesis is correct as it relates to slide acceleration of revenue growth in those two quarters relative to what we saw in Q1.","George Mihalos","Okay. Great. And just a point of clarification, Cameron. I think you had said, at least on a pro forma basis, the direct North America business or direct US business was up high singles again, which is what you guided to for the year. Did you break that out for what the legacy GPN business was before Heartland? And maybe you could size the Heartland contribution in revenue for us for the quarter. Thank you.","Cameron Bready","Yes, sure George. First of all you correct. We did note that the US direct businesses grew high single digits this quarter in line with our expectations including Heartland of course on a normalized basis. Breaking out the component I would say is a little more difficult, not really feasible, you know by virtue of the fact that we are combining these businesses and as more time progresses the more difficult it is going to be to look at the business in the US in particular and say what was legacy Heartland and what was legacy Global Payment.","As we talked about on the call we have already combined our direct sales forces in the US market, so where do I attribute that growth that is being driven by the combination of our direct sales forces. We combined our traditional book with Heartland\u2019s direct book, so it is a little difficult to say specifically what Heartland drove in the quarter versus what Global Payments drove. We did however achieve the overall expectation we have for the business which is growing our U.S. direct sales in that high single digit range which we were obviously very pleased with while also continuing to make progress on and progressing some of the revenue enhancements and revenue synergies we expect to achieve over time.","George Mihalos","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, guys.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks George.","Cameron Bready","Thanks George.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jim Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe following up on some of the metrics you gave regarding Heartland, I understand it\u2019s hard to break it out from the organic global business, but can you maybe give us some color around how the Heartland merchant base growth was in the last three quarters and how that\u2019s tracked in terms of growth rate, just on a directional basis, versus what they were reporting at the end of last year?","Jeff Sloan","Hi Jim it is Jeff. I will get some overall cover and I think Cameron and David can provide some additional detail. So as we said in our prepared commentary Heartland had one of its best sales months ever in August in terms of sales moment and that is a continuation of the trends that I think we talked about in our July call as we talk about our outlook for fiscal 2017. So I say sitting here since we announced the deal in December 20015 and closed in April of 2016 the opportunities we\u2019ve had to talk to you guys twice about it Heartland has only accelerated that growth as it relates to new sales over that period. I would say in terms of the health of the merchant base at Heartland that their attrition is running low relative to their own expectations and our expectations going into the deal as well. So, as Cameron mentioned in his remarks our ability to accelerate their growth minimize any merchant or sales rep disruption while taking the defense action that we have taken in a combined basis is something that we are particularly pleased about my way of background.","Cameron Bready","The only thing I would add Jim is, it is Cameron, is if you look at Heartland\u2019s other business outside of the pure payments business, if you look at campus solutions, school solutions, Heartland commerce each of those continue to perform very well also. We see good momentum in those businesses, we like those businesses a great deal. The vertical specific approach that they have through those channels aligns well with our integrator strategy we believe and remain very excited about the performance of those business. And lastly, payroll also performed very well in the quarter. We continue to see good momentum utilized Heartland sales force to be able to cross sell payroll solutions across the customer base and into new customers going forward. So I think we are very pleased overall with how Heartland performed in the quarter relative to our expectations.","David Mangum","And may be, this is David, I will add a few pieces to the answer. When we think about running the business, we are running one business in the United States right now. So the answer Cameron gave earlier is exactly the way we are managing the business. We have one US sales force for general payment and it is off to a fantastic start post the acquisition that Cameron correctly said, payroll is accelerating. The payments are accelerating, the additional products are accelerating, but the other products, the other business units are having record sales as well, whether it is campus solution, school solutions where we just had the fastest growing back to school season in Heartland history. All those things operating well, executing well, despite as you might imagine what can be a tumultuous time around synergy and integration of raw. The businesses are focused. The leadership is focused. We are really feeling very good about the momentum we have right now.","Jim Schneider","That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe as a follow-on, on your comment there, David. If you look at the overall ability to drive sales in the US through increased investment in sales and marketing and you weigh that against the cost synergies you\u2019re obviously getting out of plan with Heartland, how do you think about weighing those two things, if you think you can put a dollar of extra investment into the sales force and marketing activities to grow the US business faster? How do you offset that against what you basically think that you could take any additional excess synergies from the Heartland deal and replow those back into those activities?","David Mangum","Yes you know it is a great question when we talk about all the time here. Sort of the balance of sales productivity, product investment synergies, we are really fortunate in a couple of way, one is Heartland fits beautifully into our overall strategy of running an operating company by creating leverage, getting on common platforms and taking that capital that result and benefit and pouring it into product and distribution that is exactly the calculus we are really running everyday when we think about where to go from here. So, I will give you a couple of examples. While the teams are working hard on how we combine platforms and how we put call centers together and what we do to better serve customers more efficiently.","Our sales teams and our marketing is hard working on actually driving topline growth. You can do both of at once. For example, we boarded the first Heartland merchant to a Global Payments. That took a fair amount of technology investment, it puts us well ahead of having new platform migration. Makes the platform migration not an emergency as we get to that over the next year or so that allows the Heartland sales force to give to be that much more productive.","They can now sell the entire sphere of products that Global Payments and Heartland have together, and the products don\u2019t [indiscernible] there is a bar integration taht Heartland doesn\u2019t have, Heartland couldn\u2019t sell the cyber source gateway integration for example, Heartland did not have a cash advance product like Global Payments has. All these things can now be sold by that 1500% sales force. We can now sell in Canada and Puerto Rico out of that by enabling the platform by having our teams work on that while separate teams are working on expense synergies and driving more and more efficiencies out of the infrastructure.","So, we\u2019re spending an awful lot of time in these parallel tracks, planning a lot seeds, hitting a lot of singles, on the way to what we expect which is really going to be accelerating growth above what we think it can be over the next couple of years with these enhanced sales capabilities. Beyond even that we are making little investments like accelerating sales hires. Sales reps are up a little bit over where they were when we closed the deal that\u2019s conscious. We\u2019re filling in wide space that were uncovered. That\u2019s the choice we made Global Payments with the Heartland sales leadership team and an opportunity to invest a little early and what can become nice calendar 2017 sales in areas really underserve by our combined sales forces to date.","We are sharing these as Jeff said in his prepared to remarks with Hong Kong, UK, Canada that doesn\u2019t take anything away from our ability to perform our synergy work and get to our expense synergies that all in fact, it\u2019s just wonderful volume to put the top of this very efficient engine we run. In fact we\u2019ve automated the sales process with Canada and as you might imagine that\u2019s a likely place for a lot of volume to come over time. So, we really feel good about the way we\u2019re putting selective targeted investment back into the sales model while being able in parallel to keep driving our synergies and not in any way into great customer service. So the thesis are working well together right now.","Jim Schneider","Thank you.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks Jim.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Kwok with KBW. Your line is now open.","Steven Kwok","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering around the revenue synergies that you\u2019ve previously talked about where you can get additional 1 to 2 percentage points over time. Where are we with that? And are the initiatives that you have in place, is that what the ultimate goal is or can it do better than that 1 to 2 percentage points? Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Hey Steven it\u2019s Cameron. I\u2019ll maybe jump in there. I think David gave a very wholesome answer as it relates to qualitatively what we\u2019ve been doing to drive revenue enhancements across our US businesses. The thing that I would add is, sitting here today, it is important to note that the new enhancements we\u2019ve achieved thus far they are helpful on the margin, but they are not as significant enough to really move the needle as of yet.","David talked about continuing to invest in these opportunities such that over time we expect to be able to realize the 1% to 2% incremental revenue growth target that we provided when we announced the deals generated from revenue enhancements. So $30 million or $60 million or so. It is going to take some time to scale these. As you talk about combining distribution platforms combining technology environments to efficiently create opportunities to cross-sell products and enhance the revenue growth of the combined business, it is going to take time to scale that to a point where you are seeing a more meaningful impact from the revenue enhancement that is actually on our performance.","So, we expect over the next couple of years to get to that point and we do continue to believe that the overall revenue synergy target that we provided again is a realizable target and we think we have great momentum early towards achieving that goal.","David Mangum","And maybe I will add a little more color. I think is that is exactly the summary that drives our strategy and integration and we think Steven about how to go after the synergies. Certainly my expectation to get out of the timeframe Cameron is talk about is will be at the high end of those and we are certainly shooting to beat that rate. In addition to the direct sales synergies the real strategy that we think about Heartland combined with Global Payments is going all the way across all of the Heartland Global assets figuring out how to combine the best of both and then globalize everything.","So very much as Cameron said we\u2019re very much in the mode of planting speeds, doing some spade work now, that will bear this fruit in 2017, 2018 and beyond. In addition to the direct sales synergies I described earlier we are doing the same thing with campus solution. Our TouchNet software platform, the one that powers campus solutions is now integrated with Global Payments, our technology platforms in Canada. That means we can sell net new customers, we can go back with TouchNet\u2019s existing customer base and sell merchants on payments from Global Payments and we are beginning to build that pipeline, that same platform is now certified for Puerto Rico. We are ready to go in Puerto Rico as well.","You can see again, planting a few more seeds the same with what\u2019s been historically called Heartland commerce, the point-of-sale cloud software solutions. We just certified our retail point-of-sale solution for Canada. Again for payments in Canada. We have 40 dealers in Canada now with portfolios, we can look to migrate those for our payments. We can obviously sell net new. We are working with target markets then in Europe and Asia to continue expanding that. Lots of really good exciting activity that at this moment is very much at the margin Cameron quite directly said deals here and there as pipeline building all with the focus on 1%, 2% again being at the high end of that range or beating that range at the time.","Steven Kwok","Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks Steven.","David Mangum","Thanks Steven.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wonder, just expanding a little bit on some of the nice sales commentary and the Heartland integration commentary. Cameron, you\u2019ve talked about a through the cycle organic revenue growth rate, given everything you\u2019re seeing at Heartland, and also, it sounds like continued momentum in OpenEdge, is it reasonable to start thinking about North America perhaps being a structurally faster geography for Global?","Cameron Bready","I think it is. If you think about the cycle guidance that we provided historically Andrew, the high single digit rate of organic growth, that\u2019s obviously what we believe this business can produce over time. With North America now being 75% of the business, if this is not growing near that level, it\u2019s going to be very difficult for the overall company to grow at that level. So, I think it\u2019s fair to say that is our goal as we think about our North American business more broadly. That doesn\u2019t mean Canada is going to be anything different than what we expected to be which it is a low single digit grower in local currency, hopefully Canadian dollar headwind will abate here at some point, but we do believe as we continue to obviously progress the combination of Heartland and Global Payments in the US with North America should accelerate towards that level allowing the overall company to achieve the high single digit rate of organic net revenue growth that we expect to achieve over the cycle.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And with regard to OpenEdge and Heartland commerce, again maybe qualitatively at least, can you talk about how those two initiatives are working together versus maybe just co-existing, given that they\u2019re going after some of the similar distribution partners, but have had slightly different strategies, one being vertically integrated, in Heartland commerce, and maybe more of a channel strategy for OpenEdge. How are those two things co-exist versus seeing potential synergies?","David Mangum","Yes Andrew it is David, I will take the first part of this. They are actually coexisting beautifully right now. In fact they\u2019re working directly together our go to market strategy, particularly as we think about some of our large competitors in the integrated space that we can chase with these new assets. I\u2019d remind you that when we look at volume look at verticals. Less than 5%, it\u2019s really actually less than 3% overlap between OpenEdge and its verticals that it serves and what we get in Heartland Commerce. That is because Heartland Commerce is primarily restaurant and hospitality, there is very little restaurant and very little hospitality in the OpenEdge portfolio. That allows us to think about channel strategy for hospitality that really has us as the ISP working with dealers and working with direct sales to sell the combined software and payment solutions of the go forward global payments.","It allows OpenEdge to continue to focusing on what it does best, which is managing that ecosystem between ISPs and end merchants working on the targeted marketing that sales adding new partners while still working to actually add new merchants to existing partners. I would also say OpenEdge still is in the same position it was a year after, several years of mid-teens growth really successful growth. We\u2019ve got lots of opportunities inside the existing partner base. So, we\u2019ve got a nice little wall like a metaphor right now Andrew between the markets served really by commerce and the commerce asset and the markets served by OpenEdge. As we bring more and more Cloud Technology to market, we can be more and more thoughtful and surgical with our channel strategies and again chase some of the big players in hospitality, which we think is a real opportunity for sales growth over time as well.","Andrew Jeffrey","Great. Thank you very much.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks Andrew.","David Mangum","Thanks Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Condra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Paul Condra","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just on the EPS guidance, I think, Cameron, you had said for calendar 2017 you were thinking $3.75 to $4.00. That\u2019s FX neutral. Can you just give us a little update on that, just in light of your guidance revision today?","Cameron Bready","Yes good morning Paul, it\u2019s Cameron. We are not updating that early preview that we gave for calendar 2017 back in July. You know the $3.75 to $4 on a constant currency basis relative to fiscal 2016 was really designed to help you guys in the market in general with the transition to a new calendar year, but we\u2019re not specifically updating that today. We are naturally updating our fiscal 2017 guide, as you correctly stated raising that from $3.40 to $3.50 to our current $3.45 to $3.55. So I think that obviously suggests very good momentum as we are going into calendar 2017. You can draw your own conclusion from that. I think the one obviously I think we continue to have wrapped with this FX headwind. And as I suggested on the call today, we believe in that guide in that race guide on cash earnings per share \u2013 adjusted earnings per share that we were going to be observing more FX headwind in those results. So, as we get to calendar 2017, early calendar 2017 we will provide a guide for 2017 that obviously reflects our expectation for the business, as well is what we think the obviously FX impacts will be for the calendar period.","Paul Condra","Okay. Thanks. And then on the OpenEdge business, I think you had talked about it today being a mid-teens grower. And in the past, you\u2019ve mentioned mid to high teens. So can you clarify, is there any change in trajectory there or anything you\u2019re seeing?","Cameron Bready","I would say no. There is no real change in trajectory depending on the quarter kind of bounces around between mid and high. As we think about the business, our expectation is that business continues to grow in the mid-teens level. We go very good about the momentum and the trajectory to be able to do that, but from one quarter to the next it maybe high teens, it maybe midteens, but generally in that ballpark is what our expectation is for the business. So, I will tell you for Q1 it performed exactly in line with our expectations and has accelerated relative to Q4, which I think are both very good points of empahsis.","Paul Condra","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Good quarter. I\u2019ll leave it there.","David Mangum","Thanks Paul.","Cameron Bready","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning. I\u2019m wondering if you could comment more broadly on the impact of interchange caps that went into effect in Europe on December 9 of last year. In particular, is there the potential for an increase in merchant acceptance of electronic payments, as the cost of payments have come down?","Jeff Sloan","Yes David it\u2019s Jeff. So, as we said in our remarks this morning, our European businesses and in particular our UK business has performed exceptionally well during the quarter. So, certainly we think one of the important trends in the marketplace is a lower cost of acceptance, as well as a good macroeconomic backdrop for those markets. As I think, we said over time, reductions in costs to our merchants are really nothing, but good news for our business, but those ultimately get competed away over a period of time.","So, I think, it\u2019s good news as their bills go down, the market tends to be efficient over a period of time. So our benefit as time goes on tends to get competed away, yet the merchants continue to benefit with lower cost of acceptance than they had \u2013 they had previously. It\u2019s hard to back that out of the underlying economic growth in the markets that we\u2019re in. But if you look at our experience, for example, in Spain, which really adopted the interchange reduction.","Here we are now two years beyond the first adoption of the interchange reduction and our business has grown, as we said in our prepared remarks probably one-and-a-half to two times the rate of market growth for each of the last six quarters. How much of that is attributable to the lower cost of acceptance, the fantastic partner we have in Caixa in the Spanish market, is kind of hard to disaggregate. But I think there\u2019s no doubt, David, that around the world lower cost of acceptance for our customers is really nothing but a good thing.","David Mangum","I think too, David, this is David, I\u2019d add in the more developing markets of Central and Eastern Europe, we\u2019re beginning to penetrate with our Erste joint venture, you will find that cost of acceptance being a enhancement, certainly to organic and secular growth in those markets.","David Togut","Okay, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, Jeff, I\u2019m wondering what your thoughts are longer-term about Europe. As the banks see pressure from the reduction in interchange, do you see opportunities perhaps over time to acquire some merchant portfolios in Europe as a result?","Jeff Sloan","Hey, David, absolutely. So, as we said in our remarks this morning, we\u2019re very pleased with the initial progress in our Erste joint venture, which encompasses a number of countries in Continental Europe. I do believe that part of the rationale on behalf of Erste Bank for considering a joint venture was a change in competitive and technology dynamics in the markets in which they\u2019re in, in Continental Europe.","So we certainly continue to pursue other venture partners in Europe. I think that these number of technological and market-based changes that you\u2019re seeing going around Europe today do nothing, but help our ability to create value for our partners. I think we\u2019ve been able to show over a very long period of time in many markets how we\u2019ve been able to create very good returns for our shareholders and our partners. And I think, the changes in Europe provide us another opportunity to do the same. And we expect that our partners at Erste will be similarly happy.","So from that point of view, David, we continue to pursue those ventures and we hope to do more in the future.","David Togut","Thanks very much. Congrats on the strong results.","Jeff Sloan","Yes, thank, David.","David Mangum","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Good morning. Jeff, the \u2013 Jeff, you highlighted right upfront and you talked about accelerating growth in all of your markets. And we\u2019ve had very mixed retail data out of the U.S. Asia, I think getting mixed reports on the economic trends there. What is \u2013 and you talk about some of your products, and I understand that some of the acceleration. But do you feel this acceleration is driven \u2013 are you \u2013 do you think some of it is economic improvement? I mean, your acceleration in growth seems out of place with what generally seems to be reported out of retail sales and economic growth in the markets you serve?","Jeff Sloan","Bob, it\u2019s a great question. So what I would say is, I really think it\u2019s a combination of attacking the right markets with the right people and the right model. So in most of the markets which we compete, the United States is a good example, as David alluded to, we\u2019re very specific about the markets that we go after and how we do it, sort of David\u2019s response about, for example, on OpenEdge and the integrated vertical markets, we\u2019re selling technology solutions into markets that themselves like dental, veterinary, et cetera, that are higher growth in the overall rate of GDP growth in the U.S. economy plus the adoption of electronic commerce, and we\u2019re doing it with better technology, better people, better services, and ultimately, therefore better markets.","So, I think, Bob, it\u2019s perhaps a reflection of the way we go about the markets that we go about, how we attack them, and our point of value differentiation relative to our peers that really is driving the incremental rate of growth. I\u2019d also stated, there\u2019s an element at very good sales focus and execution. If you look at our results in Asia, for example, we have yet to really laugh some of the macroeconomic headwinds that you saw starting in the second quarter for our fiscal last year in Asia yet business as usual Asian markets for us accelerated their growth, as Cameron and I each noted.","In Canada, I just think think that\u2019s very good sales execution in markets like Singapore and Malaysia and the Philippines of with and without our partners at BPI. So the conscious investments we\u2019ve made, Bob, as a company into markets that are large diverse and growing with higher rates of vertical market growth than the average and better margin opportunities are really paying dividends. That\u2019s why I think you\u2019re seeing our results. Conversely, we are really not in the large merchant category, for example, in the United States as some of our peers are, I think a lot of the data Bob that you\u2019re referring to reflects the large retailer, for example, market which in general is not a market we\u2019re particularly focused at either at legacy Global or at Heartland.","Bob Napoli","Great. Thank you. And my follow-up question is, I mean, Global and the industry as a whole, or some of your competitors have had a great run since 2013, in particular. What is \u2013 how \u2013 what is \u2013 what are you most worried about as far as disrupting the strong trends that you\u2019ve had? How sustainable are the trends that we\u2019ve seen? What are you most worried about that could derail the very strong trends we\u2019ve seen? Is it competition? Is it regulation?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Bob, it\u2019s Jeff. So, I\u2019ll start and ask David and Cameron to join in as well. But I think, we touched a lot of this in the last question that you asked. But I think what you\u2019re seeing is results of the curative investments that we\u2019ve made in our business over a period of time that is really bearing fruit. I think David very nicely described the investments made in sales in Heartland, in legacy Global Payments that really results of dividend, not just in the United States, that would wrap it around the world the investments we\u2019ve made in our technology environment in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 are really bearing fruit.","So, from that point of view, I think, we\u2019re differentiated bit in terms of where we played chips on the table. In terms of what we\u2019re worried about, I think it all starts with for us and our peers of industry, what is the macroeconomic environment look like. Most of us are GDP plus derivative type businesses and therefore, it\u2019s important that we operate in healthy economic environments. For example, we talked about much of this 2016 in Asia, where for a number of quarters, the latter three quarters of fiscal 2016, we had a headwind in greater China. I think we\u2019ve been able to show throughout fiscal 2016 and our results now in 2017, our guidance show, they were able to take whatever actions we need to take quickly to preserve margin and reposition our business quickly.","So there\u2019s no doubt at the end of the day, that a healthy economy is an important driver globally of our results. So, I think it\u2019s important in terms of what we worry about a healthy economic environment for us globally continue to grow that as businesses. We also need to make the right decisions around technology investments, which is where I started. Many of the things that we invested now, we will see returns in 12, 18, 24 months from now, it\u2019s important to get those things right.","So in terms of what we worry about, we worry about, we think the wrong hit in the wrong place at the table, such that we\u2019ve made investments that haven\u2019t borne fruit, half way that\u2019s not the case. So, we worry a lot at the strategies matter about, whether those are the right investments to make today for returns in the future.","David Mangum","I think that\u2019s right. I think, I\u2019d add to that technology investment. Are we really helping our customers do what they need to do with their consumer. So those investments are right investments as we go deeper in the software. We believe they absolutely are the bearing fruit today. But we\u2019re thinking about those is the right way to think about servicing customers, allowing them to take care and to like their consumers at the point of interaction and point of sale. And obviously, in our industry, you\u2019re always worried about security.","We do believe that the combination of EMV, encryption tokenization is great for overall health of the industry overall consumer confidence. When you go back to a secular question that we\u2019re talking about earlier, I think, Paul\u2019s question maybe with David\u2019s around adoption and things like that, obviously, security is a big piece of that. We invest heavily there. We\u2019re trying to find the right balance as well as returns. So, we think about those couple of things, in addition to what Jeff described.","Bob Napoli","Okay. Thank you very much.","Cameron Bready","Yes, I\u2019ll just wrap it up. It\u2019s Cameron with one final comment on the same topic, it\u2019s a little bit different. I do think we\u2019ve got a great run over the last three years, of course, and that\u2019s been borne out by obviously how the share prices performed. I think it\u2019s very fair to say sitting here today, we remain \u2013 this is enthusiastic if not more so about the future over the next several years of this business.","Obviously, the combination of Heartland is the transformational opportunity for us. But we think our ability to drive high rates of organic revenue growth in the business to expand margins and compound double-digit mid-teens growth in earnings per share obviously creates a very nice trajectory for the business and give us a lot of optimism about, where we\u2019re heading as a company financially.","Bob Napoli","Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Cameron Bready","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to maybe dovetail a little bit on that last \u2013 the comments you guys have just been making. When you look ahead and you look at the results you\u2019ve had thus far, how much of this is a function, in your opinion, of your positioning and share gains in the market, given those chips that you\u2019ve been placing? And you could pick U.S. or Europe or Asia for that matter, relative to real market expansion. I mean, so it goes back to kind of like secular growth versus your share gains, in either mature markets or emerging markets. I would just be interested to know how you think about parsing that data out for your growth?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Dan, it\u2019s Jeff. So I\u2019ll start with that. So our bogie in most of the markets that we\u2019re in is, where are Visa and MasterCard growing transactionally. That\u2019s one way of getting at rate of market growth. But those markets that we\u2019re in, not in every sub-vertical market that Visa and MasterCard are in. But where it\u2019s relevant for us, what\u2019s the rate of transaction growth, number one, number two. What is GDP growing in those markets plus 200 to 300 basis points of increment reflecting the transition from paper to electronic means.","So if you distill that, and there\u2019s obviously a lot of markets that we\u2019re in, we\u2019re in 30 countries physically today around the world. What you would say in general across all of our markets, the bogie is around 5% market rate of growth. Some are higher, some are lower, but in general, it\u2019s around 5% rate of growth. If you look at our cycle guidance, which we talked about again this morning, we target high single-digit organic rate of revenue growth plus margin expansion, et cetera.","So the way we think about it, Dan, is if we\u2019re targeting high single-digit, if the rate of market growth is 5, when we talked about this last year, last October, in our Investor Day, we certainly think that we\u2019re capturing share in the aggregate. Now some of that is, because we\u2019re in better markets. Some of that is, because we think we have a differentiated sales force. Some of that is, because we think we have state-of-the-art operating environments, et cetera. But nonetheless, the math is the math. And I would say that in most of the markets around the world, we do think that we\u2019re capturing share.","If you look at United States, for example, and our OpenEdge business, which Cameron and David just described today mid-teens growth is probably three times the rate of mid single-digit market rate growth more broadly speaking transactionally in the United States. Now, we\u2019re not the only people growing at that rate, at the end of the day.","So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just us. But certainly, I think, traditional channels that we refer to as more relationship driven are not growing at mid-teens. And I certainly think it\u2019s fair to say that there\u2019s market share gain in a technology-enabled distribution area, whether it\u2019s Heartland commerce or whether it\u2019s OpenEdge relative to the more traditional, for example, financial institution channel, we see rates of growth that tends to be less than the market, call it around low single-digit.","So I think it\u2019s been a conscious effort to think about what the market is in each market that we\u2019re in, what the bogies are, how we\u2019re going to invest and grow at rates that are north of the market for a lot of reasons. So I think at the end of the day, it\u2019s down to smart investment that take share.","Dan Perlin","Okay. And then in the Asia market, in particular, low double-digit organic growth, that\u2019s been fantastic. I think you said Ezidebit is growing 20%-plus. Can you just remind us how we should be thinking about that trajectory throughout the year? I mean, is it we\u2019re going to dovetail it off in the back-half at some point, or are there other dynamics at work that we can kind of stay on this trajectory, which this has been a market, I guess, that we\u2019ve been waiting for this double-digit for a long time and you guys are clearly putting it up now. So I\u2019d just be interested to know that. Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Dan, it\u2019s Cameron, I\u2019ll jump in there. I think we feel very good about the momentum we have in Asia sitting here today. So I don\u2019t expect a lot different in the back three quarters of the year. I wouldn\u2019t say, our overall target for Asia is kind of high single to low double. Obviously, we\u2019re able to get the low double this quarter. I don\u2019t know that I would expect that every single quarter. But certainly, we think we\u2019re in a place and have started to lap certainly as we get into Q2 and Q3, some of the macro headwinds in the Greater China market that Jeff described earlier.","I think we feel very good about the overall prospects to be able to achieve low double-digit growth in Asia overall for the year, including high single to low double organic growth.","Dan Perlin","That\u2019s great. Thank you, guys.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan,. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great, thanks. Good quarter here. Just wanted to dig more into the strong Heartland sales in August and the quarter, just maybe focusing more on core merchant sales. Just I know you said sales energy is good and there\u2019s lower attrition. But anything secular or cyclical to call out again in the quarter as beneficial, things like EMV transition, I know, there has been a lot of bottlenecks there. Is that having an influence, for example? Thanks.","David Mangum","Yes, Tien-tsin, it\u2019s David. There really isn\u2019t anything specific to call out. We\u2019ve got terrific productivity. As I said earlier, reps are up a little bit, but it\u2019s really only at the margin and the productivity coming with the additional reps is where we wanted to be. So it\u2019s not just the volume thing or something along those lines in terms of just more reps to create more sales.","The quality and sales is good. Retention is very good right now. I think that on the pure payments basis, EMV is not driving these sales. I realize that\u2019s a popular topic of conversation, but that has more to do with other participants in the industry overall rather than us directly as a payment technology provider. So I think, we\u2019re very happy with the pieces. I would tell you that the combination of being able to sell other products in addition to payments does make for better stronger sale and more sales.","So selling payroll, selling some of the other products, selling our HCH-based product for online customers obviously enhances the payment sales as well. But I really I don\u2019t have a single thing at which to point, Tien-tsin, that\u2019s different from where things were, I think the engine is working well. The leadership is in place. And the machining tooling that underlies managing this 1,500 person complex sales force is working well.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. That\u2019s helpful to know. And just I know there has been a couple questions on Asia. But just Ezidebit, are you doing something different there in terms of distribution? I was curious if that growth rate is sustainable or even could we see it accelerate here by itself, Ezidebit?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Jeff. We actually have seen the acceleration already in the last number of quarters that Ezidebit. We partnered with those guys a number of years ago, it\u2019s been just over three years now this month. We didn\u2019t model out high 20s growth, that wasn\u2019t our expectation for organic revenue growth, that was right around 20%. And as we said today, they\u2019ve now exceeded it for a number of quarters.","So what I would tell you is give a fantastic management team in place in Australia and New Zealand. They have essentially taken an integrated model, which is what Ezidebit is, think of it as OpenEdge based in Australia and New Zealand and certainly relative to one of the last questions are doing nothing, but capturing share in that marketplace environment.","So if you were probably to go look at the rate of organic transactional growth for Visa and MasterCard and your peers in Australia and New Zealand, they would not be anywhere near 20%. So clearly, Ezidebit has a very good model with very good team and they\u2019re doing all the right things. We also did a lot of time talking about it, because it\u2019s not organic, but their integration of UA, which is something we announced in April has also gone very well.","I think it shows the \u2013 which has 25% of the online market in Australia and New Zealand. I just think it shows the flexibility and capacity in our confidence level in our management team in Australia and New Zealand and Asia to accelerate growth, while they\u2019re busy growing their own business well into the 20s.","Tien-tsin Huang","All right. That\u2019s great. Thanks.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, thanks, guys, for squeezing me in here at the end. Just a couple of quick ones. Is there any slight change in the tax rate guidance for the year? The only reason I ask is, I know the EPS is going up by $0.05, but revenues have changed. I think the margins are going up by 10 bps. So I wasn\u2019t sure that that would quite get to you the $0.05, just with the slight margin change?","Cameron Bready","Yes, it \u2013 Jason, it\u2019s Cameron. It\u2019s a good question. The margin change obviously helps, but as I\u2019ll note, we\u2019re absorbing more FX in there as well. I think overall tax rate, I think the expectation remains pretty much the same as what we described back in July. We think it\u2019s going to approach 30, it was 28.5, so 28.5, 29, something in that ballpark sort of approaching kind of the high 20\u2019s to 30 range remains our expectation for tax rate.","I would say the guide itself doesn\u2019t suggest an increase in or excuse me, a decrease in the effective tax rate that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving the increase in the guide. It\u2019s really the Q1 performance coupled with our outlook for the remainder of the year. The increase in expense synergies that we\u2019re targeting now for fiscal 2017 relative to the Heartland transaction, obviously, offset slightly by some incremental FX headwinds.","Jason Kupferberg","Can you quantify the incremental FX headwind? Are we talking like a 0.5 point here on the top line, or is it closer to a full point?","Cameron Bready","Yes, I think it could be close to a full point, sitting here today.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay.","Cameron Bready","Unfortunately, the pound is off 2% to 3% relative to where it was in the last two weeks, quite frankly. We\u2019re now seeing it down around 127, it was 134, most of September, it was 1, obviously a little higher on average for Q1. So I think we remain cautious probably as it relates to the pound specifically, particularly in light of the size of that business relative to the overall size of the Global Payment. The unfortunate reality is a lot of other currencies tend to be trading in sympathy with the pound it appears as well.","So we\u2019ve seen weakness albeit maybe not as severe as we\u2019ve seen in the pound. We\u2019ve seen general weakness across the Board in most of the major currencies in which we have exposure. So I do think it could end up being almost an additional full point for the full-year, particularly in light of my view, and I think our view that when you get to December, I think, we expect the Fed to raise. I think in a rising rate environment here in the U.S., it\u2019s going to continue to put pressure on foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which causes again the bake in a little more FX headwind into our forecast for the remainder of the year.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. That\u2019s all helpful Thank you.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Jason.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Jason.","Jeff Sloan","On behalf of the Global Payments, thank you very much for joining our call this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Investor Relations, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane Elliott","Good afternoon and welcome to Global Payments' Fiscal 2013 Fourth Quarter and Year-end Conference Call. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour. And joining me on the call are Paul Garcia, Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sloan, President; and David Mangum, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary, which are discussed in our public releases, including our most recent 10-K. We caution you not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call.","In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these results more clearly reflect comparative operating performance.","For a full reconciliation of cash earnings to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K dated today, July 25, 2013, which may be located under the Investor Relations area on our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now I'd like to introduce Paul Garcia. Paul?","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, Jane, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. For fiscal 2013, we delivered revenue of $2.4 billion and cash earnings per share of $3.65. Fourth quarter cash earnings per share of $0.98 was towards the lower end of our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected volumes in Asia.","As you know, we focused a significant portion of our efforts in fiscal 2013 on remediating security processes and regaining our PCI certification. As part of these initiatives, we accelerated planned investments in technology during 2013 to provide improved scalability for years to come, including new technology infrastructure, data centers and enhanced security capabilities. A key element of our planned 2014 growth is through the expansion of new and existing distribution channels, which we call our partner of choice strategy. We are successfully partnering with financial institutions, value-added resellers and other payment service providers offering merchants high-quality payment services around the world.","Our business in the United States has benefited from differentiated distribution through the strategic acquisition of APT, which has performed above our expectations. And we anticipate it to continue to perform well in the coming year. I'm also happy to announce that we recently signed a multiyear contract extension with our largest and fastest growing U.S. third-party sales partner.","Canada reported solid operating metrics and flat revenue growth in local currency in the fourth quarter. Very importantly, May delivered the revenue growth we expected. This performance sets Canada up for a much improved 2014.","We are also delighted to announce a significant expansion of our relationship with CaixaBank. Given the success of our joint venture in Spain, we will now partner in Brazil, with the opportunity to further expand our partnership into other markets in Latin America over time. CaixaBank will take a 50% share in Global Payments Brazil, and will bring additional global customers, leading-edge products, and their acknowledged expertise into the Brazilian market. We plan to rename the company Comercia Global Payments Brazil. This investment underscores the strength of the relationship we have developed with CaixaBank.","In our International segment, Europe's strong revenue growth of 7% for the year was driven by solid performance in all geographies. As payments evolve around the world, we continue to look for innovative partnership opportunities to provide cutting-edge solutions for our merchants. As such, I'm happy to announce that we recently initiated a new partnership in the U.K. with PayPal Here, a mobile POS product, which we expect to launch in late summer. We posted flat revenue performance in Asia for fiscal 2013. However, we expect to increase our market penetration and drive revenue growth in 2014. In fact, we are making progress in Asia, signing additional distribution partnerships as we speak.","Finally, we are committed to completing additional strategic acquisitions and to continued share buybacks as evidenced by the newly announced $250 million authorization. Now I'll turn the call over to David. David?","David E. Mangum","Thank you, Paul. Fourth quarter cash earnings came in toward the lower end of our range of expectations, primarily due to performance in Asia and Canada. On a year-over-year basis, currency changes negatively affected total company revenues and cash earnings for the fourth quarter by about $6 million and $0.02 per share, respectively.","North America revenue grew 4%, with U.S. revenue growth of 6%. During the quarter, new fees that payment networks introduced last year annualized and the fees billed by our ISO channel in aggregate grew at a slower pace than in the same quarter in fiscal 2012. As a result, we report a lower revenue growth rate than in a typical fourth quarter. However, it was about what we expected. And as a reminder, ISO fees to merchants are revenue pass-throughs to us and have no effect on operating income. In Canada, transactions grew 3% for the quarter, while credit spreads were down about 4%. We implemented our repricing actions as planned of late in the quarter, resulting in strong performance exiting the year in May. North America cash operating margin was 17.8% with operating income down 1% for the quarter. This reflects growth in the U.S. offset by an increase in technology spending and performance in Canada. International revenue grew 2% for the quarter in U.S. dollars. U.S. dollar revenue growth in Europe of 3% reflects unfavorable currency exchange trends, especially in the U.K. In local currency, Europe delivered solid revenue and transaction growth in all markets. Asia Pacific revenue declined 3% over last year, primarily due to lower-than-expected e-commerce and retail volumes across the region. International cash operating income of $57 million was down 7% compared to last year primarily due to performance in Asia and currency translation. Fourth quarter GAAP and cash tax rates were in line with our expectations at 28.6% and 28.5%, respectively.","During the fourth quarter, we incurred pretax charges of $28.5 million for data intrusion remediation efforts. Full-year expenses totaled approximately $37 million, net of about $20 million of insurance proceeds. Remediation costs have recently run higher as we work to ensure all of our applications, tools and systems fully reflect our revised security standards and are operating at our required production scale and performance levels as we enter 2014.","For the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $101.6 million. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement, assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures were a little under our expectation of $23.6 million and $98.6 million for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.","Our total available cash, including working capital at the end of the year, was approximately $250 million. And for the year, we purchased a total of $175 million of shares under our original July 2012 $300 million authorization. This includes the $125 million accelerated share repurchase program that we announced in January and which we completed during the fourth quarter, as well as an additional $38 million of shares repurchased during the fourth quarter under this authorization. We anticipate completing the $300 million authorization during the first quarter of 2014. All purchases under this program are included in our 2014 financial expectations.","I am also pleased that our Board of Directors has authorized a new repurchase program of $250 million for further buybacks. Potential share repurchases under this new $250 million authorization are not included in our fiscal 2014 expectations.","So now let's turn to 2014. We expect revenue to range from $2.51 billion to $2.56 billion, reflecting 6% to 8% growth and cash earnings per share to range from $3.93 to $4 per share, reflecting 8% to 10% growth over fiscal 2013. Our fiscal 2014 outlook includes an incremental step function increase in security spending of approximately $17 million or as much as $0.15 per share. And without this increase, cash earnings per share growth for the year would be 12% to 14%. We expect total company cash operating margins, which includes the negative effect of the security spending, to be slightly down compared to fiscal 2013.","We expect North America revenue to grow at a mid- to high-single-digit level, with growth in the U.S. of mid- to high-single digits and Canadian revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range in local currency. We expect cash operating margins in North America to be about flat to perhaps slightly increasing. We expect cash EBIT dollars to increase in the mid-single digits compared to last year, with both our core U.S. business and Canada increasing.","We anticipate that our International revenues and cash EBIT will grow mid- to high-single digits in U.S. dollars. We expect stable cash operating margins for international. We expect mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth rates in local currency in the U.K. and Spain, strong double-digit growth in Russia, and flat revenue in the Czech Republic. We expect Asia to produce mid-single-digit revenue growth.","We expect foreign currency effects to be about neutral to a slight headwind for cash earnings per share for the full year. We expect our effective tax rate to be about 29% and our diluted share count to be about 75 million. And as with 2013, we anticipate our highest tax rate over 30% in the first quarter with the other quarters then coming in at lower tax rates. We expect the distribution of quarterly cash earnings per share to be roughly consistent with 2013. And finally, we expect capital expenditures on the order of $90 million. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Paul.","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, David. To recap, for fiscal 2014, we intend to grow revenues in the high-single digits and cash earnings growth from at least that rate to the low-double digits. Importantly, these expectations include a significant step up in security costs of $0.15 in cash earnings per share for the year. Excluding these costs, annual cash earnings per share growth for fiscal 2014 would be 12% to 14%. We are positioning our company for sustainable, long-term growth throughout all regions and capitalizing on our scalable technological infrastructure and financial flexibility. I'll now turn the call over to Jane.","Jane Elliott","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And, operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, let me -- I'll ask about Canada. Just Canada with the flat revenues. I think you all are looking for something slightly positive on a constant currency basis. Looks like transactions ticked up. So what was the delta there? And also in May, can we assume it was growing in the mid-single digits and that's what's giving you confidence in the mid-single-digit outlook for the year?","David E. Mangum","Yes, Tien-Tsin, it's David. Overall for the quarter, we did see volume and transaction growth. I would say it was just a little lighter than we expected, and so Canada fell a little shy of our revenue expectations. If you go back to when we were entering the quarter, I would have said, and I'm sure I did say, it's a very important quarter for Canada, and that what we wanted to see was stability in the core metrics there. And I think the good news is we did. We saw relatively stable metrics, returned to a little bit better transaction growth of 3%. Maybe most important of all, and really importantly that was consistent with the third quarter, we saw about a 4% decline in core credit spreads. So as we discussed going into the quarter, more manageable declines, that of course, is before any impact from any reprices. So then you really hit the nail in the head with the most important part of the quarter for Canada, relatively stable metrics, nice sort of base from which then to go ahead and implement the price increases driven by the network assessment changes in the market. Those did indeed go in late in the quarter in May as planned. That performance in May sets us up for a much improved '14. I'm not really going to parse exactly what growth was in '14, but you're on the right track. Nice growth in '14, nice implementation of the price increases with reasonably solid underlying metrics. I mean, I'm far less concerned about a little bit of lightness in revenue in Q4 in Canada, and much more pleased about the outlook for Canada in '14 as I head into the year, given the implementation of the reprice.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","And Tien-Tsin, it's Jeff. Just to add to what David said, what we talked back in January in Investor Day was to make sure that we exit '13 with a stabilization in Canada. I think David described it exactly right about where we are. I do think his guidance for fiscal '14 about Canadian revenue growth in the mid-single digits and local currency is really where we really want to be.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then Asia -- I know you said this is lower than expected, lower than we expected it as well. Just -- it sounds like there's some distribution deals that you're working on. Again, same question there, visibility to get back to growth in '14. It feels like it's been steadily declining or decelerating, so just trying to get a sense of the visibility there.","David E. Mangum","Yes, and obviously, a fair question is that was one of the real challenges for the quarter. We do have new distribution partners who have come online. It's certainly not enough volume to offset what we saw in Q4, but it should build nicely over the course of '14. Maybe as important and more important will be new partners we bring over the course '14. And maybe when I'm finished with this part of the answer, I'll let Paul add a little more color to that piece. But really what we saw in Q4 in Asia was some sequential deceleration. Deceleration, to make sure I'm clear on that, in e-commerce, in really a year-over-year decline that was obviously, unexpected. We saw weakness in general retail as well. That was headlined by a year-over-year decline in one of our larger customers in the region, and a little bit of weakness in DCC and IPP, where we had expected some growth in the installment payment plan products. I think when I think about going into '14 then, a couple of things really go in our favor, quite honestly the most straightforward one is the comparables are much easier. We have seen relatively stable underlying metrics as we exit the year, so transaction growth, for example, across the region. Relatively stable tickets and solid growth in transactions and volume in general should set us up for the kind of growth we're talking about, and we're not expecting anything other than solid but not spectacular growth across these same product lines I was discussing earlier, retail, e-commerce, DCC, IPP. And then we'll do a little bit of targeted repricing in markets that can support that over the course of the year. So all in, I think if you look at the way we exit '14, you're right, there's not a lot of great things going on in the Q4 of '14, but as we enter -- or Q4 of '13, excuse me, as we enter '14, looking for solid but not spectacular performance, and I think we're poised to deliver that over the course of the year.","Paul R. Garcia","So Tien-Tsin, this is Paul. I would add that keep in mind that Asia is 6% of our revenue. And we are committed to grow it. But the bigger story is that Asia should be a much larger percent of our revenue. So by growing it 10%, that's not, quite frankly, satisfactory. We have a -- and to be specific, I was asked, I think a quarter ago, how long is this going to take? Now there's no -- there's no guarantee on deals in strategic alliances and all the things we're working on. But we feel we have enough irons in the fire that -- I made a pretty bold statement that we would get something done. And I'm sticking to that statement. We are going to get something done. So we're going to grow Asia organically, but we have high expectations of something more dramatic in some exciting areas. And that's -- and I understand everyone needs to wait and see that. And we plan to deliver that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin, RBC.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I had a couple of questions. Can you start off by helping me kind of disaggregate a bit on the top line for fiscal '14, the guidance? This part of it that's pricing, this part of it's transaction, this part of it's products, but I would like to get a better sense because I hear David talking a lot about pricing, which sometimes it's much harder to grind out, versus the feeling that there's something better in the region or you've products got, you've got some partners. So if you could just kind of help me parse that a bit, I would appreciate it.","David E. Mangum","Sure, Dan. Happy to do that. And I think in regard to pricing, I'd point out, we're really talking about Canada there and the changes driven by the networks more than anything else on a worldwide basis. So if you were to disaggregate the way the markets are going to rollout or the way we think they're going to rollout over the course of the year, as you know the U.S. is an amalgam of a number of product lines. So in the U.S. we're expecting consistent growth from the ISO channel, but reflecting essentially the law of large numbers. That channel gets ever bigger, so on a percentage growth basis, it's not going to grow at the same rate it may have grown in '13, just as '13 didn't grow the same as '12. In the direct channel, you're familiar with our direct business there, it's going to perform solidly as it has for the last year or 2. No real change in trend there if you're thinking about sort of how should I take my model forward from '13 and into '14. That direct channel includes, of course, our joint venture with Comercia, which performed well in 2013, will continue to execute well in 2014. The gaming business we talk about from time to time is a very nice vertical play in the United States that generally hovers around high-single digit to low-double-digit revenue growth, which should perform again at that same level in 2014 based on our current expectations. We now will fully annualize APT, the acquisition from last year, and we're expecting that to continue to grow in the mid-teens with real operating leverage as well. So all in, in the U.S., we're talking about mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth and operating income or EBIT improvement in the United States as well. So those are the pieces of the U.S. and where we expect growth. When you think about the underlying metrics, while we don't provide forward-looking guidance on things like the operating metrics, we're really not looking for any fundamental sea change and how fast transactions grow or what happens with average tickets, hence what happens with volumes at all the United States. In Canada, we're looking for continued solid metric growth, so transaction growth, fueling volume growth, stable average tickets, and then that's the one market where I would really call out pricing because of what's going to happen from the networks. What already happened from one network, what happens again from the other network come July. So consistent performance of what we saw in Q3 and Q4 with underlying metrics that then results in mid-single-digit revenue growth in local currency. Now if you're doing your model, one thing to keep in mind is Canada's one place that'll likely get hit by currency in 2014. So mid-single-digit revenue growth in local currency there will be ameliorated somewhat by the effect of currency. So let's keep going east and we'll head to Europe, where in United Kingdom, same underlying comment I'd made in the other markets. In the United Kingdom, we have, as you're familiar, a couple of product lines, but the core credit and debit processing business we expect to perform in very similar fashion to the way it performs in 2013. So that's in local currency, mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth. Now that base business will grow and our International Acquiring business. We're acquiring cross-border. Card-not-present transactions will continue to grow well and help fuel that growth as well. In Spain, we're actually looking for, again, mid to high-single-digit growth, once again defying gravity in the Spanish economy with our partner, CaixaBank. Again in Spain though, I would say once more, transaction growth consistent with 2013, helping to drive that. With Russia, we've seen really accelerated high double-digit volume and transaction growth. We expect that still going into '14, but we've brought those expectations down just a hair. Again, the business keeps getting bigger, therefore, expect the exact same percentage growth. We take a couple of points off that as the business gets a little bit bigger, but the same kind of strong double-digit revenue growth we saw in 2013. And then the business in GP remains flat, so very consistent assumption as you're building your model for that business going forward. And then with Asia, it's really the answer I was chatting about with Tien-Tsin just a moment ago, which are that 2013 was a challenge, the comparables are set, the question becomes can we grow over that 2013 comparable with a next-to-better penetration with the existing products, improved distribution? And then can we see just a little bit more stable underlying metrics? And we think we're poised for that as we go into '14. So all in, I don't think there are a lot of surprises if pull apart the guidance with a little lower level of detail for you. It's mid- to high-single-digit growth in North America. It's international growth in total of mid- to high single-digits, which is an amalgam of an awful lot of really nice trends. And then a little bit of a haircut due to FX, adding up to the full range of 6% to 8% year-over-year on total company revenue level.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then let me just ask one other one because I know that was a long answer, so then I'll then hop off. Paul, you talked about acquisitions. And it sounded like -- I mean you kind of hit it quickly, but you sounded like you were a lot more serious about it in the way you kind of presented it. So is that something that we need to be mindful of? And if so, is there a geography that you're hopeful and maybe more serious about going after?","Paul R. Garcia","Well, Dan, we have a pretty good pipeline, and they are in pretty much all of the geographies that we're involved in. But the question was about Asia. And I think what I said was that I can -- the reason we bought the other piece of the business from HSBC was in part to give us the flexibility to do some other deals. And we've been having -- that -- when did we do that transaction, David?","David E. Mangum","December, we closed it.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. So we've been having -- we had some conversations prior to that date, but now we're very serious about it. And yes, we are very focused. So I would say that Asia is a primary candidate for us doing some new types of deals. Now there are some other opportunities around the world we're looking at as well. But Asia is a primary point of focus for us as we speak.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Roman Leal, Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Similar question on -- just a break out of all the different drivers, but just on the margin side. Can you give us -- can you perhaps disaggregate as much as you can the -- what's driving the margins? Specifically, I mean -- North America, international would be great, but especially in the international, what's the -- why not -- what's kind of handicapping the margin expansion in '14 there?","David E. Mangum","Yes, happy to share that with you, Roman. This is David. So if you take the pieces of margin in total for the company -- Let me do North America first. I'll spend a little bit of time on international. North America is the addition of APT. And as the law of large numbers hits with ISO, little less pressure on the ISOs than you may have seen, say, a year or 2 ago. And then the improved performance in Canada, as you well know, with the ongoing ISO pressure having our second largest business then creating a big margin challenge has been among the more difficult things to manage from a margin perspective for the last couple of years. So to have that asset turnaround in '14 as we expect makes all the difference, and then being able to see a flat to slightly increasing margin on a cash basis in North America. In international, you really have 2 stories not unlike the revenue story in Q4, quite frankly. The more mature markets, or the more established markets is probably a better phrase, particularly of Europe, Spain, the U.K., continue to drive operating leverage, continue to drive margins forward, continue to drive operating income growth. We also see Russia continuing to drive real substantial leverage, double-digit growth -- growth well into the double digits on the revenue side, obviously, translating into really nice income growth as well and a very solid Central Europe business. What happens though in the opposite direction is Asia. So with Asia, though we're expecting some solid revenue growth, or at least a return to growth in the mid-single digits, we really are not slowing down what I guess I might describe as investment in Asia for the long term. When you hear Paul describe the long-term opportunity of Asia, the opportunity for more partners, the opportunity to bring more partners in, what that says to us is we should keep investing, in a circumspect and appropriate manner, but keep investing in Asia, not starve it of investment, and keep an eye on the long-term growth opportunity. So we are investing in infrastructure improvements there for scalability. We are migrating India, a huge growth opportunity market for us, we think, long term, off of a legacy platform, operated by HSBC under our own front-end and back-end platforms, and we're looking to invest in other partnerships across the region. So what you end up with is then operating income and hence growing much slower than revenue. And as a result, a pretty good-sized drag on margins overall for international that then are sort of offset by Europe and then to the extent you feel a little bit of FX here and there, that would be the reconciling item probably to anything you have in your model. If you then pop that up to the total company between those 2 regions, you've got something but we're expecting margins to be slightly down including security. That again is -- the ISO, the APT, the Europe and the Asia, with security then, you can do your own math, obviously, off the prepared comments. But security, obviously, is taking that margin backward on the order of 70 basis points. So you have some slight to modest margin expansion were it not for the security in total at the total company level.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Paul, the new buyback authorization, maybe help us think through the timing -- the potential timing of that. Is that going to be a balance between what you're seeing in Asia and other parts of the pipeline? Any color on the potential timing on that buyback will be helpful.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay, Roman. I can't be specific as to timing other than I think we have a long track record of saying that we have authorizations and then executing on them. And I would just ask you to rely on our past behaviors. However, our first use for our cash and our leverage is to do deals, and accretive deals in important areas. But we feel that we can carry out both of those objectives or we wouldn't have asked the board to authorize what we did.","David E. Mangum","Yes, I think maybe -- this is David. I'll add a little more color on that. Let us finish the previous authorization over the course of this quarter, and we'll come back based on judgment about the pipeline and timing as to what pace to embark on the next authorization. But as Paul said, quite rightly, I think we have a track record of executing them when we announce them. And we do believe we have the resources to both execute -- really to execute the entire strategy we described to you going back to January and the first priority of supporting a long-term growth and business expansion with ongoing, routine, share repurchases complementing that.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Dave Koning, Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess first of all, I just wondered international cash EBIT was down, I think, 7% year-over-year. And I don't remember you really addressing that in the prepared remarks, but that's down a little more than usual, because it usually grows pretty well. Maybe you could just talk through that for just a minute.","David E. Mangum","Yes, David, it's David. I'm happy to add more color. For the quarter, it's really 2 big drivers. It's Asia, which is down as you might imagine given the color a little earlier on Asia. So revenue growth, as you can see on the face of the income statement, is down. We have not arrested spending in Asia. So operating income is down. In fact, operating income would be down sort of proportionally with a greater effect then on revenue given that we're still spending on the infrastructure and on some of the migrations over there in Asia. At the same time then, we have very solid performance across the board in Europe that gets clipped by currency. So between Asia and currency, there's really your delta between what you may have expected or what we may have hoped to report for international overall versus what we did report.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just secondly, did the elevated security cost kind of going into next year that are going to run through the kind of normalized earnings, is that going to be kind of nonrecurring as we look out, or is that something that you expect to be ongoing?","David E. Mangum","Yes, I would describe that as a new run rate for a revised security posture for the company. So to be painfully clear, we don't expect another increase of $17 million in 2015. $17 million represents the new baseline added -- $17 million added to whatever other security we already had represents a new baseline that we would hope to actually scale. We've implemented a ton of tools, lots of new managed services. We've worked hard on perimeter defenses, internal monitoring, reporting all the things you can imagine, leveraging partners, increasing headcount where appropriate, all of that again is, I would say, is a new baseline from which we then hopefully scale over the course of '15 and beyond.","Paul R. Garcia","And, David, this is Paul, that's quite frankly, why we called it out because it is a step up.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg, Jefferies & Company.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to see if we can get a little more granular on the margins. I know we're talking about \"slight year-over-year decline,\" but should we be thinking of that as more on the order of like 20 bps or 40 or 50 bps?","David E. Mangum","Yes, Jason, it's David. I think in that range, for us slight is -- I hate to parse the word slight, but it's really not 100 bps. It's less than 50 bps. It's in that kind of range.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Understood. And then what are you modeling for Canadian spreads in fiscal '14 as well as transaction growth?","David E. Mangum","Yes, so in '14, then again we don't parse forward-looking metric expectations, but what we are expecting is transactional growth and, what I would call, core spread declines, very similar to what you saw in the second half of this fiscal year, which we reported to you, which is -- we just did a quarter with 3% transaction growth and about 4% core credit spread decline. So that's the underlying metric for the outlook for Canada for '14.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So just to make sure I'm clear on that. So 4% with a slight compression in Q4, but presumably you exited the quarter a bit better than that after the price increase, right?","David E. Mangum","That's correct. So I'm going to parse words, and I apologize for it in advance. That's why I call it the core credit spread. That's the underlying assumption what the base would do before you brought into that what is the pricing impact going to be.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I got it.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Jason, it's Jeff. I would just add to that, that without trying to parse it even further, when we separated it out that way, there's the core spread as David described, and then we always do assume that there's pricing attrition. So we don't assume any pricing changes continuing in perpetuity.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just to be clear, Dave, how much is remaining on the $300 million buyback, the amount you said you'd complete this quarter?","David E. Mangum","Sure, Greg. So let me reconcile that for you. I appreciate your asking. I'll go all the way back to the beginning to be -- hopefully to be painfully clear. The original authorizations we started last fiscal year was $300 million. We did some open market repurchases of about $13 million around the second quarter. We did our accelerated share repurchase, which we announced in January and closed in the fourth quarter to the tune of $125 million. Then we did some more open market repurchases to the tune of $38 million in the fourth quarter. So as of May 31, as we exited the quarter, we had about $125 million left. And as you might imagine, we're on our way to completing that piece of the authorization over the course of the first quarter of 2014.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, obviously, that is in the guidance but none of the incremental $250 million buyback?","David E. Mangum","That's exactly right, Greg.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess, Paul, do you want to just -- can we get your view on European interchange, potential regulation, and how you see that maybe playing out for Global Payments?","Paul R. Garcia","Sure. So, Greg, first of all, it's going to play out over a long period of time. I think we all know this is years. But at the end of the day, and not to boil this down too simplistically, but at the end of the day, complications are not bad. Downward pressure in interchange is typically good for all acquirers, quite frankly. And I'm not saying that would give us an opportunity to raise prices or anything necessarily. It simply takes some pressure off of us because the merchants total discount rate is reduced rather dramatically, the pressure in our spread, quite frankly. Now there are some discussions about transparency. Quite frankly, our deals are incredibly transparent today. So we're not worried about any of that. So the short answer is it's a good thing for us. There's a lot more chapters to be played down on this. The only kind of fair case you could make would be would you get interchanged to a level that banks would be discouraged from issuing cards? I would just tell you from our personal experience and in some markets that we're not involved in like Australia. If you look at where interchange levels were and how many cards are in the market, and then a significant reduction in interchange and how many cards in the market, I would tell you in Spain, there's actually more cards. Our partners actually issued more cards. So there's still a case that they can make a -- they can make a quite nice living. And the last thing I would say is that it doesn't mean that the consumer doesn't pick up some piece of this, in Australia, for example. I think MasterCard is trying to hit the EU maybe a little too heavily, so says someone in the Journal today. But I kind of get where they're coming from, sentiment-wise. I mean, this is the balloon, right? You push on it one end, it's going to pop out somewhere else. So long and short of it, it's good for us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene, Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Dave, maybe could help me out. You had a lot of prepared comments and you talked about North America or specifically U.S. growth that's 6%, which we all know kind of slowed. And you talked about a few dynamics there. Can you kind of walk through that again? And more importantly, is this sort of a one quarter phenomenon, and do we kind of bounce back? And then I have a follow-up.","David E. Mangum","Yes, I think Glenn, the way to think about that is all these fees -- the new fees have all annualized by the time we got to the fourth quarter. And then the biggest play in any given quarter in our revenues is what do the ISOs do with their own fees? We don't control it. Quite honestly, other than reporting revenue growth, we really don't care about it. It doesn't provide any profits, so that's always a swing. So I think Q4 was lower than you should expect in any given Q4 as a general rule with the big swing, obviously, always being those fees from the ISOs. As we look forward, what we're saying for the full year for the U.S. is mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth, which reflects the law of large numbers and the ISOs in general and then really nice growth in APT, in gaming and solid performance in our direct channels. So as we sit here at $1 billion plus of revenue in the U.S. overall, mid- to high-single-digit revenue, it's a pretty nice number. Do I expect to do better than 6? Yes, in a lot of quarters I do. And then the ISO fees at any time could swing that back towards 6 or 5, obviously, mid allows an awful lot of room in that range. But we want to make sure we talk about Q4 here. Because Q4 is usually a big seasonal revenue growth quarter for the company. I think Q4 '14, we should see decent seasonal growth again. But again those fee's swings could cause it to drop a few points at any given time.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then I -- it probably relates to the North America margins as well, which actually were better than what we were looking for despite the revenue mess and relative to our numbers in U.S. and Canada. Is it the same phenomenon? I mean, ISO is driving somewhat better margins there. And the other question related to North America margins is how much of a contribution was APT to the margins?","David E. Mangum","Yes, it's a great question, and, yes, it is a part of it. It's always a mix of a number of things. But each margin conversation in a quarter, particularly in North America, starts with how much ISO pressure you're feeling. And anything that slightly reduces that makes it a little bit easier for us to operate. And then APT is more than doing the job we expected of it when we closed it in October, which is obviously, quite helpful in the underlying numbers as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just following up on the North American margins. I think you said, David, that they'll be up year-over-year, and I don't think we've seen that in a long, long time. So I guess I'm just struggling. It sounds aggressive to me. Can you just help me feel better about that in fiscal year '14?","David E. Mangum","Be happy to, Bryan. I think that for North America, to parse it into its pieces again, we will get a full-year benefit and very nice growth from APT inside the United States. We should see, again, law of large numbers, ISO revenue growth slow down a bit. So that headwind that starts every quarter for us should be a little less challenging. That's on top of a U.S. business, where EBIT grew in 2013 to begin with, because this is part 2 of the explanation. Canada by definition was going backward in 2013. It goes forward in 2014. So flipping Canada around makes as big a difference as anything in North America in 2014. And to your point, it's been some time since we've seen this. It's been some time since Canada's headed in this forward direction.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","And, Bryan, it's Jeff. I would just go back to what we said in January at our Investor Day, stabilizing Canada is an important part of what we're trying to achieve toward the end of fiscal '13 going into '14. That coupled with the investment in APT and the actions that Dave described are big parts of the reason why we expect the margin to do what Dave described in '14.","David E. Mangum","So, Bryan, and to finish the pieces, you've got the U.S., the Canada, and then remember the technology investment that increased in 2013, and that increase doesn't recur. The cost, obviously, is still inside the run rate, but that elevated level of increase doesn't recur. So all in, with North America then, those are the pieces of where we expect to see the opportunity for flat to maybe increasing margins for the first time in a while. Then the final piece of this is that the security investment is going to appear in the Corporate segment because it's an investment for the total company. So hence, those are the moving parts of North America and then the one piece that you may have been wondering about from reconciling item perspective.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What about FX? Because I would think that the Canadian dollars is going to weigh on you and weigh on that margin in the quarter throughout the year?","David E. Mangum","Yes, that's incorporated so -- great question, Bryan. In our prepared comments, we talked about the opportunity for neutral to a slight headwind overall given FX for the full year for the company. Our outlook for that, given the very sources we try to use, is for the dollar to strengthen against the Canadian dollar a little bit and then weaken a hair against some of the European currencies, so that all in -- and then be neutral against some other European currencies, so that all in, you've got this opportunity in total for neutral to a slightly -- a slight headwind from FX. But the idea of an FX headwind in Canada is incorporated in the North America outlook.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just lastly, Paul, just a follow-up on some of the EC regs that are out. I guess I was under the understanding you guys bundled some of the merchant acquiring in Europe. So an unbundling kind of what they're pushing at, I think, would have an impact on you guys.","Paul R. Garcia","I'm not going to agree with you, quite frankly. I think if we're talking about that level of reduction -- by the way, that is correct. For smaller guys, we do, indeed. So let me just say that you are accurate. For larger guys, not necessarily. In fact, I would say most usually, not at all. They have a discrete pricing. It's typically over interchange and assessments, and it's explained as basis points or euro cents per transaction or pence per transaction. Now for the smaller guys, it would be transparent. Their -- it's already highly competitive. Those rates, I think, are pretty good. But once again, the overall rate goes down. So if you're a small merchant, you know all the aspects of that. I think you're going to look at the end result of a much lower rate, and I think that's good. I really do. But I think we check back with each other in 2 years and we'll see, maybe 3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer, CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was curious -- I have 2 questions. What -- first, what will la Caixa bring to your Brazil effort that's been installed? As best I can tell, they don't really have a presence in Brazil or infrastructure there. So concerning the branch level selling that goes on there, I'm not quite sure what they bring to the equation other than money. Secondly, if China continues down the road, are they more open -- a more open situation for outside players in the payments infrastructure? Does that help or hurt you if, say, someone like First Data with huge resources could go in there unencumbered?","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. Well, let's -- this is Paul. Let me start with the Brazil question. I'm going to ask Jeff to pick a piece of that and throw it back to me for China, if you would, Jeff. So on Brazil with CaixaBank, they have a number of significant and, in many cases, these are direct investments and possibly even board positions with a number of significant players also in Brazil that could be potential customers for us. Secondly, they have a bunch of technology that makes up a lot of sense that will help accelerate some of our product delivery. Thirdly, and I think it -- to be a little bit disingenuous, Craig, if I didn't say the money doesn't matter, it does. They bring a partner that will help us make appropriate investments without being as consumed with the impact from quarter-to-quarter to really get the full benefit. I mean, this is -- this is clearly 1 plus 1 equals 3. And in terms of the distribution, I would tell you, we're up and live. We have -- we're being in a fair number of merchants per day right now. I mean, fair number. And it's -- we're building this thing pretty much faster than we thought we would. So -- and it does not preclude us, and this is very important, it does not preclude us doing more with other financial institutions in terms of added distribution. In fact, you could argue la Caixa or CaixaBank is not encumbered because of what you just said, so they will also help us in that regard. So I think this is nothing but good news. Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Frank, it's Jeff. I would just add to what Paul said on that topic. Now la Caixa and CaixaBank has relationships with other financial institutions with multinational merchants in markets not just in Brazil but around the rest of Latin America. So if you go back to Paul's prepared comments, it's important that this is focused in Brazil. But we're also looking at the picture in the rest of Latin and South America, where CaixaBank has many relationships, both on the customer as well as on the financial institution side.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Before you move on to China, is there -- has the privatization of Redecard given you an opportunity to go after some of the banks that were or still are affiliating through them?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Craig, it's Jeff. The answer is absolutely. So we've seen a sea change in the Brazilian marketplace in the last year, so coming out of the Itau purchase of Redecard. I think other large banks in market recognize that they're after the same book of business, from a banking point of view, that Itau is after. So the receptiveness that we've gotten since that deal was announced and certainly closed has gone up quite a bit versus where it was when we first started in that market 2.5 years ago. And I think we'll see more of that down the road.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. So let me talk about China, Craig. So the question was if China -- and we think by the way, they will. If China makes it easier for others, other players, non-Chinese players, to be involved in their markets, is that good or bad for us? I think that anything that reduces the level of regulation and opens up the gates a little more fully is good for us. Now we clearly have first mover advantage. But we are -- we do have some encumbrances. I mean, we are the only non -- to our knowledge, the only non-Chinese company that can acquire in renminbi today. But we haven't enjoyed the full measure of that, and part of it is some of the regulations that we are burdened with. Now we're also uniquely positioned with CUP. We are the member of the larger board of their international organization in North America. We're the only member, in fact. And that's a big deal. So we have unique relationships. We have first mover advantage. And clearly, others are going to get in and attempting to get in, but I think that is more good for us than bad for us than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff, Stephens.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I just had one question. You talked a lot about India last quarter and a little bit more this quarter as an interesting target market where your penetration is fairly low. Can you just sort of paint a picture of how -- what would a JV there with a bank look like, or just kind of give us a sense of how that would work? And is it expensive? Is there a lot of competition for those JVs? Kind of just give us a sense of how that looks.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. I'll speak kind of notionally. So a JV -- typically, it's -- we have a 51, they have a 49, although we're open to different structures, us having more potentially, even a 50-50. It depends though on what we're trying to accomplish. In terms of is it expensive? I think anything that's attractive in India is going to be fully valued plus some. I think the -- I think they are very smart operators and understand the value of what they have and understand the opportunity a JV with a significant player would provide. So yes, I think you'd pay off for that. It doesn't mean it's not going to be cash accretive. I think all deals we do are cash accretive. But it's all I can say on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering around -- I know you've given guidance around how we should think about EPS for the next quarter, but I was just wondering are there seasonality with regard to the operating margin for each of the different segments?","David E. Mangum","Yes, Steven, this is David, there are. And typically, what you'd see is stronger margins really for each of the 2 segments in Q2 and Q4, with the lower margins being reported in Q1 and Q3. In Q3, in particular, our February quarter kind of crosses over the year end in a number of markets, usually being the weakest both from an EPS as well as from a margin perspective.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then finally, with regards to the additional charge I was taking on the processing preach, I was -- are there other charges that's going to occur in 2014? I was just wondering when we'll see the end of that.","David E. Mangum","Right. We expect a little bit of modest spill over into Q1, and then that's the end of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to Brazil for a second. Has anything changed in terms of how you think of that region from the perspective of strategic importance as kind of maybe gone down a little bit on your list of things to do?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","George, it's Jeff. No, it hasn't. I actually think the CaixaBank announcement should highlight that we expect to increase our strategic focus on -- in Brazil. As Paul mentioned, we started operating in that region. As we said previously in the fourth quarter, fiscal '13, so we're live with customers now, which obviously, is a key milestone for what we're doing. We think that the rationale behind the CaixaBank deal will allow us to accelerate the growth of that business, make additional investment, as Paul described, and bring many of the leading-edge products and technologies that CaixaBank has in Spain, in many cases, with us in partnership into the Brazilian marketplace. So I actually see it as quite the opposite. It also adds, George, the ability to look at additional markets in Latin and South America beyond Brazil through their relationships. I view that as additive to our investment in Brazil. But I think it means that we feel very good about where we are there, and we're very pleased to expand our partnership with CaixaBank into that market.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And can you just remind us what the expense drag from Brazil was from an investment standpoint in '13? And now with Caixa coming in for 50% of it, those expenses will no longer hit the operating line, right? They'll be -- they'll go below the line, am I thinking about that correct?","David E. Mangum","Yes, you're on it right, George. So we really didn't parse it out fully. It is about $0.04 for the year is the way to think about it of pure expense. What's interesting about that is as we go into '14, what we're looking to do with our partners at CaixaBank is actually amp up that investment. As you get live, you might imagine, you have expense in front of revenue. So you're hiring salespeople, you're getting product out, and then you're bringing the revenue in through the distribution channels. So what you should really expect is you'll see -- we closed it probably at the end of Q1, so maybe some business as usual kind of Q1, and then we'll be back to when we close as to whether there's any effect. But it's quite possible you'll never notice it in the face of the P&L and we really won't chat much about it other than your core second point, which is what's going to change from a geography standpoint. Well, Brazil likely, by that time, will no longer be in the North America segment. It will roll through, will deconsolidate, and you'll see it in income, but you won't see it in the pieces above the operating line.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call will be recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane Marie Elliott","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Global Payments Fiscal 2014 Fourth Quarter and Year End Conference Call. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour, and joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially.

Sloan","Thank you, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Before I begin our formal commentary, I would like to introduce Cameron Bready, our new Executive Vice President and CFO. I am delighted to have him as part of our team. On that same note this marks David's last earnings call as CFO, and I am pleased to now have David as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer. I look forward to working with both Cameron and David in their new positions.","We are pleased with our strong performance for fiscal 2014, with revenue growth at 8% to $2.6 billion, and cash earnings per share growth of 13% to $4.12.","We also returned over $415 million to shareholders in buybacks and dividends and made a key $420 million acquisition. These results reflect continued execution of our strategy to expand direct distribution, leverage our technology footprint to bring innovative products to each of our markets and prudently balance and deploy capital.","We made tremendous progress on our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2014. We enhanced our integrated payment solutions business with the acquisition of PayPros, and we have made significant strides in our integration efforts including, for example, by establishing a new leadership structure and combining our sales forces. This has already shown early wins.","As expected, we also stabilized and delivered solid performance in our Canadian business and expanded our distribution in key markets in Asia and Brazil by adding new bank referral and technology partners. These results and our actions highlight the success in alignment of our business strategy with worldwide market opportunities. We approach each of our markets with significant global knowledge and capabilities, yet remain focused on leveraging our local expertise.","We combined this approach with a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Over a 3 to 5-year cycle, we believe our model will deliver low double-digit cash earnings per share growth, including acquisitions and buybacks, driven by mid single-digit organic revenue growth and operating margin expansion.","Now for quarterly highlights. We exited the year with strong momentum. Revenue growth for the quarter was 9% to $674 million, and cash EPS growth was 11% to $1.09.","We are delighted to report that our North American business continued to deliver solid results in both the United States and Canada. The U.S. results were driven by strong performance across our direct channels, including the addition of PayPros. Canada delivered another quarter of stable performance in local currency, with 3% growth for both revenue and credit transactions.","We were also pleased with the performance of our international business, reflecting solid execution across all of our markets, with particularly strong revenue growth in Spain and our e-Commerce channel.","As we look towards fiscal 2015, I'm confident that we will continue to make progress on our strategic and capital deployment initiatives, building upon our direct distribution footprint and overall market presence. We'll remain focused on solving tomorrow's payment technology needs today by fulfilling our customer's needs and continuing to deliver scalable, innovative products and services.","In addition, we continue to pursue a well-disciplined corporate development roadmap and have a strong acquisition pipeline of opportunities in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and the Americas that have the potential to augment our strategy.","Finally, our Board of Directors approved an additional $200 million share repurchase authorization, further demonstrating our ongoing commitment to prudent capital management on behalf of our shareholders.","Now I will turn the call over to David.","David E. Mangum","Thank you, Jeff, and welcome, Cameron. We're glad to have you on board. We're pleased with our momentum exiting the year and with performance across all of our markets in fiscal 2014. As anticipated, Canada's revenue grew 3% in local currency and network assessments annualized in the fourth quarter. Canada's revenue declined by 4% in U.S. dollars as a result of currency translation. U.S. revenue growth for the quarter was 9%, driven by transaction growth of 11%. PayPros performed as expected in the quarter and added 2 percentage points to total North America revenue growth of 7%. North America cash operating income grew 3% to $82.7 million and cash operating margin of 17.2% was about as we anticipated.","International revenue grew 14% for the quarter in U.S. dollars. Europe delivered strong revenue growth of 16%, fueled by performance in Spain and from our e-Commerce business. Asia Pacific revenue grew 5%. International cash operating income grew 16% to $66 million, and cash operating margins increased about 60 basis points to 34.6%. As expected, total company cash operating margins for the year expanded by about 20 basis points to 19.5%, excluding the 2014 incremental security investment of nearly $17 million.","We generated free cash flow of about $80 million this quarter and nearly $320 million for fiscal 2014. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement, assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distribution to noncontrolling interests.","Capital expenditures totaled $20 million for the quarter and $81 million for the year. Our total available cash, including working capital, at the end of the year was a little over $300 million. And during the quarter, we purchased 2.9 million shares at an average price of $67.60.","Now let's turn to 2015. We expect fiscal 2015 reported revenue to grow 6% to 8%, and range from $2.69 billion to $2.76 billion. We expect cash earnings per share to grow 10% to 12%, and to range from $4.52 to $4.62.","We also expect core cash operating margins to expand by as much as 30 basis points in fiscal 2015.","We expect North America revenue to grow at a mid to high single-digit rate, with mid to high single-digit revenue growth in the United States, and Canadian revenue growth in the low single-digits in local currency. We expect North America cash operating income to increase in the low double-digits compared to last year. We expect cash operating margins in North America to expand in 2015.","As you know, one of our largest U.S. sales partners was acquired by another company in June. Due to the recent closing of this acquisition, our current financial expectations assume no change in the nature of our relationship with this customer. Importantly, if the nature of our relationship with this customer were to change during the fiscal year, we would not expect any significant effect on our fiscal 2015 expectations for North American operating income or total company cash earnings per share.","We anticipate that international revenues and cash operating income will grow at a low to mid single-digit rate in U.S. dollars, including currency translation headwinds in certain markets. We expect international cash operating margins to decline modestly. International expectations reflect assumptions for mid single-digit revenue growth in U.S. dollars in Europe, with consistent local currency performances from Spain, the U.K. and our e-Commerce business, coupled with a tempered view of growth expectations for Russia, which represents less than 3% of total company revenue.","We expect Asia Pacific to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth. We expect foreign currency translation to represent a modest headwind to overall cash earnings per share for the full year, and this is incorporated in our expectations.","We expect our effective tax rate to approach 28%, and diluted weighted average share count to approach 70 million shares for the year.","We expect the distribution of quarterly cash earnings per share as a percentage of annual earnings per share to be roughly consistent with that of fiscal 2014. And we anticipate that fiscal 2015 capital expenditures will total about $95 million. Including the additional share repurchase reauthorization of $200 million, we now have about $320 million of total authorization remaining for potential further share repurchases. And finally, we have about $900 million of capacity on our credit facility to fund future initiatives.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you, David. We delivered strong results for fiscal 2014, with high single-digit revenue growth, improving margin trajectory and double-digit cash earnings per share growth, all in accordance with our stated business model. We are committed to driving sustainable growth in each of our markets and remain dedicated to creating value for our shareholders, partners, customers and employees. As our fiscal 2015 guidance suggests, we expect another strong year.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jane.","Jane Marie Elliott","[Operator Instructions] And operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Congratulations to Cameron and David on your new positions. And let's start with saying it was a good quarter. I guess, my question, though, is about your guidance. And as I kind of look at the revenue guidance, $2.69 billion to $2.76 billion, it seems relatively conservative given that it should include about, correct me if I'm wrong, about $75 million or so of PayPros revenues. So I guess, if I exclude that in the organic growth rate, seems to be a bit tempered in terms of your expectations. So that's kind of what my first question was with regards to it. If you can walk through sort of the ups and downs of how you arrive at your revenue assumptions?","David E. Mangum","Sure. Ashwin, it's David, I'd be happy to. I think, you really need to pull all the pieces apart to think about how the revenue growth comes together without splitting hairs over PayPros specifically, you certainly can make your own assumption there. I would tell you, in aggregate, we feel very good about the trajectory of the company, the momentum heading into '15, that were on the model that Jeff described. We feel very good, obviously, about the 10% to 12% cash earnings per share growth to complement that in the margin expansion. With that as preamble. Let's talk about the pieces and recognize that when we go into any given year, we first start with the macro situation in all the markets we serve and start to begin to build the budget from there and think through how the pieces of macro affect GDP, which might affect the consumer, which then might affect FX or anything else that goes with that. And really, what I think you get when you come back to that total picture is really nice progress, consistent with what you'd expect from each of our markets. So let's walk through them specifically. PayPros add very nice revenue to the United States picture. Remember, the big channel there, ISO, continues to slow, which as you well know, is happy news for us at the margin line, and neutral news for us at the income line. So we're very happy to have the pieces of the U.S. revenue come together with great performance in the integrated business, married with slowing ISO channel and solid performance from the rest of the U.S. channels, all of which aggregates to mid to high single-digit revenue growth from U.S. In Canada, we're looking at low single-digit growth in local currency and then you get to the effect of currency, taking you potentially the wrong direction. Our range, obviously, always allows for currency in any given market, so you've got a couple of different pieces you've got to think through that will eventually affect your overall range about what you're asking a moment ago. When you bring all that together for North America, mid to high single-digit growth, because you accuse us of being a little conservative there, I won't say yes or no, but you do know the way we like to set our expectations here. We expect to hit them and have the potential to keep making progress over the course of the year. When you think about international, again, you think about the various pieces of the market, we're expecting consistent performance from all the assets you're familiar with across our international portfolio of business. That's sort of a mid single-digit growth kind of U.K. business. Same in a place like Malta. Maybe mid to high in Spain, which has consistently posted high single-digit growth and sometimes low double-digit growth in that market. Our Global Solutions e-Commerce business would be a strong double-digit grower, just as it did last year. Now with Russia, we have a tempered expectation, which reflects macro there, as you might expect. Macro is little bit challenged there. Obviously, we can all read the headlines, so we allow for little tempering there momentarily. And we bring those folks together, those assets together, you've got mid single-digit overall growth in Europe, a really solid mid single-digit growth in Europe. Asia grows mid single-digits as well, and that allows for low to mid single-digit growth in U.S. dollars across all of international. Again, that international allows for FX headwinds in certain markets. Right now, I think, we're going to be solid to perform across all of international. So you bring all the pieces together and you get to 6% to 8% revenue growth, which we think is going to be terrific performance fueling terrific earnings performance as well.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. I guess, my second follow-on question is operating leverage, obviously, a good thing, especially considering you guys are making investments in the business. So with that 30 basis points, is that something we should expect sort of get on out, if you will? Are you going to set a range here to say, going out multiple years, 30 to 50 is a good range to expect? Any color there?","David E. Mangum","Well, I think, I'd point back to Jeff's prepared comments and think through the way we think about the model is over a midterm cycle, 3 to 5 years, solid revenue growth, earnings growth above that, particularly when you add in the combination of acquisitions and buybacks on the top of what would be core operating income growth above the revenue growth rate. That implies leverage, to your point. I don't know if we're going to parse a target for exactly how much margin might expand on an annual basis. But you're certainly seeing a sign of what we believe the model to be when you look at the overall expectations for 2015.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","And just on top of that, Ashwin, as David described, we're not giving specific time periods. Our operating model, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a key feature of that is operating margin expansion, and we don't expect that to reverse. That's how you go from the organic revenue guidance to the earnings guidance that David laid out. The key functions of that model, therefore, would be, over time, increasing margins. And I think, you saw that in fiscal '14, and our guidance in fiscal '15 reflects that as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And I guess, just 2 questions. My first one, you mentioned cash margins being up in North America year-over-year in fiscal '15. Is that primarily due to mix? Or should we expect some of the individual items to generate increasing margins across, I guess, ISOs and direct?","David E. Mangum","Yes, David. It's actually, I guess, you think of it as both in that we expect our core integrated solutions business, so even pre-payPros, to continue to grow and expand margins as it has since we bought APT 1.5 years or so ago. Beyond that, same model for our direct business and our gaming business. We have the assumption of continued slower growth than we would historically recall with the ISO channel, which while not a margin enhancer, it's less of a headwind against the margin growth we expect from the core business. On top of that is a PayPros business, which we've talked about before, at what stage it came into the company. And over the course of this year, we expect it to be a piece of the margin expansion story as well, as they get integration straight and continue to make progress there. And then, your final element is we have a still stable, we believe, Canada in local currency. Now could FX move against this there to sort of give you a headwind there? It's quite possible. So it will track there. It's that the core stays stable, that mix of credit transaction growth spread that's been manageable for us for a few quarters now that, that continues. So if I boil down your question, it is mix because of the channels. But within that, to the point of the first part of your question, it's the individual channels themselves performing at or above expectations.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","And I'd add, Dave, to what David Mangum said, that those investments in those channels, APT and PayPros being the most obvious ones, we're done with a point of view that it was very important for us to buy businesses that, by their own nature, had attractive margins that we could then grow beyond the corporate average. So yes, part of it, of course, necessarily, is the mix as these businesses grow and perform over time. But let's realize, going back to the target model, that we've made investments in businesses that were margin-additive to what our corporate goal was. So that part was very much by design.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And just a quick follow-up. I think, you said PayPros added 2% to North America revenue growth. That would only imply something like $10 million or so of revs, and I thought we were around like a $25 million quarterly run rate?","David E. Mangum","We are on that quarterly run rate as we exited. we can check a little bit of that math as we go to the pieces later tonight. But we are on that $25 million run rate, you're exactly right, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Congratulations, David and Cameron. Just wanted ask a question to sort of parse out the U.S. growth again. Outside of the ISO channel, are you seeing any of the direct business slowdown at all? Or is all the slowdown really coming from the ISO channel still?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, George, it's Jeff. I'll start answering that qualitatively. David, of course, will add additional commentary. We're not seeing a slowdown in the remainder of the businesses. When we look at our integrated businesses and now we're going to annualize PayPros, so we don't have annualization impact, those businesses are still performing well into the double-digits organic revenue growth, George, excluding any annualization impact. So we're not seeing a slowdown there whatsoever. When we look at our other direct businesses like our gaming business, in my opinion, those businesses are growing well north of where the market is for that type of business. And the same thing, I believe, is true of the rest of our remainder of our direct businesses in the United States. So we're not seeing a trend whatsoever in any way in our direct book in the U.S.","David E. Mangum","Yes, maybe just a slight drill down, the traditional sort of bank-based referral business does not have a fundamental change in trajectory from last year or the year before, the year before that. So you are kind of left with more of a slowdown in the ISO channel, the wild horse numbers being a piece of that mathematical conversation as well.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And just as it relates to the operation in Russia, obviously, a small piece of your business, but the conservatism that you're looking at for 2015, I'm just curious, have you seen a slowdown in the fourth quarter of '14, and that's what's leading you to be more conservative? Or you just assumed it's going to slow down in the near future?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. If -- we don't parse any growth rates by market, but I would say we had a solid Q4. But now, as we sit here in July, we're looking ahead 12 months of performance. And as I said earlier, when we start thinking about any market, whether it's United States or any other, we start with macro and say, hey, is there anything about which to be cautious as we begin the idea of how our transactions and volume are going to grow, going to be, where would we take market share, et cetera, et cetera. But one would certainly look up by thinking look at Russia and say, there are probably some macro challenges ahead of you there, so let's temper our expectations. That does not mean we don't think our acquiring business is going to grow in Russia. Our acquiring business we expect to grow in Russia. I'd probably stop there, frankly, for tonight.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up question on the U.S. market. If I say it's going to grow mid single-digits and I subtract $75 million from PayPros, I'm basically getting flat year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. business. I'm just a little surprised by that. So maybe you can help me understand how that could be?","David E. Mangum","We'd have to pull apart your model, Bryan. But I think, the mid allows for a big range of outcomes, lots of risk, FX in Canada, et cetera. At the end of the day, if you pull the pieces together, it wouldn't surprise me if you're higher than the bottom of that range and thinking about the pieces. And then, of course -- you're talking about U.S. only, not just Canada, I realize now that I'm thinking about the answer, I'm giving you the full segment answer. But the pieces there allow for how quickly can the ISO business move, which, as you know, if that slows a little further, big revenue number, no impact on earnings. So think about our range as accommodating all those outcomes, including that big channel slowing down a little more markedly even than we've seen in the past.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, Bryan, I think, as David said, just to be clear, because I know we're conjoining U.S. versus Canada. So in the U.S., our prepared remarks are mid to high single-digit rate of growth in revenue in the United States. It's only when we blend in the Canadian business that low single-digit in local currency that you get to what I think you were just positing in terms of your question.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I mean, if it's -- U.S. is -- I'm just on the low end of U.S., mid single-digits, if you subtract out PayPros, it looks like U.S. could, on the low end, be no organic growth or no revenue growth. That's the surprising piece. Does Comerica, in the dissolution or the break up of that alliance, is that having an impact there? And then, last question for me is just on international margins, I think, it's going to be down year-over-year in fiscal '15. Just trying to figure out what's causing that?","David E. Mangum","Yes. Sure. So let's go back to the pieces again. On your core comments about U.S. and mid, wherever your math is getting you down in the range or below the range. Remember, that allows for further slowdown in the very big ISO channel, which would have no concurrent effect on cash earnings per share. So that's how we create that range and that range of outcomes with mid to high single. Do we expect to be at the bottom end of that? No, we don't do that any year, but we create a range for any number of risk factors. The primary 1 in the range about what you're asking would be how fast the ISOs perform? Do they grow much slower than we think? Do they decline in aggregate, which, again, frankly, doesn't matter from an earnings perspective, from a materiality perspective. On that same theme, Comerica doesn't matter for this conversation either. And so I just wanted to be very clear about Comerica, those of you who have seen the filing. It's not material to the company. To give a little bit of color to that, we had a 51-49 joint venture with Comerica Bank. We had 51% ownership of that. We have agreed with Comerica to split the joint venture. We'll retain our share, they'll retain theirs. We're currently working with them on the mechanics of the split. It's as simple as mechanics. So to boil that down and maybe to answer your question, Bryan, whatever the mechanics of that split turn out to be, it's not going to change our financial outlook for the year and it does not drive the growth rates for the company, much less for North America or for U.S. So let's set that aside and we go back to ISOs and some of the other pieces, the integrated businesses growing in such great fashion over the course of 2015, and that creates our U.S. and total company expectations. Now on international margins, which is the sneaky third question you managed to get in to this call. So a couple of things there. So we do expect it to be down modestly, and there are a couple of things involved in that. The first is we're expecting continued strong growth from what we call Global Solutions, which is the e-Commerce channel we operate, which operates at lower margin than the rest. And that has an impact in any given quarter, whether it be Q4 '14 or our expectation for fiscal 2015. We obviously have a tempered view of Russia, which has been a part of the margin expansion story over time. We certainly allow for currency at sort of the bottom end of whatever some of those expectation ranges would be, particularly in specific currencies like the euro or maybe the ruble, again, back to the macro commentary a moment ago. And we probably have another year of some moderate investment at the margin in Asia as we continue to build out the distribution channels there to try and drive the long-term growth of Asia as a bigger contributor to global, 2, 3, 4, 5 years down the road. So those are the big pieces of why we expect -- I think, our commentary is down modestly in terms of operating margins in international year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to start on the margin side. I think, you guys said it will be up as much 30 bps year-over-year in fiscal '15. But if we assume that you're getting, if my math is right, about 70 bps of year-over-year lift just from the absence of the $17 million in security costs from last year, what are the offsets against that?","David E. Mangum","So Jason, I'm a little confused by your question. The security cost don't go away. In fact, they're growing in 2015, and we are covering them in other parts of the expectations. So the $17 million was not a one-timer, it was a new run rate for the company from a security investment expense. So as we pull the pieces together, we expect security to begin to scale like the rest of the infrastructure. But we will not scrimp on security. That means if it has to grow, and it's growing quite substantially next year, that means in other parts of the company, particularly in the infrastructure, whether it's accounting or any other sort of corporate area, those things need to scale to allow for that investment and\/or we need to drive increased revenue growth. So the margin story really is a little bit back to an earlier question. You drive really nice progress in the U.S. to get a little bit of help maybe over the course of a year and late in the year at the margin from an acquisition, you have a stable Canada, you have these factors that take you back in international, even though you're growing revenue nicely, all-in, it comes together on top of a scaling infrastructure and you get approaching 30 basis points of margin expansion.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. I think, Jason, the way I think about it is, in David's prepared commentary, there's 20 bps of margin expansion in fiscal 2014, excluding, for apples-to-apples purposes, the security increment. And that 20, Jason, compares to the 30. So that's how I take that rather than saying the 20 in 70 and all those other things. We're growing margin more quickly next year than we did this year, and that's how I think about it.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful clarification. And just quick metric question. What was PayPros' contribution to U.S. transaction growth in Q4 there? I think, the total number was 11%. And then, just anything you can tell us about FX headwind for revenue for fiscal '15?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","PayPros adds a couple of points if you create that 11%. And then, would you ask your second part of your question again, your sneaky third question as well, because you cut out for a second there.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I copied Bryan, yes. The FX headwind on revenue for next year. I know you said a modest headwind on EPS. Is it similar for revenue?","David E. Mangum","It is. And obviously, it starts with the revenue. But yes, it's a similar concept when you see the revenue in addition to the earnings.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Let me add my congratulations as well. Hey, you folks have talked about kind of low double-digit cash EPS over the course of the cycle. Can you just drill down on that a little bit? What are the components to buyback versus acquisition versus organic?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","So Kevin, it's Jeff. I'll start on that. So obviously, as we said in the prepared remarks, it's over a 3 to 5-year period. So in any year, you could be plus or minus, Kevin, the targets. But I would say, in general, you look at mid single-digits organic revenue growth, then you add to that a little bit better mid single-digits operating income growth to try to get toward EPS. And that is the genesis of my comment around operating margin expansion before you get into M&A and the like. So mid single-digits organic revenue is better than mid single-digits operating income growth. Then in any given year, realizing it throughout the cycle, Kevin, I would say that it's probably around 2% earnings growth from buybacks in any given year, Kevin, and probably around 2% in any given year increment in year from acquisition activity in that year. So that's how I would think about it in terms of ranges. But you do realize that, as we've said before, when we balance corporate development pipeline by way of return, we very much think about what is the return from a buyback relative to the acquisition we're doing from an IRR point of view, and we also think about what's the return from an earnings per share accretion point of view. So to a certain extent, Kevin, I view that 2% to 4% as being not quite fungible but being tradeoffs in the context of acquisitions versus repurchase.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Understood. And then, is it fair to say that's probably the type of range we have dialed into the '15 guidance as well?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, I think, it's fair to say that we're pretty much, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, pretty much right on that guidance for fiscal '15. Now of course we're only just into the fiscal year right now and these things, by way of acquisition in particular, Kevin, these things tend to come up during the course of the year. I did mention in my prepared remarks, we do have a very full pipeline, particularly in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas, probably in that order. So we want to see how those play out throughout the course of the year, Kevin. So putting aside for a minute, you have that all in the bucket of the 2% to 4% area.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess, I just want to go back to the U.S. or North America revenue growth, but make sure I heard it right, are you sort of contemplating the potential for an ISO revenue decline within that guide, Dave?","David E. Mangum","I'm allowing for continued slowing of the ISO channel. And yes, potentially, that could even put you in a place where those are tiny decline, absolutely.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Which would imply, all else equal, better North America margins. And you sort of said somewhat up, but directionally, that would mean even more than directionally somewhat better than that?","David E. Mangum","Just to reiterate exactly what I said, I said North America margins we expect to expand. And so I think, you're right in sort of inferring from that, that we expect progress there. And a piece of that is less headwind from the ISOs, no question about it.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe if you could just update us on PayPros integration efforts, how far you guys have progressed on that? And is it likely that we'll sort of complete that by the end of the year and have a sort of a clean slate going into fiscal '16, where we get sort of a full loan integrated payments business between PayPros and APT with a much improved margin profile exiting the year?","David E. Mangum","Yes, happy to provide that. And let me just start by saying to the tail end of your question, the answer is yes. And I'll come back to that in a second. We're actually really pleased with the integration to date. I think, we noted in Jeff's prepared comments, the leadership team is in place. We've moved quickly to do that. We have a very solid integration plan for the technology, the platforms and the products and how they'll come together over the course of primarily this fiscal year. From a reporting perspective, sort of metrics and what happens in the corporate office around accounting and HR, I'm feeling very good about those pieces. We brought the employee base into the manner in which we operate and pay, which is always an important thing to do when you bring an entrepreneurial type company into a corporate environment, how do you keep that spirit while bringing them into the corporate fold, all that really being managed very well by the core PayPros leadership team and our existing APT leadership team that's come together very, very nicely. To go to the most important part of that, which is really the second part of your question. As we look at this year, we've got a lot of work to do. I don't know that we'll exit '15 finished with everything. But we will be in terrific shape from a product, bringing 1 product to market, 1 platform and 1 set of customer-facing technologies to each new customer at that point. We already have 1 face to the customer from a sales perspective and it's going great, we have 1 very, very large win you've already seen just a few weeks ago. So I do believe, to your point, when we exit the year, whether or not every little bit of integration is finished, we won't be talking about integration anymore. We will be talking about a company really growing nicely and really contributing even more to the margin story we're expecting from the United States in North America.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can I squeeze one more in here?","David E. Mangum","Sure, why not?","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, why not. I sort of -- I guess, I appreciate the sounds like various conservatism around the globe in terms of revenue growth and some people have asked around these questions. But are there any specific customer dampening growth losses or books of business that are coming off your portfolio, is it dampening revenue growth or is it just sort of more bits of conservatism here and there, you had some Russian headwinds, some FX headwinds? I don't know if you get the gist of my question?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. I think that, first off, the answer is no. There's nothing specific, no challenges, no problems. I think, we're in our usual mode. It's the beginning of the year. We're going to get ready. We have 12 months ahead of us. We take a look at all the markets, other than the specific ones I've called out a little bit earlier, which are really currency around the globe here and there, a little bit of tempering in the market with some macro challenges right now. There's nothing specific beyond that. And we expect a really solid FY '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First of all, on the PayPros, I was wondering if you could give some color on, for fiscal '15, how you're thinking about the growth rate of PayPros specifically off the base of the run rate you're at today? And then, as you exit the year, how big you think the integrated channel is going to be as a percentage of total sales?","David E. Mangum","So Jim, this is David. I would sort of parse PayPros and sort of link it to APT to answer the first part of your question and come back to the second. We think, each of these 2 businesses are solid double-digit, mid-teens top line growers for the foreseeable future. So the core PayPros business is right in line with that. We actually think, to go back to Glenn's question, we can perform, when we put the 2 really together, with the right technology and product, plan and execution, maybe we can squeeze out a little bit more growth from that over some period of time. So the core PayPros that comes into global matches the core APT really beautifully. The verticals don't overlap, but they're both growing at this really nice double-digit range. So think about that as you head for your model for 2015 and beyond. I don't believe I'm going to parse the revenue lines enough to give you exactly what piece of the company is going to be integrated payments come '15. But I would say, if you think about the math, which you know PayPros when it came into the company a little less than 2 years ago -- I'm sorry, excuse me, APT when it came into the company a little less than 2 years ago, now PayPros just a few months ago, and then, you think about the growth rates, I think, you have enough in front of you to realize that it's already a really big piece of the company and it's a really nice fast-growing defensible channel that's going to help us, Jeff said a moment ago, drive that margin expansion in and out of North America that we're expecting in the model for the 3 to 5-year timeframe we're talking about.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up. On the M&A pipeline, you've talked about different potential deals in Asia and EMEA in the past, can you talk about where we might likely see a deal first come to fruition?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, sure. So what we said, in particular, in Asia, since we started there, Jim, is there are 3 countries in Asia that we're not in directly today that we would like to be. And those are Australia, South Korea and Japan. And where we end up in those markets is really a function, as I said before, about what types of partnerships are available and what those returns look like. But I would look to those 3 as to where we've been spending our time as it relates to Asia. Second in Asia, there are markets that we're already in that we feel like we need to be bigger in because we don't have enough scale. And I think, what we've said before is in particular, India, Mainland China and Philippines, are 3 markets where we are physically present today but we don't feel we have enough scale to accomplish the goals that we have as a company. And in those markets, we're also looking continually to expand our existing footprint. We've been able to do that today organically. But we do believe, and our model suggests, that we do have to augment that through inorganic partnerships, which is what we're trying to affect. When were those things happening and the timing of those things are really a function of who the partner is and what the returns look like, but that's where we're spending most of our time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So we've seen a lot of change now in the integrated channel or the direct channel, obviously, your acquisitions, and then, Vantiv going after Mercury. Could you just talk about sort of the competitive environment? There was a lot of momentum behind the ISPs, and it sounds like that's at least partially why you're feeling pretty sanguine about North American profitability, recognizing the ISOs slowing down, too. How do you kind of think about the long-term competitive environment? How do you differentiate yourself in the direct SMB business, and ultimately, a year from now, do you think ISPs continue to blend up the profitability of your business all else being equal?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, Andrew, it's Jeff. So what I would say is we've been extremely happy with the growth rates, the spreads, and really, the retention rates and the lack of attrition in the integrated channel both in the case of APT in the 1.5 years that we owned APT, as well as in the case of PayPros in the quarter, a little bit more than a quarter that we've owned PayPros. And to be here sitting here today, I don't really see that changing all that much. I think that the key thing in those businesses, the key thing in that business, Andrew, is that we're in about 40 different vertical markets between APT and PayPros, and it's what is your value proposition, I believe, in those markets, in those vertical markets that we're attacking. So as you probably know from our Investor Day, when we talk about APT, which we owned at the time, it was very much geared toward dental, veterinary, auto repair, those types of markets. PayPros, as David alluded to, very complementary, didn't overlap all that much. And that's primarily geared towards self-storage. And of course, there's joint win that we've announced about a month ago in rentals, which David was alluding to, which of course, is in the auto channel where both really had a presence. So I think that the answer initially to your question is, what is your value proposition in that go-to-market vertical channel? And I think, as APT and PayPros have been able to show, we're very good at those vertical markets and we think we have differentiated solutions in those 40 channels that we've been alluding to. That's kind of point #1. Point #2, how do I think over a cycle, not really in the next 12 to 24 months but in a cycle that, that may evolve. I do believe, with those acquisitions, as well as with the partnership with CyberSource, which we announced 2.5 years at this point, I do think we're becoming more of a technology services company. And I think, you've seen this in us, and I think, you probably have seen this in some of our peer's announcements, at the end of the day, the mode of differentiation, I think, for us in our business going forward is not going to be the type of device that something resides on, but instead, the value of the software we're providing as a service. So to go back to my commentary around APT and PayPros and integrated, it's very much a re-catering to the specific needs of the dentist office, of the pharmacist in the case of health care, of the auto repair shop in the case of the auto dealer, and do our applications address their concerns. Well, part of doing that is be very good at differentiated service solutions. And I think, over time, that's going to become more of a technology play and a software-as-a-service play. But as I look out, I think, that's going to be a mode of differentiation for us rather than what type of device is fueling the means of acceptance. I think, we like to think about our business, Andrew, especially in that channel, as largely device agnostic. And that's how we think about delivering our value. I think, the last thing I'd say, Andrew, on the mode of differentiation is our ability to do a cross-border. So you've seen from us the announcement with APT that we brought that functionality into Canada, and in particular, we've native-ized, for example, with Interac in the Canadian marketplace. That's very different than having, Andrew, a customer in the U.S. that wants to do business in Canada. Instead, our APT product is designed for Canadian customers with a Canadian business, of course, in Canada. So I think, our ability to bring that kind of service functionality, not just as a solution to 1 market, but as a solution to multiple markets where the language reflects the nature of those markets, the certifications reflect the nature of those markets, is a very important point of differentiation. So as I look 3 to 5 years out, I would say our ability to bring those models around the world is really one of the ways that we're going to win. And I think, we've seen it initially with us in Canada with APT.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And with regard to the international acquiring business, it sounds like that continues to perform very well. Are there initiatives to expand that, either geographically or is there additional partnerships? How should we think about that? Or is that just going to be -- is that going to continue to just benefit from nice organic growth the way we've seen it in the last couple of years.","David E. Mangum","I think, it will still look to all of us, Andrew, like an organic grower. But it does have its own dedicated sales team. Actually, its own dedicated product team for that matter, too. To your point, we think about either different flavors of partners or crossing different borders with these e-Commerce transactions. So some of the enhanced growth or expanded growth we've seen in the last year comes from existing customers growing their own businesses organically and delivering pieces of that growth to us. Some of it came from existing customer routing a little bit more volume our way. And some of it, a small, but growing piece, comes from net new sales we made a year ago beginning to come into the base. And we would expect the quota-carrying sales force there to continue to keep adding net new customers to that solution in '15 and beyond. You raised a great point, we really like the performance of the top line growth and we'd like to see more of that cross-border traffic rolling through, and hence, we've got this dedicated sales force focused on doing just that.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","I'd add to that, Andrew, that if you look at the changing regulatory environment, particularly in the EU market, I think, our view and the ability to take our solutions cross-border in a relatively seamless way is a very important mode of differentiation of what we're trying to accomplish. So the footprint that we have in those markets where in many cases we're doing business there already, our ability to offer 1 seamless solution as rates come down starting in calendar 2015 and ultimately thereafter through EU regulation, we're finally starting to see over some period of time SEPA probably come into effect by way of regulations and network action. And I think, whether it's through our international acquiring business or otherwise, I think, we're well-positioned to capture share as those costs come down from merchants.","Operator","Our last question will come from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sorry if I missed this, I just want to ask on the ISO growth slowdown, is that broad-based or was it driven by a select few ISOs? And I know you get this question a lot, is the slowdown you think just law of large numbers or is there some secular issues going on as well?","David E. Mangum","Yes, Tien-tsin, it's David. I think, the slowdown has been going on for some time. I guess, as a reminder for everyone on to call to start, it is broad-based, perhaps almost by definition. But the channel overall is slower than it was 2 years ago, much slower than it was 4 years ago. When we look at it, it certainly feels like part of it have to be the law of large numbers, very large amount of revenue, very large amount of transaction. I think, though, it's inescapable, when you look at the mix of business we operate to not conclude at some level that we're placing capital investments and organic investments in channels we expect to grow for the short, medium and long term. That growth has to come at the expense of something else across the market. And so, I think, you can conclude from that, we believe firmly in the channels which we're investing that growth is coming potentially at the expense of some of these other channels. Are there other channels that may be slowing as well across the market? Perhaps. We don't see them necessarily within the portfolio of businesses we operate, but I think, you can conclude from that sort of a potential view, not necessarily a purely analytic view, of how another factor in that the slowdown of that overall ISO channel.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure thing. Just follow the capital. Just on the Asia Pac side, the revenue did step down a little bit sequentially. What's going on there? Anything unusual?","David E. Mangum","Well, we have 1 large customer who had a product launch that affected Q3 that obviously the launch itself doesn't repeat itself in Q4. Beyond that, there really isn't a whole lot going on. I think, as you know, the Asia business is one where we're still focused on continuing to invest and drive the growth we can while focused on what else can we do from a distribution and an acquisition standpoint to enhance that growth in the future. So the business kind of is operating at a certain level right now. We expect it to improve over time. But beyond that 1 customer, not a whole lot of one-timers, anything like that, operating inside the business.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Last one and I'll let you guys...","David E. Mangum","You get 3, too, huh?","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Sorry, David. Hey, man, it's your last call as CFO, I'll give you 1 more easier one. So in the long-term, we like you guys setting out that long-term guidance, I think, it's nice to have that. So I just want to clarify, for this year's EPS guidance, are you assuming buybacks in that number in the EPS range or not? I wasn't sure.","David E. Mangum","Yes. So I'm glad you actually mentioned that because I think it's a great thing to clarify at the end. Buybacks, to-date, the buybacks we did last year, obviously, are in the guidance. We are assuming no future buybacks, no potential future buybacks. With the current $320 million remaining authorization, our expectations for cash earnings per share assume no additional buybacks out of that authorization.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. Very clear. Congrats on the new title, and Cameron, welcome to the earnings circuit, man. We'll talk later.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks very much. I look forward to it.","Jeffrey S.

Jeff?","Jeff Sloan","Thank you, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We delivered solid results for the quarter, growing revenue by 7% and cash earnings per share by 10%. As a result, we are raising our annual fiscal 2014 cash earnings per share expectations and tightening the range to $4.06 to $4.11 or 11% to 13% growth. Our performance demonstrates that we continue to gain momentum as we drive sustainable growth by executing the right strategies in each of our markets.","Globally, we focus on building and growing our direct distribution channels while concurrently leveraging our worldwide technology platforms. Here in North America, for example, we are pleased to have completed our PayPros acquisition in early March.","This transaction marks a continuation of our strategy to pivot toward direct sales channels in our largest market. I\u2019m delighted to report that we are already seeing early wins as we begin to integrate the best of the APT and PayPros businesses.","Now for quarterly highlights. We are pleased with our international performance, reflecting solid execution on our strategic initiatives, with particularly strong performance in our international eCommerce channel. We also continue to make progress in our Asia business as evidenced by the double-digit revenue growth that David will describe shortly.","We are delighted to report that North America continues to deliver solid results both in the United States and Canada. The U.S. results were driven by strong performance across our direct channels, headlined by our integrated solution business. And of course, we are very pleased with recent sales momentum in our gaining business and in movement of our integrated businesses into Canada.","Canada delivered another quarter of stable performance. Revenue growth was driven by 5% credit transaction growth and assessment based changes. As previously noted, these changes were partially annualized during our fourth quarter.","Especially noteworthy this quarter is the expansion of our North American operating margins. We believe our margins demonstrate successful execution of our distribution strategies. This progress of course does not yet reflect the confirmation of the PayPros acquisition given its March 4th close day.","Now, I will turn the call over to David.","David Mangum","Thank you, Jeff. We are pleased by the solid business performance across all of our markets during the quarter. North America revenue grew 5% with U.S. revenue growth of 6% and transaction growth of 6%. Canada revenue grew 11% in local currency for the quarter and we continue to expect a mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth in local currency for the full year.","North America cash operating income grew 9% to $69 million. Cash operating margin grew about 60 basis points over prior year to 16%. Our full year expectations for North America cash operating margins remain unchanged at flat to slightly increasing compared to prior year.","International revenue grew 10% for the quarter in U.S. dollars. Europe delivered solid revenue growth with particular strengths in our e-Commerce business in Spain. Asia-Pacific revenue grew 10% over last year with pricing and new assessments driving growth in our base business.","International cash operating income of $66 million grew 8%. Cash operating margin decreased about 60 basis points to 35% as a result of continued strong growth in our e-Commerce channel and investments in Asia. We are on track for stable cash operating margins in international for the full year.","For the quarter, total company cash operating margin was 18.2%. This included over $3 million of an expected full year $17 million incremental security spend. Excluding the security spend, total company cash operating margin for the quarter would have increased about 30 basis points over prior year to 18.7%.","Currency trends were roughly in line with our expectations for the third quarter. However, movements in rates for Canada and Russia are likely to be more challenging in the fourth quarter than we previously expected. We now expect that foreign currency translation will represent a modest headwind to cash earnings per share for the full year. Our expectations, of course, reflect this. We continue to expect that both GAAP and cash effective tax rates will approach 29% for the full year.","For fiscal 2014, we expect PayPros to contribute modestly to U.S. revenue and be about neutral to cash earnings per share. We are in the beginning stages of executing an integration plan for PayPros that will continue through fiscal 2015.","PayPros represents an important milestone in the execution of our strategy to control direct sales, expand technology-enabled distribution and drive more revenue and earnings growth from our direct channels. As growth slows in our ISO channel and we add PayPros to the mix at the beginning of the fourth quarter, our 90 or so active ISO partners in United States now represents in aggregate a low double-digit percentage of total Global Payments\u2019 operating income and thus contributed about 20% to North American operating income.","We generated free cash flow of $88 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement, assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests. Capital expenditures totaled $20 million for the quarter and we continue to anticipate our fiscal 2014 capital expenditures will total about $90 million. Our total available cash, including working capital at the end of the quarter was about $320 million.","During the quarter, we completed the $100 million accelerated share repurchase program we announced in October of 2013. We also purchased the 155,000 shares in the open market during the quarter. We are pleased with the refinancing we closed at the end of February.","We now have about $1 billion of debt capacity available to fund future growth initiatives and share repurchases. And on that note, we are delighted to announce that our Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $250 million. We now have about $365 million of total authorization remaining for potential further share repurchases.","We are increasing our annual fiscal 2014 cash earnings per share expectations and tightening the expectation range to $4.06 to $4.11, reflecting 11% to 13% growth over fiscal 2013. We are maintaining our annual revenue expectations of $2.51 billion to $2.56 billion, or 6% to 8% growth.","We remain on track to achieve stable total company cash operating margins for the fiscal year, including the negative affects of the $17 million incremental stable functions in security spending.","Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, David. We were executing well on our strategies around the world and we maintain substantial capital flexibility to achieve our goals. We believe that we have made the pivot towards critical mass of direct distribution, while maintaining a careful balance to create value for our shareholders, partners and employees.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jane.","Jane Elliott","Thanks. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, I\u2019d like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. And operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","George Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to start off on the PayPros side sort of, what is the expectation from a revenue standpoint in the fourth quarter? Are we talking somewhere around $25 million, or so $1 million and sort of neutral on an EBIT basis?","David Mangum","Hey, George, it\u2019s David. Yes, you\u2019ve got it right. If you recall our disclosure at the time we closed that we gave you kind of the run rate, the last 12 months being about $100 million of revenue. So, $25 million is a possibly good assumption for Q4. And then you get to earnings neutral when you think of nice solid business with nice margins. But we are in the beginning stages of a long-term integration to combine the best of our APT and our PayPros now into the best of Global Payments. So we wash that in for the fourth quarter. You\u2019ve got about earnings neutral for the quarter.","George Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. And just maybe you can help us think of the margin profile longer-term for the PayPros business, and is it safe to say that ex the PayPros acquisition for 4Q, that margins would clearly be up on the North American side? Thank you.","Jeff Sloan","So, George, I\u2019m going to sound like I\u2019m repeating myself relative to what we said on the order of the year ago, when we first bought APT, which is we\u2019ve just bought a business that operates at a higher margin than Global Payments, that is expanding that margin with profitable growth and is the same kind of growth profile we saw with APT. When you bring the numbers I just described into the total company for the quarter, you really don\u2019t make a material difference at all to margins.","So the trajectory you have us on for the year for North America, for total company. So for the year for North America that\u2019s flat to slightly increasing margins. It\u2019s unchanged bringing PayPros and so anything you would have in your model previously really for Q4 to kind of roll that forward, PayPros is not going to make a difference to them. And similarly for the total company at that level, they were expecting stable margins in total and margins that would otherwise be expanding were not for the security investment, PayPros doesn\u2019t make a big difference there. The difference of PayPros comes over the years to come.","Operator","Your next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane, your line is open.","Jeff Sloan","Operator, let\u2019s go to the next question. Maybe Bryan can come back.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Can you hear me? Can you hear me?","Jeff Sloan","Sorry, Bryan, were you on mute?","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Sorry about that. I just wanted to ask about the Russia situation. I know you guys had some exposure to Russia and obviously the political landscape there, just curios to know if you could talk a little bit about your Russia business, how big it is and any expected impacts there?","Jeff Sloan","Yeah, Bryan. It\u2019s Jeff. I will start and then, David can provide some additional financial commentary so. I think you touched on the right point. I do believe that what\u2019s going in Russia is primarily a political event. And with potential events, it is difficult to handicap what may happen in the coming days and weeks. We continue to monitor Russia and evaluate the business situation. But you just heard David expressed our guidance raise for fiscal 2014, which of course includes our current evaluation of the Russian situation. So, we don\u2019t expect as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, this situation to have a material effect on fiscal \u201914. David, you want to add some?","David Mangum","I think I\u2019ll add to that is just remember Russia is a fast-growing, it\u2019s a very small piece of Global Payments overall.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Have you guys actually seen any impacts of the Russian business so far or nothing to date?","David Mangum","Well, I think what I had said, I would point you right back to our full-year expectation. They are unchanged. We\u2019ve obviously done best we can to assess what\u2019s going on but our expectation is unchanged.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","And then just wanted to ask on the U.S. business, the growth rates, 6% was kind of in line but anything any kind of sales, same-store sales weakness that you saw, anything you can describe further to give us color on the U.S. market? Thanks.","David Mangum","Yeah. I think it\u2019s a great question and kind of interesting when you pull apart the pieces. As you add in PayPros and think about it, I would first point you to 6% revenue growth was matched by 6% transaction growth, which if you think of the history of Global Payments is really quite an interesting combination of metric and dollars. We used to see really rapid ISO growth that would drive high transaction growth and have a big delta between that and the actual revenue growth, much less the actual operating income growth you might see coming through on the bottom line.","At this stage in terms of same-store and some of the other metrics, average tickets very stable, spreads stable, transaction is growing like revenue which you are seeing and part of why we\u2019ve sort of enhanced for the moment the way we were talking about the way the channels work and fit together is nice fast-growing direct revenue channels coming in like APT and as we add PayPros, at the same time the ISOs is slowing down which is, when you combine that with Canada is what\u2019s allowing to see the operating income growth and the margin leverage you see in the third quarter for North America.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.","David Mangum","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Your next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Hey. Thanks, guys. And just a follow-up on PayPros, the color in Q4 is helpful, but how should we be thinking about on kind of a go-forward basis annualized, I mean, what sort of what cash EPS accretion can we see from PayPros?","David Mangum","Hi, Jason, it\u2019s David. Obviously, we are not going to talk about 2015, so we are not ready to project PayPros. I would say the way to think about it again, it\u2019s a nice margin business coming into Global Payments. Add to that, the integration costs, while we try and create in the best of the assets we have. We obviously expected to be accretive, but it will be -- whatever accretion will be, it will be held down a bit by integration cost, but more to come as we get to July and really talk to you about 2015.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Okay. And then Mercury has obviously filed to the public here, so they\u2019ve got some public disclosure out there now about their contractual relationship with you guys indicating that they are migrating some of their processing services in-house. Can you just clarify for us what exactly they are taking in-house versus what you guys are going to continue to provide to them? I think your contract runs through 2018. Is there any kind of material revenue headwind we should be starting to think about at some point in time from the piece that they are migrating in-house?","Jeff Sloan","Jason, it\u2019s Jeff. I will start. So that the first thing I would say is we think, it\u2019s very good news that Mercury is going public. We wish them a lot of success. They are a good partner of ours and have been for a very long period of time. And as far as the partnership, we are only going to be successful as they are also successful. So I think you touched on one of the key points, which as we mentioned last July in our prepared remarks that our contract, our relationship with them has been extended to 2018, which is of course in their documentation. So we are going to have a very strong long-term relationship with Mercury based on what you mentioned, based on what we have described.","Now between the two of us, we are providing both transactional as well as non-transactional services. For Mercury through that period, over what period of time and in what form, it\u2019s going to vary depending on what they would prefer to do, what we would like to do. So some of that description is in the S-1. I also would add that our relationship with them is not just in the United States but also in Canada. So, actually in multiple geographies with Mercury. So from our perspective, it\u2019s a complex long-term relationship. We are going to be partners for quite an extended period of time. And our relationship with them of course is reflected in David\u2019s prepared remarks, again our guidance for fiscal 2014. David, would you add any?","David Mangum","No, I think you summarized it.","Jeff Sloan","So we will see how it plays out and we are very excited for them and we are sure we will be very successful and we think that\u2019s ultimately to their benefit as well as ours.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Okay. Understood.","Jeff Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of clarifications on some of the discussion the guys have been asking. The first on the full year guide. I think I guess some of the questions I have been getting or you sort of include -- just want to think about the figure guide. So including $25 million or so for PayPros, it sounds like there is some incremental FX type wins. I think David you called up Canada and Russia. Could you just give us some context of why you didn\u2019t raise the full year guide? Is it just you sort of still within the high end of the range? Did anything slow in the core business? I guess just a little bit color on how you thought about the full year guide given the fact that PayPros should be additive?","David Mangum","Yes. And Glenn let me make I answer your question precisely. That\u2019s a revenue guidance question.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","Yes, exactly.","David Mangum","So here is a way to think about. I think it\u2019s a starting point. I go back to the commentary on the United States revenue. The ISOs as a channel have been slower this year than previous years and frankly a midway little slower than we expected. Given that slowdown which of course is happy net news to Global Payments, we think it will from a performance, earnings and margin perspective. But given that slowdown in revenue, one might want to model us to low to middle end of the revenue range. When you bring in then the increment of PayPros, you are adding on the order of estimated $25 million or so. I believe you still are in the range and then you raised the right finer point to this which is our range always is designed to accommodate possible range of that outcomes.","Certainly as we enter the quarter, we see the U.S. dollar strengthen further against the Canadian dollar and against the ruble than we would have expected three months ago much less nine months ago when we first set up the year. So if you bring all these things together, you end up really with the same range you had before. Again, I would say for a number of happy reasons quite frankly.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","Okay. That\u2019s clear. And then just follow-up on Jason\u2019s question as it relates to Mercury, I will sort of talk about the ISO business, I guess, and you sort of talked about the ISO business for most of this year has been slowing largely due to the large numbers. Is that the primary factor or some of it that Mercury has already transitioned some of their volumes in-house? I guess the question we are all trying to get our arms around is not necessarily on fiscal \u201914, because we know that\u2019s sort of baked into your guide. But is there like a big headwind we should be thinking about as we go into \u201915 and \u201916?","Jeff Sloan","I think the way to think about this is what we have been saying the ISOs is a channel, I think is a sheer size and the sheer amount of revenue and transactions that comes from them have been slowing down. That\u2019s true across as I have said and their counts are broadly 90 or so active ISOs. That\u2019s the right way to think about the ISO channel. We gave you the rough sizing in aggregate of the channel. That sizing is spread across 90 different active, literally active ISOs.","And so I would about the channel in that way, anything else would be a little bit of speculation to have relationship evolve and what the future looks like and we will report that as we go along, as we reach milestone in those certain things. But right now we have what we know and that\u2019s baked into our expectations for \u201914.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","One more, would you be comfortable giving us the ISO percentage of North America or aggregate revenue along with the operating income disclosure which was very helpful?","David Mangum","Yes. It\u2019s actually not a matter of comfort. For me, it\u2019s a matter of -- I am not sure how relevant it is at this stage. I think the income is far more interesting. I certainly think the way we perform this year indicates to you what we are managing through the income and hopefully as a result of margin impact of all of our versus channels around the world. The fact we might have some grossed up revenue, quite frankly in some cases might not even help you think through how the channel is evolving over time.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","Okay. Thanks a lot.","David Mangum","Thanks, Glen. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Roswell from RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew Roswell - RBC Capital Markets","Yes. I was wondering if you are willing to give us the Asia Pacific transaction growth. You mentioned that it was up on pricing and assessments.","David Mangum","I don\u2019t have that in front of me. We really aren\u2019t quoting and breaking up the markets other than U.S. where that important comparison of transactions of revenue growth is rolling on. I would say you transaction growth is certainly less than revenue growth in Asia because that revenue growth in the base was a feature of pricing along with some new assessments from the networks. So you are on the right track, but we\u2019re trying not to break out market by market each piece of transaction growth.","Matthew Roswell - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then I was wondering if you have seen any change in the Canadian consumer and some concern about possible slowdown up there?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Matt. It\u2019s Jeff. No, we have not. I think if you look at the credit transaction growth which was in my prepared remarks for this quarter, and if you look the last several quarters that we described, we had very healthy growth this quarter in Canadian credit transaction growth which in our view really is a fundamental sign of the health of the Canadian consumer. And that is obviously -- the last several quarters were obviously significantly higher than it was a year and half or two years ago. So I would say if anything we see a consistent stable performance out of their Canadian consumer.","Matthew Roswell - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Jeff Sloan","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens.","Brett Huff - Stephens","Good afternoon, guys. How are you?","David Mangum","Hi, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens","Question on margins going forward. I know there is lots of lever that you guys have been able to work on both from a mix point of view and I know you\u2019re consistently working on the expense base in the fit -- more efficient technology. I think I guess this question is for you David I am not sure, but can you just give us a highlight -- we know about the security spend, but maybe you could tell us or remind us again is that -- I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a step function up again next year, I think it\u2019s a run rate. But beyond that, what other initiatives do you have going on that we should think about that help you guys battle that ISO dilution on the margin other than just if that growth is slowing a little bit?","David Mangum","Sure, Brett, great question. So you are quite right about the security spend. We expect our security investment to scale now like the rest of the infrastructure. In any given years we go into the year the infrastructure departments or their accounting or their IT receive a budget target that says the service of scale of your cost per transaction has to go down year after year after year. We are not going to skimp or scrimp on security spending, but with this one-time investment -- investment increment we saw in \u201914, we\u2019ll not repeat itself as another big giant investment increment. And in fact the way we think about it now is that security is a number one priority for the company which it should be and then maybe that stands in front of another investment we would have otherwise made, as we think through the pieces of 2015, \u201916, \u201917, \u201918 and beyond.","If you then stop for a moment and sort of think through the other drivers of margin, I would point you to other -- you mentioned it wanted to set aside for a moment. I would go back to the ISOs to the extent they continue to grow more slowly, that reduces the headwind we have been struggling against for several years quite frankly and that's helpful. Remember too, we just got PayPros which again is coming in as a higher margin. This is pre-integration costs, but then we will scale no doubt routinely from there on in, just as we\u2019ve seen APT do over the last year and so.","And then probably the final piece of the puzzle that\u2019s a little difficult to see on the surface of the income statement right now, surely Canada, which to the extent we continue to see what Jeff pointed out a moment ago which is healthy credit transaction growth, this past quarter was 5%, and as I\u2019ve said before manageable spreads. Now you have your second biggest asset helping it and helping push the company forward from operating income and margin perspective. That's an important decision we are seeing for the first time this year in some time and we would expect that trend to continue again as long as those credit transactions growth numbers remain healthy. We have a nice piece of the puzzle.","Brett Huff - Stephens","That's helpful. Thanks. And then just another question on the Caesars deal, can you size that for us at all or more color?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, it\u2019s Jeff. All right. We don\u2019t really breakout as a matter of policy separate customer relationships financially. I would tell you that as you know for the last several years as we have announced publicly, we already had a piece of the Caesars business. So it\u2019s additive to what we currently had, but I can\u2019t really give you a lot of metrics around the revenue or profitability except that it\u2019s additive to our current book.","David Mangum","Maybe I\u2019ll add a little color only in that, you can read other disclosure out there and suggest you that all of the services encompass and other disclosers are not services we perform necessarily. We do some of that through partners. So the numbers you might have seen bandied about are not the appropriate numbers for Global Payments, the services we offer linked to what Jeff just described. So just bear that in mind. Having said that, we are thrilled to expand our relationship with Caesars.","Brett Huff - Stephens","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","David Mangum","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Dugan with Sterne Agee.","Jennifer Dugan - Sterne Agee","Yes, hi. I wanted to ask about the acquisition pipeline, I know that's probably a funny question to ask, you\u2019ve made couple of really great acquisitions here. But should we be looking for you to slow down a little bit as you work on integration and focus more on buybacks or do you still have a pretty active acquisition pipeline?","Jeff Sloan","No, we still have an active acquisition pipeline, Jennifer. We balance very carefully our acquisition investments versus our balance sheet, our debt capacity and our repurchase work. So as David announced in his prepared comments, we have about a $1 billion of available debt capacity and roughly another $300 million of available cash as he described. So I wouldn\u2019t look at it and say that because we have done deals like PayPros or APT that we don\u2019t have sufficient available capacity.","In fact, one of the reasons we worked on a very successful refinancing in February was to make sure that we have debt capacity to balance those going forward. So it\u2019s a plentiful pipeline, we are opportunistic. But as you think the additional repurchase authority that we described in our prepared remarks, it gives you an indication of how we are balancing investments in acquisitions versus investments in repurchases. And I think as we\u2019ve said previously, we have a very good track record of consummating those repurchases over time and that's why we would expect us to do.","Jennifer Dugan - Sterne Agee","Okay, great. And then in terms of the next acquisitions or joint ventures, are those more likely to be here in the states or overseas in Asia? I think we are still kind of waiting to see some more action in expanding the Asia footprint. What might the timing beyond that?","Jeff Sloan","That's a great question. So as I said before Jennifer, the major of the battle is whether something is available for sale first, and then second is that a good partner and third is what to the returns look like, especially in comparison to repurchasing more stock. So I would tell you that we have a very active pipeline. As it relates to Asia, which is at the source of your question, we are certainly actively looking at markets in Australia and South Korea, we are not currently present in. And then markets that we are present in today that we like to be figure in, those includes India, Mainland China and the Philippines and we\u2019re in each of those markets and we\u2019d like to have more scale going forward.","So by far the most important thing is it is available, but those markets I indicated, we\u2019re very actively looking at transactions in. And so I think we\u2019ve said in our January Investor Day, at that time we have looked at 55 transactions over the previous two years and I think we have done three. At that time, that gives you a sense just in terms of your handicapping Jennifer that it tried to give precise dates because we tend to walk away from 95% of the things that we see using the criteria that I mentioned. But we are keenly focused on expanding our footprint and we will balance that versus repurchases to generate better returns.","Jennifer Dugan - Sterne Agee","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Hi. Great. Thanks. Glad you gave that ISO disclosure. That\u2019s great to have. I am just curious the slowdown that you guys talked about. Anything specific in there that drove the slowdown, maybe this quarter, and also just looking ahead, thinking about U.S. transaction growth, how should we benchmark that to say whatever these amounts, cards metrics or some of the other industry numbers out there, can we still assume you can grow at a premium, even with this sort of ISO trend?","David Mangum","We continue to say that -- I think that I can\u2019t point to any one thing, which is part of what I think we often talk about the large numbers relative to the ISO trend. I can\u2019t find any one specific thing when we analyze again 90 or so and how the pieces are coming together. I think if you look forward and you think of the businesses we are processing for APT and for PayPros and marry to the rest of the direct book, it\u2019s fair to expect those businesses to transact at a higher rate than market they are doing that today. They are growing faster than market whether you want to measure that on a revenue income or transactional basis unless you don\u2019t break it out. So you can\u2019t see it, I think you can imagine it\u2019s implicit in some of the numbers we report and that may give some color when you keep thinking about as we go forward with the ISO trend continues.","Jeff Sloan","I would add that Tien-tsin that of course our gaming business, the announcement that we made the other day which we are pleased to have additional business with Caesars. Our gaming business we believe today is growing more quickly than market and hopefully pro forma with Caesars than it -- we expect those rates to continue. So back to David\u2019s point, as you look at the very pieces of engines of growth that we have been investing in, at least in my opinion those businesses are growing in excess of the relative market rates.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Okay, that's good to know. I am just trying to think if we\u2019re sort of closer to the bottom with the six and it feels like with PayPros, we would be, but I guess we will take a view on that. Just my follow-up, just thinking about Canada pricing outlook, I think both Jeff, you and David said, spreads are fine and that the comps are coming up, I mean how is the pricing outlook or spread outlook look in Canada now?","Jeff Sloan","Yes. Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Jeff. I will start. Those spreads have been relatively stable, so we are very pleased with where the business is situated today. The most important thing in my opinion Tien-tsin is as we referred to our in prepared remarks, 5% credit transaction growth which is about the majority of how we get paid in Canada, it really provides a lot of opportunity and flexibility for us to grow that business normally going forward.","So as we said before, going back to Investor Day in January of \u201913, our focus really was on stabilizing Canada. As we have said in our guidance, we don\u2019t expect the 11% local currency growth in revenue to continue indefinitely. And in fact as I mentioned, the fourth quarter we anniversary that a bit, we start with mid single digit credit transaction growth. There is a lot we can do to affect the low single-digit revenue growth out of long-term that we gave you in January of 2013.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Okay. That\u2019s good to know. One more quick housekeeping, if you don\u2019t mind, unencumbered cash at this point now given on those buybacks and PayPros closed much forth. I think you said in the Q, what should we use as unencumbered cash?","Jeff Sloan","Yeah. We use that $318 million, Tien-tsin. If you just take a look at the balance sheet, it\u2019s a little bit illusory in that. We had their stage cash for the PayPros closed. We\u2019ve drawn down the debt, so it\u2019s look like $660 million or so in the balance sheet.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Right.","Jeff Sloan","So if you realize that three or four days later we closed PayPros, the number at the end of the quarter unencumbered available that you might add to the depth for total capacity is $300 million.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Got it. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Jeff Sloan ","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie","Great. Thank you. Hey, you really had a nice boost in the buyback. Any sense on another accelerated or opportunistic, just how we should think about the capital been put to work over the balance of this year?","David Mangum","Yeah. Sure, Kevin. It\u2019s David. I think that you should as always expect us to be routinely in market buying back stock. But I think we\u2019ve shown you that we move aggressively when we do give an authorization when we move forward to make a decision to buyback. We buyback aggressively and quickly, so nothing should surprise you as we look forward. Just remember further on the call, our 2014 expectations exclude any spend of that incremental authorization.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie","Got it. And then just in the ISO channels, over the course of time, do you have any target in terms of where that ultimately settles as a percentage of operating income as you kind of consolidate PayPros and APT in aggregate? Any sense of how we\u2019re thinking about that longer term? And is there any type sensitivity to what it would accrete to from a margin perspective based on becoming less concentrated, if you will?","Jeff Sloan","Yeah. I think in reverse order, the key to the margin is just in the first place having less of an ongoing headwind because it\u2019s growing, because the ISO channels formally grew faster than the rest of the channels, that\u2019s made a lot of difference, obviously combined with the healthier Canada. Those two alone are sort of the linchpins that then having the rest of the pieces of the sort of asset allocation pie really work well together. You think that the longer-term trends, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on direct distribution and things we control at the merchant relationship level.","We\u2019re going to continue to focus we believe on higher growing pieces of that asset. How the curves working at what rate ISOs move? Interestingly enough, we don\u2019t control. We hope our partners are widely successful in that and they continue to grow. They continue to grow for a very long time, but they will become we believe an ever shrinking piece of the overall pie of Global Payments. But we got a sense of their place in the pie now. We are comfortable where they are now in terms of being the minority of North America and the significant minority of total company.","So we have the pieces we can manage in much the same way Jeff described, being able to manage Canada, if we have solid credit transaction growth, we have things we can manage in Canada. Where the ISOs are now, they are great partners. They are good piece of the overall portfolio of Global Payments. From a direct-to-sell, we are investing in high-growth asset. So that curve should continue down in terms of their overall share. At what rate depends on how quickly we grow and how we quickly we acquire.","Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie","Understood. Thank you.","Jeff Sloan","Thank you","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Kwok with KBW.","Steven Kwok - KBW","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on the PayPros acquisition, I was just wondering how long does it typically take for you to integrate the acquisition? If we look back at APT, how long did that take?","David Mangum","Maybe, I\u2019ll start and Jeff will take over as well. I think that these are very different acquisitions. APT, it was a year and a half ago, as we sit here, was our first material foray into integrated payments. Now, we have bought another market leader in the same space. We have a unique opportunity to combine the best of both, whether you are talking about sales channels and sales approaches, how we go to market, how we serve customers, how customers see the technology, how the dentist offices interact with the technology, what it looks like, our partners integrate with it.","So that creates a more complex integration. Again, you are taking two $400 million acquisitions, combine them into the best of long-term and make one-on-one equal three Steven. And so that can take a little bit longer than when you buy a standalone business and you\u2019re talking about integrating, accounting and finance and HR, which can be done fairly quickly. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of work in front of us. It\u2019s the work we\u2019ve done before. It\u2019s where we are quite good at doing. And we\u2019ve got great energy and we\u2019re off to a great sale start you heard in Jeff\u2019s prepared comments from the combined entity. But there\u2019s a lot of work to do and recall, we just closed this most exactly a month ago.","Jeff Sloan","I would just add to it, David, that Steven that APT was one of our existing ISOs at the time. So by definition, while there are things certainly to be done, they were in general wasn\u2019t entirely true but it was mostly true, that they were on our platform using our systems et cetera. PayPros is not one of our existing ISOs prior to our acquisition about a month ago. So additional thing that David said, we also need to look at that when you think about the scope and the timing on an effective integration.","Steven Kwok - KBW","Got it. And then just a follow-up around the European environment. Today, we saw some headlines around the European Parliament voting around the payments proposals. Was curious about your thoughts of any potential impacts, whether it\u2019s -- does it bring some potential opportunities around the European marketplace for you? Thanks.","Jeff Sloan","Yeah. Steven, it is Jeff. I would say and I was just there for about a week and a half visiting our people and our partners in both in the U.K. and in Continental Europe. I would say that it\u2019s consistent with our features that in many of our markets including for these purposes, Europe and the EU, that interchange is likely to come down. So much of that legislation of course, if is addressed more squarely in interchange or in particular cross-border interchange.","I think that is not just consistent with our thesis but good news for us. As cost of acceptance decline, the demand for all products and services should increase. The fact that we own a number of markets across Europe makes our technology in operating environment even more attractive to potential merchant partners because many of these rates as you\u2019ve described are expressed as cross-border. So we really have that experience and have those people in market to drive additional demand for our products and services.","And then lastly, I would say, that from an M&A pipeline point of view, I think change is a good thing. But I think the markets changing. Additional complexity may drive a number of partners. We\u2019ve been talking to the potential partners to think about partnering with us in some of those markets that we\u2019ve been focusing on over time, as they try to figure out what these changes mean for their standalone businesses.","So while interchange is a pass-through for us, it doesn\u2019t impact us. Certainly, bank partnerships, it will impact the banks issuing businesses and those are conversations that we have. We were there in the last week and a half. So, I\u2019m probably a bit more optimistic sitting here today, having been through first that trip at second reading about where the EU is and where this is on that topic about our ability to find more partnerships in parts of Europe that were not physically present today.","Steven Kwok - KBW","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jeff Sloan","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Dahms with Baird. Adam Dahms, your line is open.","Jeff Sloan","Operator, why don\u2019t we go into the next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom McCrohan with Janney.","Tom McCrohan - Janney","All right. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, guys.","Jeff Sloan","Hey, Tom.","Tom McCrohan - Janney","Can you give us your view on how the ISO industry will evolve over the next several years given merchant acquisition, merchant underwriting appears to be migrating quickly through technology providers, either no tablet solution providers, X square and shopkeeper or Integrated Point Of Sale providers such as accelerated PayPros and Mercury?","Jeff Sloan","Tom, it\u2019s Jeff. So, of course, I think you hit the nail on the head. We have, of course, share of that thesis. So the last $850 million of acquisition that we\u2019ve done in the company were in PayPros, APT and CyberSource in that order. And the common thing among the three was technology-enabled distributions with additionally attractive margins. So we obviously share the thrust of what you described.","I think at the other day if you look out three to five years now, Tom, I think that mobility and tablets and integrated solutions are certainly going to be a very big part of what the industry does globally especially here in the United States. But I think there is always going to be a market for traditional ISOs in that business.","I think you are likely to see additional business models evolve over time but the quality of the application matters as much as what tablet device that you are selling. So I think for us and our peers becoming more of a software, I think, would become technology services company today but becoming more of a software provider was important that we have our own proprietary applications to drive acceptance at the point of sale.","I think our business model incorporating not just transactional or basis point fees but also incorporating software-as-a-service type fees as an addition are all very important things for us and our partner than the ISOs to do in our business. But I always think it is going to be a good business for what our ISOs, our 90 active ISOs do today going forward.","Now as David described, I think that will be a very healthy viable business but I do think there maybe impacts around the rates of growth in that business. So to go back to what we described this quarter, prior quarters, where we\u2019re investing, where I sort out the answer is that areas that we think because we are technology enabled has better than market rates of growth.","And I would answer it as that\u2019s where we see the growth, the incremental growth coming from but there will still be growth in the ISO businesses. But I do think that those would be slowing and that\u2019s the fact that you\u2019ve seen in the last three or four quarters as we\u2019ve been describing our ISO business in our earnings calls.","Tom McCrohan - Janney","Okay. I just got a quick follow-up. Could you, Jeff or David, just give a quick update on your relationship or partnership with ShopKeep and how\u2019s that progressing? Thanks.","Jeff Sloan","I\u2019ll talk about that Tom. So we are very pleased about partnership with ShopKeep. We have deployed ShopKeep here in the United States and I\u2019d add beyond that, that we have tablet providers as well as mobile and dongle providers, in some cases our own in many of our markets around the world. So it\u2019s really a U.S. conversation with ShopKeep but its a worldwide conversation as it relates to our own dongle and five markets in Asia and as it relates to our partnerships with Intuit and PayPal mobile for example in the U.K.","So ShopKeep is a very important element of that. We\u2019re selling that through our own website here in the U.S. We are very pleased with how that\u2019s progressing. But to go back to your first question, I think that will be part of this solution but I don\u2019t think that will be the only solution if we look out three to five years in terms of how we distribute our products going forward.","Tom McCrohan - Janney","Thank you.","Jeff Sloan","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Incorporated","Thank you. Congratulations guys on the quarter.","David Mangum","Thanks.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Incorporated","And especially appreciate the clarity around Global\u2019s evolving strategy here going forward. You guys provide a lot of qualitative detail on PayPros integration . Could you quantify perhaps what it means in terms of specifics with regards to what should we expect in dollar terms over the next 12 months?","David Mangum","Ashwin, it\u2019s David. It\u2019s hard to be a lot more specific than we\u2019ve been. So let\u2019s start with how we think it\u2019s incrementing into the fourth quarter and than we can speak a little bit more about the characteristics of the asset itself. So we talked about is on the order $25 million of incremental revenue coming in for fourth quarter than we had for the bulk of the quarter.","We talked about it coming in earnings in neutral as we get started owning the asset. That includes the idea of integration expenses offsetting fundamental profitability in the business that operates at a higher margin than Global Payments in total. As we go forward, we expect that margin to increase certainly over the longer-to-medium term. I appreciate you giving the opportunity to give a longer term answer to this question.","Over the course of 50, we have more integration expenses continue to operate the business. You have a double-digit revenue growth at higher margins in Global Payments, again pre the integration conversation and at margins we expect to expand over the next one, two, three years.","So quite frankly yet what we expect is something that performs quite like APT did, come in as a nice grower, enhance the growth and combined the best of the two businesses in the Global Payments, enhance it again and drive incrementally stronger and stronger margins over time. Again -- as Jeff just said moment ago our thesis technology-enabled distribution growing faster than market with sustainable competitive advantage.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Incorporated","Got it. Could you also talk about the outlook for the traction of products like DCC. Can that continue to be a tailwind and what else is added to the pipeline that kick in, sort of, keep adding to that?","David Mangum","Yes. Sure. So maybe building on, Jeff described increasing software applications. Jeff described the tablet applications that may reach other types of merchants over the longer term either directly or via partnerships. You mentioned DCC. It\u2019s a great example. DCC to this day is still not fully rolled out in all of our markets around the world. It\u2019s been very successful, as you well know in Asia. It\u2019s been very successful in Spain. It\u2019s just starting out in North America. It\u2019s just starting out in the United Kingdom for example.","So that\u2019s an opportunity, more installment payment plan is an opportunity. The Web in a box solutions for small-to-medium sized merchants around the world, an opportunity which is rolling out now as you know we have -- we have an uncapped opportunity in e-Commerce, in our own customer base and in our target customer base around the world for small-to-medium sized merchants. And if you would go around market by market, we think there is opportunity in each market for new products, specific to each of those markets.","Finally, I think I might add to that although it\u2019s not a product, certainly given the breadth of our solutions and our scope across Europe, fundamental change, interchanging cost structure of Europe, from an interchange in a regulatory procedures, opportunity for company like ourselves which has the domestic presence but the ability to go cross border as well.","And then as you well know, we see significant growth in our e-Commerce solutions but we\u2019re partnering with other folks like the PayPal around the world. So more and more of that are coming in, other network solutions are coming to market that should create broader acceptance for some of the networks that aren\u2019t Visa and Mastercard over the medium-to-longer term as well. That should be rolled out in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom over the next year or two as well.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Incorporated","And that\u2019s very useful. Thank you.","David Mangum","Thank you.","Operator","We will take the last question from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey David, I guess, the first one would be housekeeping for you as we think about cash, even margin in North America accounting for PayPros. Do you know what the angle or what the quarterly amortization addback might look like? Have you gotten that far yet?","Jeff Sloan","No , we really haven\u2019t Andrew. In fact, having just closed it, we\u2019re just getting started on what first accounting analysis will look like. So I really don\u2019t have a number for you for that one yet.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","Okay. But suffice to say, it\u2019s not dilutive to margin anyway, right? You have been pretty clear about that?","David Mangum","We can\u2026","Jeff Sloan","Sure.","David Mangum","\u2026elaborate on cash margin. So on that front, yes. When you add in whatever first accounting is going to be, when you get the GAAP, that\u2019s the part that I can\u2019t answer right now.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","Right. Okay. And integration, you are going to call that out or is that going to be part of your sort of, just all rolled up into your report as cash segment in the margin?","David Mangum","Yes. Coupled with -- let me draw a distinction because you have raised a really good question. The general sort of T&E and things like that and the odd consulting and things like that, those are the kinds of integration expenses that are going to hold down the incremental cash profitability of PayPros, initially as we go through the integration process. Let me park that for a second, the other side of integration, the severance and those kinds of things that will be called out as one-time charges.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","Got it. Okay. So, ongoing sort of work its way in your reported results.","Jeff Sloan","Yes. And thanks for allowing me to clarify that.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","Okay. And then, Jeff, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, [quoting] integrated solutions rest of world, I think what you said was Canada specifically. Could you elaborate on that a little bit, just as far as market structure and whether there are any investments or go-to market changes we\u2019ll have to make to gain traction with integrated or more direct solutions rest of world?","Jeff Sloan","Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Andrew. So we now see here today that we had entered Canada with our APT integrated solutions offering, so the answer to your question narrowly and I will come back more broadly in the thesis is yes. We had to do a fair amount of customization for APT\u2019s product suite for example for EMV, which of course is coming to United States on October 5 of 2015 but already exist today in Canada. We also had to make adjustments to the APT product suite for in RAC, which as you know is specific to Canada and is a big chunk of the Canadian market but that type of debit is very different here in the United States and different in other markets.","So if we go back to the way we described the APT at our last Investor Day in January of 2013, we think and really our business case was predicated at the time around capturing a lot more of the U.S. market and as we said, we believe we were less than 10% penetrated in the revenue opportunity of the U.S. market at the time. We probably also said, they were far less than 10% penetrated of markets outside the United States. Canada being the most obvious adjacent market and was very important to us strategically although not for the business case, but strategically to expand that business outside the United States, because we think we are early in the U.S., but we believe we are very early in markets outside the United States.","So, we\u2019ve had folks selling into the value-added resellers and enterprise software channel in all of our market for probably a couple of years now, including in Canada. So, we know that sales proposition can be very attractive in those markets, but we didn\u2019t have as some of the product suite that we needed to offer world-class products and services into those new territories. So the importance of APT going into Canada is not only, do we already have sales in that market, but now we have something to sell that we think is sufficiently distinctive, that it should drive additional growth revenue and profitability.","So, I know that, our folks at APT and our folks at Canada here at the company are very excited about doing that. We of course are also looking at other markets around the world including Europe, Asia and Latin America to see whether those markets are next now that we\u2019ve brought APT into Canada. So to a certain extent, we are very pleased with how we are doing with APT as you know, but there would be a bit of shame on us if we looked out five years from now and we didn\u2019t take that model and do that everything that we could do given our multi-national footprint outside of our home markets.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Andrew.","David Mangum","Thanks, Andrew.","Jeff Sloan","Thank you very much, operator and thank you for everyone for dialing into our third quarter earnings call on behalf of Global Payments.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference will be recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane Elliott","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Global Payments Fiscal 2015 third quarter conference call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour. Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and Form 10-Q. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.","In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures, such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these measures more clearly reflect comparative operating performance. For a full reconciliation of cash earnings and other non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning, and our trended financial highlights, both of which are available in the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now, I\u2019d like to introduce Jeff Sloan. Jeff?","Jeff Sloan","Thank you, Jane. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are delighted to report another quarter of strong financial performance while growing right through significant unfavorable currency movements.","Reported revenue growth for the quarter was 8%, 13% on a constant currency basis. In addition, cash earnings per share grew 19% and margins expanded 80 basis points, solid performance by any measure.","Our U.S. business again delivered robust results, led by our direct channels which generated double-digit organic revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. Importantly, U.S. organic revenue growth accelerated from the prior two sequential quarters and it will also continue to achieve steady performance in local currency, resulting from the consistent business fundamentals and good execution.","Our international results exceeded our expectations in local currency across our markets with the exception of Russia. Asia produced another quarter of consistent revenue growth with particular strength in the Philippines and Singapore. In Europe, we continue to benefit from solid transaction growth and market based pricing changes in our Spanish business.","In addition, Global Solutions continues to see strong ecommerce revenue growth. We believe that our ecommerce and omni-channel payment solutions provide us with a differentiated value proposition in an increasingly dynamic international payments market. In that context, we are especially pleased with the acquisition of Realex Payments announced in March. Realex Payments is a leading ecommerce and payment gateway technology provider in Europe, delivering a wide range of payment solutions to merchants. This is a favorable time to invest in our European businesses as the region moves to a single European payment area.","Merchants are increasingly seeking more comprehensive regional and worldwide payment solutions. The Realex Payments transaction represents a strategic investment in our international ecommerce capabilities, immediately enhancing our products targeted to the digital space. It also strengthens the foundation of our international omni-channel solutions by allowing us to combine Realex Payments gateway and payment service provision technology with our worldwide merchant acquiring expertise and footprint.","Over the last two and a half years, we\u2019ve invested approximately $1.2 billion in technology driven payment services through the acquisitions of APT, PayPros, Ezidebit and now Realex Payments. These transactions have advanced our strategy to expand differentiated distribution and further develop market-leading, innovative products and services.","Realex Payments is a logical next step in expanding and controlling our technological edge. We believe the successful execution of our strategies will continue to set us apart from our competitors. We are particularly pleased to continue to return capital to shareholders while also significantly increasing our growth potential for the future.","Now, I will turn over the call to Cameron.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. I am also very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter, particularly in light of the significant foreign currency translation headwinds we experienced.","Total company revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 grew to $667 million, reflecting 8% growth over fiscal 2014 and cash operating margins expanded 80 basis points to 19%. Diluted cash earnings per share increased 19% over the prior year to $1.14. On a constant currency basis, total company cash operating margins expanded by 140 basis points. Importantly, foreign currency impacts for the quarter were more significant than we forecasted at the time of our last earnings call, in January. Relative to our foreign currency expectations at that time, revenues for the third quarter would have been $680 million and cash earnings per share would have been $0.04 higher.","Our core business again demonstrated strength during the quarter even after normalizing for the additions of PayPros and Ezidebit. Assuming we own the PayPros and Ezidebit businesses in our current and prior year third quarters, or normalizing for their effect, total company revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 7% for the quarter.","North America segment results were impressive with revenue growth for the quarter of 10% and margin expansion of 40 basis points. On a constant currency basis, North American margins expanded by 90 basis points. These results were driven by U.S. revenue growth of 14% which continues to benefit from strong organic performance in our direct channels. On a normalized basis, organic U.S. revenue growth was 5% for the quarter consisting of 15% growth in our direct channel and no growth in our ISO channel. Local currency revenue growth in Canada was 4% for the third quarter, ahead of our expectations. However, Canada revenue in U.S. dollars declined 6%, as a result of an unfavorable currency exchange rate.","International segment revenue growth was 4% for the quarter in U.S. dollars with margin expansion of 310 basis points. On a constant currency basis, Europe revenue growth for the quarter in U.S. dollars was 12%, while reported results declined 3% as a result of exceptionally unfavorable currency exchange rates, particularly for the euro. This performance continues to be fuelled by strength in Spain and our ecommerce channel, offset by underperformance in our Russian business. Asia Pacific revenue grew 24%, driven by stable organic growth trends in line with our expectations in the Ezidebit acquisition. ","International cash operating income grew 13% for the quarter, including the impact of significant foreign currency headwinds. These results continue to reflect strong local currency revenue growth, prudent expense management across the regions and the addition of Ezidebit.","We generated approximately $107 million of free cash flow this quarter, which we define as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, plus capital expenditures in distributions to non-controlling interests. Capital expenditures totaled $23 million for the quarter and our total available cash including working capital was approximately $232 million at the end of the quarter.","Lastly, we repurchased a total of approximately 640,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $57 million. Since the end of the quarter, we have repurchased an additional 445,000 shares for approximately $41 million, bringing our total fiscal year-to-date share repurchases to $270 million. We now have $202 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. As noted in our release this morning, we intend to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program this month to purchase an additional upto $100 million of our common stock.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn to our expectations for fiscal 2015. Notwithstanding the significant incremental impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, we are reaffirming our revenue outlook for the full fiscal year and expect reported revenue to grow 8% to 10% and range from $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion. Based on current rate assumptions, we would expect full year revenue to trend towards the lower end of this range solely due to foreign currency translation as revenue continues to exceed our expectations in local currency. We are particularly pleased to be raising our cash earnings per share expectations yet again to a range $4.77 to $4.84, reflecting growth of 16% to 18%. We also now expect core cash operating margins to expand by as much as 60 basis points in fiscal 2015 with margin expansion in both our North America and international segments.","These expectations reflect current rate assumptions would suggest some modest further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As usual, our cash earnings per share expectations only reflect share repurchases that have been completed prior to this call and do not include any impact from the anticipated accelerated share repurchase program that we announced today. We expect this program to add approximately $0.01 per share to our cash earnings per share estimates for the full year.","We currently have approximately $750 million of capacity to fund future initiatives including approximately $500 million of availability on our corporate credit facility after taking into account the Realex Payments transaction that closed late last month. As a reminder, we expect the FIS and BPI transactions to close towards the end of our fiscal 2015 and we intend to fund these acquisitions from operating cash flows and do not expect them to have a significant impact on our near-term capital allocation plans or facility availability.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thank you, Cameron. We are delighted to yet again raise guidance for the reminder of our fiscal 2015, reflecting our relentless focus on financial execution and a successful implementation of our growth strategies. As we look to fiscal 2016, we see positive momentum in our businesses as we expand technology enabled distribution and reposition Global Payments to a unified worldwide operating company.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jane.","Jane Elliott","Before we go to the question-and-answer session, I\u2019d like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up, in order to accommodate everyone in the queue.","Thank you. And operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Bryan Keane","My question is just around the International margins; they continue to impress; they\u2019re better than what we expected. It sounds like it\u2019s more of the same ecommerce in Spain. How do we think about the margins going forward and as we carry over to fiscal year \u201816, obviously there has been some regulatory changes. Just like to get your latest thoughts on how much the increase or the upside in International margins can continue as we go forward here.","Cameron Bready","This is Cameron. I\u2019ll start and then ask Jeff to provide any more color that he would like to on the topic. So, I think International margins, as you look at them for the quarter, they were up 310 basis points. The first thing to take into account is FX. So bear in mind from an international point of view, given the weakness we\u2019ve seen in foreign currencies, it actually increases to some degree the margin for the quarter. So, on a constant currency basis, margins were still up handsomely, roughly 240 basis points but not quite the 310 that we printed.","As it relates to looking forward, I think our expectations remain of a view that frankly International margins should remain relatively stable at these levels going forward. We have seen some benefit in this year as it relates to the reduction of interchange in Spain. But obviously as we sit here today, we anticipate incremental benefit in FY16 with the changes in EU legislation around interchange rates that will be a positive benefit for the International margins as well even as we annualize the impacts in Spain. So, I think our general view is we would expect the margin profile for International remain relatively consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the course of FY15 because of some of the benefits we expect to see in Europe as well as the increment that will be provided by the transactions we\u2019ve executed this year Ezidebit, Realex Payments et cetera that will be beneficial to margins long-term.","Jeff Sloan","I would just add that Bryan by saying that since our last call, the EU has adopted in March the [cluster] [ph] and domestic regulations that we\u2019ve been now talking about but they are not in effect yet; we would expect a benefit in fiscal \u201816 in our European business, in particular Bryan in our United Kingdom business. So, I think we have two tailwinds as it relates to our European business, in particular heading into \u201816; one is as Cameron said that Spain won\u2019t analyze until the second fiscal quarter for us, so I will come back to that in a second. And the second benefit is probably in the back half of the year when EU rules are fully implemented, we\u2019ll see a benefit as well primarily from our UK related business prior to Realex from a similar lowering of interchange cross-border as well as domestically.","I will say as you said before that in case of Durbin, we\u2019d assume by way of analogy with the Durbin pricing changes in the United States that those diminishes oil pricing actions due over time. I think as we said to you Bryan and others that we were positively surprised by the duration of the pricing benefit coming out of interchange reductions here in United States around half the volume; those persisted for longer than we would have expected. So while we will of course annualize in September, sort of our second quarter benefits in Spain, I would say if it follows the Durbin like trend to extrapolate that we don\u2019t expect a full attrition of that spread action to begin in September, instead it\u2019s more of an annualization rather than a diminution of the spread benefit.","Bryan Keane","And then my follow-up question, just looking at the guidance for revenue, you guys are still reiterating guidance, but it\u2019s a wide range given we only have one quarter left. I got it at about 1% to 8% revenue growth; you\u2019re saying probably towards the lower end of the range. My math says, there is probably about six points of FX headwinds in there. And then I know PayPros, the acquisition has anniversaried. So just trying to think about some of the puts and takes between FX and acquisitions. I guess Ezidebit still there and does Realex ramp up and what\u2019s the latest on the FIS gaming business and when that ramps up? Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Yes, Bryan, it\u2019s Cameron. I\u2019ll start. I think the simplest way to think about guidance for the remainder of the year as it relates to revenue is look at some of the color we\u2019ve provided in the script. If you go back to our expectations for FX in January, we then utilize those same FX rates for Q3, we would have reported revenue at around $680 million, so roughly $13 million higher than what we recorded actually for Q3. And that reflected probably about half of quarter of impact from the weaker foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar. So if you assume a full quarter of that in Q4, just doing simple math that would bring the total FX headwind in the back half of the year to roughly $40 million. But if you take that off at the high end of our guidance of 2.8, it kind of puts you at 2.76, which again is towards the lower end of our guidance range.","So, we think all else being equal but for FX, we would have been at the high end of our guidance range, roughly to $2.8 billion, but FX is really driving us down and it\u2019s still a fairly wide range, but still driving us down towards the lower end of that range as we sit here today.","You\u2019re correct that PayPros does annualize in Q4. We do have the addition of Ezidebit that is helpful. As we\u2019ve said at the time we did the Realex transaction, we expected to be [immaterial] [ph] really to Q4 and full fiscal \u201815 results. So it\u2019s really a function of PayPros annualizing in Q4 and incremental FX headwinds that we anticipate that\u2019s going to bring us towards the lower end of our guidance range as we sit here today that is our expectation.","Bryan Keane","And just any timing on when you expect the FIS gaming business start to ramp?","Cameron Bready","Yes, we expect it to close towards the end of the fiscal year; so, we\u2019re not really anticipating any benefit in fiscal \u201815 for that transaction. So we would expect to have essentially a full year of impact in FY16.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Matt Roswell","It\u2019s actually Matt Roswell sitting in for Dan. Question on the Realex acquisition; what percentage of their transactions do you currently process and is there an opportunity to move those transactions on your system going forward?","Jeff Sloan","It\u2019s Jeff. So on Realex, we have been a large partner of theirs since 2012, selling their gateway services with our acquiring under the label of global IRS which is what we were calling it. We represented about 20% of Realex\u2019s business at the time that we purchase Realex in the last week or so in March. I give you that detail because we were already doing the acquiring for the business that we were referring in Matt, to Realex. So, I don\u2019t think that there is a substantial additional benefit on that acquiring piece, but I just described because we\u2019re already doing it, so in other words we\u2019re using their gateway in doing our acquiring. I think the benefit and the reasons we thought Realex to be a very attractive strategic investment were number one for us to be able to offer that bundled service in a way that we own the economics, not just of the acquiring, but also of the gateway on a bundled basis. We thought it was a very attractive and believe is a very interactive investment to make, number one.","Number two, increasingly innovation is a kind of the gateway layer. So for us to make sure that we preserve the point of interaction with our customer, when customers are making choices, they are making choices on the front end about innovation, products and services. And as part of a bundled package, our ability to control the point of distribution much like we\u2019ve done here in our other markets through our integrated channel, our ability to innovate and control the point of distribution as a key competitive sales edge. And we thought over time, it\u2019s more important to own that more than anything else.","And then lastly, as we said in our releases, as the world moves and we move to a more of an omni-channel dilution set which is to say [indiscernible] card not present which is Realex\u2019s focus as well as a card present solution and our ability to provide our distribution with their technology, we think also is a point of competitive differentiation in omni-channel environment. So Matt, that\u2019s really how we thought about the strategy around Realex.","Matt Roswell","Okay. And if I could ask follow-up, can you give us an update on moving some of the integrated businesses up to Canada?","Jeff Sloan","Sure. I\u2019ll start and then David, I\u2019ll ask David to provide to a little bit more detail. So, I think one of the competitive advantages that we have globally at Global Payments is our multinational footprint and our ability to take successful models from one market into another market, given the scope of worldwide acceptance that we have, really that it\u2019s a part. Just outside Realex one of the rationales behind Realex was to continue expand it into other markets in Europe that Realex was not present with our distribution and these were very similar pieces on integrated. David, do you want to comment on that?","David Mangum","Yes, I\u2019m happy to. You\u2019ve put your finger on important growth initiative for us for 2016 and beyond. In particular, we are starting with Canada for expansion of integrated out of the U.S. so, what we will also be expanding integrated business we have in Australia across Asia over the course of time as well where it applies. Specifically in Canada, we have a dedicated sales force. We\u2019ve signed a number of partners and are certifying a number of partners. Although a bit in infancy in terms of the stage of business, we are very excited about the opportunity of being the first source to bring integrated payments at scale of the market with our unique global footprint. So, we will be starting with Canada; look for more news on this as we head into 2016 and beyond. But dedicated sales force, real partners now out selling as we speak and the same unique bundle of ecosystem of partners generating leads, us generating close and then driving that kind of mid-teens growth you use to see in the United States from the open edge business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. You may begin.","Dave Koning","My first question, just North American margins were up pretty nicely, I think 40 basis points year-over-year. And that\u2019s one of the better of the past many years. I\u2019m wondering, you talked about ISO is being flat and direct growing nicely. Is that mostly just a mix shift function or are the margins actually within direct business going up year-over-year as well and that contributing to the lift. And if so, is that pretty sustainable; do you expect that business to keep expanding margins?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, this is Jeff. I\u2019ll start and Cameron will add some more color on the financial aspect of what you asked. I would say in my opinion, it is sustainable; this is part of the strategic shift that we\u2019ve been making over the last two and half years. I\u2019ve referenced in my comments the $1.2 billion of investments we\u2019ve made. The first two pieces of that about $800 million were in APT and PayPros.","If you think about what we\u2019ve been trying to accomplish here strategically and you\u2019re seeing the results is having right people in the right places with the right distribution model. So, if you look at the way organic revenue growth, it really about the whole fiscal year and accelerating days into this quarter as I said in my remarks which receives our direct book which includes open edge but is not limited to it, really accelerating to organic revenue growth to mid double digit as Cameron described in his remarks this quarter, which importantly gave us acceleration over the previous two quarters growth in the low double digit, number one.","Number two, while open edge is obviously a big part of that and very good margins, I don\u2019t want to sort of change or direct business outside of open edge; it\u2019s a very good performance this fiscal year and excellent performance this quarter, Dave in our direct book, direct channels and in our gaming related businesses and our bank related businesses, all well in excess of market rates of growth. And Dave as you know those generally come in at much higher margins in our overall corporate margin and certain in our ISO margin. So, I would say, looking at this strategically Dave, this is what the combination of two and half years of investment, very good and consistent execution this fiscal year but really an acceleration this quarter of the trends that we saw in our direct business not only open edge but direct book more generally versus what we\u2019ve seen earlier in the year. Cameron, do you want to comment on some of the specific margins?","Cameron Bready","Sure, I\u2019ll just give a little more color commentary around it Dave. You correctly highlighted margins in North America were up 40 basis points for the quarter. I would also note that was 90 on a constant currency bases. So even that 40 was laid down by fairly significant FX headwinds from Canada, as you know many of expenses associated with that business are in U.S. dollars; revenues are reported in Canadian dollars. So, we absorbed roughly 50 basis points of impact from FX from Canada in that North America reported numbers. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s particularly impressive results when you factor in that aspect as well. There obviously is going to be a little bit of mix shift in there also if you correctly highlight it. But I think fundamentally what\u2019s really driving that is our success in executing on our direct distribution strategy, the contributions at open edge, the combined platform of APT and PPI are bringing to the business as well as I\u2019d say improvement in the overall momentum around just a core direct channel business that we have in the U.S. market.","David Mangum","Dave, this is David. I would like to add a little more color, the same thing these guys are saying but in a slightly different way. Remember the way the model works, we need a stable Canada regardless of FX and we need execution in the U.S. business; they\u2019re executing very, very well. When we turn this to mix shift, just note this is conscious mix shift we\u2019ve been working on driving for the last two and half years as Jeff pointed out. Quite frankly, what\u2019s going beautifully is the slowdown the ISO channel is demonstrating to you what the rest of business can do.","Dave Koning","And just my brief follow-up, your guidance kind of implies sequential EPS of kind of flattish to up $0.07 I\u2019d think; and historically you\u2019ve grown $0.10 or more sequentially in Q4. And maybe you can help just a little bit what\u2019s the difference this year than the last few years?","Cameron Bready","Yes, I think the primary difference Dave is going to be FX. So, if you look at the impact that we bore in Q3, as I mentioned earlier, was about a half a quarter of impact. But the significant decline particularly in euro and the Canadian dollar kind of in that January, February timeframe. So we absorbed mainly half a quarter of those in Q3. We expect sitting here today based on our rate assumptions for Q4 to have a full quarter of impact of certainly a stronger dollar relative to the Canadian dollar, the euro and the pound primarily. And that\u2019s driving incremental FX headwinds in Q4 that we have to absorb relative to Q3. So I would say on a constant currency basis, you would have seen growth or would expect growth in the same sort of magnitude that we traditionally produced between Q3 and Q4, but the impacts of FX are weighing that down slightly in Q4 relative to Q3.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan. You may begin.","Tien-tsin Huang","I wonder in terms of U.S. ISO business, just how that came in versus plan and any change from large ISO partners in general?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Jeff. The ISO business was pretty much on plan. I think as you laid out, in July of 2014, looking at fiscal \u201815, we thought it was going to be a low to no growth business which our guide for the year. And it\u2019s been pretty much, Tien-tsin, low single-digit that\u2019s just about flat to the first couple of quarters of this year. So, if you look at the year in entire, Tien-tsin, there is really no difference. And as it relates to rest of our partners, also no difference on the ISO side, so really, Tien-tsin, nothing that is changed.","Cameron Bready","Actually, Tien-tsin, we\u2019re within almost dollars of the full year budget as we sit here today.","Tien-tsin Huang","And then just on Realex, it sounds like a good acquisition given everything you\u2019ve said. Can you give us some idea on growth in revenue margin? I know they do about 28 billion [ph] in volume or so. And I am curious just why now; I get the strategic side of it, but why now? I know that EU regulation is coming through. Does that motivate some of the timing on this deal; just kind of understand a little bit better? Thank you.","Jeff Sloan","I\u2019ll start and then Cameron I think will comment on the financials around Realex. So, I think you\u2019re right in what you said. We said at the time of the deal and also in my prepared remarks this morning, we think now is a very favorable time to invest in our European businesses.","First, the regulatory changes that you alluded to: As you said a number of times, it\u2019s probably nothing but good news, some cost come down for our customers and our potential customers; so we benefit directly at Global Payments or not that really is good news for us, number one. Number two, if you think about what the EU is trying to accomplish in a single European payment area, put aside interchange for a second, I think the thesis is that this is a common market. And our ability to offer acceptance in an omni-channel environment regardless of how the transaction comes into us and all those markets, really leverages the breadth of the distribution that we have if card not present as well as card present along with the technology that Realex has, particularly in a card not present environment.","Of course as said as we look at deals around the world, there is a lot of things that go into the calculus but it\u2019s not lost on us, the reverse of what Cameron has said about the impact on our results, it\u2019s not lost on us that the pound and the euro and other currencies are relative low versus the dollar. So, as we look at making investment decisions, the idea that we can look at various markets on the acquisition side to take advantage of what we believe to be dislocations in exchange rates we\u2019re making long-term investments is something that we also take into consideration from a timing point of view and place into notion that it\u2019s a favorable time the investing in those businesses.","Cameron, do you want to talk about the financials?","Cameron Bready","Sure. So Realex comes into our business at margins that are better than our total company average today. Its revenue is roughly half the size of that of Ezidebit, a little less than half the size of Ezidebit. Maybe important thing to recognize is t hat Realex going back to Jeff\u2019s comments; this is a perfect time to be buying that business because it\u2019s fantastic technology that needs distribution. And what we bring to the equation is leveraging our distribution. So as we grow and expand and utilize that technology in our business is going forward margins for that business will scale very nicely over the course of time as we\u2019re able to leverage their technology through our distribution network without significant incremental investment to do it, you\u2019re going to see a margin profile for that business on a standalone basis that really scales nicely as we continue to leverage this technology through our sales distribution network in Europe on both the UK domestic market as well as our omni-channel, omni-solutions business that\u2019s based in UK as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Georgios Mihalos of Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Georgios Mihalos","Jeff, you mentioned several times that this is a great time to be investing in Europe. And I am just curious what the outlook is there for more bank joint ventures going forward versus trade-up acquisitions. And as you think of all the different regions you\u2019re investing in, would you say that Europe, the opportunity in Europe is now sort of at the top of the heat compared to Asia and in the U.S.?","Jeff Sloan","Yes Georgios, let me start with that second question first. As I said before, we\u2019re opportunistic but the most important thing in our corporate development pipeline is that something actually be actionable and be for sales. So to understand Georgios, we have a view on the market which I\u2019ll go through again in a minute but it needs to be actionable and attractive for us to move ahead. So we\u2019re thankful we\u2019ve been able to close four transactions in the last six months and hopefully more to come.","As it relates to the bank JV part, the first part of what you said, we do see a lot of activity in Europe coming through the SEPA like regulations and the lowering of interchange on the JV side with financial institutions in Europe in particular; we don\u2019t see as much movement around the rest of the world. And we are engaged in discussions like that in a number of markets in Continental Europe. But it does require that we find the right partner; it does require, Georgios, those returns look favorable compared to our benchmark recurrence which is really investing ourselves by buying back our stock.","You include the ASR [ph] that we announced this morning, we had either bought back or committed to buy back or are going to commit to buy back almost $370 million this year. So, it\u2019s a balance between the two of them. I certainly hope that we will be able to announce additional JVs as we did with Bank of the Philippines particularly in Europe, in the coming months. So, it\u2019s very dependent on the facts of the returns and who the partners really are. I don\u2019t expect as a point of matter, those transactions to be sizeable uses of capital. I think they\u2019re important to us strategically. I think they fit thesis of what we\u2019ve been describing. But those transactions in general are not things that are material to our leverage members.","Georgios Mihalos","Okay, great; appreciate that color. And then, may be just to shift gears on the U.S. side, I think you mentioned the direct and aggregate has grown 15%; I think it was plus 12% last quarter, so a nice acceleration there. Within there, can you call out the growth in open edge specifically? I think that was grown high teens. Has that accelerated even further?","David Mangum","Georgios, this is David. We don\u2019t call up the pieces specifically; you do recall correctly. That is growing mid to high teens; that has continued at that pace. The integration is going very well and we are very happy with the progress; there is a leadership there. I would also point out and Jeff mentioned earlier, just because I feel the need to do it. The rest of the U.S. channels are executing very well; we\u2019re seeing double digit growth in gaming, we\u2019re seeing strong growth in the core direct card channel; all the pieces are really executing quite well right now.","Georgios Mihalos","And then last thing. Did you guys call out the transaction growth in Spain this quarter? I think you have in the past; I\u2019m not sure if I caught it this time around.","Cameron Bready","We did not call it out specifically in our prepared remarks. But it was high single digit, low double digit range again. I think it was 13 last quarter; it was probably 9 to 10 this quarter. So again very good organic execution in Spain coupled with again the continuing benefit of the lower interchanges really driving the performance in that market.","Operator","Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. You may begin.","Michael Landau","Hi, this is Michael Landau. First question, I was just wondering if you could call out the transaction growth and revenue for transaction growth for this quarter for the U.S. and Canada.","Cameron Bready","Transaction growth in Canada again has been relatively consistent throughout the year and this quarter again it\u2019s going to be in that low single digit range which is fairly much in line with what we saw in Q2 as well as Q1. In U.S., I think we had transaction growth of roughly 2%; it\u2019s 10% again for the direct business weighed down by the ISO of business. So overall growth was roughly 2% which again consistent with our earlier comments around revenue growth, driven by strong growth in our direct-channel and roughly 10%, weighed down by the ISO channel that was actually in Europe.","Michael Landau","And can you quantify just overall unit pricing trend in each of the sales channels, ISO direct and open edge in the U.S. and as well as just generally pricing trends in Canada?","David Mangum","The core answer is they\u2019re very stable; there is very little change in unit pricing trends within open edge but it will change in the direct channels in United States; almost no change in Canada. And as you keep going around the world, you\u2019d find very little change absent obviously the interchange driven spread changes that you find in Spain. What we find right now really around the world is very stable conditions really talking about unit pricing, average tickets themselves that drive them volume and obviously Canada is going to do some of the transaction trends. So again stable conditions, really positive conditions underlying the business itself as we go market by market, which again has enabled the level of execution you\u2019re seeing around the world.","Michael Landau","And the 26% tax rate was a bit lower than previous; is that a sustainable rate going forward?","Cameron Bready","No, I think we still expect the tax rate to be roughly 27% or crossing 27% for the full year, so a little bit lower in Q3 but I think our full year expectations around tax rate remain relatively consistent with our commentary to last quarter, which is in the 27% range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. You may begin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So, I guess my first question is with regards to Europe. Can you share what sort of assumptions you have with regards to transaction volume or purchase volume lift that you might assume because of SEPA? And this sort of speaks to several of the comment that you have had with regards to more JVs, with regards to the Realex acquisition and so on and so forth. I mean in terms of just breaking out how you might look geographically say one to two years down the road, I just wanted to understand the breakout of the business that you\u2019re aiming for?","Jeff Sloan","Sure. Ashwin, it\u2019s Jeff and I\u2019ll start. The way I think about Realex for example in terms of the opportunity across Europe, before I get to the SEPA question, is that we think that the card not present market is growing across Western Europe in particular which is what we\u2019re primarily focused in that business in the mid double-digit to high double-digit range and we think that\u2019s $2 billion to $3 billion market today. So, we think about the size of that business relative to the size of our business and why we\u2019re making that kind of investment. We think the ability to capture share in a $3 billion market growing at 15% plus organically is a good investment to make.","I think as it relates to SEPA, I think it\u2019s a little bit less on SEPA in the context of accelerating the 3 billion and the 15%, little more analogous to what we saw in Spain with our interchange reductions that were put into the place by the banks and the Spanish government on September 1, 2014. There are puts and takes between the two markets, the rest of the EU primarily for us the United Kingdom and Spain are not completely analogist. So for example, we have a higher SME book, small to mid-size book in Spain and we do in the United Kingdom where we have more large retailers who are pass-through. And we\u2019re not splitting some of the interchange benefit with the JV partner in the UK as we are in Spain. So there\u2019s puts and takes. But I think in the next couple of years, as that rolls through actually in the back half of fiscal \u201816 going into fiscal \u201817. I would certainly look to what the benefits that we saw in Durbin when we have in here United States number and years ago, the benefits we\u2019re seeing this fiscal continuing in Spain; as we think about the immediate meaning the next year or two worth of benefit to our European business through SEPA.","Realex is a slightly different thesis, as I mentioned before, which is attacking a $3 billion revenue business growing at 15% is a good idea regardless of the rate reduction environment.","Cameron Bready","And Ashwin, it\u2019s Cameron; I\u2019ll just add one other comment, which is if you think about separate more on a long-term basis, one of the things which hurts to do is help level the playing field. So as we think about opportunities for us and other parts of Continental Europe and particularly for situation where we can expand our card presence business, we do think SEPA is going to create opportunities and lead to hopefully potential situation, will be able to augment our existing portfolio, expand our portfolio through other ventures in Western Europe by creating more of a level playing field and foreseeing some of our competitors in those markets that be more rational about the merchant acquiring business.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","And then, with regards to Asia Pac, I may have missed this, but could you specify what the contributions on revenues and margins were from Ezidebit?","Cameron Bready","We didn\u2019t specifically call out the contributions from Ezidebit, Ashwin. What we have guided to previously is that we expected Ezidebit to contribute roughly $25 million of U.S. revenue or the entirety of fiscal \u201815, so for roughly the seven months that we will own it in fiscal \u201815. I would note however the Australian dollar has gradually weakened as has most of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure against the U.S. dollars. So, I would say that 25 million number now is a little high. We have probably guided you to something in the 22, 23 range, just more of the result of FX headwinds.","From a margin profile perspective, we\u2019ve always said that Ezidebit comes in at a margin higher that\u2019s higher than our international margin. So, it is impactful to the overall international margin, slightly for FY15, but more importantly for FY16 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. You may begin.","Glenn Greene","Just a few follow-ups on some of the prior questions. Just on Spain, it\u2019s helpful to get the sort of high single-digit, low double-digit volume growth, but could you sort of give us a little bit color on the pricing; did it stick to small order of magnitude as last quarter or did some about sort of trade is first question?","David Mangum","Yes, Glenn, it\u2019s David. Actually it\u2019s tracking very similarly the way Jeff was describing it earlier. It is trading away but at a fairly slow rate. Most important thing is I think what Jeff pointed out is the September 1st of \u201815, it will annualize; it won\u2019t be gone at that point. But as with all markets around the world, if we go all the way back to Australia, that\u2019s what eight or nine years ago now or our Durbin experience more recently three years ago, it will relate to highly competitive industry; it\u2019s just a matter of sort of wait and at pace at which it fits away. But right now it is moving in a way that we\u2019re predicting pretty accurately. And you raise sort of the core point which is that\u2019s happening on top of a business is executing very well which is why it\u2019s a happy outcome in our European results.","Glenn Greene","And then on Canada, it\u2019s helpful to get the low single digit transaction growth and we know the FX. Can you just clarify for us what the spreads look like and the specific benefit you got from the pricing actions you took earlier in the year.","David Mangum","Yes, happy to go and state it again. I would say while we don\u2019t close the spreads, they remain stable. And you\u2019ll recall what we\u2019re managing in Canada from a sort of metrics perspective is the two curves of spread in transactions. To the extent they remain stable and somewhat similar to each other, we have something perfectly manageable and stable that generates a lot of cash and allows us to deploy it elsewhere around the world. And we have a nice solid market that performs very well for us and very high margins, setting aside entirely anything about currency for the moment which is saying within Canada itself. That\u2019s exactly what we saw again in Q3. So without putting into specific metrics, spreads consistent, any pricing actions we\u2019ve taken in this market have started very well to provide what we think still excellent service for the customers in Canada. So the pieces in Canada hang together very nicely for us right now.","Glenn Greene","And just finally, the benefit you got in the U.S. from up low and where we are in terms of middle innings and how much more benefit can get from a growth perspective there?","David Mangum","Actually I do think middle innings is an accurate characterization Glenn. We\u2019re not incredibly early obviously; we\u2019re almost at the year end of the initial process of sales and rolling it out. And we have other channels where it has not yet rolled out; I won\u2019t specify them; we do have some other channels with some opportunity that we hope will help carry more of the organic growth for us in 2016. So middle innings; probably that just gets in fourth inning is about the right place to think about it. It\u2019s a very nice piece of organic growth. As you might imagine now that we\u2019ve established consistently performing distributions channels across our direct channels, the next thing is to pump product to that and up low has been a great additional product this year to be a nice product again next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Kwok of KBW. You may begin.","Steven Kwok","Most of my questions have been answered already. I guess just wanted to touch upon the North America other revenue growth, specifically in the U.S. That accelerated quite nicely. Can you talk about how sustainable that trend is and how we should think about that going forward in the domestic direct segment?","Jeff Sloan","So, we are very pleased with the growth in North America revenue. Let me just step back for a second. The way we generally think about our business and what our targets are is we start with GDP; we generally chase GDP growth plus a couple 100 basis points to represent a conversion to paper to electronic. And then of course we also look at the network statics on a transaction level in the markets that we\u2019re in as really bogeys for growth. The thing what I mean in the United States in particular Steven and to get into your question is showing mid single digits as a bogey for keeping pace with the market. But we just posted our third consecutive quarter of low to mid now, 12% to 15% double digit organic growth in the U.S market.","Whilst it\u2019s hard to say in the future that we\u2019ll continued to double and triple the rate of growth organically the U.S market, I certainly would expect and believe that sustainably we should operate well in excess of the rate of market growth? So that\u2019s hardly in the future remains 5%; we should be operating at multiples of that rate. Now is that going to be two and half to three times? That\u2019s hard to say in perpetuity. But certainly sitting here today Steven, I would say, we certainly will expect to be gaining share and growing substantially in excess of the rate of market growth which we\u2019ve been doing whole year in our business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. You may begin.","Darrin Peller","Just a quick one as a follow-up on Canada; typically when there is price change come; I think the code of conduct requires an advanced notification. It looked like the 4% growth I think it was about 4% constant currency closer to transaction growth rates now. It\u2019s narrow -- the spreads are narrowing back and sort of the transaction goes low which is kind what you\u2019d expect. I think people are hoping for at least starting in April with the interchange cuts coming as you alluded to earlier there to be an opportunity there. So just timing wise, I mean are we going to be able to see some sort of a benefit off that pretty quickly just given that there is usually a time sort of advanced notification? Can you just give us a sense of what we can expect?","David Mangum","I would not expect to see anything visible in Q4. The interchange reductions are coming effective May 1st in Canada. I would point out, they\u2019re not incredibly enormous interchange reductions; it\u2019s just a mathematical matter. And as I understand the way the market is going to work going forward, you will find that being largely if not exclusively pass-through entirely. Now that doesn\u2019t mean we and others won\u2019t be running our businesses at the same time but that\u2019s a good benefit coming to merchants. And whenever the cost of acceptance goes down, that\u2019s a good thing for Global Payments; obviously for the rest of the acquirers as well. But given the size of what\u2019s happening, I wouldn\u2019t expect too much of a change in Canada trends in Q4, certainly as we come around to report them in again here in July. But I would say is that positions us well to have a nice stable Canada going into \u201816 which is probably the most important part of the facts that we just had another stable quarter and another manageable and predictable quarter. We expect another one in Q4 and that will be a nice platform from which to enter 2016 from a merchant relationship perspective.","Jeff Sloan","I would just add to that Darrin and to build on to what David said, in addition to what he mentioned, if you think about what we\u2019ve been doing in Canada and one of the other analysts asked this question as well, our ability now to supplement what we\u2019ve been describing with our integrated business and bringing back into Canada with regard obviously we\u2019ve already done and David described before the sales and marketing changes around that to drive additional growth, our ability to bring other products and services like OptBlue and other things into Canada as we head into fiscal \u201816, I think gives us a lot of confidence around the stability of that business. So, I don\u2019t want to be locked in that conversation about just rate changes and the global macroeconomic environment. I think as we are in the rest of the North American business, I think we\u2019re executing very well in Canada. And I think as we head into fiscal \u201816, we are going to leverage our infrastructure and bring those products and services into Canada. This is our confidence as we look at that business in the coming months.","Darrin Peller","Just one follow-up; I mean you mentioned before, I think you came up around financial JV opportunities, obviously the strengthening of the dollar helps in Europe. What kind of interest are you seeing from banks there? And obviously they\u2019re probably worried about interchange cuts coming and loss revenue streams. I mean trying to find other sources of really good business generation maybe JVs maybe a good way to do so.","Jeff Sloan","Yes, I think you\u2019re exactly right, Darrin, in what we said. I would say that as it became clear in the last year or so that SEPA was effectively upon us culminating in the early March EU adoption of those rules; we\u2019re seeing a fair amount of interest among banks and Continental Europe who generally combine issuing and acquiring. So, as they see issuing get reduced because interchanges coming down, they are still looking at partnerships on the acquiring side to say help me grow more quickly than I otherwise could because I know there is lot of fee income coming out of the issuing side of the business. So, we see no shortage of opportunities in Continental Europe, there are hurdles that I described before. But we\u2019re very well engaged down in those conversations currently.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our last question from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. You may begin.","Jason Kupferberg","Just a follow-up question on margins; I think I\u2019ve heard you guys say from time-to-time that over the long-term there is the potential for this business on a consolidated basis to get the cash operating margins maybe in the low to mid 20s range and obviously we\u2019re moving in the right direction right now. Is that still an aspirational target over the long-term that\u2019s realistic?","Cameron Bready","Jason, it\u2019s Cameron. I think it very much is and I think you\u2019ve seen the performance over the course of this year demonstrate that we\u2019re clearly moving in the right direction as you correctly highlighted. Obviously this year, we have seen I think very good margin growth and currently are anticipating as I mentioned in my prepared comments, roughly 60 basis points of margin expansion over FY14. What we\u2019ve traditionally said is something in the 30 basis points to 50 basis points annually is a reasonable expectation for margin expansion driving towards that\u2019s overall target that we have f something in the mid 20% range which will be augmented by transactions that we do over the course of time that are going to be hopefully additive and do that overall 30 basis points to 50 basis points target that we have.","So as we did here today, we\u2019re looking at a total company margin expansion for the quarter that was 140 basis points on a constant currency basis that\u2019s fairly impressive and certainly above our expectation of what we think we can do out on a run rate basis but as you\u2019ve correctly highlighted, clearly moving us in the right direction for the overall target.","Jason Kupferberg","And just last follow-up, so with the addition of Realex now and their payment volume, if we now think about your total about your total ecommerce business as a percent of overall volume, where does that fit now and are there any longer term targets we could think about that you would be aspiring to receive there?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, Jason it\u2019s Jeff, we could break it out that way because increasingly and this is part of a thesis about Realex, increasingly it\u2019s really omni-channel environment. Customers aren\u2019t particularly desirous of just talking on one basis or the other. They want us to solve all their acceptance fees, it\u2019s not just through their website and work online, this provides every type of acceptance whether it\u2019s mobile, whether it\u2019s online, whether it\u2019s in the physical store environment. And as you think about part of rationale for Realex which is to expand at the omni-channel, further into the omni-channel business that really does merge the card not present with the card present world and leverages our footprint, not just in Europe but globally. So, we don\u2019t really think about it as what share of the market do we have other than to say that we want more of it and capture more share is a key strategy of ours.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, understood. Thanks guys.","Jeff Sloan","Thank you. Well, thank you very much for joining us this morning on Global Payments\u2019 third quarter FY 2015 call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call be recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; Winnie Smith. Please go ahead.","Winnie Smith","Good morning. And welcome to Global Payments third quarter 2019 conference call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today\u2019s conference call contain forward-looking statements about expected operating and financial results. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and any subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update them. Some of the comments made refer to non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net revenue, adjusted net revenue plus network fees, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance.","For a full reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our trended financial highlights, both of which are available in the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Joining me on the call are; Jeff Sloan, CEO; and Cameron Bready, President and COO and Paul Todd, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks, Winnie. We are delighted to have completed our landmark merger with TSYS this quarter, bringing together two industry leaders and positioning the new Global Payments as the premier pure-play payment technology company at scale globally.","We successfully closed this transformative partnership on September 18, just 3.5 months after we announced our agreement in late May and well ahead of our initial expectations.","Our ability to execute on an accelerated timeline was made possible by the highly complementary nature for our market leading payments and software technology businesses, this strong alignment of our corporate cultures and the unrivaled expertise of the 24,000 people across our combined organization. I could not be more excited about the future opportunities for all of our stakeholders.","Our terrific third quarter results highlight the continued momentum in our business which is being fueled by broad based strength across our relationship-led and technology businesses and underpinned by consistent ongoing execution.","In the midst of the largest integration, we have undertaken to date we again delivered double-digit revenue growth, expanded adjusted operating margin by 80 basis points and produced adjusted earnings per share growth of 18%. We are very grateful for the hard work of our colleagues that has brought us to this point.","And we also accomplished of these results while simultaneously expanding our strategy to be the partner of choice for the most complex financial institutions worldwide.","To that end, we are thrilled to announce we have signed new partnership Desjardins, Canada\u2019s leading financial co-operative group; and Citi, one of the largest money center banks globally. These new competitive wins with marquee partners across multiple geographies further validate the distinctiveness of our pure-play payments model.","Starting with the Desjardins, we reached an agreement to purchase the Qu\u00e9bec based bank's existing portfolio of approximately 40,000 merchants and have executed an exclusive referral partnership to provide acquiring solutions to its clients for next decade.","Desjardins selected Global Payments as a direct result of the breadth and depth of our technology payment solutions, local and global expertise, comprehensive distribution, modern architecture and infrastructure, and our unrivaled track record of execution over many decades. We expect this transaction to close by early 2020.","We were also excited to have been selected by Citi to partner to offer payment acceptance services to its multinational banking clients on an omnichannel basis. Our ability to offer highly competitive payment solutions physically and virtually in more market seamlessly than our peers differentiates Global Payments and this partnership capitalizes on our local market expertise and industry leading unified commerce platform, or UCP to provide a true omnichannel experience. We expect to be in market with Citi by year end 2019.","We look forward to working with Desjardins and Citi to bring best-in-class solutions to their merchant customers around the globe. We are winning every day in the marketplace with the uniqueness of our strategy and we are very proud of the company we keep.","In addition to our new preliminary agreement with Citi, we recently signed several significant global omnichannel customers including with UK based online luxury retailer, MATCHESFASHION and a rapidly expanding modern high tech hotel chain, Eurotel.","We also continue to expand UCP. We are now live in the United States in addition to Canada and Asia-Pacific and will fully roll out UCP in the UK over the next two weeks.","Turning to our integrated and vertical market businesses. OpenEdge, once again, delivered strong growth during the third quarter, driven by our ability to provide a truly integrated ecosystem across more vertical markets and more geographies than our peers.","And we maintained our consistent track record of growth in our own software portfolio as our strategy of delivering the full value stack in key vertical markets is creating deeper, richer and more value-added relationships with our customers.","Our combination with the TSYS significantly accelerates our technology-enabled software-driven mission establishing Global Payments as the leading provider of integrated payment solutions, own software in both merchants initialing and omnichannel capabilities in the most attractive markets globally.","On a standalone basis, TSYS produced consistent results for the third quarter. Performance at TSYS merchant business improved, resulting in meaningful revenue acceleration.","These results were achieved while making significant progress on integration, contributing substantially to an increase in our expected revenue and cost savings expectations just a few weeks post close.","Our strategy of the combined merchant businesses remains focused on cross-sells of complementary products, further penetration of adjacent distribution channels and rollout of UCP to the TSYS customer base.","In addition, TSYS' issuer solutions business recently completed new long-term agreements with the Central Trust Bank in North America and leading retailer Riachuelo in Brazil.","These were competitive takeaways, providing further validation of our combined pure-play payment service. And we also expanded existing contracts with Virgin Money Nationwide Building Society and Metro Bank.","Most notably, we expect growth to accelerate in this business as the issuer solutions team successfully converted the Walmart portfolio on behalf of Capital One earlier this month.","This market leading business has a full pipeline today and the expanded breadth of our combined 1,300 FI partnerships provide significant untapped opportunities for new issuer and merchant referral relationships.","Our strategy to accelerate growth in issuer solutions involves modernizing its platforms, cross-selling existing relationships globally and extending the product suite. As customers move to cloud-based solutions, we believe that Global Payments can enhance the development of next-generation products and services.","Turning to the consumer solutions business. Earlier this month, we announced a partnership with Samsung to integrate the Netspend digital MasterCard into Samsung\u2019s mobile wallet and provide a variety of payment solutions including P2P. Branded Samsung Pay Cash, this solution allows smartphone users to establish a re-loadable balance and whole funds for use, including spending and budgeting, opening a significant pool of new customers for this business.","Our differentiated strategy at Netspend consists at Netspend consists of product extensions into P2P and B2B segments, as well as select international expansion. In addition to the recently announced P2P solutions like Samsung, we are building product offerings currently to dramatically enhance the scale and scope of Netspend's B2B offerings.","Domestically, we expect Netspend's Paycard products to help expand Heartland's payroll offering. We also see additional use cases for Paycard in restaurants, one of our largest vertical markets, as well as in our gaming business, which is among the largest in North America.","Finally, we believe we can bring Netspend into new markets, based on Global Payments' existing acquiring partnerships outside the United States in short order.","The substantial progress we have made in just a few short weeks since we finalized our partnership, provides us with the confidence to now raise our expectations for both revenue and expense synergies.","Importantly, we expect the integration actions we have already initiated to generate in excess of $100 million of expense benefits on an annualized basis, meaning that we believe we can achieve our 2020 accretion goals announced in May, even if we were not to undertake any additional actions next year, and, of course, we intend to do more in 2020.","Cameron will provide you with the specific details on our updated targets in a moment, but let me highlight a few of the revenue synergy opportunities already planned that give us a clear line of sight towards achieving our goals.","First, our efforts to align our merchant organizations and go-to-market strategy in the US are well underway and we expect to start cross-selling products including Bio TSYS, Genius and ProPay, as well as the subscription-based engagement and analytics and vertical software solutions in 2020.","Specifically, we expect the capabilities of ProPay to provide value-added products like multiple disbursement capabilities and web-based Sales Select and Heartland. We\u2019re also laying the groundwork so we can begin to deliver products like products like Data Final POS, Genius and ProPay to additional geographies internationally and enable TSYS' legacy customers outside of the United States.","Second, we are already engaged in preliminary discussions with our existing global bank partners across three continents on issuer processing opportunities for TSYS. We have just returned from Europe and we believe that the market is ready for processing capability domestically and cross-border in geographies like United Kingdom, Central Europe, Spain Ireland, and closer to home Canada.","By marrying issuer processing with our acquiring capabilities, we can emulate many of the aspects of the virtual close loop, as well as provide strong customer authentication internally which is now the law of the land across Europe. These opportunities are in addition to core merchant referral relationship possibilities from existing TSYS FIs and private retailers to Global Payments.","Third Netspend is actively working on new B2B, B2C and P2P capabilities and opportunities including for our restaurant and gaming customers, as well as in new geographies. Netspend has already proved fertile ground for new merchant referral relationships among its larger distribution partners.","We have found a true partner with TSYS and could not be more excited about the future opportunities to drive significant value creation for our employees, customers, partners and shareholders. We are fortunate and grateful to be in the position we are in today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Cam.","Cameron Bready","Thanks everyone. Before I begin, I would like to welcome Paul as the new Chief Financial Officer of Global Payments. It has been my privilege to serve in this role for the last five years and to work with all of you in that capacity. We were thrilled to successfully finalize our merger with TSYS this quarter, our largest transaction to date.","And as Jeff mentioned, we\u2019re already making significant progress on the integration of our two leading pure-play payments businesses. Importantly, we accomplished this while producing strong financial performance in the third quarter, a testament to our continued relentless focus on execution.","Total company adjusted net revenue plus network fees for the third quarter was $1.31 billion reflecting growth of 27% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 33.8% and adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.70 or approximately 20% on a constant currency basis. Naturally our third quarter performance reflects TSYS' results from September 18, the impact of which was neutral on an adjusted earnings per share basis.","Before turning to the financial impacts of the merger, let me start by covering the standalone Global Payments highlights for the quarter. Excluding TSYS Global Payments produced adjusted net revenue plus network fees of $1.161 billion, reflecting growth of 13% versus 2018 or over 14% on a constant currency basis. And adjusted operating margins expanded by 110 basis points to 34.2%.","In North America, adjusted net revenue plus network fees for Global Payments on a stand-alone basis was $877 million, reflecting growth of 16% over the prior year period.","Adjusted operating margin in North America expanded 130 basis points to 35.6%, driven by growth in our technology enabled businesses and consistent strong execution across the segment.","Our US direct distribution businesses again delivered low double digit normalized organic growth this quarter led by strength in our integrated and vertical markets business.","Specifically OpenEdge produced high-teens growth while our own software portfolio continued to deliver low double-digit organic growth consistent with our outline targets. We also saw high single digit organic growth in our US relationship led channel, reflecting consistent execution in this business.","Our Canadian business grew low single digits in local currency with weakness in the Canadian dollar impacting reported results by approximately 100 basis points for the quarter.","As Jeff noted, we are very pleased to announce today our new partnership with Desjardins in Canada, which we expect will provide new avenues for growth in this market going forward. Lastly, our wholesale business declined mid-teens consistent with our expectations for the quarter.","Moving to Europe, adjusted net revenue plus network fees for stand-alone Global Payments grew approximately 11% in local currency or 6% on a reported basis as foreign currency exchange rates remain a meaningful headwind during the period. We continue to benefit from strength in our businesses in Spain and Central Europe, each of which grew well into the teens on a local currency basis.","In the UK we delivered mid-single-digit organic growth, which was ahead of our expectations and accelerated sequentially from the second quarter despite a continuing soft macro-environment and the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.","Our European e-com and omni solutions business, again delivered strong growth as we further enhanced our differentiated capabilities in unified commerce platform. We look forward to completing the next phase of our rollout of UCP globally when we go live in the UK over the next few weeks, which we expect will support continued momentum for our pan-European omni-channel offering.","Adjusted operating margin in Europe expanded 100 basis points to 48.6% as consistent execution and scale benefits offset pressure from foreign currency headwinds.","Turning to Asia Pacific. Reported adjusted net revenue plus network fee growth for stand-alone Global Payments was 5% or approximately 7% on a constant currency basis.","Excluding Hong Kong where we have been impacted by the ongoing protest, our Asia Pacific business delivered low double-digit growth in local currency consistent with our overall target for the region.","Adjusted operating margin of 33.9% improved slightly relative to the prior year as outstanding execution and expense discipline offset headwind from both disruptions in Hong Kong and foreign currency exchange rates.","Following the close of our merger on September 18, TSYS contributed $145 million of adjusted net revenue plus network fees and $45 million of adjusted operating income for the final 13 days of September.","Overall, for the third quarter, the legacy TSYS business produced constant currency revenue growth largely consistent with the second quarter, while margin expansion was above the high end of TSYS' previous 25 to 75 basis point target.","Growth for the legacy TSYS merchant solutions business accelerated from the second quarter moving back into the high single-digits longer term targeted range. Normalized for the exit of its government services business and the deactivation of a single value-added product, the legacy TSYS issuer solutions business grew in line with its longer term mid-single digit target in the quarter.","Finally, revenue performance for the legacy TSYS consumer solutions business was largely consistent with the second quarter. We expect revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter across all three legacy TSYS businesses.","In the merchant solutions business we're building on solid third quarter performance as we align our go-to-market strategies in the U.S. and begin to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities.","In the issuer solutions business, the conversion of the Capital One Walmart portfolio earlier this month provides us line of sight to improve growth entering the fourth quarter.","Lastly, in the consumer solutions business, we're building momentum as we expand our digital product offerings including our partnership with Samsung and realize benefits from recent distribution wins and renewals, more to come on our outlook for the remainder of the year in a moment.","Turning now to capital structure, in August, we successfully priced a $3 billion senior unsecured notes offering. In combination with the new credit facility we closed in July, our combined capital structure is now largely complete and meaningfully improves our weighted average interest rate going forward. In fact the terms we achieved are more favorable than we anticipated when we announced our partnership with TSYS in May.","In addition at closing, we received our final investment-grade credit ratings from both S&P and Moody's, consistent with our expectations. Pro forma leverage for the combined business was approximately 2.5 times at the end of the quarter.","This leveraged position coupled with our expected strong free cash flow generation provides the new Global Payments with significant capacity to invest in the business as we continue to advance our strategy and execute on our capital allocation priorities.","As for the outlook for the combined company in 2019, we now expect adjusted net revenue plus network fees to range from $5.60 billion to $5.63 billion reflecting growth of 41% to 42% over 2018. We also expect adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.12 to $6.20, reflecting growth of 18% to 20% over 2018.","Inclusive of TSYS from the date of the merger, we now anticipate adjusted operating margin expansion of up to 40 basis points for the full year. Given TSYS' business mix, its margin profile is lower than that of Global Payments' legacy business, thereby reducing margin expansion expectations for the full year period.","That said, on a standalone basis, TSYS is forecasted to exceeded its margin expansion target for the full year period. In addition adjusted operating margin expansion for Global Payments on a stand-alone basis is now expected to be up to 100 basis points for 2019, well ahead of our historical target.","We\u2019re very pleased with the progress we've made since closing on our partnership with TSYS last month and have increased confidence in our ability to accelerate revenue growth and deliver substantial cost savings over the next three years and beyond.","In fact, as Jeff detailed, our revenue enhancement initiatives are already underway. And based on the work completed to date, we're increasing our target for run rate revenue benefits to more than $125 million within three years.","As for expense synergies, we have implemented actions that are currently running ahead of our year one target and have already identified additional sources for expense optimization. As a result, we're also increasing our total expected expense savings to more than $325 million on an annual run rate basis within three years.","The momentum we have in our business coupled with the significant progress we've made on integration bolsters our confidence in the future. And more specifically, the accretion expectations we have for the TSYS merger at the time of announcement in May.","We now expect at least mid-single-digit accretion in 2020, which all else being equal, would imply adjusted earnings per share expectation in the mid-$7 range based on a stand-alone 16% to 18% growth target. Naturally, we will share in more detailed outlook for 2020 during our year-end call in February.","Before concluding today, I want to provide an update on our expected go-forward reporting for the business. First, as we finalize our combined structure, we anticipate reporting based on three operating segments: merchant solutions, issuer solutions and the newly named business and consumer solutions, which includes the legacy TSYS consumer business and also reflects our expanded strategy for this channel going forward. We believe this reporting structure will best align with how we expect or operate our differentiated payment center business model.","Second, based on feedback from the SEC regarding the use of our adjusted net revenue plus network fees metric that came out of a customary review of our public filings going forward we expect to report on an adjusted net revenue basis excluding the addition of network fees.","Although, we believe adjusted net revenue plus network fees provide useful insight into the economics of our business in a manner consistent with how the company assesses and measures performance, the SEC has requested we discontinue its use. As a result, we report without the addition of network fees in the future, consistent with how TSYS has reflected this item historically.","To facilitate this change, we'll be providing pro forma financial information for the combined business for historical reporting periods consistent with this presentation. Of course, Global Payments reports adjusted net revenue each period, in addition to the adjusted net revenue plus network fees metric and a historical pro forma information will be built on this basis.","We will be transitioning to this methodology in the fourth quarter and will provide all the components necessary for you to measure performance under both conventions. We could not be more excited about the future as we build on our competitive advantages and payments leadership position and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the coming quarters.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks, Cam. We could not be more excited about the momentum in our business and the significant wins we have recently achieved with large FIs like Desjardins and Citi validate our pure-play payments business.","Payments are not just an adjacency for us; payments are our exclusive focus in the area of unrivaled expertise. Multiple recent successes and competitive processes confirm the wisdom of our strategic focus and the privacy of our business model.","With TSYS, we deepen our competitive mode and confirm the value of our ecosystem across each element of our strategy. We have the most comprehensive software-driven solutions globally with full omnichannel capabilities, the broadest market reach, and enhanced exposure to faster growth geographies.","We have the very best employees providing the very best experiences for our customers with the very best technologies in the most attractive global markets. Together, we are positioned to deliver industry leading growth and remain at the forefront of innovation as we had into 2020 and beyond. This is truly an exciting time to be part of the new Global Payments. Winnie?","Winnie Smith","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I\u2019d like to ask everyone to limit their question to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Koning of Baird. Your line is open.","David Koning","Yeah. Hey, guys. Great job.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks, Dave.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Dave.","David Koning","Yeah. I guess, first of all, just on TSYS, I mean you laid it out extremely well, I just want to make sure we understand 2020, should we expect accelerating revenue just given the synergies and some of the headwinds this year falling off? And then I guess the other part of TSYS, am I right to understand about $100 million cost synergy run rate already in Q4?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, Dave its Jeff. I'll start off and I'll turn it over to Cameron and Paul. So, the answer is yes to your first question. I think what we're very excited about the combined company, certainly as we looked at TSYS to address what you asked. We are entering the fourth quarter with our expectation of an accelerated revenue growth in TSYS just really 13 days after the close of the merger. We pointed out the reasons of that including the Walmart portfolio conversion in Capital One.","So, we feel really good about where we are heading into 2020 with TSYS. We also did see - I mean one area of direct overlap between Global and TSYS which is in the merchant business. As Cameron pointed out, we did see an acceleration in the third quarter in merchant already. And I think Cameron alluded to the other thing that we see improving performance in merchant in the fourth quarter.","So, we think we're in a really good run rate place Dave at TSYS currently in the quarter we're in, in the fourth quarter. And I think it gives us a lot of confidence heading into 2020. Cameron you might want to comment a little bit on the revenue synergies as it relates to Dave's question?","Cameron Bready","Yes, David, I\u2019ll jump in there quickly. We are making good progress particularly in the merchant business on realizing some very tactical cross-sell opportunities already with our combined businesses and obviously, we expect those to continue to ramp as we head into 2020 and beyond.","Now, the numbers at this point aren\u2019t going to be dramatic, but certainly they are providing a little bit of a nice tailwind in the merchant business within TSYS that gives us confidence that we can continue to accelerate growth and maintain it in that high single digit target for the merchant business as we head into 2020 and beyond and hopefully, even build upon that in future period. So I do think we feel very good about the momentum that we have in the TSYS business heading into Q4 and then further on into 2020 in particular.","To address your last question about the $100 million of expense synergies what we said in the script, just to be clear, is we\u2019ve taken actions that run rate to $100 million of expense synergies in 2020. Obviously that $100 million is not in Q4, so I just want to be explicitly clear about that.","The actions we take and today will generate $100 million of expense savings in 2020, which was our target for realize the expense energies for the first full year of ownership of TSYS that we announced when we paid the acquisition or merger back in May.","David Koning","Great. Thank you. And then just as my follow-up, the Canada acquisition that sounds pretty cool. What roughly is the size of that? I mean, is that something that 10% of the Canada business or something more substantial?","Cameron Bready","Yeah. It's a great question Dave. We're thrilled to have the opportunity to partner with Desjardins in Canada. It adds about 40,000 merchants to our existing base of customers in Canada and obviously gives us a much more significant presence in Qu\u00e9bec, which is an area of the market where Desjardins has been very effective and certainly has a very strong presence.","So we\u2019re too glad to be able to partner with them. As it relates to financial contribution it's going to add next year probably about in the neighborhood of $70 million or so of adjusted net revenue plus network fees to our existing Canadian business, which I think you know is just a little north of $300 million.","So it's a nice addition, nice bolt-on to our overall Canadian business and obviously, I think opens up new avenues for growth in that market for us going forward.","David Koning","Great. Thanks, guys.","Cameron Bready","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Good. Thank you so much results. Just on the merchant side maybe can you help us recast what percent is now defined as tech enabled versus all the other pieces just want to get a better sense of how we should think about the components of growth for merchant with TSYS?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, Tien-Tsin. It's Jeff. I\u2019ll start. So it's essentially the same percentage at the combined business as it was for Global stand alone. I think we set this back in the May announcement up 50% is the combined total. The reason for that I'll ask Paul to comment just in a second.","The reason for that is TSYS merchant really had two pieces that were very similar to two pieces at Global Payments. One was Cayenne, which is very similar to OpenEdge. That was completely integrated business, adjacent areas of overlap, which I think is a great opportunity for OpenEdge.","The other one of course which transfers, which is very similar very similar to Heartland at Global Payments. And transfer has both semi-integrated as well as relationship-based businesses as well as an e-commerce asset.","So I actually think it looks a lot to be honest the way Global Payments did the on the merchant side so it's just about 50%. Paul you want to add anything?","Paul Todd","Yes. The only thing I would say is in the third quarter we do see that integrated piece of our direct business of the legacy TSYS direct business get right at 40%, which is a high watermark from an integrated standpoint in that legacy business going back a year or so ago. That was roughly one third and so the fact that has grown just kind of underpins just comments around the mix there.","Cameron Bready","Tien-tsin its Cameron I\u2019ll just add for the merchant business in particular, if you think about its contribution to the total business it's about 70% of the combined business now. And it's roughly 50% technology enabled and about 50% relationship globally.","So as we talked about when we announced de deal combining TSYS with Global Payment gives us just south of $1 billion of integrated revenue. We have just south of $1 billion of e-com and omnichannel revenue. And we talked about roughly $800 million or so of software revenue in our portfolio. So that ends up being close to half of the overall merchant business on a global basis.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. That\u2019s good to know. I just want to make sure we have that right. And then on the issuer side, you mentioned you get a full pipeline. How about on the merchant front, any comments on pipeline or bookings on the software side? I know there\u2019s a lot of activity going on with ISVs and dealers and even on the bank side as you mentioned; anything there? Thank you.","Cameron Bready","Yes, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about pipeline on the merchant side Tien-tsin. As you know our focus tends to be small to medium-sized businesses. So when we think about the pipeline for the businesses, it's a little bit different than obviously the issuer business which tends to be more large FI-focused. But I would say momentum in both of our businesses is very good.","As we talked about in our integrated business, Paul gave a little bit color on how TSYS performed. We commented that OpenEdge grew high teens in the quarter which is the high watermark for that business certainly over the last several years which I think reflects a strong new partner growth over the course of the last couple of years and obviously, good effectiveness at converting existing customers of our partners to payments customers of Global Payments which has been obviously an important part of our growth story over time.","The second thing I would say in our own software businesses, we continue to see strong bookings growth across AdvancedMD and ACTIVE as well. SICOM had a very strong quarter and has very strong momentum heading into 2020 having received recently some positive news from one of its largest customers about a rollout of a new product across its base of franchisees in 2020 which we think will be a nice tailwind for that business heading into the year.","And on the relationship side, we saw strong high single-digit growth in the quarter, good consistent execution in that channel. We continue to see decent same-store sales growth in the business, roughly 3.5% for the quarter and obviously, new sales and attrition rates remain very constant giving us again good momentum heading into the 2020 timeframe.","So, I would say all-in-all across the merchant business, certainly in the US, we\u2019ve seen very strong trends. Europe improved quarter-over-quarter accelerated on an organic growth basis, largely driven by slightly better performance in the UK. And, of course, Spain and our Central European joint venture with Erste performed really well in the quarter as well.","The only really point of softness within Hong Kong that's completely expected, obviously, given the environment there. Ex-Hong Kong, we grew low double-digits in Asia which again is consistent with our expectation for that market.","So we feel good about how the rest of Asia is holding up as a macro matter notwithstanding obviously the site disruptions in Hong Kong. We've had to absorb in the P&L.","Jeffrey Sloan","Yeah. Just on the legacy TSYS standpoint, I\u2019ll just add on. We had an all-time record level of net revenue in the merchant solutions area. Our integrated - with legacy TSYS, integrated business grew in the strong double-digit range. We did get some accretive growth from the legacy indirect side. So much similar to Cameron's comments on the legacy Global side, it's just a great quarter from a merchant standpoint.","Tien-tsin Huang","Glad to hear. Thank you.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks Tien-tsin.","Cameron Bready","Thanks Tien-tsin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Togut","Thank you. God morning. Good to see the strong results and nice to see the early raise on the TSYS merger synergy targets. Perhaps just starting on the TSYS side, you talked about already having taken the actions to achieve the $100 million of cost take out in 2020. What specifically about the cost take out process is going better than you expected to-date?","Cameron Bready","Dave, its Cameron. I\u2019ll start and ask both Jeff and Paul to chime in if they have anything to add. I would say a couple of things. One is, first of all, experience, right? We've been down this path before. We have very strong experience from an M&A standpoint.","We learned a lot of in valuable lessons in the process of merging with Heartland and integrating Heartland. And I think TSYS has done the same with acquisitions that they've done over the point of time as well.","We got an early start with our planning process upon announcing the merger in May. And I think the governance model and structure that we put around the process itself I think has given us very strong start to obviously our working relationship and the ability to drive obviously ahead of schedule expense actions that we intend to take as we look to bring these two businesses together. So I really think it's the experience that we have and our ability to work collaboratively together.","I think our common cultures have allowed us to work very collaboratively in a way that has brought to the forefront very good ideas of how we can bring the companies together in a very efficient manner, how we can find savings within the business as we look to bring our merchant businesses together.","In particular, we have great momentum amongst the leadership team in merchant as it relates to our go to market strategy and finding ways to obviously drive efficiencies in the combined business as we work to implement our target architecture model and target operating model.","So we feel very good about obviously where we are. We feel good enough to increase our target expectations around expense synergies on the whole. And as we said on the call and mentioned earlier on the Q&A, we had line of sight to $100 million of run rate synergies in 2020 already and the actions we\u2019ve taken will allow those to materialize next year as we continue to look to do more for 2021 and 2022.","Jeffrey Sloan","Yeah. And the only thing David I would add is from a legacy TSYS perspective, we said this at the time of the deal that we knew each company very well. Both companies had a long history of knowing each other and we knew that that was going to provide kind of additive tailwinds from the synergy standpoint of just that expertise that we both had at our legacy businesses and the complementary nature of the two legacy companies putting them together. And so that was our commentary at the time of the deal, and after we got post close, that came to fruition of that kind of a starting point.","David Togut","Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up. Europe came in significantly better than we expected both on revenue and cash EBIT. I am just curious Jeff about any early go-to-market experience you've had combining your merchant business and TSYS' issuer processing business in Europe which was definitely a big call out when you announce the transaction?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes. Dave that\u2019s a great point. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks we were just there, the combined management team clearly matured a couple of weeks ago. I would say the receptivity for the combined partnership was even better than I expected back in May.","David, when we announced the transaction in the first place, we saw most of TSYS' large customers in Europe on the issuing side and we saw a lot of Global Payments large customers in the merchant side in Europe, when Troy and I and the team where there.","I think the market, as I said in my prepared remarks is absolutely ready for onus domestic and cross-border processing and the markets I listed in the prepared remarks. Of course closer to home here in Canada, we just announced Desjardins this morning.","So I think on a combined-ish [ph] or a merchant basis we have the same relative presence for the combined company in Canada than we even do in Europe, which is why I singled out on the script this morning, I think the opportunities are right there too.","I would also say as I mentioned that PSD2 and strong customer penetration is now the Global land as of mid-September in Europe. While that's been \u2013 took the regulators have joined pushed the back to 12 months in terms of terms of implementation. I think that's good news good news for us. There's all sorts of matching that we can do in issuing and acquiring to get the hands authentication services in e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities that we also discussed with our partners in Europe a couple of weeks ago.","And there are even new opportunities David that I haven\u2019t considered such as enabling some of the bigger retail brands that TSYS has on the issuing side in Europe to become more of a payment facilitation mechanism and enabled around digital wallet using issuer and acquirer capabilities which is actually something I really haven't thought about in May, but certainly heard a loud and clear from some of the consumer brands who are already on TSYS when we were there a couple of weeks ago.","So, I would say David, sitting here today, I'm more optimistic than I was even back in May about what those opportunities are and in fact, at least one new sizable one has come to pass. I'd also reiterate what we said I think in the July or August call where Cameron and I mentioned which was we have a number of partners at Global Payments, FIs in Europe, and in Asia who've asked us about moving to TSYS on the issuer side.","These are large financial institutions and those conversations were had again when we were in Europe a couple of weeks ago. So, pretty optimistic on the combined business and where we're heading.","David Togut","Congratulations. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks, David.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of UBS. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. I was interpreting the commentary Jeff that you made around the consumer solutions and in particular Netspend. I was kind of indicating a renewed important strategically of that business to the combined entity going forward.","Is that a correct interpretation or you're just simply giving us more insight into how it fits into the broader integration strategy?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, Eric I think you're correct when you said. Let me just say that when we were doing diligence on that business in May, we were optimistic then. So, I don't know that it's a different point of view. I would just say that we looked at TSYS and each of the segments as being a very attractive partner for us.","And we certainly view there as - view us as having a differentiated strategy in Netspend versus the other public competitor. And I tried listing those in the prepared remarks. But just to reinforce it, number one, I think we have non-US opportunities, particularly in Europe to roll out the prepaid products.","And I think the market is right for that in those geographies and I would stay tuned on that in relatively short order. I think that is a differentiator for us. Number two, I do think there are a lot of revenue synergies coming out of Global Payments and Netspend. I\u2019ve listed two of those at my prepared remarks, but as you know Heartland is a very big presence, Xenial and SICOM, as Cameron mentioned in the restaurant channel. There's particular surge of used cases in restaurants for the Paycard and related services for Netspend.","And they also called out the gaming applicability where prepaid - and we\u2019re not the only ones doing this, but in prepaid, in light of the regulatory changes you've seen, in sports betting as well as the brands that we have in the gaming business, particularly, distinctive place on a combined basis with Global Payments and Netspend.","So I actually think it's a continuation Eric of the thesis we laid out in May. And we think we have pure line of sight to continue to enhance and grow the market opportunities of that business and that's something we're very excited about.","I\u2019d also say for all of our businesses, not Netspend, we assess all of our businesses continually. And that's not specific to any one of them. So, if we think there's a higher better use for everything that we're doing, we're obviously open-minded and we're all very focused on shareholder value.","But I would say that we have a very strong thesis that we think we have the ability to add a lot of value into all of our businesses, but in particular, in light of this question, in Consumer Solutions by adding B2B, by adding International applicability, and we intend to focus on it.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thank you for that. And if I may just follow-up one more on the synergies. Of the - you delineated for us the three primary areas where you anticipate them, but of the incremental synergies that you\u2019re underscoring today, can you give us an attribution of what they relate to with respect to those three buckets?","Cameron Bready","No. Eric it's Cameron. I'll jump in. I'd say they're probably roughly split between the three buckets. We've seen a little better opportunity across all three of the primary areas, we expect to realize synergies from the transaction an expense matter. I wouldn't want to point any particular item per se.","There\u2019s not one significant driver of that overall $25 million increase that we articulated on the call today. So it's little things here and there and it's probably across all three of the primary areas where we expect to realize synergies from the transaction.","Jeffrey Sloan","Eric, it's Jeff. I would just add to that. When you make a deal you make assumptions. You make assumptions in May, when you can see all the detail. These are experiences Cameron said before but what those things are.","But we now have the detail. We now have the plans. So the happy news is those assumptions proved to be conservative and we think we're run rate at a much higher level.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Your line is open.","Ramsey El-Assal","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the M&A environment. I know you did this deal and have a pretty attractive capital structure right now. What should we be thinking out in terms of timing?","And also what types of deals you're looking for? Could it be something in the future transformative or is it more series of tuck-ins? How should we take up frame of your M&A activity?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, Ramsey. It's Jeff. I would just say speaking from a strategic point of view I think our focus on M&A for the combined company really hasn't changed. So in terms of the types of deals that we're looking at, we\u2019re looking at geographic expansions. We're looking at end market scale consolidations.","You heard Desjardins today that we described, which is a market partnership in a business that we're already in. And of course, we're looking for more software and more vertical market solution. So I think the strategy as it relates to combined company, really hasn't changed all that much.","We\u2019re obviously opportunistic. But I would say sitting here today, we feel pretty good about where the pipeline is, where the pipeline is going to be. From a timing point of view, we obviously want to make sure. I think the balance sheet is a very happy place.","As Cameron alluded to 2.5 times leverage give us a lot of capability. I think among the three deals that were announced its lowest leverage among all three. But as I think about it this is as much as managerial question as anything else.","We want to make sure that in the next number of months all the stuff that we've laid out internally and externally that we're going to meet and even exceed those expectations.","And I think once we feel our sea legs are there and they were tracking in the right place, this won\u2019t be an issue of capital availability or balance sheet. I think we have we have we have those today.","Instead of say, hey, we're in a really good place, we're in a really good trajectory, we're very good managerially about where we are. So certainly as we head into 2020, if the capital markets stay favorable and our execution continues or accelerates on a path that it's in, I certainly think we're open for business.","Ramsey El-Assal","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. A quick follow-up on your wholesale business which I know for Legacy Global is an increasingly small part of your business and declining. I know TSYS had a slightly different strategy there.","And I am just curious in terms of the harmonization of those two approaches, how are you viewing that business kind of in a go-forward basis?","Cameron Bready","Yeah. Ram, it's Cameron. It's a really good question. We spent a lot of time as we bought the two merchant businesses together talking about that very topic. And what I would say is our strategy at Global Payments, obviously to your point is different than the way TSYS has approached sort of wholesale and direct channel historically.","I would start by saying for the combined business, it's a very small part of the overall combined business. And think as a given the size of merchant organization we're operating today, there's room for us to have a wholesale business. I don't know that we'll continue to try to grow it perhaps as aggressively as TSYS has grown it historically, but certainly I think there's a role for wholesale to play in the overall merchant business.","We want to continue to serve the customers and partners that we have in that channel extraordinarily well as I think we have historically. And I think we'll look to maintain that business without putting a lot of resources and deploying a lot of resources towards trying to grow it going forward.","I think you can be a part of the overall merchant business, again, without being a core part of where we\u2019re deploying resources trying to grow the business in the future.","Ramsey El-Assal","Got it. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Perlin","Hey, guys. Great result. I guess I had a question going back to kind of the original announcement and talking about this dual headquarter relationship. And I'm just wondering as we - you're pretty clear on the synergy target I think today.","But are you thinking about any opportunity to repurchasing the second location, is that contemplated in the cost synergy further down the road? Or is there some other use for that long-term that we could be thinking about?","Jeffrey Sloan","No, Dan. Its Jeff. We are dead-set on what we said at the time of the announcement which is we're fully committed to dual headquarters in Atlanta and Columbus. We have 5,000 fantastic team members in Columbus. We probably have in the Greater Atlanta area on a combined basis 1,000 or 1,250. So, Columbus is really the heart of the company.","At the end of the day, Columbus, of course, also is the heart of the issuer business where the two companies really don't overlap from a competitive point of view before we did the deal in the first place rather that's really more on the merchant segment.","So, we're fully committed to what we said. Columbus is an incredibly an important part of what the company is today and will be going forward and we're very committed to our team members there as well as the communities in which we live and work.","Dan Perlin","Got it. That's great. I just wanted to clarify a little bit on the TSYS reacceleration in merchant. I mean I know that the company seems like it was distracted in the second quarter, especially around merchant. I'm just wondering in addition to other things you mentioned, I mean is it just regained focus coming into this quarter as the deal closed?","And then you saw a better line of sight and so the people that were involved on the TSYS side selling those products just were reinvigorated or was there a bigger strategy that was kind of being put in place post, kind of, the second quarter which was a little bit disappointing?","Paul Todd","Yeah. So, as it relates to second quarter, we did have some kind of comp challenges year-over-year as it relates to kind of just the overall number for the second quarter. I would say we've had acceleration kind of as part of the deal and so that's been a nice tailwind as we've been able to bring kind of our teams together.","But from a - kind of a core underlying performance, we did have good underlying performance in 2Q albeit some headwinds from a comp challenge standpoint. We obviously did lose our leader in second quarter which also did lose our leader in second quarter which also had some effect there.","But we\u2019re glad to be in a position where that meaningfully accelerated in 3Q. And as Cameron mentioned, we are expecting further acceleration on that legacy business in Q4.","Cameron Bready","The only thing I would add to that Dan is we\u2019ve already aligned our go-to-market leadership teams across our integrated businesses here in the US market across our relationship channels in the US market.","Our key leaders in TSYS are now fully integrated into those overall leadership teams in those go-to-market channels. We feel very good about how we've come together as a go-to-market motion as a combined company and how the team is executing in the early days of putting those organizations together.","So, the momentum in the business is clearly there. We feel good about the pipeline as I highlighted earlier in the Q&A and certainly, feel like as we have more opportunity to work together, we have more opportunity to align our product strategies, our technology environment and our operating environment, there's obviously more momentum to continue to build as we go forward to 2020 and beyond.","Dan Perlin","That\u2019s great. Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","Thanks, guys, just coming back for money 2020 it does sound like pricing has been somewhat stable at least on the SMB side, if not actually better. And we actually did hear that there's still some opportunities on the TSYS side that were let\u2019s call it relatively underpriced. I know you have legacy on Heartland side.","So when we compare that in the end the other key trend, we are hearing one of the others is around paybacks. Companies enabling software to do more on their own which I guess underscores your strategy of buying in. But are you seeing that as well?","And just talk about what you really priced in around the opportunity on pricing upside into your guidance and your synergies? And is there more of an opportunity there? Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Yes. It\u2019s Cameron. I'll start, Darren. So I do think as we look across the TSYS portfolio over the course of time there may be some opportunity to rationalize pricing across the channels that we operate at Legacy Global Payments and TSYS collectively.","I wouldn\u2019t suggest that that's a meaningful aspect of how we think about driving revenue enhancements by combining our business. When we talk about revenue synergies and the merchant business, it's really across the opportunity, the cross-sell products and capabilities into our existing collective merchant basis.","Obviously, TSYS brings us I think some very attractive products in terms of the Vital POS solutions, the Genius platform and of course ProPay, which dives into the second part of your question as it relates to paybacks and enhanced capabilities in that channel in the US market.","So most of the revenue synergies we expect to drive from combining our two businesses are really around those particular cross-selling opportunities, bringing payroll into the existing TSYS base of customers.","Obviously, the Paycard capabilities the Netspend brings, we think provide a very attractive avenue for growth for the payroll business across our existing base of customers then of course bringing some of these solutions to International markets, we think creates other long-term opportunities for revenue enhancements in the overall merchant business. I\u2019ll maybe let Jeff ask - respond to you as it relates to the payback conversation that you raised.","Jeffrey Sloan","So, Darrin I would just say, this goes back to APT kind of 7.5 years ago we did that deal on August 2012. We really had not seen the advent of the bar ISOs to be honest in any of our businesses and any kind of meaningful way.","Part of what drove us toward the own software model was lots of worry about paypacks or ISOs are more focused on in those markets where it makes a significant difference like restaurant. We think we need to own the entire element of distribution.","So Cameron for example commented on trended venial SICOM, which has had a good year and we expect to have even a better year in 2020. We would not be in the position we are in today.","If we didn't know the hardware, software, drive through digital wallet functionality, we wouldn't be able to serve 20 of the top 40 QSRs, and have over 100,000 in the United States just full stop.","So, I think I was driven strategically less \u2013 what that paypack might do and more rather by the means and mode of competition in those businesses means that you need to sell all those things or you've been reduced to just selling commodities payments processing at the lowest possible price, which just is not that interesting from our point of view.","It\u2019s nice to hear that what you heard the conference is that the trend is coming our way. I do think we have a slightly different thesis though on why we think that's important strategically.","Darrin Peller","Okay. That's helpful just one quick follow up the, I mean, congrats on the city partnership. I just, because I just want to understand what exactly you\u2019re going to be executing there, is it more of a bank referral model that I mean historically you guys didn\u2019t really use as much I think, merchant bank referral, but maybe just explain what the Citi deal is all about?","Jeffrey Sloan","Sure, I am happy to do that. It's Jeff. That\u2019s the new initiative that's called Spring by Citi, so in essence, you can think about it as a referral deal, but as it relates to UCP specifically, so it\u2019s specific to the unified commerce product offering that we've been talking about for probably about a year now, specific to multinational customers on an omnichannel basis.","So, what\u2019s so exciting about this is, obviously, number one, Citi is a fantastic partner and number two, a very smart consumer and then the very, very sophisticated services. So, when they looked out in the landscape and asked who's got the very best technology and distribution capability on an omnichannel basis in the market that they care about, we're very fortunate to be in a position that they selected us.","So I think you should think about it as in an area that's high value add, very difficult to service for their most important largest, most complicated multinational customers in geographies both virtual and physical, that's something that we're very fortunate to be in the position to provide to Citi as part of the spring initiative.","So I think that just is further validation of the exceptionality of our technologies, particularly, in one of the most competitive markets that you can have, which is ecommerce and omnichannel business.","Darrin Peller","That's great. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks Darrin. On behalf of global payments, thank you very much in joining us - for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in us. And everybody have a Happy Halloween.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"10101":["Global Payments Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder today\u2019s conference will be recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane Elliott ","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Global Payments Fiscal 2015 conference call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour. Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; David Mangum, President and COO; and Cameron Bready, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during this conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and any subsequent filing. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.

","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Sloan, Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you Jane and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our strong performance in fiscal 2015, demonstrating another year of solid execution that resulted in substantial growth across our markets. For the year, we delivered reported revenue growth of 9% and grew cash earnings per share 18%. Additionally, we increased margins by 60 basis points, representing the first reported annual margin expansion since 2006. We expect continued positive momentum in fiscal 2016 as we execute our strategy to expand direct distribution, leverage our technology and prudently deploy capital. ","In fiscal 2015, we enhanced our geographic footprint by entering Australia and New Zealand with the addition of Ezidebit, and Ireland with the acquisition of Realex Payments. Coupled with our acquisition of the FIS Gaming Business in the United States, our 2015 acquisitions really augmented our product and technology capabilities and added significant additional distribution. ","We remain focused on expanding distribution in strategic markets globally. Together with our partner CaixaBank, we recently announced the Joint Venture with Erste Bank Group, one of the largest multi-national banks in Europe to provide merchant acquiring and payment services in the fast growing Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania markets. As we have said recently now is a favorable time to invest in Europe and we intend to leverage our proven sales capabilities products and technologies to drive accelerated growth. We look forward to generating attractive returns with our partners in these new direct markets. ","Fiscal 2015 was also an important year for successful launches of new product and services in the United States, including AmEx OptBlue, ApplePay and Global Shield and Edge Shield, our security solutions for EMV, tokenization and encryption. Our global footprint combined with our unified worldwide operating environment and scalable technology platform streamlines our ability to efficiently launch similar products into other markets. For example we were the first payment technology company to introduce AmEx OptBlue into Canada in June. We also launched Apple Pay in the United Kingdom earlier this month. ","We remain committed to providing our merchants with value added, innovating solutions, as we introduce today the technologies of tomorrow. We committed nearly $1 billion of capital in fiscal 2015. In addition to the nearly $600 million allocated to the previously noted acquisitions, we've returned almost $400 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to actively managing our capital base as we enter fiscal 2016. ","Now for quarterly highlights; we are delighted that our North American business continued to deliver solid results for the quarter. Our U.S. direct channels generated 13% organic revenue growth and Canada continued its steady performance in local currency, resulting from stable business fundamentals and effective execution. Our international results exceeded our expectations, primarily driven by organic performance in Europe. We continue to see double-digit volume and transaction growth in Spain for the quarter. ","Europe results also include the Realex acquisition that was completed at the end of March. As a reminder, Realex is a leading e-commerce and payment gateway technology provider in Europe. The Realex and Erste Bank transactions highlight our commitment to maintaining a pre-eminent position in Europe. ","Asia delivered consistent organic revenue growth. We also are delighted with our Ezidebit business which performed in-line with our expectations and we look forward to closing our joint venture with the Bank of the Philippines Islands. We expect our recent investments in Asia Pacific to enhance our rate of organic growth across those markets overtime. Looking ahead to this fiscal year and beyond we have completed the pivot towards the scale direct distribution model that we have been describing publicly for the last two years. ","Going forward we will now provide extra reporting metrics that better match the way we manage the business and provide for easier comparative analysis. We\u2019re also modifying and raising our expectations for revenue growth, margin and cash earnings per share growth over the next three to five year cycle based on the progress we have made in transforming our business. We now believe our organic net revenue growth will be in the mid to high single-digits, operating margins will be significantly raised on a net revenue basis with sustained expansion of up to 50 basis points per annum and we expect to deliver low to mid double-digit cash earnings per share growth annually. Now I will turn the call over to Cameron. ","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. I'm also pleased with our fiscal 2015 performance, particularly in light of the significant negative foreign currency impacts included in our reported results. For the full year total company reported revenue was $2.78 billion, a 9% increase over fiscal 2014. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was 12%. Cash operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 19.4% and diluted cash earnings per share increased 18% to $4.85. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 total company revenue was $707 million, reflecting growth of 5% over the prior year or 10% on a constant currency basis.","Operating margins for the quarter expanded 50 basis points to 18.6% and cash earnings per share increased to $1.22. Highlights for the quarter include the following; North America revenue growth was 4%, with operating income growth of 3% including the impacts of significant unfavorable currency trends in Canada. On a constant currency basis North American margins expanded by 30 basis points. U.S. revenue growth was 6% reflecting strong organic growth of 13% from our direct channels and low single-digit growth in our ISO channel. As a reminder our PayPros acquisition annualized at the beginning of the fourth quarter. ","Canada\u2019s revenue grew 5% in local currency, resulting from consistent execution and stable fundamentals. In U.S. dollars Canada\u2019s revenue declined 7% as a result of unfavorable currency exchange rates. International segment revenue growth was 6% in U.S. dollars with margin expansion of 310 basis points. On a constant currency basis Europe revenue growth in U.S. dollars was 19% while reported revenue growth was 1% as a result of exceptionally unfavorable currency exchange rate, particularly for the Europe. ","This performance continues to be fueled by strength in Spain as well as the addition of Realex during the quarter, offset by under performance in our Russian business. Asia Pacific revenue grew 27%, driven by mid-single digit organic revenue growth trends, in line with our expectations and the Ezidebit acquisition. International cash operating income grew 16% including the impact of significant foreign currency headwinds. ","We generated free cash flow of approximately $72 million this quarter and $371 million for fiscal 2015. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests. Capital expenditures totaled $36 million for the quarter and $93 million for the full year. During the quarter we purchased 1.3 million shares at an average price of $95.59 per share. Subsequent to the end of the quarter we settled our previously disclosed accelerated share repurchase program and retired an additional 162,000 shares. ","Lastly our total available cash, including working capital at the end of the year was approximately $195 million. Before moving to our fiscal 2016 outlook I would like to call attention to the new disclosures we are providing today. As Jeff noted these metrics are to better align our reporting with how we managed and measure our performance internally, as well as provide for improved comparability with our peers.","First, we were introducing a new net revenue disclosure that reflects the economic benefits of certain wholesale lines of business, such as our ISOs on a net basis. We will now deduct gross-up related payments associated with these channels from our GAAP revenues and operating expenses. This disclosure does not impact our cash operating income or diluted cash earnings per share, but will affect our cash operating margins.","Further for fiscal 2016 and beyond we are modifying our reporting convention for cash earnings to exclude expenses associated with share based compensation. As noted we believe this will provide for improved comparability with our peers. Going forward we intend to both guide and report, utilizing our net revenue metric and our new cash earnings convention. In addition operating margins will be presented on a net revenue basis. For convenience we have provided fiscal 2015 results including quarterly data consistent with this methodology on schedule 10 to our earnings press release.","Now let's turn to our fiscal 2016 outlook. We expect our annual fiscal 2016 net revenue to grow 6% to 8% from fiscal 2015 and range from $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion. Note that this growth rate is approximately 300 basis points higher on a constant currency basis or 9% to 11%. We expect cash earnings per share to grow 11% to 15% from fiscal 2015 and range from $5.60 to $5.78. We also believe cash operating margins calculated on a net revenue basis will expand by as much as 30 basis points in fiscal 2016 on a constant currency basis.","Actual cash operating margins on a net revenue basis are likely to be roughly flat due to the impacts of unfavorable foreign currency trends. On a GAAP basis we expect annual reported revenue to grow 4% to 6% in range from $2.87 billion to $2.95 billion. Again this growth rate is approximately 300 basis points higher on a constant currency basis or 7% to 9%.","As a reminder one of our larger ISO partners was acquired in June 2014 and our outlook assumes this ISO will begin migrating off our platform in calendar 2016. Although this impacts our GAAP revenue for the year, it is not expected to have a material impact on our net revenue, operating income or cash earnings per share. In fact our ISOs in the aggregate are becoming an increasingly small portion of our business. For fiscal 2016 we expect our ISOs to represent approximately 17% in North American net revenue and 13% of North America operating income and roughly 11% of total company net revenue and 8% of total company operating income.","We anticipate the distribution of quarterly cash earnings per share as a percentage of annual cash earnings per share to be roughly consistent with that of fiscal 2015. With respect to the more detailed assumptions that underlie this outlook, net revenue for our North America segment is expected to grow at a mid to high single digit rate which includes FX headwinds of approximately 200 basis points.","U.S. net revenue growth, which reflects ongoing strength in our direct businesses and the addition of our FIS acquisition which closed on June 1st is expected to be in the high single to low double-digit range. Canadian net revenue growth assumptions remain in the low single-digits in local currency. We expect North America cash operating income to increase in the mid to high single digit range compared to last year. North American margins are expected to expand in fiscal 2016 despite the anticipated FX headwinds from Canada.","We anticipate that international net revenues will grow at a mid to high single-digit rate in U.S. dollars, including currency exchange head winds across all markets, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2016. We anticipate these FX headwinds will impact growth by approximately 500 to 600 basis points for the year. We expect margins to be roughly consistent to down modestly largely due to currency impacts. We expect annual net revenue growth for Europe on a U.S. dollar basis could be low single-digit; but high single to low double-digits on a constant currency basis.","Asia is expected to deliver U.S. dollar revenue growth in the high teens driven by the addition of BPI and Ezidebit which annualizes in October. International expectations include impacts from the Realax acquisition and the BPI transaction which is expected to close towards the end of the first quarter. However our outlook does not include the announced joint venture with Erste Bank which we do not expect to have a material impact on the company\u2019s fiscal 2016 cash earnings per share or capital plans.","For fiscal 2016 we expect share-based compensation expense being excluded from cash earnings to amount to approximately $0.20 per share, roughly the same as fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate is projected to approach 27% and our diluted weighted average share count is expected to approach 66 million shares for the year. Consistent with past practice our guidance does not include any future share repurchases.","Lastly we anticipate that fiscal 2016 capital expenditures will total approximately $105 million. For fiscal 2016 we will continue our disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment. Consistent with that strategy our Board of Directors approved an additional $300 million share repurchase authorization which expands our total capacity to approximately $400 million and further demonstrates our ongoing commitment to prudent capital management on behalf of our shareholders.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you, Cameron. Building on the solid foundation from fiscal 2014 we delivered yet another year of strong results in fiscal 2015. As our fiscal 2016 and new cycle guidance suggest we remain committed to accelerating growth across our markets. We have now completed our pivot toward direct distribution. We are confident that we can attain our heightened net revenue, cash operating margin and cash earnings per share growth goals even though the bar continues to be raised.","We believe our positive momentum, ability to successfully execute on our growth strategies and capital deployment capabilities will continue to drive value for our shareholders, partners, customers and employees. Before I turn the call back over to Jane we will be hosting an Investor Conference in Atlanta on October 20th. More details regarding this event will be forthcoming soon. We hope to see you all there. Jane?","Jane Elliott","Thank you. Before we begin the question-and-answer session I would like to ask everyone to limit their question to one with one follow-up in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. And operator we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. I will ask first on Canada maybe, just been doing some research there. I heard the low single-digit outlook for the year. I am curious what the spread assumption is for guidance, or what the spread dynamics are today given some of the changes going on there?","Cameron M. Bready","Hey Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Cameron, good morning. I would say for Canada for fiscal \u201816 the outlook is roughly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the last probably two years. Canada for us continues to be a stable market, which is really the combination of transaction growth and spread and we expect that trend to continue as we look forward to fiscal \u201916. For \u201815 as you noted I think we performed a little better than our guidance, which is low single-digits growth in local currency, but as we roll into \u201816 I think we still view Canada as a low single-digit growth market in local currency and that\u2019s going to be the combination of stable transaction volumes and spreads over the course of time.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it, and I heard the new targets, make sense. The sustained margin expansion of the 50 bps is that primarily just coming from better incremental margin business from the direct channel you are building on and did I hear correctly that in \u201816 you are looking for 30 bps in constant currency, if so what\u2019s delta between the 30 and the longer term 50?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, Tien-tsin it\u2019s Jeff. I will start and then Cameron will join in on the \u201816 guidance. So the answer to question is yes. It\u2019s from a better mix of businesses as well as leveraging our infrastructure and our technology platforms. So if you look at first the fiscal \u201815 results for the U.S. direct business organically we're really in the double-digits organic revenue growth all year in fiscal '15 in U.S. direct. And as Cameron guided for '16 we expect that to continue. ","So we invested pretty substantially across our businesses but in particular in the United States on the direct business. Now I think we're reaping the benefits of having made that investment. I'd also say that we talked in our prepared remarks about our unified operating structure we put in a place the last couple of years as well as new product development. So of course Tien-tsin you know we've been very successful with American Express OptBlue here in the United States and now also we've rolled out in June in Canada. ","So we think if those things give us sustained accelerated growth in the United States and North America with better margin characteristics Tien-tsin than the corporate average. Cameron you want to talk about the guidance?","Cameron M. Bready","Sure, just a couple things to note on the guidance. So as we said our cycle guidance is up to 50 basis points annually. For this year we're guiding up 30 basis points on a constant currency basis for margins. A couple of things to note about '16 in particular, one is, is it\u2019s July. So I would bear that in mind as you contemplate the guidance we're providing. Secondly, we did a lot of transactions in fiscal '15. Now there is a fair amount of integration work that\u2019s still ongoing with respect to those transactions including Ezidebit. We closed the FIS gaming business on June 1st, we have a couple of other transaction we expect to close during the year. So in the near term, obviously as we're integrating those businesses there is a little bit of headwind on margins but we are still able to grow through that and expand margins through that. So I think it positions us well for fiscal '17 and beyond. ","Tien-tsin Huang","Understood, thanks for detail. ","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks Tien-tsin. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. ","David J. Koning","Yeah, hey guys, thanks for all that disclosures, super helpful and good job. And I guess my first question is just the UK interchange adjustments that are coming on in December, is that really much in the guidance, it didn't look like in Europe you're guiding to anything overly aggressive. So I'm just wondering if that was kind of in there in or not. ","Cameron M. Bready","Dave, it's Cameron. I would say yes, it's in there. The important thing to recognize about Europe is just the impacts of FX headwinds in fiscal '16 that is having an impact on the local currency growth that we would otherwise expect to realize for the year. As we said for Europe, we expect low single digit revenue growth for fiscal '16. On a constant currency basis that's going to be high-single digit. So that's really going to be driven by what you're expecting in the UK in the back half of the year with the benefit of the lower interchange regulations coming into play. ","As well as, as you remember we\u2019ve annualized the benefits we've seen in Spain come at the end of the first quarter. So that obviously is a grow-over that we have for the back half of the year as well. So when you balance those things out on a local currency basis we would expect high single digit revenue growth in Europe, which is I think accelerated from what we have seen largely led by the strength in the UK on the heels of the benefits of the EU regulation coming into effect. ","David J. Koning","Okay, no, that's helpful. And I guess my follow up question separately the ISO business -- the net revenue presentation now you said it's 11% of total revs this year and about 8% of EBIT. I would have actually thought that on a net basis that ISO processing business was a really high margin above the company average but obviously it's below given it's less of an operating income percent than revenue. So I'm just -- I would have thought like 40% margins maybe you can just talk a little bit about the margin dynamics. ","Cameron M. Bready","Yeah some of it is the convention that we're utilizing for addressing the business. So we're backing out residuals but assessments are not being backed out. So that's part of the reason that the margin profile maybe a little bit different than you would expect perhaps on paper. So I think that's part of the driver. I think on a wholesale basis the margins aren\u2019t terrible dissimilar to what we see from our retail basis business around the globe. But it is probably a little bit wider when the assessments are in revenue as we brought them. ","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, David, it's Jeff I would just add to that. As you think about where we\u2019ve been investing especially in the United States with the OpenEdge, those are very high margin businesses, the direct business we've been investing in. So OpenEdge Gaming for example in the United States and then of course we said this at the time when we invested in Ezidebit in Australia and New Zealand, but Dave I think we said that would have about 40% margins at the time that we did the deal a year ago. ","So I think that we have the happy answer of having significant investment and expansion of our businesses with very attractive margins. And that's how we look at it Dave rather than so much the ISO businesses in one place, I would say the other businesses that are growing very quickly has a far better profile than the average. ","David J. Koning","Great. Well thanks, good job. ","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks Dave. ","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks Dave. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citibank. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar ","Thank you guys and congratulations for good solid results here. My first question is on capital deployment. So you guys mention that you will be focused on integration of the deals already completed or in progress. Would that then imply that you are less focused on M&A, that the M&A outlook is maybe muting out a little bit and any incremental thoughts on capital structures?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah Ashwin it\u2019s Jeff. So we've announced I think it\u2019s five acquisitions now, in the last twelve or thirteen months, but we still have a very full pipeline, particularly in Europe and Asia. So I would say that we don't see any diminution in the outlook for M&A. Of course as we said it takes the right partner in all these transactions but I wouldn't look at any of the announcements we've made or statements to indicate it\u2019s anything other than kind of full steam ahead on the capital deployment.","Ashwin Shirvaikar ","Okay. And if Cameron, if you could walk us through sort of the -- a lot of moving parts here, so the year-over-year comparison of what goes on with FX, with the acquisitions, with the changeover of the accounting, if you could kind of give us a bridge? You might have had that if so I missed it up, I apologize but if you could give us a bridge of how do you get from the exit growth rate to sort of full year growth rate for the next year?","Cameron M. Bready","Sure. I'll be happy to, let me start with just providing a couple of specific indications in details in case you didn\u2019t capture them in my prepared comments. First of all you were guiding to net revenue growth of 6% to 8% which is really 9% to 11% on a constant currency basis. So to me that's the right sort of starting point for the conversation is 9% to 11% number on an adjusted net revenue basis. So I think as you think about the way we've been talking about our direct distribution business this year that 9% to 11% is fairly consistent with the growth that we've seen in the direct distribution business throughout the course of fiscal '15. ","So when we look at the organic normalized growth rates, 15% to 16% they are going to be roughly the same, they are 7% to 8% on a constant currency basis depending on the quarter which aligns, I think very well with the organic growth we've been generating in the business on a normalized basis this year. So I think the growth trends are very much intact year-over-year. You're obviously there is a lot of moving pieces as you correctly described but when you normalize for all the transactions and you address currency you're going to see a normalized organic growth rate in the 7% to 8% quarter-to-quarter and we feel like that is obviously a trajectory that we can continue to achieve as we push forward in time. ","I am happy to address any other specific questions but that would be my general comment about how we look at fiscal '16.","Ashwin Shirvaikar ","No, that's very helpful, thanks.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Perlin","Thanks, and good morning. The kind of longer term cycle guidance from margins of 50 basis points per annum, I was wondering if you could, I guess maybe help conceptualize how we build up to the 50? Are you contemplating the ability to have more pricing opportunities long term, just given kind of the nature of the industry or is it that you really feel as though you've got kind of the economies of scale and you can drive your unit cost down to have the confidence to have 50 basis points, or is it just an incremental mix benefit as well. I know you're going to say all but if you could parse it, that would be helpful.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, Dan, it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll start and ask David to join in too in a moment. So the first thing I\u2019d say is on a comparable basis that you look at \u201815 over \u201814 we would've seen a very similar margin expansion similar [ph] to the 50 basis points that we're describing today on a constant currency basis. So I really, first view Dan is an extrapolation of how the company\u2019s been operating for the last couple of years kind of point number one. ","Point number two, in our business the margin economics are very good in what we do. So we tend to think that the vast majority of an incremental dollar of revenue for 80% tends to fall through our bottom line as an operating matter. So of course the faster we grow the more transactions that we do generally the higher the margins and the more profitable that we are. That\u2019s particularly true as we pivoted more toward direct distribution and more of the retail business in a way a bit [ph] from the historical legacy of the company as they -- as a wholesale business. ","So those things lifted margin in '15 over '14 and we expected to lift margins '16 over '15. We've also been benefiting from the investments we've made in product and technology. David you want to talk a little bit for example some of the things you've done at product?","David E. Mangum ","I'll happy to, Dan. When you think about the cycle it becomes a fairly easy conversation around the operating company piece as the guys described in the prepared comments. As we operate as one company, we've the opportunity to drive products and drive additional leverage all across the company as we make progress. So for example the one we talked about before is American Express OptBlue, which has rolled out brilliantly in the United States. It's beginning its roll out in Canada after a very good start. It will find its way to Europe over time as well as you know and eventually to Asia. ","We've a similar inventory of products like that, that we expect to help us drive growth and drive incremental profitability over the next several years. At the same time we have the opportunity to operate the company more efficiently with the same paradigm, whether that's operations credit risk and again even product and product development. So those pieces come together nicely and then we're working closely with all the businesses around the world to roll out what I would call global capabilities or things like integrated payments and omni-channel ecommerce. You saw us purchase Realex to add to our stable of products to be able to drive any kind of transaction anywhere in time. That kind of omni-channel processing is where we are going to drive enormous amount of highly profitability growth we believe over the next several years. ","And then finally maybe the most apparent one to you, as you look at, particularly our U.S. results today is the success in integrated payments. There we\u2019re driving continued organic mid-teens volume out of the open edge business in United States and the Ezidebit bussiness in Australia and New Zealand with the ability to expand those globally. Right now we are working hard on taking that sort of dedicated ecosystem of partners, lead generation and sales closure into Canada as we speak and really it's exciting for us right now. One of our largest partners in the United State is expanding with us in the United Kingdom as we speak. ","So you can see the beginnings of a global approach to integrated payments. That's really something unique that only Global Payments can do right now.","Dan Perlin","Great and then just quickly on the recently announced JV, I'm just wondering, I know it's not going to -- doesn\u2019t sound like it's going to be material in '16, but with like Asia and the other opportunities that you have built out is there other parts of like the portfolio that we are just not paying attention to that could also be bolted on into other JV's, to make them more meaningful in '16 and then is there opportunity to kind of leverage your legacy MUZO business given that the Czech Republic has always been kind of a hit or miss market for you guys? Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, Dan. It's Jeff. I think the answer is absolutely part of the guidance around '16 is that we need three regulatory approvals in three different jurisdictions. As it relates to Erste, our Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. So it's a little bit of just to get pre-approval takes a little more time Dan. So I think it\u2019s less a comment about the economics of the transaction and more a comment of that will take us a little more than we typically we do, and obviously we'll be updating that as we get closer. But that's one answer. ","The second thing I would say is absolutely if you look at what you refer to as MUZO, when we call Global Payments Europe. Today that is a business prior to the Erste JV that was 90% what I would call indirect add, meaning our customer was the bank but not the merchant and 10% direct, meaning 10% of the business has the merchant as the bank customer. Pro forma for the JV that's pretty much closer to 50-50. ","So if you think Dan what we've tried to do here and the rest of our businesses globally, but especially here in the United States, we spent over a $1 billion of capital in the last several years migrating to more of a retail business and a direct merchant relationship business for all the reasons that you are familiar with. We think we are doing the same thing now with GPE. So if we can continue that trajectory and turn into more of a direct business, a very opportune time in Europe where the common European payments area, with cost coming down for our customer base, while the exchange rate in this area going in our favor, we think we have the ability to create a really meaningful cross border omni-channel business the way David described it a few minutes ago strategically. We think it's a very, very important step for us and our GPE cohorts.","David E. Mangum ","I think Dan, it\u2019s David I would say one other thing. I think we have a pretty good track record of taking ventures like this, integrating them, migrating platforms as appropriate so we can lever the product and drive the kind of direct distribution we believe we were good at operating around the world and then driving increasing returns and actually the same pattern for that deal as has been for our previous deals.","Dan Perlin","Great. Thank you guys.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn Greene ","Thanks, good morning.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Good morning.","Glenn Greene ","First question, I just wanted to touch on open edge specifically APT and PayPros, maybe get an update there, are they sort of still tracking toward high teens revenue growth and I know you had the integration of PayPros going on and sort of dragged down margins for a bit, but more specific within fiscal \u201816 how should we think about the aggregate margin profile for the open edge business?","David E. Mangum ","Glenn, it\u2019s David. And I think you put your finger on the correct metrics. At the end of the day we believe we\u2019re going to drive organic mid-teens to high-teens volume and revenue growth in Open Edge as we\u2019ve done since we first purchased Open Edge three years ago and we added PayPros to it but first -- excuse me APT three years ago and add PayPros to it a little over a year ago. So that business is right on track with U.S. performance. It is actually fully integrated, we got some platform work to do but at a sales force level, the piece of it that drives the initial sale and net organic growth, fully integrated and operating as one unit as we roll into 2016 which allows us now to think about the global expansion of Open Edge that I described a little bit earlier in answer to Dan\u2019s question, as we complete our migration into Canada and actually think about other markets in Europe going forward.","Glenn Greene ","Okay, and then Jeff I know previous to the change in the -- adjusted revenue reporting you had been talking about a long-term operating margin goal of 25% and obviously with the change in reporting that could kind of blow that out of the water but how should we be thinking about the long-term, and I know you\u2019ve talked about the 50 basis points annually but is there sort of a reasonable expectation over a five year period where you think aggregate margins could go to?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, Glenn it\u2019s a great question. So I think I can get to the low 30s. So yesterday\u2019s mid-20s Glenn is probably tomorrow\u2019s low 30s.","Glenn Greene ","Okay. And then the final question just to level set us all, on a GAAP revenue guide perspective how much is the Mercury drag?","Cameron M. Bready","Glenn it\u2019s Cameron. We haven\u2019t specifically sort of identified in our guidance how much of drag Mercury migration will be in fiscal \u201916. We expect them to begin migrating in the first part of calendar \u201916. So the back half of our fiscal year. I think the way I would characterize it is the range that we have provided, I think accommodates a variety of outcomes for Mercury, from they migrate fairly quickly at the beginning of calendar \u201816 to they migrate more slowly and tend to be off more towards the middle of calendar \u201816. ","So I think that\u2019s part of the reason we have a little wider range on the GAAP revenue is to accommodate a variety of outcomes on Mercury.","Glenn Greene ","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok with KBW. Your line is open.","Steven Kwok ","Thanks guys, good quarter. I just have one quick question. Just around given some of your peers, maybe one of your larger peers maybe looking to go public by the end of this year, can you talk about the competitive landscape within the space today and do you envision that changing once your peer is public? Thanks.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, Steven it\u2019s Jeff, that\u2019s a good question. So no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change all that much. I would say that first of all across all of our businesses and our markets we operate in a very competitive environment. That\u2019s been true for very long time and I expect that to continue to be true kind of point number one. Point number two, I think it\u2019s nothing but good news for us and I think for our peers to have more public comparable data points for you and our analysts and also for our shareholders. We think we are pretty transparent with the way that we provide our disclosure. As you can see today we\u2019ve supplemented that, so that we can provide you more disclosure around how we are operating. ","We think that compares very favorably to existing public companies and new public companies. So as I would say our peers performing well on a comparable basis is really good for the industry and really good for us.","Steven Kwok ","And then just as a follow up. In terms of what are the specific regions that you guys compete in?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, so you are right in what you said Steven it does vary by geography. So I think operating [ph] regionally is the right way to go about it. So for example here in United States it\u2019s largely day in, day out First Data, U.S. bank for [indiscernible] and then a number of the First Data joint ventures, certainly DAA merchants services Wells Fargo and the like is a good partner for us too but I would say it\u2019s largely bank driven and of course First Data too with a number of our bank partnerships as well as Vantiv although I would say that everyone of those companies, I just mentioned has a slightly different strategy than we view, but it\u2019s certainly across the board those are our peers in United States. ","In Canada of course Moneris has the largest share in that market which is you know the two banks. In Europe it tends to be country specific but certainly United Kingdom it\u2019s [indiscernible] and Barclays, constantly it varies by country, Caixa and our Comercia joint venture has a leading share in that market but certainly [indiscernible] there and BBVA would be examples of peers in that market. ","And then Asia Steve, it\u2019s really market by market. It\u2019s kind of hard to say. We certainly see banks like Citibank in a number of those markets. In the Philippines where we've announced our BPI joint venture it\u2019s [indiscernible] BVO who\u2019s got the largest market share there. We have the second largest post the consummation of our JV. So as you can tell by all the different names Steven it really varies by market.","Steven Kwok ","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, good morning, guys. Cameron, I was just hoping you would go through the international margin expectations for fiscal year '16 again. Sounds like there is some FX that has an impact and then maybe you could just break it out between Europe and Asia Pacific?","Cameron M. Bready","Sure Bryan, it\u2019s Cameron. We haven't provided sort of the disaggregated margins by Asia Pacific and Europe, but I will try to give you a little bit color on those. If you look at the international margins on a net revenue basis kind of year-over-year we did guide to roughly flat to slightly down. That's largely due to potential impacts of FX in fiscal '16, that's included in our outlook. The other thing I would note is those margins are in the low to mid-40s. So in fairness when you're at margin levels at that range, again maintaining those margins, I think is a fantastic outcome. ","Obviously we'll see a little bit of FX pressure on that, but again we do expect them to be roughly consistent, may be down modestly year-over-year but not dramatically. As it relates to Asia and Europe in particular, I think Europe\u2019s where we're going to see the most pressure largely from FX as I mentioned before. I think Asia margins we expect to expand largely due to the continued contribution of the Ezidebit now in the Asia Pacific region which has a higher margin profile as described earlier relative to our sort of business as usual Asia Pacific business, that's operating in 11 Asian markets. ","So from an Asia point of view I think the combination of both Ezidebit and the introduction of the BPI joint venture will do a couple of things, one is accelerate growth and then importantly continue to improve the margin profile in the Asia Pacific region.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And when you are thinking about then longer term about the 50 basis points on a constant currency basis, is that mostly coming in from the North American side versus international, since international already had such high operating margins?","Cameron M. Bready","I think that's probably a fair characterization. If you look at the North American business now and you look at the U.S. business in particular, our largest business and a net revenue basis in the U.S. is now Open Edge. It\u2019s approaching $300 million of annual revenue, growing in the mid-teens. So the US business on a net revenue basis is going to be roughly $1 billion. 75% of that is direct and the largest portion of that is Open Edge. And that is where we're seeing a lot of margin expansion in the business coming from mix, in addition to all the other things that Jeff and David described earlier around how we're operating the business on a global scale, how we're innovating new products and services that are higher margin relative to the traditional economics of the business. ","All that's factoring into the margin expansion we expect to realize but a lot of that is going to come from North America and principally the U.S.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Great, thanks and congrats on the results.","Cameron M. Bready","That's Bryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg ","Thanks guys. Good morning. I just wanted to start making sure I\u2019ve got the pieces of the bridge from the 6% to 8% revenue growth guidance for fiscal '16 from the 11% to 15% on the bottom line. I know you said there\u2019s about 300 bps of FX headwind on revenue, so not sure how much of that also makes it down to the EPS line, because I know on a reported basis you're looking for kind of flattish margins and you're not building any more share buy back into the EPS guide. So can we just walk through that bridge?","Cameron M. Bready","Sure. It\u2019s Cameron and I will start and ask David or Jeff to add in any additional color. You're right on where you started. We are sort of 6% to 8% on a FX adjusted basis for net revenue growth year-over-year. We are expecting margins on an FX adjusted basis to be roughly flat. And obviously then on an op income basis we are expecting kind of mid to high single digit growth on op income. So we are driving up income growth that is incremental to our net revenue growth, due to the mix of the businesses where FX is having an impact and where it is not. That's obviously dropping to the bottom line in addition to share repurchases we've executed in \u201815 that we will fully annualize in \u201816 are helping to drive the incremental cash earnings per share above and beyond the top line revenue growth and operating income growth that we\u2019re forecasting.","David E. Mangum ","Yeah, and the other pieces Jason, this is David again are really the cross sales and the additional product roll outs I was describing earlier. The ability to roll out OptBlue into Canada, to lock in the kind of local currency growth we have, locking the profit improvement, setting aside FX entirely for a moment, that sets up then how we deal with the FX adjusted growth. Same with the Realex and the omni-channel sales will do across the UK and then across the rest of the Europe, eventually as well and I\u2019ll set this up for highly leverageable, highly leveraged growth over the middle term to long-term and even we\u2019ll see some of those benefits from Open Edge on some of the other businesses including Ezidebit in the short-term in \u201816 to setup then the parameters that Cameron just walked you through.","Jason Kupferberg ","Okay. And then just as a follow-up given the huge presence you guys have in the SMB market in the U.S., I wanted to get your perspective on EMV roll out within that merchant base, what you are kind of seeing now what you are expecting as we kind of get to the quasi finish line here in October and then beyond because part of our thesis has been that between EMV and Apple Pay and other mobile payment solutions a lot of the merchant acquirer and processors have been embracing more of kind of a technology led consolidated sales approach as opposed to just going in and bidding on processing. So what\u2019s your perspective on that?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, our perspective aligns almost perfectly the way you just described Jason. At the end of the day you are seeing some fundamental changes. They start with the fact that this is a merchant choice, at the end of the day. So you need the help of your technology provider you are acquiring traditional terms to help you think that through, think through the business case for your industry and for your particular business, and also relieve you with a burden of dealing with all the security issues that happen in our industry, so you can focus on running your business. I love the way you phrased the question because this really is all about SMEs at the end of the day. The large merchants will make their own choice of their own point of sale devices. ","So for us we\u2019ve obviously been deploying -- for quite some time it\u2019s about enabling EMV terminal space, we\u2019re really comfortable with our progress, we\u2019re rolling through the upgrade to technologies, we\u2019re the certification you might imagine. But really what we\u2019re trying to do is help our customers think about their own security needs overall. EMV is just the piece of the puzzle. So we\u2019re selling through Global Shield which is the security solution we have for our direct business and the edge shield, which is the solution we have for the integrated business, a suite of security solutions that you can tailor to your business. ","The point-to-point encryption EMV, token, token vault and obviously come with whatever is appropriate in terms of PCI compliance and then you really do perform that consultative role as out of the town [ph] dealing with small merchants it\u2019s a one on one conversation helping them think through what to do and when. So setting aside any metrics as I said before we\u2019re very comfortable with our progress to-date but at the end of the day we\u2019re actually gaining a little share, nominally particularly in integrated because we were among the first to roll out integrated security solutions, we can take across that base. ","And really that\u2019s the sale we\u2019re making for the long-term as well. It\u2019s that relationship based sale where we\u2019re driving a serious value proposition that allows them to focus on running their business, whether it\u2019s a pharmacy or a vet or any other sort of vertical and let us focus on the complexity of payments, let us help you deal with Apple Pay, Samsung, Android all the rest of the pieces you might imagine in this evolving technology world and you\u2019ve heard us use the phrase technology-led distribution, technology-enabled distribution that\u2019s the business we run today, you are exactly right Jason.","Jason Kupferberg ","Okay, I appreciate the comments.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore SIS. Your line is open.","David Togut","Thank you, good morning. What are some of the acquisition opportunities Jeff that arise from the new regulatory reforms in Europe? In particular how do the interchange caps for example affect a bank\u2019s ability to stay in the merchant acquiring business as opposed to considering a portfolio or so?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah it\u2019s a great question, David. So first we got a real live example from yesterday which is the announced Erste JV in continents like Europe. So most banks run the acquiring business together with the issuing business. So David as the interchange caps come on board in the most markets in Europe that\u2019s going to be early December, given the EU adoption of those rules. It means David on one side of the ledger they will be losing potential revenue and fees as interchange comes down on the issuing side. Therefore as they look at their portfolio of businesses that they have won in cards they then look at the acquiring side and depending on the acquiring nature of their market if they can find the right partner there is an opportunity they would hope and we expect to be able to grow the acquiring business more quickly to offset any diminution on the interchange side of the issuing business. ","So for those banks who choose to exit, they've made the decision that they don't think they can grow more quickly, or haven\u2019t found the right partner. But for those banks David, like Caixa in Spain with whom we did the JV in 2010, or in particular Erste with whom we and Caixa now did yesterday, I think they have made the decision that if I can grow my acquiring business more quickly, benefit from the changes in the EU market place with rates coming down, having a common acceptance area, perhaps I could offset or even grow my overall card business to offset the interchange hit coming on the issuing side and that's how it works.","David E. Mangum ","And maybe at the other end of panel, David, it\u2019s David, to do with the partner in terms of thinking through the ramifications of the technology, the platforms that deal with that complex regulatory environment. You are asking a lot of legacy platforms inside of banks. So the idea of dealing with the partner we can actually leverage that same technology platform capability across the globe is really an attractive situation on the other side.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","That's certainly [ph], the level of investment as we heard in the last couple of questions, David in terms of new technology and compliance has only gone up. So if you partner the change in interchange on the issuing side with what David just said, which is that the bar continues to be raised makes it great difficult from most traditional financial institutions, especially in countries in Europe to really go it alone.","David Togut","Is yours the transaction, the beginning of a longer term trend much the way we saw banks in the U.S. sell their merchant portfolio starting about 30 years ago?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yeah, I believe it is, David. I mean for a long time and you've been in the industry for as long as we've been. I think for a long time we've been talking about this type of partnership possibility in Europe. But now I think we've seen it in the case of yesterday with Erste and now I think we've seen it come to fruition and I think what's driving that as much as anything is what we just talked out a minute ago which is the common European payments area coupled with technology and compliance team with the banks. So this is one of the number of discussions we are in with banks in Europe and of course we've also announced the partnership with the Bank of Philippines Islands, [indiscernible] by market cap in the Philippines to do the very same things. So I do believe that we're in the sweet spot. What I expect to see to be further JV's across Europe.","David Togut","Understood, thank you very much.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Willi from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Tim Willi ","Thanks and good morning, two questions. The first one was if you could just give an update on Brazil and Latin America in general the sort of how you are feeling about that operation,","David E. Mangum ","Tim it's David. Thanks for asking about Brazil. We feel actually pretty good about it. We are actually up to about 10,000 merchants. It's growing really quite rapidly. We are adding distribution partners at a steady pace and as you know that's really the key for driving organic growth in that market. We are obviously still quite small at 10,000 merchants when we were zero not really longer. We are very happy with that progress. ","We also have a new technology platform that we rolled out few months ago and really we're very happy with the product suite and particularly I'm happy with our e-commerce capabilities in that market, because I think that's really the place where we can drive growth as opposed to fighting it out merchant by merchant for brick and mortar business and we feel like we are very well positioned with the e-commerce platform to add additional products on top of that. So really we feel in very good and we are exploring other markets around Latin America really fits into the same answer Jeff gave earlier about M&A and opportunities. ","Latin America is a key geography for us with our partner Caixa as well, as you might imagine. So much more come on Latin America over time, but we very happy with progress to-date in Brazil.","Tim Willi","Great and my follow-up was around sort of e-commerce and omni-channel. You talked a lot about how you are positioning Europe with recent acquisitions. I'm sure it's in the U.S. aside you think about your role either in the direct channel and if you are sort of the integrated payments channel in software is opening up opportunities as those customers that are using the software trying to find cross channel capabilities as they build out sort of e-commerce or virtual businesses on top of physical locations and to what degree I guess also do you hear from your acquirers any opportunities or asking you to advance your capabilities as they hear that from their own customers, give us the sort of the feel on the ground. Is there anything there going on that we should think about?","David E. Mangum ","Yeah, there is, actually it\u2019s a great question, a thoughtful question. The core of the integrated payments industry tends to be face-to-face transactions where you've integrated the payment technology with the software, someone obviously is helping that small business person run his or her business. What\u2019s buried below that and we don't talk about it a lot but it really will be a key source of growth for us over the next couple of years and integrated in United States and globally is the any, any, any nature of payments, the payments they are having increasingly at restaurants and retailers, small ones around the country. ","So the enablement of present capability, the enablement of any sort of omni-channel payment will really go fuel incremental transaction growth we don't see today as well as the key part of the value preposition to the merchants we're thinking about really working with consumers in the new paradigm today, they are no longer walking in doing a research on a mobile device maybe not transact on that device because certainly at mobile device is not a great experience today, but it\u2019s improving that, allowing them to come in and do the brick and mortar transaction or do it in house but they are also improving the mobile as a core part of the product. ","So when you think of the assets, we're putting together around the world the marriage of integrated plans, the software that helps the small business person manages our business and the ability to accept and process and manage the fraud compliance and security payment in any channel really is a powerful set of capabilities we're putting together and that's the undercurrent when I talk about the leverage of product and technologies around the world at the time that helps us to support the sizeable guidance that Jeff and Cameron are talking, about all that coming together is really the underpinnings of what we are talking about with this confidence in our cycle guidance.","Tim Willi","Great, that's very helpful. Thanks so much for your time.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe address the cadence of operating margins as you head across fiscal '16. You mentioned mix and some of the potential synergies from the acquisitions as being two possible drivers, but are there any other things we should think about in terms of how operating margins progress over the course of the year?","Cameron M. Bready","Jim, it's Cameron I'll start off. I don't really think there is anything too terribly unusual in any particular quarter as we roll through the year. I think we would expect relatively stable margins \u201815 to \u201816 quarter-over-quarter, you are going to see little bit of pressure in the front half of the year largely due to FX. That will balance out in the back half of the year, should be roughly flat. And again as we mentioned before we're guiding to sort of reported net revenue base operating margins are roughly flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Again we expect them to up 30 basis points sitting here today. ","So that's really the only color I could give as bear in mind the impacts of FX in the front half of the year, would be more acute obviously in the back half of the year we expect them to dissipate to some degree, although we still expect a little bit of FX headwind in the back half of the year.","James Schneider ","That's helpful. Thanks. And I realize it's a relatively small part of your businesses at this point as you provided all that disclosure, but can you maybe just give us a sense about your expectation for the ISO business in fiscal '16 versus '15?","Cameron M. Bready","Yeah, it's still a good question, it's still about you know 25% of our U.S. business on a net adjusted revenue basis. So it's is still an important part of our business nonetheless. As we look at fiscal '16 you have a couple of things going on as we talked about before. The growth in that business had been slowing for a couple of years, that trend has not changed. Even on the adjusted net revenue presentation that we're now providing. The other thing that obviously is expected to happen this year as we commented on in our prepared remarks is the migration of [indiscernible] and again we don't have an exact timeframe as to when that will happen and I think our guidance ranges around both adjusted net in gross are meant accommodates a variety of outcomes for Mercury migration in the back half of our fiscal year, recognizing of course on a net revenue basis that migration has very little impact on our net revenue obviously has a larger impact on our gross revenue.","James Schneider ","That's helpful. Thank you.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thank you.","Cameron M. Bready","Thanks Jim.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Thanks very much everybody for joining us this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"10230":["Global Payments Inc.

Please go ahead","Andrew Langford","Good morning, and welcome to Global Payments' fiscal 2016 year-end conference call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour, and joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO, David Mangum, President and COO, and Cameron Bready, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially, and we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.

For a full reconciliation of cash earnings, adjusted net revenue, and other non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning, and our trended financial highlights, both of which are available in the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now, I'd like to introduce Jeff Sloan. Jeff?","Jeff Sloan","Thank you, Andrew, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are delighted with our strong performance in fiscal 2016, highlighting another year of solid execution that generated significant growth across our markets. We also made substantial progress in our strategic objectives, including the successful completion of our merger with Heartland in April, a landmark transaction for Global Payments.","For the year, we delivered net revenue growth of 11%, increased operating margin 50 basis points, and grew cash earnings per share 18%. Each of these results exceeded our fiscal 2016 budget expectations as well as the cycle guidance we set forth at our Investor Day last October. We are most proud of our ability to accelerate net revenue growth and maintain a consistent level of operating margin expansion, and cash EPS growth versus last fiscal, notwithstanding the incremental impacts of foreign currency.","We expect continued positive momentum in fiscal 2017, as we expand direct distribution, deliver innovative products globally, leverage our technology and operating environments, and prudently deploy capital. And of course, our partnership with Heartland is at the core of this strategy. We are very pleased with early results at Heartland. Our combined senior management team is in place, and has hit the ground running.","New sales at Heartland have set internal records over the last three months and we've begun to see the anticipated benefits of revenue enhancements across our businesses. We closed our first global cross-sell in June, and jointly closed Heartland's largest ever new sale when we signed a major US national restaurant customer in May. We are already executing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth by enabling sales of our Heartland campus solutions, school solutions, and commerce point of sale payment technology globally as we head into fiscal and calendar 2017.","Since the closing of the merger on April 22, we have also focused on executing our integration plans, which are critical to the realization of expense synergies. We have successfully completed the first 90 day actions which consisted of substantial reductions in force, facility closures, vendor rationalization and duplicate expense elimination. We are well down the path toward realizing the expense synergies we outlined for fiscal 2017 and beyond. And we have not been busy just with Heartland during fiscal 2016.","We continue to make progress on the two key strategic initiatives to accelerate transformative growth that we described during our Investor Day, international expansion of our OpenEdge integrated solutions business, and continued development of our omni-channel solutions offerings. For OpenEdge, we are now live, and driving sales of our solutions outside of the United States. We recently signed a contract with one of our largest existing ISVs to deliver integrated solutions to their customers in the United Kingdom.","We are also pleased with our progress in Canada where we now have 30 ISV and VAR partners. We will shortly launch OpenEdge marketing campaigns with both local and US-based partners to further accelerate penetration of our integrated solutions end market. Our omni-channel solutions businesses had another very good year in fiscal 2016. We added over 4,000 new e-commerce customers in the UK and Ireland, and signed several enterprise e-commerce clients in the UK in the fourth quarter, based on the strength of our Realex platform, its scalability, reliability and performance.","We are well-positioned to accelerate growth, and we expect to roll out our bundled e-commerce solution in Spain imminently. In addition, we plan to integrate Heartland's e-commerce offering in the United States with our global e-commerce solutions to create best-of-breed omni-channel capabilities before the end of calendar 2016. Furthermore, our acquisition of eWAY also expands the scope of our offerings in the Asia-Pacific region, providing us with global reach that is unmatched in our industry.","Now for quarterly highlights. Our North American businesses again delivered strong results. Our US direct channels generated high single-digit organic revenue growth, led by OpenEdge. Canada continued its steady performance in local currency, resulting from strong new sales, terrific execution, and stable business fundamentals. Our European businesses again generated solid results. We saw double-digit volume and transaction growth in Spain for the fifth consecutive quarter, well in excess of market growth.","Outside of Spain, our businesses in the UK and Continental Europe performed in line with our expectations. While we were disappointed with the result of the recent UK\/EU referendum, we have been preparing for that potential outcome for some time. We had contingency plans in place, which were executed immediately after the result. We do not expect any material impact on operations or earnings expectations as a consequence. We continue to monitor the impact of the referendum, and we'll take further actions as conditions warrant.","It is also worth noting that our US business is now two-thirds of our net revenue post Heartland, with the UK now representing single-digits of our company's net revenue. Asia delivered high single-digit organic net revenue growth in local currency. Much like last quarter, we also generated substantial operating margin expansion, as we reacted quickly last fall to emerging macro headwinds across our greater China markets.","Finally, we remain delighted with our Ezidebit business, which reported accelerated revenue growth above 20% on a local currency basis. Our investment in the eWAY partnership in April highlights the confidence we have in our Australian colleagues and our optimism for this market.","Finally, a word about the change to our fiscal year that we announced today. Last July, we began the journey to provide enhanced comparability of our results with our peers. I believe this change will be the final piece of the puzzle to allow our stakeholders to better compare our performance to that of our competitors.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2016 was another terrific year for Global Payments. It included a number of significant milestones. We executed our largest ever transaction in our merger with Heartland, successfully raised $4.5 billion to finance growth, completed our first stock split in 10 years, and lastly were added to the S&P 500 Index. Importantly, we accomplished all of this, while also producing strong financial performance throughout the year.","Total company net revenue for fiscal 2016 was $2.17 billion, reflecting growth of 11% versus fiscal 2015, or 17% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 29.2%. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded 120 basis points. Cash earnings per share increased 18% to $2.98 per share, or 29% on a constant currency basis. For each of these measures, we exceeded our cycle guidance on a stated basis, and substantially exceeded it on a constant currency basis.","For the fourth quarter, total company net revenue was $621 million, a 25% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, or 27% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin was 28.1%, an expansion of 40 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 70 basis points.","Cash earnings per share grew 14% to $0.73, or 16% on a constant currency basis. Relative to our expectations in April, currency impacted fourth quarter cash earnings per share by roughly $0.01 to $0.02. Naturally, fourth quarter performance reflects the results of Heartland from April 22, which were in line with the expectations we shared during our April call.","Now for detailed segment highlights for the quarter. Our North America segment, which now includes Heartland, saw net revenue growth of 36%, and operating margin expansion of 30 basis points, despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our US direct channels, calculated as if we owned Heartland and the FIS Gaming business in both this period and in fiscal 2015 was high single-digits for the quarter.","Canada once again, delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North American net revenue growth by over 100 basis points for the quarter. As Jeff noted, our European business performed well again this quarter, posting revenue growth of 7% on a constant currency basis. Reported net revenue growth for Europe was 3%, due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound and euro. As a reminder, we also annualized our acquisition of Realex in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.","European operating margin was 47.8%, declining from prior year, primarily due to investments we were making to further expand our omni-channel solutions business and foreign currency impacts. Asia net revenue grew 15% or 19% on a constant currency basis, despite ongoing macroeconomic weakness in our greater China markets. Organic constant currency revenue growth, adjusting for both the BPI and eWAY transactions was high single-digits for the quarter, accelerating sequentially from our fiscal third quarter.","Once again, we're particularly pleased with operating margin in Asia-Pacific, which expanded by over 400 basis points to 26.3%. This was primarily driven by the continued strong growth in our Ezidebit business, as well as the expense management program we implemented in the fall of 2015. Shortly after closing the Heartland merger, we entered into a $50 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, bringing total share repurchases in the quarter to 711,000 shares for approximately $53 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repurchased a further 638,000 shares for approximately $44 million.","Now turning to our fiscal 2017 outlook. On a constant currency basis, we expect fiscal 2017 net revenue to range from $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, reflecting growth of 50% to 54% over fiscal 2016. We anticipate foreign currency headwinds will impact net revenue growth by 200 to 300 basis points for the year, resulting in expected reported net revenues of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.","Operating margin is expected to expand by up to 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. After reflecting the anticipated impact of foreign currency headwinds, we expect reported operating margin to expand by up to 40 basis points. We are particularly pleased with our outlook for operating margin expansion, as we expect to be able to absorb the anticipated margin degradation from Heartland, and still expand operating margins on a constant currency basis toward the high end of our cycle guidance.","We expect cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to range from $3.50 to $3.60, reflecting growth of 17% to 21% over fiscal 2016. After giving rise to anticipated foreign currency headwinds, particularly the significant weakness we have seen in the pound resulting from the Brexit referendum, we expect reported cash earnings per share to range from $3.40 to $3.50, reflecting growth of 14% to 17%. We are forecasting the most significant foreign currency impacts in the first two quarters of the year.","As a result, we expect roughly 47% to 48% of our cash earnings per share to be contributed in the first two fiscal quarters, and the balance to be realized in the back half of the fiscal year. This is essentially the inverse of fiscal 2016.","With respect to the more detailed assumptions that underlie this outlook, we expect North American net revenue to grow nearly 70% in fiscal 2017, including FX headwinds from the Canadian dollar. This growth reflects the addition of Heartland, and our expectation that our combined US direct businesses will generate organic growth in the high single-digits. Canadian net revenue growth assumptions remain in the low single-digits in local currency. We expect North America operating margin to expand for the year, as we anticipate being able to more than offset the margin impacts of Heartland with operating efficiencies and synergies.","In Europe, we expect net revenue on a constant currency basis to grow in the mid-teens, including the impact of the Erste transaction. FX headwinds in Europe, especially the British pound, are forecasted to impact net revenues by several hundred basis points, resulting in expected reported growth in the high single-digits. Operating margin in Europe is expected to decline in fiscal 2017, largely due to integration costs associated with our Erste joint venture, and the impacts of foreign currency headwinds. Much of the degradation is anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2017, when we expect to realize a substantial portion of the integration-related expenses, and absorb a considerable amount of the foreign currency impacts.","Asia-Pacific is expected to deliver US dollar net revenue growth in the low double-digits. Operating margin is expected to remain relatively consistent in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 is projected to approach 30%, and our diluted weighted average share count is expected to approach 156 million. We anticipate that we will invest approximately $140 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017.","With the completion of the Heartland merger, our near-term capital allocation priority is to reduce debt, and return to our targeted leverage ratio. As such, we expect the majority of our free cash flow in fiscal 2017 to support debt reduction. However, we have sufficient capital available to continue to pursue select acquisitions that augment our strategies, like the eWAY partnership we executed in Q4. You should also assume we will continue to be a consistent buyer of our stock, as a means by which to return capital to shareholders.","That said, our outlook for fiscal 2017 does not include any assumptions with respect to future share repurchases. As Jeff referenced, we're pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a change in our fiscal year-end, from May 31 to December 31. Our first fiscal year on a calendar year basis will begin January 1, 2017. As a result, we will report a seven month fiscal period for the period June 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. We will host our Q1 and Q2 fiscal 2017 earnings call as customary, and we'll then transition to calendar quarter reporting, beginning with the first quarter of calendar year 2017.","With our forthcoming change in fiscal year end, we're providing an early preview of our outlook for calendar year 2017 to assist with this transition. Building off of our constant currency guidance for fiscal 2017, we would preliminarily expect constant currency net revenue of approximately $3.375 billion to $3.5 billion for calendar 2017. In addition, we would anticipate cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to be in the range of $3.75 to $4 for calendar 2017.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Cameron. Building on the solid foundation from fiscal 2014 and 2015, we delivered yet another year of strong results in fiscal 2016. As our fiscal 2017 and cycle guidance post Heartland suggests, we remain committed to accelerating growth across our markets. We've had a terrific run over the last several years, but we are just as optimistic today, as we were back in October of 2013. We have the right people, in the right places, with the right business model. Early results of our partnership with Heartland, our largest investment to date, point strongly toward continued success for fiscal 2017 and beyond. We could not be more pleased with where we are today, but more importantly, we could not be more excited about where we are headed. Andrew?","Andrew Langford","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one, with one follow-up, in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. You may begin.","Glenn Greene","Thanks. Good morning. Lots of numbers to digest. But I guess, at a high level, maybe to sort of frame how you've thought about and included in your fiscal \u201817 and calendar \u201817 guidance the, both the Heartland payments, cost synergies and revenue synergies, how should we be thinking about that?","Jeff Sloan","Sure, Glenn. It's Jeff. I'll start, and I'm sure Cameron and David will add to this. First, on the cost synergy side, as I said in the release this morning, we're well down the path on where we expect to be on expense synergies. In particular, relative to the $50 million that we talked about in fiscal 17, today we believe we're running ahead of that target of $50 million for fiscal 2017 realization. That falls in the buckets that we talked about back in December and April, primarily on the executive side, on the operating side, and on the technology side.","On the revenue enhancement, as you know, at the time we announced the transaction in December, as well as in April, we talked about 1% to 2% incremental revenue growth over the cycle. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've already had some early wins coming from our work, out of our work with the folks over at Heartland. But we haven't yet included that in our fiscal 17 estimates, as we do not include those in the guidance we gave in December and April. Cameron, do you want to --?","Cameron Bready","The only thing I would add there, Glenn, is as we look at synergies on the expense side for fiscal 17, as Jeff noted we are ahead of the target that we originally established back in December, when we announced the transaction. Perhaps more importantly, however, I think we're very much on track to realize the full run rate synergies that we had targeted, with respect to the transaction, the 125 million in fiscal 18 and beyond. So I think from an expense point of view, we feel very good about where we are, have a lot of positive momentum going into fiscal 17 to exceed the expectations we had for the full year. But as I said before, we're very focused on that ultimate run rate number, and are well on track to achieve that expectation.","David Mangum","And Glenn, it's David, maybe a little more color on the revenue. I think I'd say the same thing about revenue that Jeff and Cameron said about expenses. I think we're a little ahead of where we might have thought we'd be right now. Those obviously take a little bit longer to execute, require obviously closing sales, et cetera, in some cases, some product development. But if you told me a few months ago, we would've already closed our first cross-border deal in Canada, I'd have been surprised, really pleased at the way the sales forces are working together. So we are equipping that Heartland sales force to do cross-border sales as we speak, with an initial focus on Canada, followed by Europe and the UK.","We're also adding in targeted, I would call almost surgical additions to sales folks in white spaces, white space territories we don't have full coverage, which is outside the plan and kind of a unique synergy we've run across in the last few months. And maybe as interesting, to go back to some of the things as we've talked about in earlier calls, we're enabling the technology businesses, the software businesses like TouchNet, the campus solutions business to sell software and Global Payments processing in Canada and Puerto Rico, with UK and Europe to follow shortly. And the same for the commerce businesses around the world, and beginning the process of enabling those going forward.","Glenn Greene","So the other question, look, I'll ask a couple, and then just jump back into the queue. But as it relates to the revenue synergies, is it early to sort of be thinking about potential pricing benefits, or how have you thought about that, and the timing of that?","And the other question is unrelated to the synergies, maybe just sort of the OpenEdge expectations into \u201817, and what you're assuming in terms of the benefit from the European, or this UK interchange reduction? Are you going to keep that? It seems like some of your other peers are sort of passing that through, and I'll jump back in. Thank you.","Cameron Bready","So Glenn, it's Cameron. I'll start with the first couple of items. As it relates to pricing, there is no assumption in our fiscal 17 guidance for any sort of pricing changes, with respect to the Heartland portfolio. So that's a fairly easy one to address.","With respect to your second question around interchange, the interchange benefits came into effect in December, as we talked about in the UK. Obviously, the interchange benefits themselves are transitory benefits, as they have been in other markets where we've seen such changes over the course of time, including the US back in 2012, and of course, Spain in 2014. So over the course of time, we do expect the market to rationalize those pricing benefits. We're seeing in the UK, what we expect to see, and have seen in other markets, as it relates to these transitory benefits.","Over time, they'll get rationalized away, and spreads will return to pre-interchange reduction levels over a 12 to 18 months\u2019 time frame, and I think the UK's very much on that track currently. One element to note with the UK, is we did see some early adoption of the SEPA rules in Q4 of \u201815. So Visa reduced some debit interchange in Q4 of \u201815, MasterCard also reduced some credit interchange in fiscal 2015. So we have started to begin to annualize some of the early benefits from SEPA, but the largest changes obviously came into effect in December of 15.","Jeff Sloan","I'd also say, Glenn, on OpenEdge, our assumption fiscal \u201817 is that it continues that mid to high teens rate of growth that we've been describing, probably over the last two to three years.","Glenn Greene","All right. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital. You may begin.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. Hey, guys. So I wanted to make sure I got this right. So you said 70 basis points of margin on a constant currency basis, and I thought I heard you say, Cameron, 40 basis points on reported for the total Company? Is that right?","Jeff Sloan","That's correct, Dan, yes.","Dan Perlin","Okay. So when we run that through, and you talk about Europe being down, Asia flat, and I look through this kind of organic growth of high single-digit in North America. And we certainly are layering in the cost synergies, it sounds like there might be maybe meaningful costs that you guys are taking out of the core business? Is that right to assume that, in order for you guys to have that 40 basis point increase? And if so, I'm just wondering how sustainable, or you how quickly does that come in?","Cameron Bready","Well, I think, Dan, I'd point you to our cycle guidance that we updated on the heels of the Heartland transaction, where we indicated over the cycle, we expect to be able to expand margins by up to 75 basis points annually. So I think the constant currency guide that we provided today is towards the high end of that expectation. I think we're particularly pleased with that, as we said before, because as you know Heartland comes in at a lower margin than Global Payments has operated at historically. So I think we've been able to absorb that degradation, and expand margins this year at a level consistent with our cycle guidance on a constant currency basis.","So I think when you roll it all together, we obviously, are expecting margin expansion in North America. We are expecting a little bit of margin headwind in Europe as I noted on the prepared remarks, largely as a result of integration costs for the Erste transaction and currency. In Asia, we expect to maintain the significant margin improvement that we achieved in fiscal 16. When you roll that together, obviously with North America now being almost 70% of the combined business, the margin expansion in North America really drives the total Company margin expansion.","Dan Perlin","Yes. That's great. So the organic growth of high single-digit again in North America, how do we parse that in terms of - you guys consolidating share up, with maybe the integrated model increasingly, volumes and then pricing opportunities? I know you said, you're not repricing the Heartland portfolio, but that continues to be a pretty strong number, in a market that I think secularly isn't growing that fast. So maybe you could just parse that a bit? Thanks.","Cameron Bready","Yes, I mean, I think I'd start with, Dan, both us and Heartland pre-transaction, were growing at a faster rate than the market rate of growth. So I think when you put these two businesses together, and you're able to accelerate growth, the way that we believe we'll be able to, I think we feel very good about that high single-digit organic revenue guide - organic revenue growth guide for FY17. If you deconstruct the parts a little bit, our core direct distribution businesses in the US, which includes our traditional go-to-market [indiscernible] business, OpenEdge, our gaming business, again still growing high single digits, that's our expectation next year, led obviously by OpenEdge as Jeff mentioned earlier, which we continue to expect to grow in the mid to high teens level. If you look at the Heartland side, again their direct sales business we expect to grow high single digits, consistent with the trends we've seen in that business. Their integrated businesses, similar to ours are growing double-digit. You roll all that together again, and you have a business that's very well-poised to grow organically in the high single-digit range in FY17 and beyond, and that's consistent with the cycle guidance we provided historically.","Jeff Sloan","And Dan, it's Jeff. I would just say, as I said in my prepared remarks, we announced the Heartland deal in December, we closed in April. Here we are sitting in July. And as I mentioned in the prepared commentary, that Heartland has experienced one of the strongest periods of new sales growth since April in the last three months, well post the announcement and into the close. So we couldn't be more delighted with the ongoing rate of performance at Heartland, as well as our legacy global business. So it's very easy to see a scenario, if we announced something in December, and you don't see that kind of acceleration. But we've seen exactly that kind of acceleration into Heartland, gives us a lot of confidence heading into FY17.","Dan Perlin","That's great. Thank you, guys.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Dan.","Cameron Bready","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Good morning. Just want to ask about Europe. I think Europe grew 7% constant currency. That was down from a big quarter last year -or last quarter, I think it grew 16%. So just trying to figure out the delta change there on the top line in Europe?","Cameron Bready","Yes, Bryan, it's Cameron. I'll lead off. There's really two things. First of all, in Q3 it was 15% on a constant currency growth basis, and that included inorganic growth from Realex, which we didn't have this quarter, as Realex annualized in the fourth quarter. So that's a big chunk of the difference as a starting point. I would say, the second element that impacted Europe in Q4 is I mentioned earlier in my comments, we've started to begin to annualize some of the early benefits from interchange reductions in the UK in particular. Last year, MasterCard in the fourth quarter of 2015 lowered credit interchange from on average roughly 100 bips to 80. And Visa changed debit interchange from the 8p a transaction to 20 basis points plus 1p. So those early benefits from the SEPA regulation that didn't actually become effective until December, we began to annualize in Q4 of this year, which created a little bit of headwind. Europe still grew high single-digits on a constant currency basis. That's in line with our overall expectation for Europe. So I would say it was a quarter, Europe-wise, that was very much consistent with our overall expectations.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then going forward, it sounds like it goes back up mid-teens constant currency in Europe. Is that the Erste JV pushing that up, and what would it be ex Erste, I guess JV?","Cameron Bready","Yes, that's a good question, Bryan. So we do expect Europe to grow next year in the high single-digits on an organic basis. And then, of course, the Erste joint venture is adding inorganic growth to top line revenue expectations for Europe in FY17. So those would be the component pieces next year.","Jeff Sloan","Hi, Bryan, it's Jeff. I think you'd also see Spain finally start to annualize, the annualization of the original benefits starting on September 1. So as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that Spain hit yet another double-digit volume and transaction growth quarter, I think their fifth consecutive in the quarter in a market that's probably going half that. And you're finally going to see that accelerate into the beginning of our second fiscal quarter in 2017.","Cameron Bready","And that's in the high single-digit growth expectation organically for Europe for the full year. We'll annualize (multiple speakers) the benefit of the UK interchange reductions as you know in December.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then, just to close the loop here. On the international operating margins, they fell a little bit on a year-over-year basis, and obviously were down sequential. Just any - I think it also has to do with some of the pieces on the top line we talked about, but anything else to think about there, that caused the drop in the international operating margins? And congrats on the quarter.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Bryan. Appreciate it. No, I think you've got it right. Obviously, currency had a fairly significant impact on margins, particularly in Europe. The other item I mentioned in my prepared remarks again, relates to investments we're making in our e-com omni-channel solutions business in Europe. We're continuing to invest in that platform. We are preparing to launch a bundled solution in Spain, similar to what we launched in the UK earlier in the fall. That's coming in the next few months. So we did make investments to prepare for that market rollout, which we think will obviously be helpful to accelerating growth in Spain. So those investments were a little bit of a drag on margin in Q4. But in the grand scheme of things, we really try to target margin expansion for the total Company. Which once again, we achieved this quarter and we're very pleased with the level of margin expansion that we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016. Europe being nearly 50% margin, our goal is to largely sustain, or close to sustain that level of margin, and really looking to drive total Company margin expansion through North America primarily.","Bryan Keane","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Kwok with KBW. You may begin.","Steven Kwok","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been answered, but just wanted to go back on Brexit, in terms of the contingencies. Can you just talk a little about the contingencies that you had in place? And then if things were to let's say, deteriorate further, what are the other steps that you can take? Thanks.","Jeff Sloan","Hey, Steven, hi, it's Jeff. I'll start on that. As I said in our commentary, we anticipated that this might happen, even though it wasn't our preferred option. As a result, immediately after the referendum, we took a number of steps by way of contingency, to prepare the business in the event that the macro environment in the UK deteriorated further. Those were along the lines of a bit of deferral on some investment we were going to make, Steven, by way of headcount, and product in the UK, and in Ireland. We also had plans, in the event that things change further, we also have plans to make additional decisions around our European businesses, if that's what's needed. I would say though, if you back up, that hasn't happened today. So as we said in our commentary, that post Heartland, our UK business is single-digits, as a matter of revenue of our businesses. I think we've shown, with what we've done in Asia over the last year, that to the extent that there are emerging headwinds, that we'll get ahead of those, as we did in the fall of 2015 in Asia. So I think sitting here today, we're as well-positioned as could be and obviously, we're here to manage proactively if things change. But that's not the case today.","Steven Kwok","Got it. And you mentioned on the call, around select acquisitions. Could you talk about what are some of the opportunities that you're seeing that's out there?","Jeff Sloan","Sure, Steven. It's Jeff. As always, we start with what's available for sale. We're really looking for things that are in our wheelhouse from a strategic point of view, and have the right partnership and culture to really drive the business forward, relative to our other alternatives for our capital. I would say sitting here today, a number of those opportunities are really in the Asia-Pacific region. Cameron, I think talked about the eWAY transaction that we consummated in the fourth quarter of 2016, driving additional omni-channel and e-commerce activity in Australia and New Zealand. We're looking at a bunch of technology-related businesses in Asia primarily. Obviously, we think we're relatively full-up here, post Heartland, in North America. And as Cameron mentioned, we just closed our Erste JV on June 1, and we think we have a fair amount of work ahead of us, to continue that integration over the next period of time. So I think we look at opportunities. Sitting here today, those are likely to be more weighted towards Asia. But of course, we're flexible, and it depends on what comes available for sale.","Steven Kwok","Great. Congrats on the quarter again, and thanks for taking my questions.","Jeff Sloan","Thank you.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Steven.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from George Mihalos with Cowen. You may begin.","George Mihalos","Great. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my questions, guys.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Georgios.","George Mihalos","Maybe just to kind of kick things off, appreciate your talking about calendar 2017, and kind of giving the constant currency guide of $3.75 to $4.00. But could you also kind of give us a sense of what that might be on a reported basis, kind of what you're thinking there?","Cameron Bready","George, it's Cameron. I'll maybe start. You can see from our FY17 guide, that we're forecasting anywhere, maybe $0.10 to $0.15 of currency headwind in FY17, as a result of - primarily weakness in the pound stemming from the Brexit referendum in the UK. So you can sort of extrapolate that further into calendar 2017. But sitting here today on July 28, it's very difficult. I think with any sort of accuracy to predict what currencies may do in calendar 2017. Frankly, at some point, I hope to annualize these fairly significant headwinds. I sort of view flat, as the new up, from a currency point of view. So I think when you get to flat, you can kind of get a sense from the guide we've given for calendar 2017, as the earnings power of the business, that we're able to generate, notwithstanding the FX headwinds over the past couple years. But if we can get a normal FX environment, obviously 20% cash earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis is fairly attractive and well ahead of our cycle guidance, and well ahead of what I think our peers and other industry participants are able to produce.","George Mihalos","Yes. No, that's fair. And just kind of moving on, focusing again on the US market, just what are your expectations in FY17 for ISO growth? And then, are you guys thinking - I know right now with all the confusion going on with EMV certification and the like, but as you think about calendar 2017, would you consider implementing EMV noncompliance fees?","Cameron Bready","Let me start with the ISO comment, that's the easier question. I'll give David the harder question around EMV. On the ISO side, we're expecting essentially flat growth, or roughly no growth out of the ISO channel. As we talked about historically, with the pivot we've made to direct distribution, particularly on the heels of the Heartland transaction, where we've essentially invested over $4 billion now in direct distribution in the US market, that is the focus of our business going forward. It's obviously the driver of the growth. We'll continue to serve our ISO partners well, but that is not a focus for our business, and we're certainly not expecting any tailwinds from the ISO channel. We expect it to be relatively flat.","David Mangum","And then, George, on EMV plans, our focus to date has been on the transition for our customers, making it seamless, and really delivering to them security solutions bundles that really can drive maybe some nominal market share gains. So I think the way to look at what Cameron and Jeff have been describing, is there is no assumption of economic benefit from EMV whatsoever, but that is something we're exploring. As we get deeper into 2017, we're certainly going to have to think about where the risks are in the industry, where we've added value to our customers, where we may not be being compensated. But it's nowhere in the expectations. It's just something to think about as a marketing matter.","George Mihalos","Okay, great. And just last question from me. Just again as it relates to the EMV certification issues that we've seen with some small merchants. Has that had any impact on your business at all?","Jeff Sloan","No, it hasn't. And I guess, I appreciate you asking the question. I know that there have been folks out talking about certifications, about backlogs, some folks talking about acquirers delayed in certifications. I can tell you this, we have no backlog in our infrastructure anywhere, whether it's a direct channel or an integrated channel. So whomever is talking about those types of things to you guys, whether it's an opinion, or it's some other delays, it's not Global Payments.","George Mihalos","Great, thank you.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, George.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Paul Condra","Great, thanks. Good morning, all. I guess, I wanted to ask first just about Canada. You talked about launching OpenEdge there, and some of the cross-border business. Is it your expectation that growth rate there could accelerate at some point, or just could you talk about that a little bit?","David Mangum","Yes. Paul, this is David. Our expectation is indeed that we can accelerate Canada with really a couple of things. One is bringing in these new global initiatives like more e-com business, some of the fastest growing part of that market. And certainly with OpenEdge, where we're up to 30 partners. And we're just really beginning to build that sort of purpose-built ecosystem I've talked about before, partners, campaign management, and our sales teams to accelerate growth. So early stages. Hence, you've seen from Cameron very traditional Canadian expectations for now for 2017, which I'm expecting our Canadian team to beat this year. And then beyond that, it's the Heartland synergies. So being able to take the products, whether it's education products, or the commerce point of sale cloud software across border to Canada. And just being able to take the US-based customers and prospects that our Heartland sales force will close in the coming months and quarters, and take those and extend those to Canada as well. So we think we've got lots of tools to accelerate Canada now, really for the first time in the last five years in Global Payments.","Paul Condra","Thanks. That's good to hear, and thanks for that detail. I guess, just as a follow-up, you also talked about some e-commerce enablement. And I'm wondering if you can talk about, in the US, your e-commerce strategy, how important is that, how you think you can get bigger there, if that's something that you really want to go after?","Jeff Sloan","Yes, it's certainly something we want to go after. It's obviously a growth pool in the United States, and it's one of the hidden benefits of the Heartland transaction, to be frank. First off, we finally have a real substantial direct sales force in the US, a strategic distribution asset that we did not have before. We also have OpenEdge, which is a fantastic business, and our vertical gaming and credit giving [ph] businesses, but we've not had a direct sales force like this. And another hidden benefit of Heartland, they have a true e-commerce solution for the United States as well. Great product folks, a great development team, and actual product in market, that's seeing success. In fact, we actually signed a record number of e-commerce customers in Heartland during the June quarter as well. So we're seeing increasing momentum that fuels our confidence, both about integration overall, and the type of accelerated growth the two companies can deliver that Cameron described earlier.","Paul Condra","Okay, thanks. I don't know if you could maybe size that, or give us any metrics around it? And then I'll jump. Thanks a lot.","Jeff Sloan","I think it's tough to size on direct metrics. Obviously, you have the two fastest organic growing acquirers in the industry combined. We think we can accelerate that growth, so we're pretty confident, it's pretty fast-growing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. You may begin.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys.","Cameron Bready","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey","Wonder if we can dig in a little bit on sort of the North American, specifically the US competitive environment with regard to ISVs? One of your competitors talked about ramping sales and marketing this morning around that business and other fast growth channels. So wonder if you might just talk about perhaps residuals in that business. And then also, if you have any view on the PayPal Visa relationship, and whether or not you'd expect perhaps PayPal to try to become a merchant of record in physical world, if that's something you've thought about at all internally?","David Mangum","Yes, Andrew, it's David. I'll start with some of the integrated ISV talk. Obviously, our industry is highly competitive, but I don't think there's a sea change at all in the competitive nature of what's going on around ISVs and integrated payments. I think in particular if you think about the results we posted in 2016, our confidence in Heartland to date, and then the expectations for 2017, we're expecting another mid to high teens delivery from OpenEdge. They continue to drive across into new verticals. We don't see some of the larger competitors you're describing in our specific verticals in the OpenEdge business. We continue to drive that growth in the dentist, the pharmas, the things we talked about. Again, a highly competitive, every deal is competitive in this space, but we win more than our fair share with the integrated solution we drive.","On the Heartland side, you've got the education verticals, the two, the one for K through 12, the one for university, that combination is double-digits as well. And the same thing, competitive deals, but we're driving and winning more than our share. I think the final piece of this is really the commerce businesses, where we've got new assets where we're just beginning to pursue restaurant and hospitality. There we're going to see more competition, but it's all going to be incremental to us. So we're very excited about our growth opportunity on that side.","Jeff Sloan","Okay, Andrew, it's Jeff. On Visa PayPal, we're a very good partner of both Visa and of PayPal I think, anything that drives toward more adoption of card-based usage, whether it's relative to ACH, relative to cash and check, et cetera, is really nothing but good news for our businesses. I would note, that in that partnership in particular, that's a US-only deal. Visa PayPal is the way it's been described externally. Most of our business with PayPal, as you probably know is outside of the United States, and in particular, mostly outside of North America, primarily in Europe and Asia. So I don't think by itself, it's going to have really a direct impact, just because of the geography that's been described. I think as a concept, to get to your other point, the idea that there's more volumes going through digital wallets, through two partners like Visa and a PayPal, is really nothing but good news for our business longer term.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. You may begin.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks. Good morning, guys. So it sounds like you're running ahead of plan on both revenue and cost synergy for Heartland, which is obviously good to hear. So should we assume that you may do better than the mid single-digit EPS accretion target from Heartland in FY17? Or what's actually baked into the FY17 guidance, is it still the mid single, or is it something a little north of that?","Cameron Bready","Yes, Jason, it's Cameron. I'll maybe start with that one. So if you think back to December when we originally announced the Heartland transaction, consensus for us for our FY17 was around $3.32. And we guided to mid single-digit accretion which kind of gets you to $3.47 [ph] or so. If you think about where we are now, we just guided on a constant currency basis $3.50 to $3.60. So a midpoint of $3.55. That kind of implies high single-digit accretion year one, which is pretty attractive from our point of view, and obviously, an acceleration from what we originally announced on the deal in the December time frame. Obviously, we've seen a $0.10 of - $0.10-plus maybe of incremental FX headwinds. There's a little bit of noise around FX. But on an apples-to-apples basis, we're kind of looking at FY17 being high single-digit accretion from Heartland, and that's pretty exciting.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. That's real helpful. And then, just two other quick ones related to 2017 [ph], just your plans for growth in that direct sales force, as well as the interest expense expectations?","David Mangum","Yes, Jason, David here. We do plan to keep growing the sales force. It's measured. It's surgical. As I said a little while ago, we've identified white spaces, where we want to accelerate growth and sales coverage as we speak. So we will keep growing that sales force, measuring it against demand and opportunity. But there's a lot of room for growth, in terms of just headcount adds, as well as in coverage that you'll see in the coming quarters.","Cameron Bready","On the interest expense side, I think we've provided a little bit of color around interest rate expectations back in the Q3 call. We have about $2.8 billion of incremental debt associated with the Heartland transaction, actually we'll pay a little bit of that off the course of the year. Our weighted average cost of debt somewhere around $3.75 [ph] to $4.00 [ph], so in that ballpark. And then as a reminder, the legacy debt that we had, was repriced as well as part of the transaction. So there's probably an incremental 100 basis points on that. So it's going to be in the same, sort of probably $3.50 range for the historical debt. So all-in, that gets you to an interest rate expense assumption that's going to be in the north of $160 million range for FY17.","Jason Kupferberg","Thank you, guys.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Koning with Baird. You may begin.","Dave Koning","Yes, hey, guys. I guess, a couple of things. First of all, is Spain - I know you're growing really well there, transactions and volume. Has revenue caught up with that? And if not, like when does revenue catch up with the same transaction and volume growth?","Cameron Bready","Yes. Hey, Dave, it's Cameron. Great question. Revenue is essentially flat now. So we have caught up, in the sense that we've gotten revenue to its flat to slightly up. As we get to September, and annualize the annualization of the interchange benefit - I know it gets complicated - we would expect revenue growth to trend back to the same level of transaction and volume growth that we're seeing in that market, which is double-digits to mid-teens. So we're very bullish on our execution in Spain. We, I think, are looking at our fifth consecutive quarter of growing transactions and volumes in the double-digits.","We're growing well above the rate of market growth, and couldn't be more delighted with our partnership with Caixa [ph], and we see nothing but really tailwinds in that market. GDP has remained very solid in the market, and our execution has been terrific. So as we get into FY17, and get past the first quarter, we expect Spain revenue growth to return to that double-digit level. And it's obviously an important driver for overall expectations for European organic growth in FY17.","Dave Koning","Great. Okay. And then, the minority interest line, that one's always a little tough because there's been some of moving parts in and out, and now with Erste coming on. How do we think of that on a cash earnings basis in FY17?","Cameron Bready","Yes, David, it is a tough thing to model, and we've had joint ventures that we've unwound. We've added new joint ventures, and I recognize that's complicated. So with the addition of Erste, I would expect it to be up year-over-year relative to FY16 in aggregate by roughly 50%, relative to what we just reported for FY16. So that's kind of a rough guide. And we can obviously provide a little more color on that, if we have an offline conversation.","Dave Koning","Great. Thanks. Nice job.","Jeff Sloan","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank. You may begin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks, guys. So my question is about the cadence of how we think of 1Q and 2Q? I guess, the other quarter's would be part of the new calendar reporting. And the reason I ask is, last year's August quarter was pretty much the perfect quarter, and very strong. So can you help from a modeling perspective with that?","Cameron Bready","Yes, Ashwin, it's Cameron. I tried to give a little bit of color on that in my prepared remarks, because we recognized a couple things. One is, the quarterly distribution of earnings in FY17, because of the FX headwinds in particular, are likely to be sort of the inverse of what we saw in FY16. So we expect 47% to 48% of the earnings to be distributed in the first two quarters combined, and the balance, 52% to 53% in the back two quarters, which to your point, will roll into the new calendar year. For the full FY17 guide, obviously, we're going to see the most FX headwinds in Q1 and in Q2 in particular, but primarily Q1. So still expect good growth in Q1 over FY16, and same for Q2. But it will ramp in the back half of the year, as we hope currency headwinds will begin to abate, number one. And number two, it's important to recognize that synergies ramp over the course of time as well.","So as we're executing on synergies, and taking expenses out of the business, the benefits of those actions ramp over the course of the fiscal year, as we roll into FY18 as well. So those two things combined create an environment where, the back half will be a little bit stronger than the first half. But the overall expectations for the year, I think are very attractive.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. And I guess, that's a good segue to the next question I had, which is a synergy question. So if I think of the $50 million synergy for FY17, layer in that you're making investments basically for the first half of the year, that would imply a fairly strong move from investment to benefit in the latter half, which would mathematically seem to carry us to a synergy pace about $125 million. And I think, you partly addressed this, in a previous reply with regards to the EPS guidance. But why not just bring up the synergy target at this point, if you're already seeing that, is the question?","Cameron Bready","Yes, Ashwin, it's a really good question. So what I would start with is, when we look at our FY17 expectation, there's a lot of activities that are in progress today. We have dollar amounts tied to every one of those activities, but there's obviously execution that needs to be done to realize those synergies. So as we sit here today, we expect to achieve synergies in excess of the original $50 million-ish guide that we provided when we originally announced a deal in fiscal - at the end of, I'm sorry, December for FY17. But more importantly, as I said in my comments earlier, we're well on track to meet the overall run rate synergy expectation, by the time we get into FY18 and beyond of $125 million a year. As you know, with synergies, you have realized synergies in a particular period. But then, you also measure the run rate of the actions you have taken, and how they're contributing to the overall run rate expectation that we have of $125 million.","So I think it's a little early, to I think try to put more specific numbers around where we think we're going to end up from a synergy point of view. But I would want to leave you with certainly, our perspective which is we have a high degree of confidence on being able to accelerate synergies for FY17, relative to what we originally anticipated, and certainly feel very, very confident in our ability to deliver on the total run rate synergy, that we had premised in the original transaction economics.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Understood.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Investor Relations, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane M. Forbes","Good afternoon, and welcome to Global Payments' Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Conference Call. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour. Joining me on the call are Paul Garcia, Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sloan, President; and David Mangum, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary, which are discussed in our public releases, including our most recent 10-K. We caution you not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call.","In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures, such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these results more clearly reflect comparative operating performance.","For a full reconciliation of cash earnings to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K dated today, April 2, 2013, which may be located under the Investor Relations area on our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now I'd like to introduce Paul Garcia. Paul?","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, Jane, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon.","Our third quarter performance was consistent with our expectations, and we are pleased with the progress we have made in achieving our 2013 initiatives.","For the third quarter, revenue grew 8% to $579 million and cash earnings per share grew 5% to $0.87. I am pleased to note that we are on track to achieve our full year revenue and cash earnings expectations.","I'm gratified to report that during the quarter, we returned to the worldwide list of PCI-compliant companies. This was a significant milestone and I am proud of the accomplishments of our team. We are particularly grateful to our customers, partners and the card networks for their support.","Now that the remediation work is behind us, we can turn our full focus to driving the business forward. To that end, I want to highlight 3 specific growth areas. First, our partner of choice strategy. You heard a lot of about this at our Investor Day. We have been successfully partnering with financial institutions, value-added resellers and other payment service providers offering merchants high-quality payment services around the world. We anticipate driving further growth and expansion in new and existing distribution channels through the partner of choice strategy. A case in point: our partnership with Intuit in the U.K. is an example of a new distribution channel. The Intuit Pay mobile POS product was formally launched on March 14. And Intuit recently won the best SMB Innovation Award at PYMNTS.com Innovation Award ceremony.","In addition, and as we also discussed in January at our Investor Day, integrated payment solutions, such as those delivered by APT, will provide significant leverage to our direct sales efforts in North America in the coming fiscal year. Secondly, we are continuing to invest in technology infrastructure that will give us scalability for years to come, including new data center facilities and state-of-the-art security capabilities. Additionally, we are pleased to note that we have completed certification with Visa for contact and contactless EMV cards in the U.S. We are on track to complete certification with the other networks prior to the mandated dates later this month. Thirdly, in this ever-changing payments environment, we will continue to innovate in our core business and introduce new product offerings. For example, in the next 90 days, we will be ready to offer in-store PayPal acceptance to our U.S. merchants. Our proprietary mobile PayApp product, which recently piloted at Hong Kong, received an Innovation Award at Visa's annual Hong Kong event.","We have now expanded the PayApp pilot to include merchants in the United States. Further, we just launched a pilot in the U.S. with edo, a leader in personalized card-linked offers for a merchant loyalty program that provides instantly redeemable offers tailored to customer's individual shopping habits. Through edo, our merchants' customers can access a card-linked offer platform with 200 million cards on file across 200 banks, including importantly, 3 of the top 6 financial institutions in the United States. These innovations leverage our existing merchant relationships, enhance merchant retention, grow new business and will provide new revenue sources.","I will now turn the call over to David. David?","David E. Mangum","Thanks, Paul. North America Merchant Services delivered revenue growth of 8% in the quarter driven by U.S. transaction growth of 10%. Canada's revenue declined 7% in local currency versus prior year. Transactions grew 2% for the quarter but spread declined at a mid-single-digit rate. We do anticipate an improved fourth quarter in Canada, with modest revenue growth in local currency.","North America cash operating income or EBIT dollars were $63.2 million with a cash operating margin of 15.5%. In the fourth quarter, given our Canada revenue assumptions, we anticipate that the North America margin will be similar to the margins in the first half of the year.","International revenue grew 10%. In local currency, Europe posted strong revenue growth driven by transaction growth in all markets. Strong U.K. performance was fueled by e-Commerce growth on our International Acquiring platform. Asia-Pacific revenue increased 2% over last year as volume continued to track below our original expectations across the region. We now expect low single-digit revenue growth from Asia for the full year.","International cash operating income of $60.6 million was up 5% with an operating margin of 35.6%, for a decrease of 160 basis points versus prior year, about as we expected for the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate a modest sequential increase in operating margin.","Third quarter GAAP and cash tax rates were about 27%, in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, GAAP and cash tax rates are approximately 28.5%, which we also expect for the full year of fiscal 2013.","During the third quarter, we incurred pretax charges of $17 million for data intrusion remediation efforts, offset by approximately $18 million of anticipated insurance proceeds for a net credit of $1 million on the GAAP income statement. Year-to-date, our net data intrusion expense is $8.3 million, and we now anticipate that the net full year 2013 expenses for the data intrusion will total approximately $20 million. Assuming we receive the remaining $10 million of insurance proceeds sometime in our fiscal 2014, the estimated cost for the processing system intrusion from its inception last year will total approximately $95 million.","We generated free cash flow of $52 million, which included cash outflows related to the processing system intrusion. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement, assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $21 million, primarily related to terminal purchases. We continued to anticipate that full year capital expenditures will total about $110 million. Our total available cash, including working capital at the end of the third quarter was approximately $220 million.","As a reminder, on January 17, 2013, we announced a $125 million accelerated share repurchase program and initially received approximately 2 million shares of the company's common stock. We will complete the program in the fourth quarter, and at that time, we'll have just under $165 million authorized for further buybacks. We are reaffirming our financial expectations and continue to anticipate total company fiscal 2013 revenue of $2.36 billion to $2.4 billion, representing 7% to 9% growth, and cash earnings per share in the range of $3.64 to $3.71, resulting in a 3% to 5% growth over fiscal 2012. We have also updated our annual fiscal 2013 GAAP diluted earnings per share expectations to include the estimated full year impact of net intrusion remediation costs of approximately $20 million or $0.17 per share. Including the estimated full year impact of acquisition-related intangibles, nonrecurring items and processing system intrusion costs of approximately $0.77, GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.87 to $2.94.","And now we'll turn the call back to Paul.","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, David. We have built a strong foundation in our strategy to expand distribution through partnerships and innovation while producing tangible results. We believe that no one is better positioned to take advantage of expanding worldwide payments.","I'll now turn the call over to Jane.","Jane M. Forbes","[Operator Instructions] And operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Roman Leal of Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe we start with Canada, and it's good to hear you're reaffirming your expectations of acceleration in the fourth quarter. But this quarter seemed a little bit weaker than what we were expecting. What gives you confidence that in that perhaps, can you walk us through what you saw maybe January, February, March? Is the trend relatively improving over the last few months?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, Roman, it's Jeff. I'm going to start on Canada, and David will certainly join me. So the first thing, a point to David's commentary in his prepared remarks, is we saw a mid-single-digit decline on spread in the quarter as he described. While we're not where we want to be as it relates to spread, that is an improvement. As you had mentioned, Roman, that is an improvement in our performance in Canada that we've seen over the last number of quarters. So you may remember that in managing Canada, it's a mix of spread, transaction growth, the economic environment, new sales and controllable costs. Spread has been a big driver over the last number of quarters in terms of results, and that mid-single decline that David referenced is important to note. The second thing I would say that we saw on the quarter is a change and a decline in volumes. So when you look at volume in Canada, and now I'm talking about specifically Visa volume, not just the Global Payments but for the whole country of Canada for Visa, we saw a deceleration of those volumes that also impacted at the margin the results that you referred to in the quarter. So we feel like we're tracking well from a share point of view against those metrics but we certainly saw a weakening of Visa volume not specific to Global in the quarter. So when we think about the fourth quarter that David alluded to in his prepared remarks, we think we've seen some progress, not where we want it to be, but some progress on spread declines, a little bit weaker of an economy as reflected in the Visa volumes and then the actions that we've talked about before for the fourth quarter that should help us finish the year as we alluded to. David?","David E. Mangum","Yes. Just to add a little more color to that, Roman, obviously in the fourth quarter, you've heard us say before, it's a pretty important quarter to watch the spread trends and make sure that what we saw annualizing early in the calendar year in terms of the big spread declines from last year really do start to come in at sort of a more manageable level to which you hopefully then could marry transaction growth, which, of course, you didn't see in Q3 to then the other opportunities to sort of manage the economics of the business with the new assessments coming out and the new opportunities to manage around those assessments for hopefully greater economic return on the fourth quarter.","Paul R. Garcia","I would just add to what David said, Roman, that we remain pleased with our new direct sales in Canada, including in particular some large accounts that we've won recently. So you marry that all together, we feel confident in heading into the fourth quarter of fiscal '13.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just -- this is a follow-up. In international, it seems like the margins were unusually strong last quarter, maybe unusually weak this quarter. Was there -- is there something in regards to timing or seasonality that perhaps we missed there? What drove the margins in international?","Paul R. Garcia","We have the typical seasonality that happens in every Q3, really around the business, whether you're talking about North America or most of our assets around the world. You've heard me even say that even Russia actually sees a seasonally light third quarter, as odd as that may sound, even thinking about a high-growth business like that, a high-growth market like that. When you start to think about international margins for the quarter, in isolation, I would point you back to -- we did talk about last quarter the margins would be down a little bit in the third quarter when compared to previous, and really the 2 key pieces to that when we looked ahead and then they sort of essentially came true, the margin again right about where we expect it, maybe a little bit more EBIT dollars in total than we expected, given some of the mix issues I'll talk about in a second. So the declines in Q3 really in international margins are driven by continued sluggish revenue growth in Asia, where we continue to see volumes running far shy of what we hope to see at the beginning of the year, and again, lots of macro involved in that. Of course, remember we saw average tickets decline in the summer and we've seen soft transactions and result in soft volume across Asia. With that, Asia is one of our main scale drivers over the last 3 years of the company's margin performance, particularly in international when that then hangs around low-single digits, it's not scaling margins and is a drag on total international margins. At the same time, we're seeing really different revenue mix in the United Kingdom, and this started to show through in the income statement in the second quarter when we saw outsized growth in general in Europe and talked about that being fueled by United Kingdom business, out of which we run a product or a platform we call International Acquiring, which is the processing of cross-border e-Commerce transactions on behalf of a number of merchants that are one quite large but any number of others, we signed about 30 more for that platform for this -- in this year alone. Now that business drives a great growth on the top line but operates at a lower contribution margin or incremental margin than our core credit and debit processing products in the U.K. So you get great revenue growth, we're seeing terrific revenue growth, you can see that in the top line, we look at the year of growth Q2 and Q3 year-over-year. And that will continue to grow, we think, with secular trends on transaction and with new merchant signings, we continue to add more and more to the platform, as I referenced earlier. So between those 2, you've got a couple of things that are headwinds married to perfectly fine margins and nice progress really across the region in general when you think about our international businesses. So the margins in the other markets are just fine. I think as you look ahead to Q4, we're looking to see some sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. We sing -- we swing toward a more seasonally strong quarter in the fourth quarter, and that's true again across the board just as Q3 was true across the board. And we're continuing to expect solid mid-single-digit growth in EBIT for the full year, and that's held down, as you well know, on a year-over-year basis by currency.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Koning of Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess my first question, just last quarter I think you talked about North America margin being more or less flat sequentially, and I know it ended up about being down about close to 200 basis points. And I guess just figuring out kind of where the disparity between those came from.","Paul R. Garcia","Yes, David, I think if you look at North America, what we may be best to marry it to the international commentary I just gave an answer to Roman's follow-up question. If you look at the total company for the quarter, lots of puts and takes as there always are in a business this large and this complex. So a little bit more performance than you might have expected from international, U.K., especially, maybe a little less in North America quite honestly and little less in Canada. We had the nice metric of just mid-single-digit declines in spread, which we're cautiously optimistic, portends better things as we go forward. On the other hand, Canada still had its revenue decline 7% in local currency and that's a clear headwind as you enter the quarter. So if you look at the puts and takes really across North America, you get that little bit shy on just overall performance with the revenue decline in Canada heading a little north of what we thought. If you marry that then, we got U.S. revenue, kind of right on we expected for the quarter, maybe a little bit shy, but perfectly fine putting in lots of puts and takes in any given quarter. So the Canada revenue decline with really strong ISO growth, which always puts more pressure on the margins. We continue to have that down on an annualized basis, the movement of CyberSource up from the indirect model to the ISOs, the tech spending continued and our increased -- and our expenses increased in Brazil as well. All that offset by the positive impact of APT. And as you probably pause here for a second and remind you, we talked about APT helping margins between the 50 basis points total company and 70 for North America for the full year, it's running a little bit ahead of that. But it's running that in the face of a little bit more challenging situation in Canada than we might have thought going into the quarter and then just sort of the same general performance you're used to where ISOs can drive a lot of margin swings just inside of each and every given quarter. So when we look out to the fourth quarter, which may be the best way to answer your question, I think I do expect to see some margin improvement in the fourth quarter, maybe returning to the levels we saw kind of in the first half of the year if you kind of average Q1 and Q2 maybe back toward those levels. And that's really driven by a typical Q4 in Global Payments, seasonal revenue improvements as usual in our direct channels. And in Gaming and our Greater Giving, where, as you'll recall, we'll do 50% of the full year revenue in the fourth quarter alone. And then you should probably expect us to do the traditional fourth quarter pricing actions we do in that business every year as you get your bolt-ins from the networks and work around those.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just my follow-up then. If Canada, I mean should that be sustainable growth going forward now, and if so, then can we expect EBIT to grow in North America in fiscal '14 behind that in APT?","David E. Mangum","Well, I think you're ahead of the game when we're talking about fiscal '14. I would say this, that what we've talked about before when you deal with Canada, you've got -- well, North American utility, you've got APT coming in, you've got the U.S. business, you've got some trends that will normalize in general in terms of our investment spending hopefully in places like Brazil and technology. And then Canada, it comes down to do we continue to have more manageable spreads that allow us to offset those sort of core spread declines with transaction growth and with any other creative economic things we can do in and around pricing with assessments, and those are the pieces that hopefully we have a much more on toolkit as we enter Q4 than we had 2 months ago.","Paul R. Garcia","And let me add something too, if I could, David. Dave, this is Paul Garcia. Clearly, we understand that our job as management is to grow our company in all of our areas. And while we're not prepared to give any FY '14 guidance, I just want you to know that we certainly understand the charge at hand and we're very focused on doing just that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Kwok of KBW.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess 2 question I have, one was just -- was curious in what was the spread compression in Canada in the second quarter? And just wanted to see what the trajectory is going forward.","David E. Mangum","Yes. Steven, David here. I don't have the exact number in front of me. We've been running in the low to mid-teens in Canada for the last 4 quarters. So that exact number, 12, 13, 14, 15.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it. And then going forward now with the processing intrusion behind the company, what are the areas that you guys are focused on to drive earnings growth? And additionally, does that help with the ability to make additional acquisitions or -- and\/or incremental capital management?","David E. Mangum","Yes, I think, let me touch on capital and then I'll turn to Paul to talk about some of the initiatives. He touched on some of this in his prepared comments. I think -- remember we said at the Analyst Day that you should continue to expect us to look for global expansion. We still think that's the first and early use of our excess capital. That said, we expect to be consistently in market buying back stock as well. So from a capital perspective, you should expect us to stay consistent with that planned strategy we articulated in mid-January. I guess I'd point out as we're exiting Q3 and heading into Q4, we still have that accelerated share repurchase extant. And then we'll look out and talk some more about that as we close that out and give you sort of the final accounting on that. And then with that, maybe, Paul, some of the more specific initiatives?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes, thanks, David. Steven, during a most difficult time for our company, a difficult time for any company, one of the most significant challenges you could face, we actually -- we grew our company. But I would tell you that we had a number of initiatives on hold, these things you couldn't pursue. And I don't think we fully recognized just how that would impact a lot of innovative things, new customer signings, large customers, a number of things that we had in place to execute in this fiscal year that we're just now executing on. So that's why I was upbeat on my comments and why we're very focused on things like partner of choice. We're making significant progress internationally and domestically. We're signing big merchants. I mean, big, like billion dollar merchants in various locales around the world. That wasn't on the table. So things are -- very positive things are happening, which I think will set us up well for fiscal '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from Georgios Mihalos of Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to circle back on the transaction growth in North America. It looked like there was a bit of a slowdown both in Canada and the U.S. And maybe speak a little bit more broadly, what are you seeing in the North American region? Is there anything you can kind of point to, consumer spending or anything like that?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Well, George, it's Jeff. Why don't I start, and I'll start with Canada because we really have a national business there in the U.S. It's more of a tale, as you know, of vertical markets. So as I said before in response to Roman's comments, in David's prepared remarks, we saw a 2% transaction growth in the quarter for Canada, that is lower than we had seen in the prior number of quarters, although I would say that's consistent with the market growth. So if you go back to what I talked about in the context of how we measure our progress in Canada in terms of our share and we look at Visa volumes for example across all of Canada nationally, those were in line with what we reported in our own business. Those Visa numbers have decelerated over the last number of quarters to about 1% growth in this most recent quarter. So if you look at the macroeconomic environment in Canada, George, whether you measure it by unemployment, GDP growth, same-store sales growth and now, of course, the Visa volumes across the country, you've seen a deceleration in the growth -- on the rate of growth in that market. So I still feel like we're well positioned and capturing share in that business, but no doubt a difficult macroeconomic environment. Second, in the United States, I feel like in the vertical markets that we're in and I think David referenced Gaming, I'll add, as Paul referenced, integrated payments and also look at our bank joint venture with Comerica, I actually feel like our growth there has been pretty good from a transactional point of view. So on those vertical markets in which we have a direct business, in which we compete, we've seen reasonably good transactional growth that I feel is in excess of those relevant markets for Visa and MasterCard. Dave, do you want to...","David E. Mangum","Yes, I think when you look at the U.S., George, it's really a story of the ISO metrics sort of swamping the others. I think when I look at the numbers at base on the surface, we're dealing really with the law of large numbers. If you go back a couple of years ago, you'd see mid to high-teens settling down to mid-teens on its way down to low-double-digits. And I don't think there's much more going on than that on the surface of metrics.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up question. Your opportunity for acquisitions, I mean your portfolio acquisitions in Europe and abroad.","Paul R. Garcia","Yes, George, Paul Garcia here. Pretty robust pipeline, and that's something we are focused on. I can't really comment too much more than that other than we're seeing a number of things, including some things that aren't necessarily processes, which means we've been working hard on bringing something, bringing an opportunity forward. And I will say that we are very disciplined buyers. I mean, we pass on a lot more than we buy. But I'm fairly encouraged, particularly internationally.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Paul, or maybe David, can you talk a little bit about the U.K. business? You talked about the International Acquiring business, maybe that's putting a little bit pressure on the margins although it's showing some good growth. Can you talk about maybe how big of that -- how big of a business that is now? I think that's something new for you. And trying to get a perspective of maybe how big of a business that is for the U.K. market.","Paul R. Garcia","Yes, Kartik, we don't break out the U.K. to sort of a product level. It's actually a fairly -- it has been historically a fairly small piece of the U.K. and it's growing at such a rapid rate that actually it's moving the meter on the metrics themselves. Maybe an easier way to answer this is our sort of core credit and debit transaction growth rate in U.K. are just fine. This business is growing so fast, 2x or 3x some of those core transactional growth rates in the, again, the core credit\/debit business that it just has the ability to take that high-margin business and drive it a little bit backward in terms of margin while still delivering EBIT to the operating line.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just as a follow-up for Europe, can you just talk about maybe what kind of transaction growth you're seeing in some of those countries? Just to get an idea of there's still so much on the news about what's happening in the economy. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of transaction growth to get an idea of maybe if things are slowing down there or just maybe more of just what you kind of hear on the press?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes. So if we sort of zip around without quoting too many specifics, we've said to you before that our Russian business is growing well into the double digits. That's a revenue comment. It's clearly a transaction comment as well, when we think about sort of the pieces of that. Then our Spain business, which is, I mean, this is just really remarkable in the face of the economy in Spain, the revenue itself in local currency is growing to mid-single-digits. Obviously, by the time you translate it back, it's lower than that. But let's focus on what the business can do inside of its own market. Revenue is going mid-single-digit; transactions are right on that same kind of number. And again, I continue to think that's just remarkable. It speaks to the value of the partnership we formed with la Caixa and the partner, la Caixa itself and the leverage they help bring to the market married to our ability to run this business in a very focused manner, and it's working beautifully. In the United Kingdom, I think you'd be surprised as how high the transactional growth is. It's really a little bit north of where it was a year ago. That's the business that -- and in local currency in pounds, we talked about mid-single-digit, it's going to do better than mid-single-digit revenue growth this year and its transaction growth is right alongside its revenue growth. So they all feel healthy at that transactional metric level. I mean again, when you think about Spain and what's going on kind of across Europe, it's pretty remarkable.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm going to ask, believe it or not, on Canada. Just trying to make sure I understand it. So second quarter, Canada was down 7% in constant currency and it remained at that level. And so when I look at the pieces, it sounds like 2% transaction growth in this quarter was below expectations. I guess first question is, what was transaction growth in the second quarter? And then the reason why revenues stayed the same even though spreads got better was because, I guess, transaction growth decelerated and volume decelerated. And then why did those 2 things necessarily get better into the fourth quarter?","David E. Mangum","Right. So Brian, the transaction growth in Q2 was 4% year-over-year. It became 2%. So you really -- you put your finger on the right interplay. You had higher spread declines in Q2 with -- offset partially by higher transaction growth. In Q3, fast forward, you've got lower spread declines but then lower transaction. Now if I take a look at any other metric, let me see if there are any other metrics of any sort of relevance -- no, averages tickets are kind of flat. So it really is just those 2 that pull into the difference in the numbers. If you look ahead to Q4, and I'll toss it over to Jeff for any other color, we're not expecting a huge acceleration in transactions. It's much more about, hey, does that spread -- the core spread decline stay consistent with Q3 levels and then do you have other opportunities with these new assessments coming out to economically benefit Global Payments and have this all turn to a prettier picture for Q4 than it was in Q3.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","I think that's a great summary.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just my follow-up to Paul, obviously, a lot of noise around this Chase\/Visa deal and maybe what it might mean and possible potential implications for the merchant acquiring industries since Chase Paymentech is going to be a big part of that, just want to get your thoughts on the changing or if there will be much of a changing industry dynamic there?","Paul R. Garcia","Brian, I've been in this industry for 30 years and we've seen these type of announcements in the past, and I think there is something here that has to meet. I think that -- and I think we shouldn't read too much into reduced interchange levels, et cetera, because that's just not commercial. I mean the reality is developing markets have honest [ph] interchanges, not typically developed markets. And it's just not a commercial proposition. So I think I've got a number of questions about will Chase provide lower discount rates based on accepting lower interchange levels. Reality is they always could do that. This arrangement doesn't provide any unique opportunity for them to do so. They haven't done so because it doesn't make sense. I think the ability, however, for them to offer some marketing incentives and some programs, that's real. And I think they -- we'll see some action. They are already do that. I mean there are already some things now. If you're a Chase cardholder, you can get some discounts. Going into merchants, I think there will be more intense levels of focus on their own merchants. We are responding in kind with things like edo, plus you can assume we're talking to other financial institutions. We are uniquely positioned not being aligned with any big card issuer. So it's kind of refreshing to get to inbound calls, and we're actually fielding some of those. So long and short of it is, Paymentech is a robust competitor domestically, particularly and also in Canada, robust competitor. They, I think -- I don't know if this gives them any unique position. I think it's a clever move and -- but we're not -- I mean there's a lot of things that keep us up at night. This is not amongst them.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Bryan, it's Jeff. I would just add that, as you know in the United States, we generally have a vertical market strategy. So we've been very selective about those markets in which we compete, which, of course, David and Paul and me have described for a long time. I would say that, that kind of approach is outlined by Chase and Visa. While it's applicable generally, it's most applicable to large national and international accounts in the markets in which Chase operates. So as we think about the vertical markets that we've described, while they're all intensely competitive, that vertical market strategy is very different than, perhaps, some of our competitors.","Paul R. Garcia","I want to say just one other thing too, I think everyone knows that we lost a real pioneer in Mike Duffy, who passed away a couple of weeks ago, and that's a -- he was a class guy, built a great company and a robust competitor and a really good fellow.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Of course, I get the -- in the queue right after the Chase question. I'll guess I'll also ask the Canada question just on the price compression. I mean, I guess it's safe to say that the price compression was not as good as you expected it, I think. So I'm curious, is it due to competitive actions or the timing maybe some of the initiatives you're putting in? It just seems like a little bit of a pushout in your recovery plan in Canada, that's why I'm asking.","David E. Mangum","Tien-Tsin, it's David. I think that the -- what we saw is the big spread declines annualized in January really. And for me, quite frankly, the key is does Q4 look like we've annualized those and we have a more manageable spread decline. So if we set the idea that Q4 was going to have flat spreads or something like that, it was unintentional really, it wasn't in our forecast. This 4% kind of decline, the mid-single-digits we quoted, kind of about what we expected honestly. But the key for me all along has been in Q4, does that settle down to some level that's manageable and then how do you marry that to the other things going on in the market that we talked about before the assessment and the reintroduction of assessments and assessment increases. And again, does that give us something else from the toolkit that we haven't had really for quite some time in Canada.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, and Tien-Tsin, it's Jeff. I would just add to David -- to what David said, just to remind you that in the prepared remarks, David talked about growth in the fourth quarter from a revenue point of view in Canada, so clearly that embeds in it assumptions about spread, volume and transaction growth. So when you think about where we are from a trajectory point of view, well, we're not exactly where we would like to be at the start of the year. I do think as we head into the fourth quarter, it will be nice to see as we expect revenue trend in the other direction.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. So Jeff and David, just as a follow-up to that, it sounds like some of the revenue initiatives and your ability to pass through the assessments and maybe round up or what have you, that's in place today or still to do? I'm just trying to understand the visibility around it.","David E. Mangum","Yes, so they haven't happened yet. The official dates are April. So think of them as coming in place as we speak literally. And so we have pretty good visibility into the actions we either have taken or intend to take in the very near future.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","And Tien-Tsin, it's Jeff. Just to add some more operational color. So from a Code of Conduct point of view, those notifications, David is exactly right on what he said about the implementation. Those notifications under the Code of Conduct need to be sent months in advance. So those notifications, Tien-Tsin, in our service center around those notifications have happened already.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. That's kind of what I was getting at. So since you talked about Code of Conduct, I got to ask just around the U.K. and there -- they put out that paper talking about creating utility-like oversight committee or whatever in the region. It kind of reminded me of Code of Conduct. What's your thoughts on what's going on in U.K.? I know it's early days, but given your presence there, I'd figure I'd ask you.","Paul R. Garcia","Yes. I think there are some things that may be reminiscent to Canada. I think there are fundamental differences. First off, what's going on in the U.K. when you look at the -- I think it's called the Treasury Select Committee. It's really -- it's not focused on cards or merchant acquiring in contrast to what we've seen in some other markets. We also clearly don't see it targeted at regulated price or the nature of customer relationships. And that would run counter to a lot of public statements frankly over the years from the U.K. regulators if it were targeted again at price or the nature of customer relationships themselves. There are calls for greater transparency and improved governance really for the payment system or systems at large. And so to us, that suggests a focus again on the systems and clearing on settlement on all the pieces that come together and maybe a focus on the barriers to entry of some of those systems and does that reduce transparency and increased cost whether it's to businesses, small businesses, consumers, anyone who has sort of a play somewhere in this ecosystem. You may even remember we had an example of this a few years ago with some of the faster payment initiatives that were driven in and out of banks and then the vocal [indiscernible] folks as well who had to enable some of the faster payments. And really for -- that means, I think, the big banks and their sort of gatekeeping role relative to payment systems are the focus of this. Again, not merchant acquiring, not customer relationships with merchant acquirers and the card networks themselves. And quite honestly, I think there's possibly a benefit for us. We participate in those systems but we need sponsors, we need any sort of sometimes gymnastics to participate in the systems themselves. If that were to become easier and less costly, maybe level the playing field between ourselves and some of the bank owned acquirers out there, there's nothing wrong with that, that can be nothing but a positive for us. Now to balance that, maybe there's some risk to an acquirer like us of some compliance costs for settlement or reporting for this extra transparency. But I don't view it as the fundamental issue the price of our product out to the customer itself. It's more the cost of doing business, and this happens in every market around the world at any given time.","Paul R. Garcia","And allow me to add, David, that -- this is Paul, Tien-Tsin. We'd never, and never should you, be afraid of having full transparency. We think we're pretty transparent now, quite frankly. And whatever comes out, we will fully comply, and I think that's generally a good thing if you're pleased with how you price. And you shouldn't be afraid to discuss that in detail if one wants to see it.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, and Tien-Tsin, I think at the end of the day, you said it well, it's early days. But as we sit here now, we don't see a fundamental change for us coming out of the, again, the early days of pronouncements.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Smith of Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Paul, I wanted to kind of ask you what the mood out there is among other acquirers you talk to and your ISO customers. Sort of getting back to the Chase\/Visa announcement, I don't think anyone has mentioned Square yet, so throw that in there. Is there sort of a sense of urgency and is it possible that companies are maybe talking about some merger combinations they may not have been talking about 6 to 12 months ago? Or would you say it's just business as usual?","Paul R. Garcia","I would say the former. I would say there is more kind of urgency. I think that's a good thing, actually. I don't think anyone sees this as business as usual, because business changes pretty dramatically, Greg. I think Square -- I think I said all along, Square, and you could pick apart a lot of things about Square. They don't make money, and there's a lot of issues. But I think this -- the fundamental nature of it brought some excitement to the space. Now there were those, you were not amongst them, that thought we're all going to be dis-intermediated. That was silly. It remains silly. But I think just that kind of excitement with Square kind of took our game up a little bit. And we're doing a number of things we're really proud of, and we're trying to one up Square. So -- and I think that goes for a bunch of us. In terms of combining companies and big M&A opportunities, I think those probably get kicked up a little bit too, and that adds a little more excitement to everything as well.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, Dave, the -- were there any material APT integration expenses in the quarter that you can call out?","David E. Mangum","No, Greg. Really, the integration expenses will come in, in Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Maurer of CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was hoping to drill down Asia a little bit. Looking at Visa and MasterCard's trends, you really don't see much, in a way, a fall-off in Asia. So I'm curious if you could describe a little more what you're dealing with. Is it slow approval for expansion in China? I'm just curious.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","I think, Craig, fundamentally, our portfolio really across Asia is heavily weighted toward the travel industry and the high-end retail shopping. In some cases electronics, but also just high-end retail shopping itself. And that's really the portfolio which we started with HSBC, and that's how we focused our merchants since then when you think of the markets we're in with the Maldives, Hong Kong, et cetera, you can imagine the level of travel. So with that, what we've seen is we saw a drop in average tickets in the summer, which generally indicates less spending. We may see the same number of transactions we saw the quarter before, but less spending overall. And, of course, we take a percentage of that, and that then harms the actual performance of the business. I mean at the same time, we've annualized some products as well. And including we now have DCC fully rolled out across the region, as well as our installment payment plan fully rolled out across the region, so some of the things that fueled a little bit more growth have annualized now. Really still brings you back to the core question of we're going to ride more secular adoption over time there. But for the moment, we're being harmed by being so travel again and high-end retail focused, but that's the place where we're seeing some pain. And this is true really across many of the regions there, whether you're talking about Hong Kong or all the way to Brunei, and again as I mentioned, the Maldives, et cetera. So I think we're not a dead-on comparison necessarily to the networks in those regions as they're driving more generalized secular adoption and we're focused in different part of the market. Now we have a number of initiatives in place to actually drive into other parts of those markets, more penetration. The same things we talked about last quarter that we thought would drive improved performance in Q4 actually still hold true. We are driving additional product launches, including new flavors of installment payment plan processing that we think will drive volumes deeper into the bank customer base as they shop, and general retailers around the various markets rather than just the high-end retailers. And then also, we've signed a number of new referral partners this year. They all do come live and are continuing to come live. Unfortunately, those improvements aren't quite enough to offset the overall volume softness we're seeing in general on the market.","Paul R. Garcia","And let me add something, David, if I may. Craig, this is Paul Garcia. We just received 11 awards from MasterCard, Visa and CUP. I mean we're talking weeks ago, for our performance in the region, including Highest eCommerce Acquiring Volume award, Highest Market Share awards, various things we've done and some -- and also the mPOS Acceptance award. So we've done a number of things we're very proud of, and the team's doing a great job. But we're not in China in any real way. I mean we are just what David said, we have all the high-end merchants in Shanghai and Beijing and a number of cities but we have not been able to truly penetrate the vast market opportunity throughout China, and the same with India. We have a new referral partner in India. We have some other big opportunities in India, having just returned. We have a number of big opportunities now in China with us buying the other piece of HSBC. But as I said for a lot of calls, the real opportunities are those markets, and we have yet to capitalize on those but we're very focused on doing so. And now we absolutely have an opportunity to do it with us buying the other half of HSBC.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can I ask a follow-up on Brazil?","Paul R. Garcia","Of course.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I apologize if you already mentioned this, but are you live there yet? And can you disclose who your bank partner is down there? I'm trying to get an understanding of your market share opportunity.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, sure. Craig, it's Jeff. So our bank partner is Bank de Brasilia (sic) [Banco de Brasilia], BRB. It's a state-owned bank based in the capital of Brazil, Bras\u00edlia, and it's a bank where most of the federal employees and the government have their bank accounts. And that was publicly announced in Brazil, I think, last month by BRB. What we've said before, which is still true, is that we plan on being live in fiscal '14, which, of course, starts in June, which would, of course, mean therefore a pilot before that. And given that we're in April, you can assume that that's relatively eminent.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","I wonder if you can give any incremental thoughts just around buyback. It looks like you bought back, if I have it right, 130 million shares. And how we should think about that over the balance of the year and prospects for taking that up?","David E. Mangum","Yes, this is David. So I would point us all back to the Analyst Day in mid-January. We did then announce a $125 million buyback in an accelerated fashion that obviously hadn't closed by the end of the third quarter, so more to come on that as we close that out. And then if we think about to our commentary, we are committed to continue to buy back shares. Let us go and finish off that operation, come back and talk to you some more about it. But just know that we said -- we meant what we said in January, we intend to be in the market routinely buying back stock as the core part of our capital strategy.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then just on the data intrusion, it's -- are we totally done at this point -- all behind us? It just -- it seemed pretty clear from the press release, just want to confirm that.","David E. Mangum","Yes. So let me parse that just a little bit. Again, this is David. We are complete. We are back on the list of PCI-compliant companies. We are processing. We are on, I believe, every list possible at this stage, all the way around the world from all the various entities. We still have some internal cleanup, so you'll see charges come through again in Q4 as they finish documenting processes and\/or make sure that they're ready to roll on a sort of a run-rate basis as we exit the year. But our remediation activities are complete. Our rocks are all back, and we are compliant with all the networks now. It's a matter of making sure, as we exit the year, we're ready to roll and have that to be the core part of how we run the business and not as sort of a standalone function the way it's been for the last nearly a year from investigation through remediation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just one question. The loyalty stuff you were talking about, Paul, was really interesting. And I'm curious when the conversation start on loyalty, tell us how they start. Is it an issuer-driven conversation or is it a merchant-driven conversation? And then how do those conversations go? Kind of what's the focus, is it an issuer trying to keep their card top of wallet? Is it a merchant trying to understand their customers better? What's the genesis of that?","Paul R. Garcia","So they're typically -- it depends a little bit by market. But it's typically starting with us having smaller merchants in mind, kind of the SME to middle market, and offering that. The big guys are pretty much pursuing their own path, although we are having some discussions with larger merchants about this as well. And what you try to do is make it as seamless as possible. You want to tie in as many -- and that's why this edo thing is in [indiscernible] through the others. But this edo thing makes a lot of sense because you have 3 of the 6 biggest banks and 200 million cards. So you have a good chance as -- if you're a merchant, to get a wide spectrum of your consumers in. The challenge is you got to get as close to a majority as humanly possible. So we focus on ubiquitous offerings, ease of use by the consumer, some -- a commercial proposition for the merchant and, by the way, a little bit for us too. It makes the merchants stickier. It produces some good revenue sources for us. You want to add something, please, Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. So I think what we liked about edo was that unlike some of the other models, which are deep discount models, edo really rides the back and the rails of the financial institutions from an issuing point of view. So I think Paul rightly described 3 of the top 6 FIs and about 200 million cards. So from a supply-and-demand point of view, in the case of edo, as one example, a lot of the offers are coming through the bank-related channels, and therefore, are very targeted. And it doesn't depend, therefore, on the small to midsize merchant, accepting very large, call it, 30% to 50% discounts. But instead, it can be a relatively small discount. But because it's very efficient and targeted in the way it's delivered, which is just coming through an FIs who knows the card spend, it's a very nice outcome for the merchant, for the issuer, for the consumer and for Global Payments. And we get bounties, as well as the volume related to loyalties on that. So I think from that point of view, it's a very nice way for us to participate in the loyalty schemes.","David E. Mangum","And then maybe -- I'm going to take a little crack, a little more color too, what the heck. It does -- Paul said exactly what I think is very important to emphasize is it actually starts with us looking to enhance our merchant value proposition and trying to find offers that aren't so issuer-focused that we can't bring enough value small to medium merchants, as Jeff had said. The final thing -- I'll pop in the real reason I'd butted in for a moment here is you should expect us to do similar things with our international partners where we have referral partners and our core partners in Europe and in Asia who have enormous issuing presence and allow us to be even more thoughtful about how we bring offers with them in partnership.","Paul R. Garcia","And just one more thing, we're beating this to death but it's important. Brett, I think the fact that we are this honest broker, right? We are taking inbound calls from a number of financial institutions, both domestic and international, saying, look, we understand you won't just to do this exclusively with us, but we understand that you will bring -- you bring some utility. Let's see if there's something we can work out that makes sense for everyone, and those are very interesting conversations.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just, I guess, one quick follow-up. Is this the thing that merchants are next asking for from you all? As the trusted advisor, what's the #1 thing that your ISOs are being asked or your direct sales force is being asked next that you can help them with?","Paul R. Garcia","That's a wonderful way to wrap this up, thank you so much. I would say, Brett, that is precisely what we're being asked for. We were just -- I was just addressing -- our international product guys who are in for a big meeting, and we talked about what is it that we do. We provide core processing, but we provide much more than that. We have to allow the merchant to have a more intimate relationship with their customer by providing lots of data and have lots of relationships with the merchant that will be very difficult to disrupt. Pricing, generally, comes down in core products. You replace it with things like dynamic currency, with IPP, with installment payment, with loyalty products and that is exactly what they expect. Of course, PayPal is another one. That is exactly what they expect. The ISOs are asking for that, as are the merchants, and we're very focused on making sure we deliver it.","Operator","This concludes the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session.

This was one of the strongest quarters we've ever produced, building on the momentum in the business over the past year. We once again accelerated growth across our markets generating double-digit organic growth on a consolidated basis.","In addition, adjusted earnings per share grew 33% and we expanded operating margin by 110 basis points. Just over year ago, we closed the Heartland merger and we could not be more pleased with the progress we have made together as one company.","As we outlined in December 2015, the combination of Global Payments and Heartland presented an opportunity to accelerate growth by broadening our direct distribution channels in the United States and enhancing our vertical markets exposure. We continue to be delighted with the performance of our combined Heartland sales organization and leadership team.","Since closing the merger, we have consolidated sales forces and adopted Heartland's Merchant and Sales Professional Bills Of Rights in our largest market. We have also established a more robust leadership structure for the sales organization and fully supported their recruiting and training efforts resulting in 147 net additional sales professionals being added to the organization and sales productivity levels that exceeded expectations.","In addition, we have seen historically high numbers of sales professionals performing above targeted amounts and low levels of sales professional attrition since the closing of our partnership. Further, we have made investments to stabilize Heartland's technology environment and equipped our sales professionals with better tools and more robust products and services to sell","For example, we integrated our Realex technology with Heartland's e-commerce solution to create leading e-commerce and omni-channel offerings in the United States. This combined offering contributed to growth in excess of 20% in this channel. These actions have allowed us to gain market share, generate record sales and drive historically low levels of customer attrition in the business.","In addition, the investments Heartland made in its technology businesses have complemented or integrated in vertical market strategy. Over the past year, we have consolidated these businesses under a common leadership and are managing them as a combined distribution channel. We're also bringing these capabilities to other markets including Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Puerto Rico and Hong Kong to further differentiate our technology offerings and accelerate growth.","We are poised to further our position as a leading provider of technology enabled, software-driven solutions worldwide. While launching the revenue synergy initiatives necessary to meet our 2017 and longer term objectives, we have also continued to make substantial progress realizing our expense synergy expectations from the merger. The last significant milestone in this effort is the migration of existing technology environments to our target architecture model, which will be finalized in 2018.","The success of our integration efforts over the past year provides the backdrop for the outstanding performance in our North American business for the first quarter. Our U.S. direct sales channels again generated low-double digit organic net revenue growth and accelerated sequentially. This was driven by strength in our integrated and vertical markets business in our Heartland sales channel.","We saw solid performance in our gaming business as well and we're delighted to announce last week, the renewal and expansion of our relationship with Caesars Entertainment. This renewal reflects the strength of our gaming services and commitment to delivering innovative payment solutions in the vertical markets we target.","In Europe, we accelerated revenue growth across the region, led by our United Kingdom and Spanish businesses. In Spain, we continue to see market-leading volume and transaction growth.","Our Asia Pacific business continues to operate at exceptionally high levels, improving upon last quarter's strong performance. Organic net revenue growth was again mid-teens, driven by solid trends across our key markets. And Ezidebit once again contributed significantly to results in the region with over 20% organic growth this quarter.","Lastly, a few weeks ago, we learned Forbes' named Global Payments and Heartland to its list of America's Best Employers in 2017. I could not be more proud of this acknowledgement, as it is a reflection of our extraordinary team. Our people come first and they are our most important asset. They drive our ongoing success.","I am very proud of our performance in all of our regions. These results are a testament to our focus on excellence and execution, and exemplify our exceptional track record of delivering sustained growth.","Now, I will turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance was exceptional, meaningfully exceeding our exceptions across our key markets. Importantly, we achieved these results while also investing in our business for future growth, furthering Heartland integration efforts and successfully refinancing our credit facilities.","Total company net revenue for the first quarter was $804 million, a 68% increase over 2016. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.85, reflecting growth of 33% or 38% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin for the quarter expanded 110 basis points to 28.5%. On a constant currency basis, operating margin was 28.8%, representing a 140 basis point increase year-over-year.","North American net revenue grew by 101% compared to the first quarter of 2016 and operating margin expanded 250 basis points. Margin expansion was principally a result of strong organic growth in our direct distribution businesses in the U.S., and the realization of expense synergies from the Heartland merger.","Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct distribution channels, calculated as if we owned Heartland in both this period and in the first quarter of 2016, was low-double digits for the quarter, accelerating sequentially from the previous quarter. This was primarily driven by our Heartland sales channel, and our integrated and vertical markets business, both of which again generated low-double digit organic growth. Canada also delivered better than expected performance with mid-single digit growth in local currency.","As Jeff mentioned, our European business performed very well this quarter, delivering 18% net revenue growth on a local currency basis. Reported net revenue growth for Europe was 9% compared to the prior year due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.","Local currency net revenue growth in Europe was primarily driven by low double-digit organic growth in the UK and mid-teens organic growth in Spain, as well as contribution from the Erste joint venture.","In addition, we continued to see strong performance in our e-commerce and omni-channel solutions business in Europe. European operating margin of 45.9% declined from the previous year, as expected, primarily due to the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates and integration costs associated with the Erste transaction. Integration of this joint venture remains on track. And we expect it to be largely complete by mid-2017.","Asia Pacific had another outstanding quarter with 24% net revenue growth and operating margins of 31.2%, an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. Growth in Asia-Pacific was primarily driven by double-digit organic growth across Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and China as well as Ezidebit, which continues to produce over 20% growth.","Excluding Heartland integration costs, we generated free cash flow of approximately $150 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interest. Capital expenditures totaled $46 million for the quarter. In addition, since the beginning of the year, we have reduced outstanding debt by approximately $85 million.","Earlier this week, we completed the refinancing of our existing credit facilities. Through this transaction, we increased our term loan B facility by $610 million, with the proceeds being used to reduce a portion of our aggregate term loan A facility and outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. The amendment also reduced the interest rate spread on all of our credit facilities by 50 basis points and extended the maturities of the term loan A facilities and revolving credit facility to May 2022.","In March, we entered into an additional $300 million notional amount interest rate swap, bringing our total hedge position to $1.3 billion or approximately 30% of our outstanding debt. As a result of our strong results for the first quarter, we are raising our outlook for calendar 2017. We now expect net revenue to range from $3.38 billion to $3.46 billion, reflecting growth of 19% to 22% over 2016. Operating margin is now expected to expand by up to 110 basis points.","Lastly, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to range from $3.78 to $3.95, reflecting growth of 19% to 24% over 2016, which includes a net benefit of approximately $0.03 from our credit facility refinancing.","We are extremely pleased with our performance in the first quarter. The continued momentum in our business, coupled with strong execution and the effectiveness of our Heartland integration efforts, positions us well to achieve our strategic objectives going forward.","I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Cameron. This is an exceptional start to our new fiscal year. Not only have we made significant progress on our strategic objectives, but we have maintained our focus on delivering outstanding results across our business and generating strong returns for our shareholders.","Isabel?","Isabel Janci - Global Payments, Inc.","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up in order to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you.","Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks guys. Great job on the revenue growth. I just wanted to start off with that concept, mainly because in the acceleration off of what was already very strong growth clearly underscores what we're seeing in terms of strength on the iPOS business you mentioned and the direct overall. Is there anything changing in what you're actually doing on that front though? Could you give us a little more color on what's driving that in the sense of how you're operating the iPOS business or how you're handling the sales force? And is that sustainable and is there any one-time nature items that we should be thinking about taking out of that?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Hi Darrin, it's Jeff. Thanks for your comments and I'll start and I'll ask David and Cameron also to jump in. First, I would say, if you step back for a second, you have to look at the overall macro environment. We were very pleased with the health of our economies worldwide, pretty much normal markets.","One thing that (15:08) about this quarter is producing double-digit organic growth across our markets in the entirety, which is one of the few times we probably have done that. So, as pleased as we are with our iPOS business, in particular and also our business here in the United States and in Canada, we're especially pleased as well with Europe and Asia.","And I'll tell you that as much as I like to think that we have a secret sauce here on everything we do, I view our results to be similar in terms of the momentum that you saw from Visa, Mastercard and PayPal, in general, in terms of the macroeconomic health.","Second, I'd say in terms of products and services, what we like to talk about is our integrated and vertical markets. So certainly OpenEdge had another very good period as we described. But I'd also tell you that this is a culmination of a successful investment in expanding the breadth of our integrated and vertical market solutions as we described to the last number of quarters and it's really a continuation of that trend. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've solidified the leadership of our combined businesses both at Heartland sales, as well as for integrated and vertical markets.","We have invested and stabilized the technology and operating and product environments. In Heartland, we've added more products and services like Realex and e-com into Portico which is the legacy Heartland business that we've been describing in terms of their gateway. And I think what you're really seeing now, Darrin, is the fruits of those investments and those efforts that we've made over the last number of months. So I view this as not a culmination but a continuation of the trend that we've seen over the last three quarters.","I think a good way to see that in addition to the revenue, is what we've been reporting which is very low relative attrition rates across our customer base, particularly, at Heartland but also really around the world which is unusual in my experience. Dave, do you want to comment a little bit more on the...?","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. I'd be happy to. I think that's a great answer. Darrin, what I'd add to that is, you asked about one-timers, there are no one-timers in this at all. What you have is really good execution and really good integration frankly across the entirety of Global Payments, whether you're looking at Spain, the UK, the Heartland base business in the U.S., the vertical markets businesses that, Jeff, described that include integrated, as well as our software businesses. You have very solid performance market-by-market and increasingly integrated sales approach going to market with the ability to actually accelerate that growth over time, but fundamentality, no surprises really. You've got everybody hitting on all cylinders all at once.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's really great to hear. So just to be clear, I mean, was there anything extraordinary \u2013 and I'll just turn it back to the queue after this \u2013 about pricing in the quarter anywhere? I mean, we've had a lot of questions on that over the last couple of quarters but it seems like this is really just good execution, if you can just clarify that.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Hey, Darrin. It's Cameron. There's nothing in price that had an impact on the quarter at all. It's really solid execution. And on the sales side, its adding new revenue at faster paces than we have historically and on the retention side, as we're servicing our customers, I think, extraordinarily well, we're retaining our levels of customers than we have historically. And the combination of that, the math is very powerful. As David said, when you have all markets sort of executing well, the earnings power of the business, the revenue growth power of the businesses, it's very powerful.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's great. Great job, guys. Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from George Mihalos of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Let me add my congrats on the strong start to the year. Maybe if I could follow-up on Darrin's question, as it relates to North America and the revenue we saw there, I would have expected a little bit more seasonality, sort of revenue coming down a little bit more from the fourth quarter was almost in line, I think a $3 million difference. So maybe, Jeff or Cameron, you could talk a little bit maybe outside of Canada, where the sources of upside were? Was it OpenEdge, was it Heartland that did a little bit better but clearly seems like something outperformed again?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, George. It's Cameron. Good morning, and thanks for the comments. Couple of things I would note, particularly. One, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, our direct distribution businesses in the U.S. accelerated quarter-over-quarter. So we did see even more strength in our direct distribution businesses in the U.S., the combination of Global Payments and Heartland in the first quarter of calendar 2017. Certainly, that aided the growth that we saw and certainly resulted in that sort of seasonality downtrend in Q1 relative to Q4.","I'd say the second thing, Canada had a strong performance. Last quarter, it was low-single digit in local currency. It was mid-single digit in local currency this quarter. That certainly helped results. And I'd say lastly in our wholesale business, we anniversaried a large portion of the Mercury migration from last year, which as we talked about last year, was sort of an optical headwind to growth as we now anniversaried a chunk of that at the end of February. We've got a little bit of benefit in the first quarter from that which again from a top line growth point of view helped the overall performance in Q1. So I think those are the primary factors. But to me, it really starts with the organic rate of growth we're seeing in our direct distribution businesses which was very strong once again.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And if I could just follow up with one more. Just on the margins, you guys really came out strong out of the gate, up 110 basis points. As we think about the remainder of the year, is there a fundamental reason why margins wouldn't be higher in the back half when I would think more of the synergies flow through and there's less of an FX headwind?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, around the expense side, we've always anticipated that margins would expand in the back half of the year for a couple of reasons: one is currency. We expect the currency headwinds to somewhat abate as we get a little further into the year, which will be helpful to margin. And then secondly, to your point, as we continue to execute on synergies, those will ramp over the course of the year which will be a tailwind for margin in the back half of the year as well.","As it relates to our guide, we increased our overall guide for the year about a 20 basis points. I would note, this is the first quarter. So obviously, we're mindful of that as we think about guiding for the balance of the year, but you're right, as it relates to the trajectory of margin, we do expect margin expansion to be stronger in the back half of the year.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Nice results, guys.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thank you.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","I guess maybe to drill down a little bit on Heartland. I know, Jeff, you gave some commentary and it's getting harder to parse but to your best guess sort of directionally, Heartland's organic revenue growth trends and maybe just an update on what you're seeing in sales performance. I know it's been pretty good out of the gate, but you didn't really give an update on overall sort of bookings trends there.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Glenn, I'll start, and I'll ask David to join in, too. Listen, we continue to see fantastic new sales over at Heartland. Now, of course, those don't translate into revenue for some period of time until they're booked. But I think you're starting to see in our numbers the benefits of last year's good new sales over at Heartland coupled with, as we've said, relatively low attrition and investments in products and services, technology and operating environment. So I think it's really a culmination of all those things, Glenn, while we continue to see very good performance at the integrated and vertical markets of the combined companies including as well at Global.","One thing we haven't said in quite some time is the health of our gaming business. We called that out in our prepared remarks, made an announcement a couple of weeks ago that we've retained and expanded our relationship with Caesars which is one of our larger gaming customers here in the United States.","So I'd say we have the beneficial effect of a very good execution kind of at the core and doing all the right things that we need to do on product, services, tech and ops to make sure that salespeople are focused on what they should be focused on which is selling.","We also said in our prepared remarks that we've added 147 net additional salespeople to Heartland throughout the year. Listen, that helps at the end of the day. We also refer to the fact that we have very good productivity per sales professional at Heartland which, of course, also translates into revenue over time.","So I really view it, Glenn, as a continuation of the trend. I think it's probably been two, three, four quarters now where we've seen kind of consistent trends. And I think, as Cameron said, when those things are all going in the same direction, we certainly need to manage and apply tweaks to it. But I think you're seeing the fruits of the investments that have been made over the last number of quarters.","David, do you want to comment a little bit more on some of the particulars of Heartland?","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. I can add maybe, Glenn, a few metrics there or color \u2013 a little bit of color that'll help shape that. I would start with on a pure Heartland sales basis. So sales remained at an all-time high level. That's been something we've been building for the past year with that team, and they've done a brilliant job as a leadership team. We did restructure the leadership team to create more scalability, to even put more feet on the street but also more leadership on the street. So we're feeling good about that.","I would say, even within that high sales growth, you've got lots of e-commerce growth, you've got the increasing sales of technology-enabled products, even software products, in and out of our trusted dealer network, as well as our core reps on the street.","So we're selling more technology, more services. We're wrapping more value around the sale itself, which obviously creates frankly a higher revenue conversion rate over time, which you're beginning to see in some of the commentary that Cameron made.","Beyond that, Jeff mentioned the 147 net salespeople up versus the same time a year ago. We're also running at historically high levels of reps who are outperforming their goals, meaning they're beating goal, they're on their way to sales club, so historically high levels of that kind of performance. Historically low levels of new rep attrition.","So we added 147 reps. Perhaps your question is productivity. I can tell you, productivity is up, as Jeff mentioned, and you can see it in the low levels of attrition of our new folks. That's a testament to the investments we've made with the leadership team for Heartland sales and recruiting, training, and our sales automation tool.","So, again, just more good execution, good leadership from the team that came with the Heartland partnership in the first place, most of whom are now at higher, more senior positions, driving more growth for us.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Oh, sorry, Glenn. It's Cameron. To the first part of your question, you're absolutely right. We've now anniversaried the Heartland transaction. It's very hard to parse, obviously performance between what was legacy Global versus what was legacy Heartland. My expectation is relative to the second quarter of fiscal 2017, both of those channels accelerated probably by around 100 basis points. So if Global legacy was around 10% or 11% before, it's probably around 11% this time, maybe a little north of 11%, and Heartland's probably a little north as well. So as we think about the rates of growth, on average, it's probably about 100 basis points better than the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which you apply that to the overall starting point, it's a fairly meaningful amount of growth for the overall channel.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Then for my follow-up, Cameron, on North America margin expansion, 250 basis points, and in theory, it should have been a seasonally light quarter. I don't know if the answer is the same as it's been, but my guess is it's not a lot from synergies. But is it largely just business mix, or what's the real story on the strong margin expansion in North America, and how sustainable is it?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we certainly think it is sustainable. Whether it's still sustainable at the sort of 250-basis-point level or not, I don't know that sort of were driving the business towards that type of margin expansion overall. I think you're seeing a couple of things.","One is obviously our integrated and vertical markets business had very good performance in Q1. That's a higher-margin business. So we're obviously seeing the benefit of that flowing through the margin performance in the quarter as well.","On the direct side, as David mentioned, we have strong new sales, but importantly, we continue to see low rates of attrition in that portfolio, and that's essentially all margin. So as that flows through, you're seeing a margin benefit from obviously the organic growth we're seeing, the lower attrition rates that's beneficial to the overall North American margin as well.","And then lastly, it is synergies. If you think about it mathematically, we started integration a year ago. So in the first quarter of calendar 2016, the prior-year period, we didn't have Heartland at all. We took a lot of synergy out over the course of the last year. We still have more work to do, of course, as we work through the balance of calendar 2017, but that is beneficial to margins in the first quarter.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","At the risk of beating the dead horse here on U.S. and Heartland, in particular, can you characterize sort of your share performance versus the market's growth as a whole, recognizing that we are in a really good macro environment? I wonder if you could just kind of talk about share, macro trends and then just the shift to iPOS, say, versus traditional acquiring?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Andrew, its Jeff. I'll start and I'll ask David to join in, too, as it relates to Heartland, in particular. But listen, I don't think there's any doubt about it mathematically, we're taking share across most of our markets, but certainly here in the United States. If you think about U.S. GDP, let's put aside the first quarter which is traditionally low. At least here in the United States, the way it's measured it's sub-1% growth. Let's say its 2.5% to 3% for the year. These businesses are growing well into the double digits organically as we described, particularly, integrated and vertical markets of which iPOS obviously is a part.","But, if you look at it, we're 3 to 5 times the rate of market growth. I'd like to say we're the only one who's doing that. I talked before about Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, et cetera. So I don't know that we're unique in capturing share in the markets that we're in. But as you can see from what we've been describing over the last probably year and a half, we've made very heavy investments in those businesses that we think are growing more quickly than market. So our integrated and vertical markets business which has, as their defining characteristic, a distinctive and defensible distribution edge and primarily where we're selling technology.","We design and have been growing much more quickly than the rate of market growth. So for example, in our Heartland campus or TouchNet business, we're primarily selling software and payments is dragged along with it. In Heartland commerce, in our QSR channel, we just released a new product called (29:40) this week which is essentially commerce in the cloud for QSRs and it's already live this week with a number of restaurants and stay tuned on that.","So those products by definition are designed to grow more quickly than the rate of market growth given their vertical market focus. So I think it's good identification, Andrew, of the areas that we think will grow more quickly. And I think it's good fundamental execution around those opportunities. David, do you want to add anything to that?","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. I think I'd also point out, Andrew, that sort of as a volume matter, we're outgrowing network based volumes around the market. Also Jeff was speaking about macro in general, we're outgrowing the network volumes and I think that's a combination of a couple of things. One is the more tech-enabled solutions we sell, obviously, that on one side drives greater retention, which Cameron pointed out earlier. Obviously, that gets rid of a piece of the headwind of growing over somebody's attrition. So that's a nice, stable base because of the systems investments, because of the quality investments we've made over time and because of the high touch customer care.","But more importantly, you made a point in your question about the shift to iPOS from traditional. Increasingly, as Jeff said, we don't see as much of a distinction because our reps, whether you think of them as traditional acquiring reps or a sales rep in OpenEdge, for example, they're selling technology-enabled, often software-driven solutions. It could be a semi-integrated solution to the point-of-sale. It could be software that's dragging payment, as Jeff mentioned, or payment that's dragging software and, in particular, businesses in TouchNet, in school solutions, in Heartland commerce and in OpenEdge, are a technology sale that's going to grow faster than overall transactional volume in the market. That's what's going to drive our growth rates as on a sustained basis above market growth levels.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","I think, the size of that business, Andrew, it also explains a little bit mathematically is the way we define our technology-enabled businesses that we talked about on our Investor Day, call that billion-ish revenue and the vast majority, not surprisingly of that, is here in the United States or in North America as it relates to Canada with OpenEdge and e-com, but let's call that $1 billion where our U.S. business is just over a couple of billion or thereabout.","So when you think about the percentage of our U.S. business, which is our largest market at two-thirds of the company, while nearly 50% of are those revenue amounts, $1 billion on \u2013 low-$2 billions are directed at this kind of distribution. So unlike some of our peers, it's not a small piece and a fast-growing piece, but a small piece of our business. It's like half the business as it relates to our largest market and I think you have to keep that in mind on the math when you see the levels of growth.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That helps a lot. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, you talk a lot about e-commerce and omni-channel. Could you just frame up sort of how you think about your competitive position in those areas, given that there are some big players? PayPal is one that are in those markets and growing pretty fast.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Sure. I'll start and I'll ask Cameron to jump in, too, Andrew. So what I would say is we think about e-com and omni-channel in a couple of ways. First, I think we've probably got one of the two or three market-leading omni-channel businesses worldwide. We are physically present in 30 countries today at Global Payments. We conduct business in countries well above that.","PayPal is actually a very good long-term partner of ours, and in some cases, is wholesaling our technologies. And that should give everyone, including us, confidence that we have market-leading products and solutions for someone like PayPal to think about going to market with globally. That's kind of one idea.","The second thing I'll say, so the breadth of our products and services as well as geographic distribution, I think, is a distinctive competitive edge. There's only a few people in the world who I think have that. Secondarily, what I would say is we've done a very good job of taking those centers of excellence like Realex in Ireland and in the UK, and moving those into our other markets.","As David, I think, described in the last couple of calls, we've brought that solution to Spain in the last quarter or so, we brought that solution to Canada, and then we brought that solution, as I talked about in my prepared remark, to the United States, to Portico, which is the Heartland gateway here in the United States.","What's a little bit different about us in the U.S. here versus our peers, to get at your question, is we're primarily SME-focused in the United States broadly and then specifically in e-com. So while we have a lot of respect for those partners who spend a lot of time and effort hoarding the very large e-com sellers like Amazon, our stock and our focus historically has been very centered on margin and our ability to sell services that are distinctive but also defensible, at the end of the day.","So I would tell you is that SME focus, including here in United States, is somewhat distinctive to us as it relates to e-com and omni-channel in this market. And I think, as Dave described, that's why I think our cross-sell Realex into Portico here in the United States has been so successful. So those are the ways, I think, were the same in the ways I think were different as it relates to e-com and omni-channel globally.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Great job. You guys crushed it again. And I guess my main question, I guess, first of all, now that you have the new calendar quarters, Q1 was obviously very good, a lot better than what most of us thought.","How do the sequential trends into Q2 go? Is it something like up mid-single digits sequentially, and how are each of the different three regions? Are they all kind of in that same up a certain amount mode, pretty similar to each other?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Dave, it's Cameron. Good morning. Thanks. And first of all, thanks for the kind comments. So I would say, and I think we've talked about perhaps this a little bit before, that the cadence of the quarterly growth is going to be fairly consistent with how you should think about our whole fiscal calendar.","So, if you try to overlay the most comparable period, you're going to get trends that are fairly consistent overall. Q2 is going to step up obviously from Q1 from a net revenue performance point of view, and that should be true by and large across North America and Europe, probably not so much in Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific has a strong quarter in Q1 largely timed around New Year, holidays and things like that. They tend to be strong drivers of transaction volume growth in some of the Asian markets. So Asia, I wouldn't expect quite that much certainly change quarter-over-quarter. But certainly in North America and Europe, I would expect that.","And then Q3, I think, again, sequentially stepped up again. Q3, I would expect to be, from a net revenue performance point of view, one of our strongest quarters, should be the strongest quarter just seasonally due obviously to summer trends and transaction volumes that we see in the summer that are going to be impactful to overall revenue and revenue growth.","And then lastly, Q4 is a little bit of a step down from Q3 just seasonally, obviously. But overall performance again and from a growth point of view, relatively consistent kind of year-over-year to what we'd expect to see in Q3 as well. So, I hope that kind of help shape it. Happy to get into more detail offline with you kind of as to how to think about the overall shaping of the revenue growth. But hopefully that provides a little bit of color.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, that's great. And I guess my follow-up question, the methodology of EPS guidance, it seems like your Q1 was so big. FX, I believe, now is less of a headwind. And now with this refi, it just seems like you've allowed yourself still a little conservatism in the EPS guide so that if you drive more good execution, you potentially have more upside. And I'm just wondering if that is kind of the methodology that you've had now for a couple of years, I think, and if that's continuing?","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","So, I would start by saying I've been accused of being worse things. So first of all, it's the first quarter. So I think we're always mindful. We're in the first quarter and we think about that as we contemplate the outlook for the balance of the year. We raised revenue guidance roughly $20 million at the midpoint. We raised margin guidance by 20 basis points first quarter out of the gate. We raised an earnings guidance by $0.07 at the midpoint, $0.08 on the bottom, $0.05 on the top. So obviously, very good Q1 performance and we factored that into our thinking for the outlook of the year.","But on the margin, I would say we're probably slightly more cautious on Europe. And there's a couple of big events here over the next weeks and months that we're certainly paying close attention to. First of all, being the election in France this weekend, the UK elections on June 8, the fact that Brexit now has officially been triggered with Article 50. The implications of all those as it relates to the macro environment in Europe and in particular what that may mean for currencies is certainly on our mind, and we've factored that into our thinking for the balance of the year.","I think we narrowed the range appropriately. We took the midpoint up by $0.07. We've reflected the refi. Just on the refi specifically, obviously we expect good benefit from the savings that we'll get on spread. But we're also seeing underlying LIBOR rates slightly higher than we anticipated in our budget. So there's a little bit of offset that we've allowed for in the guidance as well.","So, I think we're delighted with where we are from a guidance point of view at the midpoint of the range. We're reflecting sort of 21% to 22% growth over calendar 2016 on a constant currency basis. That's probably more like 26%, 27%. Those growth rates are obviously fantastic. And I'd say perhaps more importantly, as we think about how we're poised for the balance of calendar 2017 and even going in to calendar 2018, if you apply our cycle guidance to the midpoint of our 2017 earnings expectations, that suggests something in the mid-$4 range for calendar 2018, which is obviously terrific.","And if you think back to at the end of fiscal 2015, we reported split-adjusted around $2.50. For calendar 2018, we're going to report something in the mid-$4s. The growth we've been able to drive in this business over the last couple two-and-a-half, three years has been absolutely tremendous, and I think we're well poised to continue to deliver on that going forward.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. It's all good. Congrats. Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if we can maybe kind of like dig into some of the head count and productivity metrics you talked about earlier. You talked about a number of salespeople you added, direct sales force.","Can you remind us how much that is of the total, so what percent did that grew by? And then over the last year, can you give any quantification of the metrics around sales force productivity that would kind of give us an eye towards what we could we expect in terms of the ability to sustain the double-digit growth in direct?","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Jim, it's David. Happy to help you with a few of those things. I'm not sure I'm going to fully quantify all the productivity measures for you, but we can talk about the pieces. That 147 is a roughly 10% increase in head count. And that's obviously productive net heads. So, again, we should be painfully obvious about that. That's net of any attrition. That is a net add from where we were this time a year ago. Obviously, the way the model works, the more of those heads will come in and were productive, obviously, we're getting more sales, more revenue, et cetera.","So I'm going to point you to a few other metrics, some of which I mentioned, some of which I didn't mention a little while ago. So historically low levels of sales \u2013 or low levels of attrition of new reps. So the 147 come in; they're productive immediately. Productivity is up, and productivity in 2017 is above budgeted levels.","Beyond that, we've got historically high levels of reps performing above target, meaning again their target is set and if you beat target, you have a chance to get to the club, get the different awards, get to different levels. We actually call them diamonds. So getting to different levels of diamond. We have historically high levels of folks performing above target and therefore, getting extra rewards or extra notoriety for their performance. I'm not going to tell you exactly what the levels are and how the productivity actually works, just can't because that's a piece of trade secrets, I think we call it, as I look across the room at my colleagues.","But fundamentally, that group of folks is then selling also \u2013 and this I think is a really important piece of the story. They're selling value-added solutions on top of what you would think of as traditionally is payment processing. Maybe we've added a payroll solution to an existing customer. Payroll continued to grow very well for us this quarter. That won't show up in transaction metrics, for example. Perhaps we've added an analytics product, a reporting product, a new lending product is one of our synergies for this year.","I can tell you, we've launched all of our synergy initiatives to hit the 50 basis points of extra revenue growth that Cameron quoted you guys three months ago. So embedded within the productivity is more to sell. This sales force and frankly Global Payments overall around the world has never had more product and solutions to sell around the world.","So generally speaking, I would tell you, we've added 10% of heads. While productivity is increasing, performance is increasing. All of these things bode well for us as we go forward. We continue to set or actually perform at record sales levels across the board. So hard to complain about how the pieces are going where the momentum sits right now.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, David. And then maybe I'll be so bold as to step away from the U.S. growth question for a second and ask, Jeff, at a very high level from an M&A perspective, you've seen a lot of your competitors and peers in the space acquire B2B assets and sort of get into more ancillary areas. So I was just wondering from \u2013 as you look forward to further business combinations and M&A, what's more important to you, growth in ancillary areas or building additional skill in the core acquiring business?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. Jim, it's a great question. First, let me just say, because I know you guys like to ask, that our revenue pipeline is pretty full. I think when we started this year, we said that it was important for us to get to the right place from a balance sheet and capital point of view. I think Cameron's addressed that in some of his commentary.","We've now more than anniversaried Heartland. The integration is proceeding. It has proceeded at a very good pace. We're really in the final legs of that. So I certainly feel as we think about the company strategically that we're in a very happy place, and the pipeline, as a result, globally really is full. So, that's kind of one overarching thing.","The second thing I'd say is it really starts with what's available for sale, the quality of the partnership, the quality of the culture. Very rarely, Jim, do we buy something and just buy assets. It really starts with what do we think of the strategy, what do we think of the culture of the people? And then, of course, do we think we can manage and generate the kind of returns that we really want to generate at the end of the day.","So, I think we're open minded on all those things as you've been signaling, and I think you should assume that we look at everything. So when people announce B2B deals, for example, I think it's fair to assume that, in general, we look at those things around in the marketplace and make a determination on them. And we have a very good track record of closing those things that we are interested in given our history.","I would say on the tradeoff between integrated and vertical markets and kind of more generally, we have a thesis on geographic markets, we have a thesis on new markets that we're not in, we have a thesis on products and technologies that we're not in, and we have a thesis on getting bigger in markets that we already are executing in. So it really does depend on taking opportunities where they come.","Clearly, I think the company is very focused on growing our vertical market strategy. We've talked about that in the last, number of releases that we've had. We talked about it again this morning. It was a key part of Heartland and we've talked many times about campus school, commerce and the like, at Heartland and how important that's been to our strategy.","So sure, sitting here today, Jim, I think if you said I've got this great vertical markets opportunity that's software and some (45:40) payments, I think we'd be highly interested if they met the other criteria that I laid out. I'd say what's a little different about us, too though Jim versus some of our peers is, it's important for us to think about multinational applicability.","So one of the things that I think we bring to the table is a little distinctive, is that we are in those two dozen plus countries around the globe. One of our key criteria is really, can we bring this to other markets as we've brought OpenEdge to Canada and the United Kingdom as we had Ezidebit across Asia-Pacific, as we've done with Heartland, as David has described on the last number of calls.","So, that is a veneer that we would apply, that some of our peers would not apply and we look more favorably on those things that have a multinational focus given our history. So those are some ways to think about where we are.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Superb results, congrats. I'd like to ask about Europe. Great to see the expansion of Realex. Can you talk, Jeff, about your strategy for PSD2? And, in particular, will you be able to leverage Realex to accept consumer ACH payments for ecommerce?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah, Dave, it's a great question. So we're very focused on PSD2. I would tell you, we were also very focused on PSD1 and SEPA and many of the other changes that you've seen from time to time in Europe and around the world. I think you're exactly right in your question. I think PSD2 is very good for our business in Europe. If you think about what that regulation is intended to accomplish, it's focused on moving away the traditional connection between the account at the bank and the provider of payment functionality. Good news, we're not a bank and we're not a bank especially in Europe, we're not a bank in our market. So I think that's very good news to allow more portability of the underlying banking transaction to people like us who are non banks and are technology providers.","Secondly, I think your question's exactly right in a sense that we have open APIs at Realex and one of the other initiatives around PSD2 is to allow open API applications to be built by third parties. Well, if you go to Realex's website, on their website, that's exactly what you see. So I think that really very much leans in our favor. So we think PSD2 is going to be a very good thing when it rolls around in 2019 in our markets for our businesses. We think SEPA and the lowering of interchange even though we don't book revenue on that, lowering of cost to our merchant base was, as you have seen in all of our markets but including in Europe, also a very good thing for our business.","And I think really catapults ahead our omni-channel and e-com strategies worldwide, but especially in Europe. And one of the things that we have, David, that I think some of our competitors don't have in those markets is the omni-channel capability. You meet with people who compete with Realex, particularly in Europe, what they'll say is we're really good at e-com but we're having trouble with the last mile i.e. face-to-face connectivity.","If you think about the size of the footprint that that we've been able to build worldwide, but especially in Europe, one of the things that we have is we're in so many markets physically around the world. Markets like Spain, the joint venture with Erste Bank in four countries in Continental Europe of course; Ireland, the United Kingdom, et cetera. That is a head start versus what these other firms are doing. And I think in all candor, I think our competitors would tell you, gee, that part's really hard, and we agree which is why we spent 50 years building it.","So, I think it puts us in a very good competitive position as PSD2 comes to the market and as we continue to integrate our Realex offering not just in Europe but globally.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Glad to hear you're so well positioned for PSD2. Just as a follow-up on that, Jeff, what will the revenue model look like for Realex as you kind of integrate that into PSD2 capability for merchants?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. So, it's a mix of models today, David, and obviously this will change over time. But traditionally, Realex was a gateway model. So, we were white-labeling in the United Kingdom before we did the deal a few years ago. We were white labeling their gateway, and their model historically was cents per transaction, and of course we get paid as an acquirer.","Today, now that we've integrated that, we obviously have moved away from gateway-only pricing into a provider of value-added services. So, what did that mean? That means support and analytics, that means data reporting, and very similar to the strategy, David, that one of your peers asked about in the United States.","We're very focused on providing technology solutions like software, and dragging some element of processing with it is a good thing. But we're just as content selling technology solutions that aren't tied directly to basis points or cents per transaction as we are selling software and SaaS and fraud protection and prevention and data reporting and analytics types of services.","So, I think the answer to your question is we took it from a gateway-only business that wasn't doing any acquiring to a bundled solution in a market that it's in. Now, we've taken it to a value-added products and services solution that is settling in many currencies that people like to settle in around the world that aren't just tied to any one market. You can see the movement away from basis points and cents per transaction toward a more wholesome value-added food chain.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","And, David, it's Cameron. I'll just add one maybe minor distinction that I think is worthy to know. We don't really think about Realex so much as a \"standalone\" business. Realex is really enabling and equipping our e-commerce and omni-channel solutions capabilities around the globe.","So we're managing it as a revenue model. It's really enhancing and enabling our ability to drive e-com and omni-channel growth in all of our major markets, key markets around the globe. We think about it more that way as opposed to sort of managing Realex and operating it as a standalone business under the Global Payments umbrella.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Congrats, again.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. We talk about Asia, growth has been strong there. I was wondering if you could update us on your longer term objectives there. Just interested in which geographies apart from Australia are looking like sustained, solid, double-digit top line opportunities. What's your thinking about your longer term strategy?","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Well, Jeff. It's Jeff and I'll start. And thanks for what you said about Asia. We really couldn't to be more pleased with our performance really across Asia but especially in those markets that Cameron alluded to in his prepared remarks. So really, when we started looking at the business a number of years ago when we started running the company, we really grouped Asia into \u2013 as we do with all of markets, but Asia into two or three categories. One is growth markets where we think we could have a technological advantage relative to the peers.","It's pretty easy now, Jeff, in hindsight to say, well, Ezidebit Australia and New Zealand, sounds like a really good idea, as does eWAY which is e-com and that's a quarter of the market in Australia and New Zealand, that would be a very good example of markets where we think we can get hyper growth by technology-enabled software-driven solutions.","The second category is markets that are attractive in their own right, perhaps not with technology, but where there is good GDP growth with an accelerating middleclass and a relatively low card penetration. I think the Philippines are a great example of that market. And, of course, a year and a half ago in August of 2015, we closed our joint venture with Bank of the Philippine Islands, which is the second-largest bank in the country of the Philippines and is a fantastic partner for us.","And as Cameron alluded to in his prepared remarks, we saw a double-digit organic revenue of \u2013 well into the double-digit organic contribution growth in the Philippines, and that's a market we're very excited to continue to grow. And I think we've got probably 25% to 30% of the acquiring market in the Philippines today with our partner, Bank of the Philippine Islands. That's the second category.","And the third category is more traditional markets that may not have the same growth trajectory but are important for us to have our foot in the door as things change and develop. And I would put in that category, we like to talk about Greater China, but let's put mainland China in that category for the time being, and let's also put India in that category. As Cameron alluded to in the last couple of calls, not surprisingly, Jeff, demonetization is actually a very good thing for our business, the idea of banning cash. Not surprisingly, since we're a card provider, it sounds like a great idea in the scheme of things. Whether that long term is the right policy is for other people to really decide, not us.","But what I would say is benefiting from those trends is a good example of foot in the door, and we think that markets are very attractive and ripe for what we're doing, and we were lucky rather than smart, in the case of India, but I would say, certainly, the strategy is sound.","In the case of China, and we'll probably talk more about this in the future in the case of mainland China, expanding the source of our distribution and diversifying to include not just Visa Mastercard, Amex, and the like cross-border, but adding and growing our business with China UnionPay but adding people like Alipay, which we've done in our markets, is very important for us to access new payment types.","So while it's not a \u2013 while mainland China itself is a very large percentage of our business worldwide or in Asia today, Cameron did call it out as a double-digit organic grower this past quarter in his prepared remarks. So, from that point of view, that's the third strategy, India and China. And it's important for us to have exposure to those markets.","So Jeff, I'd say it's really those three buckets. We're very fortunate, as Cameron said, to be enjoying, probably Cameron, our fifth or sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth in Asia Pacific with very good margin enhancements. And listen, I think if we can find more Ezidebits to do, we will \u2013 and more joint ventures with people like \u2013 partners who are terrific like BPI, we would certainly do those. But I think the strategy has played out very nicely.","In terms of the focus going forward, we are certainly looking at QR codes, different modes of payment. Obviously, we're exposed to RuPay in the Indian market and things like that. And we continue to look at those things, Alipay, I already described. We continue to look at those things as they emerge, as we continue to access sources of growth in that market.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Appreciate that. And then just as a follow up. Can you just remind us how you're thinking about pricing from Heartland as you think about the medium term? Are Heartland's products and services being appropriately compensated from your standpoint? What's your thinking there? Thanks","David E. Mangum - Global Payments, Inc.","Yeah. So this is David. And we're thinking about the same way we have for quite some time. Right? We want to be compensated where we create value. We don't price for pricing sake and we won't price for prices sake. But we do believe that combination of Global and Heartland runs an industry-leading infrastructure with world class service. So we do want to be paid. What I'd tell you is more directly to answer your question, we're steadily making our economics for new sales better aligned with that high level of quality and service.","We've actually enabled some of our tools to make it easier for sales reps to price the products based on value. And so we're trying to make things more visible and obvious where we're creating incremental value and encouraging the sales reps to begin to price at levels that are more appropriately actually matched to the service we give. So we're putting all these pieces in place. I want to draw a really important distinction there and I'm going to repeat myself, that's not priced for prices sake, that's looking hard at, hey, when we bundle this service with that service that service, should we be paid for that. When we enable our Level 4 merchants to comply with the new PCI standards and we create an investment for that and create a product for that, we should be compensated for that.","So, again, not pricing for pricing sake, but do think of it as lots of enhancements to the way we run the sales force, to the way the sales force goes to market to give them the ability to think about the value of the service we're creating and priced accordingly. All that's fully in place as we enter 2017. And as Cameron said, you'll see some of the benefits of that begin to build in the 50 basis points of revenue synergies we'll drive over the course of the year.","Cameron M. Bready - Global Payments, Inc.","And, Jeff, it's Cameron. I'll just add one minor comment which is in Q1, we're really not seeing any of that. That is building as we work through the year. And to David's point, none of it is pricing for pricing sake and certainly none of that in Q1. So we see good momentum as we're building towards the 50 basis points of revenue enhancements that we indicated we would deliver in calendar 2016, working towards the overall 1% to 2% over time. Those are initiatives that are in flight. But certainly, I think Q1 is \u2013 we're not seeing a lot of impact from that at all.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Appreciate it. Thanks very much.","Jeffrey Steven Sloan - Global Payments, Inc.","Well, on behalf of Global Payments, thank you for joining the call this morning and thank you for your interest at Global.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Investor Relations, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane M. Forbes","Good morning, and welcome to Global Payments' conference call to discuss the unauthorized access into a portion of our processing systems. We are now also going to discuss fiscal 2012 third quarter earnings, and this call replaces the conference call previously scheduled for April 4. We will pause after our prepared remarks on the security incident and take your questions, resuming with our prepared remarks on earnings about halfway through the call. Our call today is scheduled for one hour. And joining me on the call are Paul Garcia, Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sloan, President; and David Mangum, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary, which are discussed in our public releases, including our most recent Form 10-K. We caution you not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call.","In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these results more clearly reflect comparative operating performance.","For a full reconciliation of cash earnings to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K this morning dated April 2, 2012, which may be located under the Investor Relations area on our website, www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now I'd like to introduce Paul Garcia. Paul?","Paul R. Garcia","Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. In regard to the security incident, I am very pleased to inform you that we are making significant progress in defining and rectifying the event. The company believes that fewer than 1.5 million card numbers may have been stolen and that the theft is confined to our North American processing system. Importantly, the investigation to date has revealed that the theft involved Track 2 card data only. We do not believe that Track 1 card data was taken or that cardholder names, addresses, social security numbers or consumer banking information was obtained by the criminals.","In addition, based on the forensic analysis to date, network monitoring and additional security measures, we believe that this incident is contained. Visa has removed us from the PCI compliance list pending the results and resolution of our work. Upon reflection, this was not unexpected, and we are focused on the remediation measures necessary for full and timely PCI reinstatement. It goes without saying that we are providing uninterrupted service 24 hours per day to our customers around the world as we speak.","I cannot stress more vehemently that this does not involve our merchants, our sales partners or their relationships with their customers. Neither merchant systems nor point-of-sale devices were involved in any way. It is also important to emphasize that consumers are completely protected if any exposure were to arise. The card-issuing institutions have well-established and highly effective procedures to protect their customers. Consumers, as always, are encouraged to be vigilant by reviewing their statements and reporting any suspicious activity to the card-issuing institution. To that end, we have established a consumer website for inquiries, which will be operational later this morning. The website is www.2012infosecurityupdate.com.","Operator, we will now take questions regarding the security incident.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jim Kissane with Credit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Paul, how quickly do you think you'll be back on Visa's approved processor list? And just a follow-up, I mean, you're calling it unauthorized access as opposed to a breach. What's the fine line between unauthorized access and a breach, if you can provide a little insight there?","Paul R. Garcia","Okay, Jim. In terms of when will we get our ROC back, our record of compliance, so I will tell you that prior to the event -- to the -- we can say, breach, and prior to the breach -- I think they're synonymous is really the answer to your second question. Prior to the breach, we were -- we received a report of compliance, and then after the breach, we were removed. I think it's a little bit like a Joseph Heller novel, Catch-22. I mean, you are compliant prior. If something happens, by definition, you\u2019re no longer. And therefore, that's not totally unexpected. The important thing is we're open for business and processing transactions. Now how quickly can we get back? That is something we are absolutely focused on, and we're working around the clock, literally. And we're working collaboratively with all the associations to get that ROC back. And quite frankly, we have every expectation that will happen as expeditiously as possible. But this is somewhat nascent in that, remember, this was self-discovered, self-reported. No one came to us. No one said there's records of all kinds of incidents out there, with cardholders reporting incidents and banks having concern. None of that happened. We found this. We reported it. Within hours, we reported it. And this is -- the investigation is still continuing. So there's parts of this, Jim, that we still need to resolve and button up. Although it's absolutely contained -- to the best of our ability and opinion, it's absolutely contained. We know we have some work to do to get with the associations to get this ROC back. So long, windy answer to saying it's going to be as soon as possible. We're working very diligently, but I think it's going to take a little time, yes.","David E. Mangum","And Jim, this is David. Maybe a little bit more color in banding. We can't put a timeframe specifically on this. What we need to do is complete the investigation portion of this process, and then identify and perform any required remediations at that point, and we'll do just that. That's our plan.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Are you aware of any fraudulent transactions on the accounts where the data's been stolen?","Paul R. Garcia","No. No, Jim, we are not.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess I just wanted to get some clarity on the timeline of sort of when you discovered this, and it sounded like, from your press release from Friday, it was early March, and there were some indications that the breach actually kind of happened late January. It'd be helpful just to get some clarity around the timing of events.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. So a couple things, Glenn. First of all, this is an ongoing federal investigation, right? We're -- they\u2019re trying to get the bad guys here. So I can't be terribly specific, and I will tell you, there's a lot of rumor and innuendo out there, which is not helpful to anyone, and most of it, incredibly inaccurate. But I can tell you this. Approximately 3 weeks ago, we identified that cardholder data may have been taken. Literally, within hours of that discovery, we contacted federal law enforcement and the card associations. So we jumped on this instantly. Now in terms of other timelines, I just cannot be specific, truly, about that.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the types of cards, was it a Visa, MasterCard, or was it beyond that, other branded cards as well?","Paul R. Garcia","I think it's the major brands and pretty much in proportion to how they're used by the consumer.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a little bit more insight as to how much time you think it'll take to actually rectify the issue?","Paul R. Garcia","David, I wish I could. And we clearly realize that's something we need to do as quickly as possible, and you can be assured that we are working very collaboratively with the associations. And quite frankly, they have every desire to have us button this up as quickly as possible, too. So they're pulling on the same end of the rope as we are. So they have to make certain that every single thing that we say is fixed is fixed. They have to tick and tie that. That's not days. It's longer than that, regrettably. We don't think it's months, but we have work to do here. And I\u2019ll promise you this. We will keep you guys informed in this.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And just as a quick follow-up, you\u2019ve said that none of GPN's merchants and none of those merchants' customers were affected. Does that suggest that the breach occurred through an ISO? Or I mean, if it's not your merchants or customers, I mean, where did the breach actually occur?","Paul R. Garcia","David, I'm so glad you gave me a chance to answer that because I want to really hit this hard. This was not a merchant breach. This was not an ISO breach. It's literally nothing to do with those guys, literally nothing to do with them. This is something that happened in a subset of our North American processing system. A handful of servers in reflection -- a handful of servers as compared to significant numbers that we have, and after combing each of these -- we had security measures in place that caught it, and now we're going back with a fine-tooth comb with a number, number, I mean, multiple forensics experts, leaders in the field, to go through every single aspect, every single server, every single piece of data to make certain that we didn't miss anything. And that's what I'm talking about. It's evolving. But it was at our systems. It's nothing to do with the merchants, their relationship with their customers, our sales partners, financial institutions who do business with us, nothing to do with them. Nothing. Period; end of story. No more so than if they take U.S. currency, and there's a -- the currency devalues. Or they accept a card brand, and they have a systemic issue. It's nothing to do with them.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Does this suggest you'll have to step up R&D or system spending as a result?","Paul R. Garcia","Well, if the answer is, are we going to spend even more amount of money, quite frankly, on security, the answer is yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Real quickly on the -- I guess I'm thinking more about the competitive response to this. So presumably, in the ISO channel world and in any other part of the world where you guys are actively competing, there's going to be a playbook out there that says you guys were breached. How do you keep your ISOs, especially the larger ones, from balking at this point? What guarantees do you guys have in contract terms that this isn't some type of a material adverse clause where they could actually start considering looking at other merchant processor relationship at this point?","Paul R. Garcia","Julio, let me answer that, and I think Jeff wants -- Jeff Sloan wants to mention something, as well. So firstly, I would say I'm incredibly heartened by the competitors who -- I'm talking about people that you recognize that compete with us, who have given me every assurance that they will make certain that they don't do anything that would inappropriately take advantage of this situation. And quite frankly, I will tell you we all did the same when other occurrences have happened, with other processors. I made those same assurances to those guys. We're all in this together. We're all in this together, all of us, the card issuers, the banks, the merchants, the acquirers, we're all in this together. And no one wants to try to capitalize that. I mean, there might be rogues, but let me tell you, they are the outliers, and they are wrong. Secondly, we've gotten similar responses from our customers. And they said, look, we know we're going to get through this. We have a long relationship with your company. We feel very good about everything you're doing. And we'd like some more product now and again. I mean, that's the kind of the business-as-usual kind of comment you get, which, quite frankly, are very heartening as well. Now it doesn't say that I can guarantee you there'll be no fallout here, but -- because this is a significant thing, we're working through. But so far, I will tell you we're very, very encouraged by the response. Jeffrey?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","I would just add onto what Paul said, Julio, by saying what he said a minute ago, which is there\u2019s absolute nothing at our partner level, nothing at the ISO level, with our bank referral partners, with bars or any other similar distribution partner that was impacted here. So what that really means at the end of the day is there's no need to replace, for example, point-of-sale equipment or any way we operate with our partners. So in my experience, Julio, the thing that you tend to be most concerned about in terms of disruption to our or our partners' businesses is disturbances at the point-of-sale, disturbances from an operating point-of-view. And while what happened is what it is, as Paul described, at the end of the day, the endpoint relationships between our partners and their merchants and the merchants and their customers was not impacted by what Paul has described. And I think that's probably the best way to think about how our partners have thought about it to date. That's how I view it, but that's also been my experience in having conversations with them through the weekend.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just any incremental expense associated with this presumably are going to be in fiscal '13 since we only have one more quarter to go here in fiscal '12.","David E. Mangum","So Julio, this is David. When we can size it, we're in the early stages of investigation, we'll be back with what we have. We have to be able to size it, reasonably estimate it, any losses and expenses. Anything we're doing right now relative to the investigation, we're expensing as a period cost in Q4. We don't have an event to take a charge in Q3, so we'll be back to you on that. And then I think if we refer back to David Togut's question, any investment you'd see will take itself into FY '13. I think that's part of the point of your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess my first question, have you guys experienced anything like this, or I'm sure on a smaller scale, in the company's history?","Paul R. Garcia","The answer is no. We have not. I mean, that's some of the misinformation, quite frankly. I mean, we -- there was a rumor out there that we were aware of a data intrusion a year ago. The answer is no. That's not -- this is the first incident and we hope this is the last. I think one of the answers, Bryan, is that this is an ongoing process. We get better and stronger every day. And I think that one of the reasons we're getting assurances from our customers is they know that we will be even better at the end of this process and that they will be with someone who is very strong and very tested. So that's why it's going to take a while to get the ROC because we have to demonstrate all of that. So no, there was no other incident. If there were, quite frankly, we would have reported it.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I assume the criminals probably tried to attack multiple networks, and somehow, they got through on GPN. Is there any -- do you know exactly what it was that was the weakness on your guys\u2019 side?","Paul R. Garcia","So I will tell you this that this speaks to the ongoing nature of the investigation. I don\u2019t think you can assume anything you just said, in the first part. I think that there's attacks that happen every day against lots of people, and I think we are -- we have contained it, so you can be sure that we have all the necessary measures to protect ourselves, and that starts with where you think the intrusion happened. But I can't really be more specific, and I certainly can't speak to anything that is happening to anyone else as we speak.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last one for David. I assume a lot of these costs, we will have a separate, broken out number kind of -- there'll probably be some onetime charges, I assume, from this and maybe some ongoing expense as well. I think that's what people are trying to get at, just your thoughts there.","David E. Mangum","Yes. I think that's right, Bryan. We will call these out and make sure they're clear to you. Again, just to sort of repeat what I said in answer to Julio's question, we can't, right now, reasonably estimate what the charges\/losses might be related to the incident. When we get to the point where we can reasonably estimate, we'll obviously record and accrue and disclose. So you're on exactly the right track. When we get to that point, we'll be back to you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to clarify the situation with Visa a little bit further. I know your press release yesterday said that you are still actively processing for all the brands, but you obviously are trying to get the ROC back there. So what exactly is the situation? I mean are you still able to process for Visa, or do you have to wait to actually get the ROC back here?","Paul R. Garcia","So Jason, there's 2 questions there. Number one is are we processing transactions for Visa? The answer is absolutely, positively yes. Of course, we are. We have millions of merchants around the world who are processing Visa transactions as we speak. We'll continue to process Visa transactions as we speak. In terms of getting the ROC back, we are going to do that as expeditiously as humanly possible. And I think our merchants and our customers understand that this will make us even stronger. And if people were to leave and go to another processor, and God forbid something happened there, would they go to another processor? I mean, PCI gets better and better and better. This will make us all better. This will help PCI be better. This will help us be better. This will make everybody more secure. We're all in this together. And Visa, MasterCard and the other brands absolutely understand that, and we are working with them, and they're working with us, and we're all trying to get ahead. What we shouldn't forget is these are thieves. These are bad guys. These are people who are working day and night to try to hurt all of us; and all of us, together, have to do our best to thwart them, and that's what we're focused on.","David E. Mangum","So Jason, David, I'll add a little more color to that, too. We're all of a little over 3 weeks into this process. We have to complete the investigation portion of it, identify any things that require remediation and perform that remediation. We do expect to do just what Paul said, do that as expeditiously as possible, but we have to complete our work.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So in the meantime, what are the implications while you wait to get the ROC back? I mean...","Paul R. Garcia","Jason, I think that's an excellent question. So I think it's unclear. I would tell you this. It does not, and nor would anyone suggest that this would stop us from processing transactions. I think what was mentioned earlier is true. It could give our partners some pause that they're doing business with somebody who experienced a breach. Regardless of whether or not there's a ROC involved, someone experienced a breach. And that's why we are working very, very, very hard on fixing all of that.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Jason, it's Jeff. I would just add that, as you know, in our business, we have long-term relationships with customers. As David rightly said, as we continue our work, whatever needs to be remediated and done to Visa and the other networks' satisfactions ultimately will be done, but these are long-term relationships with a lot of technical infrastructure around it. I think people understand what that means in terms of day-to-day operations. And for now, clearly, through Friday and starting today, around the world, it's business as usual.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And then just to come back to sort of the investigation and the remediation, which I understand you can't be precise in terms of how long this will take, it sounded like it's not days, it's not months. So people are going to say, okay, maybe it's weeks, and you can debate how many weeks. But is it -- it will be resolution of that remediation over the next x number of weeks, for argument's sake; that will then allow you guys to reasonably estimate the charges and costs associated here? I mean, that's how we should be thinking about the sequence of events.","Paul R. Garcia","So Jason, let me say this. Firstly, I think you said it extremely well. We understand there are 2 things hanging over us, right, getting this ROC back and identifying the exact onetime charge associated with this. Now we are doing our very best to see both of those happen as quickly as possible. And I think there's still -- it's still developing. It's still going on and there's still cost. David needs time to get his hands around all of that. But we will -- we're trying to do that as quickly as possible. If you push me, I would say maybe the ROC comes before the charge comes, probably in that order, but hopefully, it's as soon as possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Your confidence level that the 1.5 million account figure represents the upper end of the range. I know this is a moving target and it's variable, but it\u2019s a big difference from 10 and refreshing, but how can we just kind of range-bound the -- how much this could move here?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes. That's a great point. So you can be sure that we worked very hard on that and we looked at every piece of data we could possibly look at and then allowed ourselves some expansion. I mean, we're trying to do this in a way that puts our hands around it. We don't have complete clarity of information. So you have to come up with a number that we all believe is reasonable. We all believe this number to be a reasonable limit. Now we obviously understand if this were to go beyond that, we'd have to deal with that, and of course, we would, but that's not our expectation. And it's because of a lot of work and effort that we came up with that, so we have a high degree of confidence in that number. And if that were to change materially, of course, we would be out to you guys with that information.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You guys have a lot going on internally as far as platform consolidation and data center reshuffling. Could this event impact any aspects of your strategy there?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes. I'd say the answer is no. This is what we're trying to do. We have almost 4,000 people at our company. We have probably 100 who are focused on this. And the rest of the people are running their businesses and signing up customers and operating their data facilities, et cetera. Now it\u2019d be disingenuous to say that this didn\u2019t -- wasn't distracting and that everyone in this room has clearly been working around the clock on this item and, quite frankly, will continue to. And that's going to be a little distracting, and you can only do so much in one day. So it does mean that some hours we could've spent on product innovation, et cetera, we push that off. But we're going to get back focused on that as soon as we can, and the rest of the company's already focused on it. So business as usual sounds a little trite, but we're trying to make that just exactly what that is: business as usual.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just last question, you said you made changes and there's still more changes to be made. I mean is that something where the networks will come in and help advise you on what needs to be done, so you can fall back into compliance? How -- yes, that's basically my question. How much has been done already? I mean, was it just to plug the leak, and is it a whole lot more work to have the ongoing patch, if you will?","Paul R. Garcia","Well, that's another excellent question. So Glenn, let me just say a couple things, which is not typical in these scenarios. Remember, we self-reported this. We self \u2013 we determined it ourselves; no one came to us. And I think there is a kind of a, that's great; you guys did that and that's the way these things should work. Now how did they get in, in the first place? That's not a good thing. So we absolutely recognize that and assume full responsibility for it. Just detecting it early is a good thing but it doesn't necessarily -- it doesn't forgive us from trying to stop it altogether. So we are focused on that aspect of it. The associations are working collaboratively with. They've been terrific to date. And they have forensic experts that are working collaboratively with us to get this done, and we will work arm in arm with them until it's resolved.","Operator","At this time, I will now turn the call over to Paul Garcia for earnings commentary.","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, operator, and let me say, too, when we go to questions on the earnings, obviously, we'll continue to entertain questions on the data breach. So if you feel you want to ask some more of those, absolutely. We just wanted to get this out here, too, because as we said, we're running our business, and we're pleased with our results, and we want to share them with you and give you an opportunity to ask some questions about that, as well.","Okay. So now for Q3. We did have a strong revenue and cash earnings per share performance in the Q, both resulting in 17% growth over prior Q3 to $534 million in revenue and $0.83 of cash EPS. Our revenue this quarter also included a partial benefit from the 3 acquisitions we announced last quarter. These collectively added about 1 percentage point to total company revenue growth, and these acquisitions are all on target financially for the quarter. Let me just remind you what those 3 were. They included the merchant business with more than 6,000 merchants from Alfa-Bank, increasing our footprint in Russia. It was HSBC's merchant acquiring business in Malta consisting of about 4,000 merchants and a portfolio of approximately 9,000 U.S. eCommerce merchants from CyberSource.","For the third quarter, North America delivered revenue growth of 15%, driven largely by our U.S. ISO channel, with continued solid performance from our gaming and direct businesses. Although Canadian transactions grew 6% on a transaction basis, Canada did not meet our internal expectations and posted a revenue decline of about 5% in local currency, and it's primarily due to spread compression. ","Our international segment produced another very strong quarter, with revenue growth of 23% fueled pretty much by all regions across Europe. Asia's revenue grew at a somewhat slower rate at 8%, in part due to an intentional exit from a major airline processing relationship. We exited that relationship.","I'm pleased to announce, very pleased to announce -- and a lot of people have been waiting for this. I'm very pleased to announce that we have received formal approval to process China UnionPay renminbi transactions in much of Guangdong province and consistent with the manner in which China UnionPay defines its geographic regions. So it's not all of Guangdong, but it's like cities like Guangzhou. This is a region with 80 million people, so this is probably covering 60 million of them. We continue to focus on expanding our renminbi merchant-acquiring capabilities to all of PRC, and we're making progress.","For the current fiscal year, we anticipate Asia's revenue growth to be about 10%. I'll now turn it over to David. David?","David E. Mangum","Thank you, Paul. North America merchant services revenue growth of 15% was fueled by U.S. transaction growth of 13% and also the positive effect of the debit legislation changes. North America revenue growth was negatively affected by Canadian performance and unfavorable Canadian foreign currency exchange rates. And as a result, North America cash operating income or EBIT dollars were down 1% for the third quarter over prior year. For fiscal 2012, our expectation for the U.S. remains unchanged at mid-teens revenue growth. We now expect Canada revenue to be about flat to as much as 1% up over last year in local currency.","Our international segment delivered strong results. International cash operating margin increased to 37.2% compared to 35% in the prior year. We continue to expect full year revenue growth for fiscal 2012 in U.S. dollars to be about 30%.","For the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $56 million. This includes about $17 million in first-time cash distributions to our bank partners in Spain and Asia. Excluding these distributions, free cash flow would have been $73 million for the quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. ","During the quarter, we spent $36 million on capital expenditures, a substantial portion of that on data center and network infrastructure initiatives. Our third quarter tax rate, based on the face of the income statement, was about as expected at about 28% on both a cash and GAAP basis. We continue to expect our full year tax rates to be about 29%.","During the quarter, on a year-over-year basis, currency changes had a slightly unfavorable effect on each of GAAP and cash revenue and earnings by about $5 million and $0.02 per share. We continue to believe the aggregate effect of currency will likely be about neutral to slightly positive to our earnings per share for fiscal 2012 compared to 2011 due to the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar to date and our outlook for the rest of the year. Fluctuations in exchange rates, in particular, rapid further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, could cause variances to our outlook.","In closing, we continue to expect seasonal improvement across our global markets along with some incremental new business in our U.S. card, gaming and Greater Giving channels to drive sequential benefits in our fourth quarter. And now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, David. And based on our current outlook and assumptions, we continue to expect our annual fiscal 2012 revenue to be in a range of $2.15 billion to $2.2 billion, reflecting 16% to 18% growth, and our cash earnings per share to be in a range of $3.50 to $3.58, reflecting 14% to 16% growth over fiscal 2011. We now expect a GAAP diluted earnings per share range of $3.10 to $3.18, representing 19% to 22% growth over the prior year and reflecting planned cost savings initiatives in the fourth quarter.  Excluding the impact of the debit legislation and our recent acquisitions, we plan to expand cash operating margins in our core business by as much as 50 basis points for the total company for fiscal 2012.","Operator, we'll now go to questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Koning with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First of all, just in North America, you mentioned EBIT was down just a bit year-over-year. I'm wondering if you can give us kind of the size of Durbin, so we can kind of get a thought of what maybe core EBIT was down and then kind of how you see that playing out. We've had a few -- like 3 or 4 good quarters of growth, and now it's kind of turned the other way. Maybe you can just give us a little commentary on that.","David E. Mangum","Yes, David. This is David. Relative to the debit legislation, when we were together last quarter, we talked about it adding on the order of $40 million of revenue and certain earnings, and we incorporated that in the guidance. So I think what we can do for now is give you a little more color on that. We're not going to parse Durbin any further in terms of actual performance, and I'll come back to that again in a moment for a couple of interesting reasons. But I will tell you Durbin is roughly on track, probably a little ahead on the revenue side. But what's become very interesting is -- we mentioned to you a couple times on the way to the actual implementation of Durbin, and then even in that first quarter, that we thought it would be transitory, and we're indeed seeing evidence of that in the market as we speak. Evidencing that, we've seen behaviors even from some of our partners that suggest that Durbin had its own influence in some ways that maybe even we didn't anticipate. For example, fees we've seen ISOs charge annually for certain months of the year that occurred in this quarter were not repeated. And our suspicion, of course, is that's in light of any debit legislation benefits, and it really shows the market is still, being -- our partners still being quite circumspect and making sure that all the proper economics are being returned to the proper places as part of this. So it's very difficult to even think about parsing the legislation at this point. So I think we'll stick with -- we incorporated it in the guidance last quarter. It's a little ahead in and of itself on the revenue line. But when you start looking at the overall market, I'm not certain we can even say that with absolute definity.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the EBIT side, I mean, do you expect declines to continue? And then quickly on just the breach, does that affect your ability to make acquisitions or buy back stock?","Paul R. Garcia","Right. So in order, I think that we expect EBIT growth in North America in Q4. We expect to see -- our Q4 expectations obviously imply fairly typical seasonality, frankly, around the world in the markets where we're used to seeing that. That would include U.S. and Canada. So all in, we expect nice growth in Q4 in North America, obviously nice growth abroad in order to achieve the levels we're talking about when you look at doing the math of the guidance for the fourth quarter. Relative to capital planning, our priorities remain the same. While we work our way through the investigation -- and just to go back to the earlier questions, we've got to work our way through the investigation, work our way back through any of the remediation required on the ROC since that's been a question several times. That will take whatever time it takes. We can't define that right now, but we'll keep you posted as we go through the process. So as we work our way through that, I think you may see us be a little more circumspect about the deployment of capital and think about our resources. That does not mean we're not open for business, not continuing the same path and same priorities, but perhaps a little more circumspect about substantial outlays at any given time, and we'll be back to you on that as things evolve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess just on Durbin, just parsing through your answer to David's question, does that imply that the margins were a little bit worse than you expected? I know it was running well ahead of what we had modeled. But I'm curious if it's just in the 20 basis-point impact range, understanding that it's tough to parse through the details.","Paul R. Garcia","Yes. I think if you try to isolate it, Tien-Tsin, you'd say, hey, if revenue is over-performing and it's coming from the ISO channel, by definition, the headwind's a little north of what one might've modeled.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, right. But still in that range, or are we talking about a significant difference in...","Paul R. Garcia","No, we're still in that range, and that's why, quite frankly, we're not going back and re-parsing. What we said to you was the core business would expand its margins on the order of 50 basis points, excluding the 3 acquisitions as well as the legislation. We're still on track for that, and we're still on track for the resulting net opportunity for expansion as well and plus or minus a few basis points. No reason to parse that for you.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. The Canada piece, the spread compression, a little bit worse than what we expected. So what's driving that? Is it just a competitive change going on there, or is it, perhaps, tied to some of the regulation that's happening there? Just curious.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Hey, Tien-Tsin, it's Jeff. I'll take a stab at Canada, and of course, David can add as well. I would say that on the spread compression continues. I think it is a very competitive market. We're actually relatively sanguine with our volume growth in Canada as we believe that we're growing north of Canadian GDP, well north of it, as well as north of the organic rate of growth in the Visa and MasterCard volume and transaction counts in Canada. We have seen, though, the spreads outweigh that, which is the genesis of Paul and David's commentary. I believe that's a function of 2 things, Tien-Tsin. First, competition continues in Canada, so I think it's a very competitive marketplace. Second, at the margin, the Canadian economy did not get as high as the U.S. economy did in '07 and '08. It didn't get as low as the U.S. economy did in '08 and '09, but it hasn't recovered to the same extent that the U.S. economic data has indicated that the United States has. So if you think about, Tien-Tsin, the richness of spread, a lot of that is in the small to midsize business segment around the world, but including in Canada. That part has been impacted both by competition as well as by the factors around the Canadian economy that we're seeing. So we're pleased at volume growth, but the spread compression, it more than offsets what we're seeing in terms of market share movements.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That makes sense. Just one more, if you don't mind, just on the breach, then I'll jump off. Just the 1.5 million cards, obviously, pretty small versus what we saw at TJ Maxx and Heartland. I'm curious if -- is it fair to size the impact and we look at those as case studies to help try and frame the impact? I don't know if it's a linear relationship or not, but it seems like it's got to be pretty small in relation to the other financial impacts that we saw those 2 cases. Is that fair?","Paul R. Garcia","Tien-Tsin, I have to tell you that we really can't tell you that is fair at this point. I think we have to continue to size the investments and all the things you have to do to remediate it. We don't think we'll be coming back to you saying it's more than 1.5 million cards. But I don't think you could take $1 cost on someone else and put it towards this. If anything, it could be much higher than that because of the smaller number, but still the cost associated. But I can say this. This is manageable. We will get through this. I will tell you that, absolutely, positively. Now it might be bigger than we'd like, but we're going to get through this. This is a onetime charge. We're going to better for it. We'll get through this, and the sooner we can tell you, the better. And that's what we're focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.","The question has been withdrawn."," ","Your next question comes from Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just back to Canada, is there anything you can do, or are you changing your strategy any? It just still seems like this was kind of a pretty quick change in the spread compression.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Hey, Greg, it's Jeff. I'll answer that, and David and Paul, of course, can comment as well. The first thing I'd say is we continue to rightsize the business in Canada. So we are taking expense actions to deal with the continued spread compression that we described a few minutes ago. Number two, because the source of good spreads for us in any market, including Canada, is a small to midsized business segment, we have put in place analytical programs to help us minimize attrition generally, but to minimize attrition, in particular, in the higher spread businesses and really look at the lifetime value of customers in that market and around the world. So I would say on the analytical side, those actions have been taken and should start to take effect this coming quarter. We're also looking at selective addition of sales personnel in those markets where we have a sustainable spread and defensible technology advantage, and we'll make selective additional capital investments where appropriate. So I think our strategy hasn't changed in Canada. As I mentioned in Tien-Tsin's question, we're actually pleased with our volume performance relative to the market and our peers, but we just have to deal with the everyday reality of continued competition for spreads, as well as the economic environment in the marketplace in which we operate.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And David, do you have the impact from currency on the revenues handy in Canada?","David E. Mangum","In Canada, specifically?","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes.","David E. Mangum","I\u2019m sorry, I don't know if we go country by country, but certainly, the Canadian dollar hasn't moved that much, so you can certainly work your way back to it. Hang on one second, and I'll see if I can give you some help there. I'll tell you what, I'll just get back to you, Greg, on that, but we're not going to parse it by country, as you know. It was a negative impact but, at the end of the day, not enormous. This really is about the reasons Jeff's describing.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then another question just on the data breach. So the issue with Visa and not being PCI-compliant, you can process transactions, but are you precluded from signing new merchants up? I mean, what does it really mean?","Paul R. Garcia","Greg, this is Paul. So the answer is we're not precluded from signing up new merchants. We're literally signing them right now. I mean, it's -- we already had our day in Asia, and I can promise you, they signed a lot of merchants. So it is -- that is not part of this. I think, Greg, this is -- as I said, this Catch-22 reference, I think, is a fair one. I mean, the associations -- you had a breach, it's difficult to say you're compliant. So I think we have to remedy that. But I wouldn't want to imply this is without teeth. This is not a good thing, not to have your ROC, and we're very focused on getting that reinstated. We take that very seriously. But it doesn't mean we can't process. It doesn't mean we can't sign merchants to be very, very, very clear.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","But at some point, if you're not compliant, what's the ramification? I mean, don't you think...","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. No, I'd say if you ask me to speculate that, a year from now, we have major issues, I think the associations have to protect themselves, but no one, clearly, is anticipating any of those.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. I think that's pretty clear. And then just one last one, it's maybe not the time to talk about this, but just broadly throughout Europe, given some of the dislocation with banks there, have other opportunities popped up as far as potential acquisitions? I mean, anything we may see on that front?","Paul R. Garcia","The answer is yes. So I thought David answered that acquisition question superbly, but I will say that we do have a pipeline. We are focused on it. We know we want to take a deep breath here and get through all of this right now, but we absolutely have some great opportunities, including some internationally and just exactly what you said. So stay tuned. We're hopeful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays. ","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on Asia. I think the revenue guidance there also was a little bit tempered. Could you just talk about what specifically drove that?","David E. Mangum","Yes, Sanjay, it's David. So for the quarter, we posted 8%, which is a little softer than what we might have expected. I think we pointed out in Paul's prepared comments that we did intentionally exit a major merchant relationship in Asia. That was a regional airline for whom we were processing with full indemnity from a bank partner. The indemnity expired, and we were unwilling to proceed without a reserve. So that took the edge off some of the growth, and it will again in Q4 if you marry that to a couple other thoughts. So we're looking at about 10% growth overall. Remember, we've had, on full year basis, the grow-over challenges, particularly last quarter, with the major merchant product launch, the nameless merchant from a year or so ago. So if you marry those together, you kind of get to this sort of 10% level. I guess I'd remind everyone on the call that a couple of points of growth in Asia for this quarter, 8 versus a 10. It's all $700,000 of revenue inside this company. So all in, plus or minus, we're about where we thought we were in Asia. It's probably a little minus. Your point is fair, and your question's absolutely fair. As we head into Q4, we're expecting a bit of an uptick in our DCC volumes and indeed our volumes overall. We may do a couple of targeted re-pricings as well. So we think we have Asia on track. We really weren't surprised but your question\u2019s fair. It's a little light of what we might hoped for, for Q3 and what we expected for Q3.","Paul R. Garcia","Sanjay, let me add some color. This is Paul Garcia. The reality of Asia isn't that we generate a couple million more in revenue per quarter one way or the other. The reality of Asia, I mean, if it goes from 10 to 11 to 12 to 15, I'm going to be very disappointed. Asia is all about getting the real opportunity mined in China, and this announcement about Guangdong and Guangzhou is huge for us. And it's going to take a while to materialize, but it is a very important flag planting. Ditto with India. That's the other big market. We're focused on expanding our presence there. And so that is the real excitement and juice about Asia, and we are continuing to focus on delivering on that. And I\u2019m hopeful in a couple years, that's what we'll be saying. We just have continued expansion in all these geographies.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I completely understand. And then just one follow-up on the breach. I hate to beat the dead horse, but I just want to make sure I understand this not being a Visa-compliant issue. I mean, is there any liability, kind of impact from a liability increase or anything like that, a financial impact related to that? And then also, have you gotten any clarity from how MasterCard expects -- from MasterCard on how they expect to respond?","David E. Mangum","Sanjay, it's David. I think we'll wrap up liability into, hopefully, one conversation in the future when we've completed the investigation and we know how all these pieces come together. We obviously don't know that right now, hence, we can't quantify, can't reasonably estimate. Hence, I guess just to be really painfully clear, this is not in our expectations for the year on a GAAP basis. We'll be back to you on that when the time is right. We're going to have to roll all that up into one conversation at that time.","Paul R. Garcia","I would say clearly not being PCI-compliant has financial liabilities, and that's part of the number that we'll quantify eventually, and the sooner the better. Okay. Sanjay, sorry.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And then MasterCard, any comments? Because I didn\u2019t catch that.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. On the MasterCard, the answer is what's MasterCard's expected -- and there's other card brands here involved, too. I would say that it wouldn't be unexpected to have MasterCard take similar action. We're working hand in glove with them, you can be sure. And their primary interest is to be very thoughtful and very thorough, and they are doing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just got a few on the breach and one on the quarter. Can you confirm that the BINs have been shut off for the 1.5 million cards, meaning the -- what I'll say deactivated?","Paul R. Garcia","Well, no. We can't. I think, Dan, I wouldn't even know how to answer that. I think that the card issuers deal with this in all manners of way, right? They look for any fraudulent activity. And it's very important to understand that, that doesn't necessarily translate -- I mean, having someone's number doesn't translate to that being a fraudulent transaction. It means they had access to it. It doesn't mean it results in fraud activity or cards being issued or any of that, and we don't know that; that's developing. Of course, we're responsible for that, and we will absolutely stand tall and pay that. But how the banks handle that really -- not banks necessarily. How the card-issuing institutions handle that is really up to them. But I will tell you, they have time-proven, really thorough ways of doing it. Consumers, regrettably have cards replaced all the time, and it\u2019s just kind of matter of course, in this industry. I mean, it's a dangerous world out there. But they do a superb job of doing this for the consumer, protecting their consumer completely, and we're going to play our role to make sure all of that works seamlessly.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. And just to be clear, you're on the hook for the replacement cost.","Paul R. Garcia","Absolutely, as we should be. Absolutely. We're absolutely are on the hook for that as we should be, and we stand tall to do that at any point. That's our obligation.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The act of processing a transaction as a non-PCI-compliant acquire typically means Visa and MasterCard are levying fines on you. Is that happening, currently?","David E. Mangum","Dan, we're going to talk about liability all in one conversation when we can reasonably estimate it and size it. We'll be back to you when we have that.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you remind us what the size of your insurance policy around all this stuff is?","David E. Mangum","Dan, we have insurance in place for events like this, but we have to know exactly what the pieces and the parts are and calculate it against the actual policies and work with our providers and our partners. So when we have numbers, we will be back to you.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then in Canada, the transactions were strong, revenues down. We're hearing that the ISO market in that region is heating up pretty significantly and the trend would suggest that. You guys have any thoughts around that?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes, Dan, it's Jeff. I'll take that. So we're pleased to have a number of our ISOs with us as partners in the Canadian market, and we're adding more as we speak. So we think that's a good thing. We've been operating with a number of our partners up there for some time, so I don't think that's new. If you go back to what David and I talked about a few minutes ago about what's going on in that marketplace, that is not driving the trends that we're seeing. Instead, it's just a very competitive market generally, augmented somewhat by a differential economic environment in terms of recovery relative to what you see in the United States. But if you go back to what I've mentioned, our volume growth, our transaction growth is good in that market. And if we can get more quality ISO partners up there, that is absolutely part of our plan.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But you think that with transaction growth, you can have incremental margins in that business, or are we going to have a similar problem to what we see in the U.S.?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Well, I think it's, order of magnitude, different today in terms of the contribution of the ISOs in the Canadian marketplace versus what it is in the United States. We have a very large national business, for example, that we purchased a long time ago in Canada. So it's a little bit apples and oranges. But I would tell you the way we think about it, Dan, as a tactical matter within the company is we welcome our partners to come up to Canada. So I'm not concerned about that issue in the near term, nor do I think that's impacting the spreads that we described some time ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the breach front, I know it's still early, but is there any way you could characterize in terms of where the breach occurred in your systems, where that particular system was from a technology upgrade standpoint? I mean, I know you have the G2 platform. You invested a lot. Was this within G2, or is it outside G2? Was it a legacy system that was breached? Can you give us any color on that front?","Paul R. Garcia","So Chris, so let me clarify a couple things. Number one, remember, this was self-detected so the loss prevention software we had in place to determine these types of intrusions actually worked, but it didn't work perfectly enough to stop them. So partly, it worked; partly, it didn't. And we are focusing on where that happened and remediating it. You can be sure of that. We're not going to share any specific details on exactly other than it's confined in North America. It's a number of servers based, and there's a massive number that were not implicated. And that's all we can say on that. And partly, Chris, honestly, this is an ongoing federal investigation, and we got to let them do their work.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Sorry, I understand that. So I guess on a related question, the North American operating margin is down this quarter. And with the security issues confined in North America, I was wondering if you had any sense of \u2013 are we looking at a little lower margin in North America for the near term as you address security issues as well as what's going in the marketplace? And if you could just give us a little more color as to security issues on North American margins. And also, I didn't catch if you had a U.S. transaction number and how the core business is doing in the U.S. would also be helpful from a transaction count.","David E. Mangum","Sure. So, Chris, this is David. I'll start where we were before the -- we're not in a position to quantify the impact of the incident. When we are, we'll talk to you about it. Obviously, in Q4, with the new sales, the new merchants we're boarding for our gaming, the uptick we see seasonally in Greater Giving, we're expecting EBIT and margins to tick up nicely in North America in Q4. If you want to project forward without quantifying, because we're not in a position to do it, it's fair to say incremental investments, say, in 2013 or something along those lines. Once we're through our investigation, through any remediation, it all revolves around anything we can quantify for you relative to the incident. Many of our IT investments do indeed hit the North American merchant services income line. So it's fair to think about it in that way. But until we can quantify either of these, the impact of the intrusion, much less the ongoing investment levels, I can't give you a great quantified answer. But from a color perspective, I think you're thinking about the geography of the income statement in the right way.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. And then on transactions, I saw -- I think we had 13% transaction growth in the U.S. last quarter. Can you talk about how you caught that number for this quarter?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes, it was 13% again, Chris.","Operator","At this time, we have reached the allotted time for questions and answers. I will now turn the call back to Paul Garcia for closing remarks.","Paul R. Garcia","Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, and we appreciate your interest in Global Payments.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Investor Relations, Jane Elliott. Please go ahead.","Jane M. Forbes","Thank you, Tien Tsin. Good afternoon, and welcome to Global Payments' Fiscal 2013 Second Quarter Conference Call. Our call today is scheduled for 1 hour. And joining me on the call are Paul Garcia, Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sloan, President; and David Mangum, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during the conference call contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary, which are discussed in our public releases, including our most recent 10-K. We caution you not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of the date of this call.","In addition, some of the comments made on this call may refer to certain measures such as cash earnings, which are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these results more clearly reflect comparative operating performance.","For a full reconciliation of cash earnings to GAAP results in accordance with Regulation G, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K dated today, January 8, 2013, which may be located under the Investor Relations area on our website at www.globalpaymentsinc.com.","Now I'd like to introduce Paul Garcia. Paul?","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I am pleased with our solid performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Revenue grew 11% in the second quarter to $589 million, and cash earnings per share grew 8% to $0.93. We have increased our full year EPS expectations, which David will detail later in the call.","I'm also pleased to note that the acquisition of U.S.-based Accelerated Payment Technologies, or APT, and the purchase of HSBC's remaining 44% ownership interest in our Asia-Pacific joint venture are both complete. APT will allow us to leverage industry-leading technology by adding new merchants through existing value-added reseller partners and through establishing new VAR relationships. I am delighted to tell you that APT has hit the ground running and is performing well. The Asia-Pacific transaction will, of course, now allow us to more fully leverage our presence in this strategic region. To that end, we are encouraged by our prospects and the receptivity of those with whom we have already met.","Next, I'm happy to provide an update on our PCI recertification process. We are delighted to announce that we have essentially completed our remediation work as anticipated, and the required documentation is in the process of being provided to the Qualified Security Assessor for verification. This verification allows the networks to evaluate the results and return us to the list of PCI-compliant service providers. This was truly a collaborative effort. And first and foremost, we owe a debt of gratitude to our customers and partners for their unwavering support. I also wish to thank the card networks for their expertise and professionalism throughout this process. Their job, and they do it well, is to protect the cardholder and ensure the integrity of the payment system. Through it all, we continue to sign new customers, securely process record transaction volumes and grow our business around the world. I'm truly thankful for my colleagues' daily efforts that made all of this possible.","Speaking of around the world, we have received approval from Visa and MasterCard for license to process in Brazil, and we anticipate certification of our platforms by the end of the fiscal year.","We also signed a new agreement with Intuit, the makers of QuickBooks, to be the payment services provider for Intuit Pay, a new integrated mobile payment solution that targets U.K. SME business segment. This is in keeping with our strategy to power mobile-related payments globally for companies that wish to offer value-added payment services for their customers.","We continue to benefit from our partnership with la Caixa as the bank leverages its financial strength by expanding through acquisitions. In addition to increasing the joint venture's footprint, some of these financial institutions have merchant acquiring businesses. To that end, our joint venture, Comercia, closed on a merchant acquiring business from Bank Civica [ph] valued at approximately USD 23 million in December.","We also announced that our board has doubled our share repurchase authorization to a total of $300 million. This increase underscores our confidence in the long-term prospects of Global Payments.","I will now turn the call over to David. David?","David E. Mangum","Thank you, Paul. We were pleased with our results in the quarter. Good overall business performance and a low tax rate drove strong cash earnings per share growth.","International revenue grew 11%. In local currency, Europe performed well, especially given macroeconomic conditions, driven by strong revenue growth in the U.K. and Russia. Spain also performed well, growing local currency revenue at a high single-digit rate. Asia-Pacific revenue increased 1% over last year as volume continued to track below our original expectations across the region. Based on the current trends and the macroeconomic environment, we now expect low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth from Asia for the full year.","International cash operating income of $62.2 million was up 15% over prior year. Operating margin of 37% increased 150 basis points versus prior year. North America Merchant Services delivered revenue growth of 11% in the quarter, driven by U.S. transaction growth of 13%. We believe we saw a fairly modest financial impact overall due to Hurricane Sandy, which we believe speaks to the diversity of our U.S. merchant customer base. Canada's revenue declined 7% in local currency on a year-over-year basis, which was consistent with our expectation. We expect Canada's local currency revenue to decline modestly for the full year. For the quarter, North America cash operating income, or EBIT dollars, were $73.3 million, approximately flat with prior year with cash operating margin of 17.4%.","Second quarter GAAP and cash tax rates were about 28% and 26%, respectively, a little lower than we expected. Year-to-date GAAP and cash tax rates are each now 29%. We expect both GAAP and cash effective tax rates to approach 29% for the full year of fiscal 2013 and thus expects to report higher tax rates in Q3 and Q4 as compared to the second quarter.","We generated free cash flow of $32 million, which included cash outflows related to the processing system intrusion. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $25 million, primarily related to intrusion remediation activities and data center initiatives. We continue to anticipate our full year fiscal capital expenditures will total about $110 million.","Regarding our data intrusion remediation efforts, during the second quarter, we reduced our estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges by $31.5 million, resulting in a credit of $14.5 million in total processing system intrusion costs for the quarter. We based our initial estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges on the operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks. We have now reached resolution with certain networks, resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates. However, we continue to anticipate that full year 2013 expenses for the data intrusion will total $25 million to $35 million as insurance proceeds will now possibly occur in fiscal 2014 rather than 2013.","In the second quarter, we closed the new senior unsecured term loan of $700 million and increased our existing revolving line of credit by $150 million for a total increase in capacity of $850 million. We used the term loan proceeds to pay down $280 million of our existing revolver debt and to complete the APT acquisition of $413 million. We funded the $242 million for the Asia-Pacific transaction with the combination of cash and the draw on our revolver and now have remaining capacity approaching $600 million.","Regarding our stock repurchase program, our total authorization is now $300 million. During the quarter, we purchased a total of 190,000 shares at an average price of just under $43 per share for a total of about $8 million. Just under $290 million remain authorized for further buybacks. We continue to anticipate fiscal 2013 revenue of $2.36 billion to $2.4 billion, representing 7% to 9% growth on a reported basis and 8% to 10% growth on a constant currency basis.","Given the solid performance in the second quarter, we now expect cash earnings per share in the range of $3.61 to $3.68, resulting in 2% to 4% growth over fiscal 2012 or 5% to 7% growth on a constant currency basis. This outlook does not assume any impact from future share repurchases.","And now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, David. I continue to believe that our company is in a great position to benefit from the ever-changing payments environment. Our global market position and our execution on strategic initiatives will provide us with a platform for sustained growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Jane. Jane?","Jane M. Forbes","[Operator Instructions] And operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about -- maybe, Paul, just get the question out of the way, the ISO channel, any change in relationships there worth noting? I know there's been some noise out there in the marketplace.","Paul R. Garcia","No, there's been nothing of any note or any materiality. Our ISOs have been growing very nicely and have been incredibly supportive during the last period. So we're very pleased with the ISO channel. So I appreciate you giving me a chance to address that one because there has been a lot of noise out there.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so no change there. Good to know. Just as my follow-up question then I'll jump off. Just -- Europe is doing well. I guess Asia, you did take it down. Is it really all cyclical? How are you performing there versus the broader market? And I mean, is this a good opportunity to maybe add more sales and to try and drive some better performance here relative to the cycle? Just curious what the short-term thinking is on Asia.","Paul R. Garcia","Well, Tien-Tsin, the performance from Asia, when we took that business over, we grew it very nicely, and then we added product. But you get to a point where you're limited by the number of referral channels you have. And HSBC is a fabulous partner. But we found ourselves adding reasonable number of merchants, and on a net basis, we're growing the business. But we annualized some new product introductions and some additional revenue generators. And we are in need of new sources. So there's a couple of ways to do that. You can add organically to your sales force. And we are slowly doing that in PRC in particular. But having new referral channels and partners is the biggest opportunity. Now we have not been able to do anything with that because of the past exclusive relationship. That now terminates. And although, of course, HSBC will always be in a very important position and never be disadvantaged, we are having conversations. And as I mentioned in the script, many of those have actually been very, very well received. And I have to tell you that I'm very encouraged by our conversations to date. And I made a comment, I think, in the last earnings call, so I said in the year, if we don't see something of some significance, now that's 9 months, so I want you to know that we are very focused on making some things happen. So the opportunity in Asia is about taking advantage of our first mover, adding new referral partners, slowly adding organic sales, introducing some new products. And we're going to hit a lot of that, quite frankly, next week, too, at our Investor Day at the NYSE. We'll talk a little bit about all of these, too.","David E. Mangum","And Tien-Tsin, this is David. Maybe a little more tactically. Our new sales are on track across the region. And we do believe we are taking market share. We believe what you're seeing in terms of the results really is consistent with macro and not unlike what you hear from other similarly situated companies in the region wherein between average ticket and transactions, we're just not seeing the kind of growth we thought we'd see entering the year. We do believe that it actually does create an opportunity to take more market share with these new referral partners Paul's describing. We have a couple more we expect more to bring online late in the year. As you can tell from what we expect from the region, we obviously are expecting higher growth, particularly in Q4, versus what you've seen year to date at this point. So we think the business itself is executing on track. So in a tough situation from a macro and then the real opportunity, as Paul said, is the long-term opportunity of new partnerships, new referrals, new markets and new products, and we're working hard on all of those things.","Paul R. Garcia","So let me add to that, too, Tien-Tsin, what David said. So we had -- it's not about getting 8% or 9% or 10% or 11% to 12% growth out of that market. It's about a much more aggressive target, and that's what we're focused on. And we quite frankly believe that market can deliver that.","Operator","Our next question for today comes from a Roman Leal with Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, with respect to Canada, can you comment on how Canada is tracking relative to your expectations? I know you have a lot of different initiatives there. And I mean, are we close to seeing an inflection point there?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. Roman, it's Jeff. We did see in Canada, as David described, an improvement in the rate of decline in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And if you listened to David's prepared remarks, we are looking for that to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. We also saw, Roman, very good transactional growth in Canada versus what we believe our competitive market to be and certainly versus Canadian GDP. And we've also seen, Roman, very good new sales growth in terms of revenue in Canada. So what I would say about Canada is it remains a balanced transaction growth, new sales with a diminution in spread and a weakness across economies that we've seen over a period of time. But I think you can see in the results from the quarter some improvement and the guidance from David relative to where we're trending. There remains a balancing act. It remains difficult to pick a precise end date as to when that will be easier. But I do think that we are managing that mix consistent with what our expectations are. David, go ahead [ph].","David E. Mangum","Yes. I think we've become better at predicting it. You obviously can sense it's performed, perhaps, a shade less than what we might have thought. Originally, when we started the year, you can tell that from the language of the prepared comments, but we're becoming better at predicting, particularly the spread declines. So there's the kinds of things we might be able to either control or be able to analytically predict, which gives a little bit more confidence as we head later in the year.","Paul R. Garcia","I will add. I think Jeff just alluded to this, Roman. We are adding merchants. We are growing the business transactionally. We're actually adding more transactions. So we have a nice growth in that. And it's all about the spread issue. We are controlling attrition. Merchant attrition is down. So from those measures, it's pretty good. And this will work its way through. I think we're hesitant to give an exact time, but it is working its way through from all the metrics we've seen. And regardless, we understand that this is something we have to grow around. I mean, Canada has a lot of a very positive things, throws off a ton of cash, and we use that cash elsewhere. But every market is what every market is, and we got to take all of that, put it together and grow the company regardless of what Canada throws our way.","Operator","Our next lesson comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","I wondered if you could give us -- it seems like you're making nice progress on the data intrusion -- when we could expect the record of compliance to be back based on where we are in the process?","David E. Mangum","Yes. Kevin, this is David. We -- in terms of the ROC remediation, the PCI remediation, we are right on the goal line. We believe we are legally on the 1-inch line to use a football metaphor since it's playoff time in the NFL. We are literally in the process of handing over our work to our QSA while we clean up some final items. Once that QSA certifies, it's on to the networks for their own evaluation. So we're thinking, and of course, we don't control this. We don't control this process. But we're thinking, we believe we're looking at a matter of weeks to return to the list of PCI-compliant companies. And so we think we've done exactly what we hoped to do. We are living on that 1-inch line, really making great progress. And it is probably an appropriate moment for me to echo something we said in the prepared comments. The networks have been fantastic through this process, professional, sophisticated, rigorous but also appropriately supportive. They do a great a job. So working with them in partnership, we feel like we are, as I said a couple of times earlier, right in the goal line.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","Super. And then it sounds like from a reserve perspective, you took down the reserve. I know -- just so I'm clear on that. I know that didn't impact the reported EPS. It was just that's kind of part of the onetime reserve, and that's why it was brought down. Or could you just clarify that for me?","David E. Mangum","Yes, I'd be happy to. Great question. So if you go back to July to our year end, we recorded estimates for the various fraud-related expenses, fines, fees, charges, all of those things that might come given our liability for the data intrusion. Those were estimates based on our own reading of how the bylaws worked for each of the various networks involved in this and based on any preliminary communications we might have been able to have with some of those networks. As we then progressed a few months later, we've gotten to the final charges from some of the networks, not all of them, at all. And the good news for us and for our shareholders, those final charges particularly for the fraud-related stuff have come in lower than our estimates in July, and hence, you see what's essentially a $31 million reversal of that original July accrual coming through the GAAP results for the quarter. Interestingly enough, that actually turns you in a net credit position for data intrusion for the quarter, which is a little odd to see on the face of the income statement.","Operator","Next question comes from Bryan Keane with the Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about Europe. It looked like it pops pretty good in the quarter. I was a little bit surprised by the strength. Is there a constant currency revenue growth number we can think about there, David, and maybe why it popped? And then how do we think about in the next 2 quarters that European segment for growth rate?","Paul R. Garcia","All right. So Bryan, it's a great question. We really are seeing very nice growth, particularly in the U.K. and Russia, very nice local currency growth as I saw, as I stated, in Spain. But that flips to a negative when you translate the Euro because you're looking at the full year. So yes, constant currency growth for Europe for the quarter, year-over-year, would be about 15%. That would be the revenue number, just roughly that range, Bryan, when you aggregate all the pieces and then you bring it down a little bit for FX. So this wasn't our largest FX impact quarter as you can tell from the earnings release itself. It's really that's almost right on the FX-related impact you see. So really good growth in that quarter, and again, particularly from those markets, with really solid performance from Central Europe as well, something we don't often talk about. But worth mentioning that we had solid performance there. When you go out to the out quarters for Q3 and Q4, we're thinking we'll see another solid quarter of local currency growth in Q3, but maybe a little less so in Q4 as we have a lot of big items happening for us across Europe in Q4. But I think you're going to see very consistent performance in Q3 and Q4 from Europe, and it's going to look a lot like the full year stuff we talked about, the sort of local currency mid-single digit to high single digit in the U.K. and Spain, much higher than that in Russia, about flat from GPD [ph] and just kind of nice washing of all those results in combination.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the segment operating margins, I guess I'm thinking about it sequentially as we go into the third quarter. We know that the third quarter is a little bit weak. But maybe you could talk about the North American segment margin, international segment margin, what we can expect sequentially? Because if my math is correct, we might actually get to EBIT growth in North America year-over-year in the third quarter?","Paul R. Garcia","Thank you, Bryan. Yes, I think that -- a couple of things to look at. I think you -- depending on how your math and how you want to model, you may will see EBIT growth in North America in Q3, which would be a nice thing to chat about at that point. If you're looking at the margin sequential performance, maybe flattish in Q3 to Q2 for North America, plus or minus. It can be down a little bit. It can be up a little bit and really similar in Q4 when you get out to the out quarters as well. So roughly flattish margins over the course of Q2 through Q4 in North America. When you get to our international results, I think you'll actually see us tick down in margins in international in Q3 and Q4. And it really shouldn't shock you when you think about the moving pieces of our international margins, which include Asia, challenged a little bit for growth, as we said, while still absorbing some investment costs as well as some new technology costs for some of the new platforms to which we moved. So thinking about the pieces there, you can see international margins challenged a bit there, as well as in the U.K. A lot of our revenue growth is coming from our international acquiring products, which comes at a lower margin. As that continues throughout Q3 and Q4, that will pull margins down a bit. And in addition, in Spain, we've got some nice new products rolling out. But still, Spain overall may have some margin challenges when you translate all of this to U.S. dollars given what the euro is doing year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Regarding your comments that you have received your license to process in Brazil and that you could see yourself getting started there by fiscal year end, I was wondering if you could talk about who your partner is going to be for affiliation because that might help the size the opportunity that you have down there.","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Craig, it's Jeff. We're going to talk a lot more about that next week at our Investor Conference. What I would say is it's a local Brazilian commercial bank in market, which is important to note. It comes with not just sponsorship but also with referral and existing book of business, which is also important to note. What I would say though is our task in Brazil is this is really a startup in market, which is very different from what we typically do. So I think what you'll hear from us next week is it's terrific that we have sponsorship and referral from a bank in Brazil. It's great that we've got the licensing, as was described in the prepared remarks. But it's also going to be important for fiscal '14 and beyond that we expand that base to include additional referral banks beyond the one that we'll discuss next week. And I also think, Craig, it's important for us to continue to look at acquisitions and other joint ventures in market because, as you know, given the size of our company, given the history of how we've developed these businesses, we are really going to try to look for step-like functions in a market as attractive as Brazil. And the best way for us to get there is to find additional partnerships, augmenting what we're already going to discuss next week about where we are. So we are happy with where we are, and we view this as a nice initial piece of foray into an attractive market.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And a follow-on question regarding your China business. Is it -- is my understanding correct that in China, you need province-by-province regulatory approval to move forward, that it isn't just a question of sales reach but it is a question of actual approval from local governments?","Paul R. Garcia","So Craig, that is true for CUP acceptance. So we are the only non-Chinese CUP acquirer, meaning that our salespeople, in a number of regions, we have 5 and counting, big regions, I mean, talking about hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens living in these domains. Our salespeople can directly assign merchants for CUP acceptance in renminbi, in local currency. Now we are working on a more countrywide approach that's working its way through the various regulatory channels. But in the interim, we continue to hammer it away region by region. Now for Bancard, we are not restricted. We can sign Visa and MasterCard and American Express and Diners Club and JCB and others countrywide throughout the PRC. And there's no restrictions that relate to that at all. And we are indeed doing that, and those would be mostly the brands that you probably recognize and a lot of big Chinese cities that have a lot of tourist activity in particular. Because China citizens don't really use Visa MasterCard, they use CUP card. So there's 2 markets you're chasing, people that come into China and use their plastic from their country and then the Chinese citizen, and that's the big opportunity, quite frankly.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","With -- knowing that the merchant discount rate is capped legally in China, how are the spreads compared to other regions you guys participate in?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes. It's -- they are pretty robust at the end of the day. The Visa, MasterCard spreads, I think, are in keeping to high end, and the CUP spreads for a debit spread are actually very high. They actually mandate pricing that is actually very favorable.","David E. Mangum","And Craig, there's a very important distinction. So you have cross-border traditional spreads for the Bancards, [indiscernible], the AmEx, et cetera, and then strong -- remember, those CUP cards are almost all debit cards but strong relative debit spreads for those. It's a very important distinction.","Operator","You're next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the U.S. business. Are you hearing anything incremental from either your direct sales force in the U.S. or any of your ISO partners in the U.S. about any kind of additional competitive pressure from any of the newer entrants in the market?","Paul R. Garcia","So Jason, are you talking about things like Square and things like that in particular or...","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. Yes. I would say, Jason, that our ISOs are primarily competing with Square in that space. And based on the numbers we've seen, one in particular, that is now advertising, in fact, advertised, I think, at the BCS bowl last night. I saw an ad for them. They are after that space and had been for quite some time, for years, I believe, and really having some success. I think they are kind of head-to-head with them. The rest of them, not so much. Us, almost never. But I mean, don't take that away as we don't have robust competition. The competition is it remains robust in all of the spaces we're in. But in terms of new entrants, I would say Square is chasing that. And a couple of our customers are as well. We're going to have a little more about our strategy in Investor Day next week on that. We hope to see you there to take you through that. So that's the answer.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the share buyback side, obviously, good to see the additional authorization. And I think there was some language in the press release that you intend to execute on the authorization, which is encouraging. Can you help us a little bit just from the timing perspective? I mean, do you think we'll see a meaningful amount of the authorization actually exercised this fiscal year?","David E. Mangum","Jason, this is David. We really can't comment on the timing of a buyback. I can tell you we have a track record of executing our buybacks, and that's probably as far as we can go.","Operator","Our next question is from a Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","In Canada, the upcoming price change from Visa and MasterCard, what's your latest thoughts on? Is that an opportunity? Or is it more of a risk?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. Greg, it's Jeff. I think that's an opportunity. As I think we've discussed on other phone calls, whenever there are changes in any direction from a network point of view in any market, really, those are generally good news for us. In particular, in the Canadian market, it has been a number of years since there had been any changes to that network environment. So we view the announcements from Visa and most recently from MasterCard as good news for us in that market. And we welcome those changes in the coming months.","Paul R. Garcia","Let me just add that the market that is a very competitive market, and merchants are very well served. And that's -- I mean, this was, I'm sure, a long, hard decision from the associations to do this. They feel confident that there are reasons to justify it. What we are able to do is round, do a couple of a basis points here or there. It's nothing of any mammoth proportion, but it does give us that opportunity as you picked up, Greg. So that's all good news.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just maybe, David, on APT acquisition, can you give us some metrics, maybe what volume was in the quarter or how we should think about run rate or revenue if you could, possibly?","David E. Mangum","Greg, it's a great question. It's a tough one to answer because we had more than 90% of APT's volume, and hence, revenue on our platform already. So you'll recall the incremental revenue was really modest, and quite frankly, not material to the company for the rest of the year from October on. It's obviously not material for the 2 months ended November. So I really struggled to give you a whole lot of insight into those volumes. They've all already been here. The key for us with APT is what do we do with that business in '14, '15 and '16, adding new VAR and really diving deeper and penetrating more of the existing VAR channel of those spaces. So I guess I'd come back, too, and say this. The incremental revenue for the year is really quite small. It's really immaterial. They're off to a very good start, a little ahead of their numbers, but a little ahead is low 6 figures kind of numbers we're talking about now for those first 2 months given we already had the revenue on the platform. And then we're still on track, we believe, for the same. We said about neutral at the earnings line. We obviously don't expect to miss our numbers on those new acquisitions. So we feel like we're off to a very good start and maybe more to come when we've got 5 months of actuals come the end of February quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Quick question on incremental margins and potential leverage opportunities going forward. I know that there's some investment in data center, modernization. Maybe there are some new products rolling out. I know there's some -- going to be some APT help as we roll forward. I guess, David and maybe Mike, this question is for you. Can you just sort of enumerate some -- the opportunities that you all see in terms of increasing incremental margins going forward?","David E. Mangum","Yes, happy to, Brett. And maybe if you'll indulge me, we can set aside the currency effects for a second and speak a little bit to some of the international businesses and kind of on more of a constant currency basis. You pointed out technology. I think that's absolutely fair. We are investing substantial amount in new network infrastructure and new data centers this year. We don't expect to have that investment recur. In other words, to the extent we added a few million dollars of expense to that this year, we're not going to add a few million more of expense on top of that next year. So we expect to begin to see immediate scale benefits in '14 and beyond for the investments we've made in '13. And really, as you well know, the real benefit from that kind of investment is going to come in '15, '16, '17, '18 and beyond because we believe what we've been building is the infrastructure for transaction processing for the next 10 years for this business. We do have a fairly robust pipeline of new product that we quite frankly have struggled to get out over the last 9 months because we've been so focused on breach investigation and breach remediation. So we hope to see that roll out probably over the course of '14 -- fiscal '14, calendar '13, and that hopefully will bring with it the opportunity for new incremental revenue and high margins again in '14, '15, '16 and beyond. As you keep rolling through the pieces of the company, you are correct in the U.S. to identify APT as the linchpin to any potential expansion there. And we obviously believe that's quite a possibility, and again, that's a '14, '15, '16 conversation with some nice little bumps just happening with the increment. As you'll recall, the increment is coming in fiscal '13. Remember, recall, the APT is bringing in more than 50 basis points of the positive margin impact to our North America margins just for this a partial year, and there's more of that to come. So then let's go abroad for a moment. We still believe there are more scale benefits to be had in Spain, still more scale and more growth opportunities in United Kingdom. Certainly, Russia represents a great opportunity for continued rapid growth in the double digits. The business is scaling nicely enough to a core adoption acceptance story wherein it's a very straightforward sort of scale benefit. You add more and more volume, and the bottom line continues to improve in Russia. And then the other final piece of that puzzle is probably Asia where at the end of this year, we'll also absorb the increased IT expenses in Taiwan. And then the question becomes really what Paul and I answered together earlier to an earlier question on Asia, I think it was from Tien-Tsin, which is the combination of continued execution, improved sales performance where applicable and in a very targeted fashion married to more newer referral channels and potentially new markets and new partners should drive long-term benefits there. So those are the sort of positives as you go around the globe.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then one last. This is just a balance sheet question. The $242 million liability goes away presumably when you report next quarter on the HSBC -- related HSBC, bringing in the rest of that business, right?","Paul R. Garcia","Yes, that's right. And you saw that was sort of created almost in fantasyland because it really was a movement the quarter before from redeemable noncontrolling interest, which had been showing what that put was in terms of the fair market value and then paid in capital to sort of create really just geography change on the balance sheet up to that new commitment. That commitment then washes away with the purchase. You're exactly right.","Operator","Next question is from Georgios Mihalos with Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just kind of what you guys can dig in to maybe the growth of the direct non-ISO channel in the U.S., what you're seeing there? And over the long term, is there an opportunity to accelerate growth for APT?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. George, it's Jeff. Let me start, and then Paul and David surely can add to it. So we were -- in United States, we're talking more about next week. But in United States, we have a lot of very attractive vertical markets on a direct basis that we've been investing in. So 2 I would highlight for the quarter to get your question are our gaming business, and we are very pleased with our growth on a direct basis in gaming in the quarter on a revenue basis, and then our Comerica call joint venture here in the United States. Both showed very good growth in the quarter and are key to our performance. And those are areas where we have direct control over the sales force, around our P&L. And those are very attractive businesses from a growth and a margin point of view. And that's before we get into APT. So that's a core part of what you've seen in the quarter. And I'm sure David can provide more color on that. Then on APT, one of the things that we really like about APT is it came with a very nice quota-based salary and commission-based sales force, which is also now part, since October 1, of Global Payments. And as David mentioned in his answers to one of the questions from Brett, we have seen good performance in APT since October 1. That, of course, includes revenue as well as contributions. So I would say looking ahead, to answer your question, if we look at some of the vertical markets we're in x ISO, you look at gaming, you look at Comerica and you look now at APT, we've been pretty pleased with the direct sales positioning of those businesses. And then overall, from a quarter point of view, on all the direct in the United States, we've been pleased with its performance to date. David, you want to...","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe one follow-up to shift gears going back to APAC. David, I think you spoke about a bit of an acceleration in the back half of the year skewed more to the fourth quarter. Should we be looking for double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter from APAC? And is there any reason why double-digit growth in APAC is not sustainable looking out over the long term?","David E. Mangum","George, great combination question. I would not necessarily look for double-digit growth in Q4. But it's certainly on the table. If you think about what we're saying in terms of the range for Asia, somewhere between high single and low double is possible in Q4. But I wouldn't suggest you count on double in Q4. We expect a couple of things to come together in that time frame. One is this new referral channels that we have signed become more productive and then generating actual volume come Q4. We've got a couple of promotions that are going on and a couple of reprices to go on that helped Q4. I think on a long-term sustained basis, there's no question you should be expecting double digit. And Paul said it quite rightly earlier. the real trick to Asia is how do you arithmetically or logarithmically expand Asia and not just grow it 10% to 15% year after year after year, and that's really what we're focused on doing. In terms of jumping off into '14, I'm not ready to talk about that now. Let's see how Q3 and Q4 play out, and we'll talk some more about '14 tactically at the right time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.","Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just looking at EPS seasonality, I think typically, you've seen a little bit of a step down in cash EPS in Q3 and then a little bit of a step up in Q4. And I'm just wondering with the tax rate going up and some of the things you said about North America how we should think about cash EPS seasonality in the back half of the year.","David E. Mangum","Yes. Great question. So we expect a fairly typical Q3, which to your point, would be sequentially down from Q2 and in rough proportion to the percentage of earnings that prior Q3 delivered to the company. So last year's Q3 was on the order of 24% of the full year's earnings. This would be plus or minus, maybe in the same ballpark. And then same for Q4, we've developed over the 3 years a bit of a hockey stick in Q4 relative to earnings performance, and we expect some a version of the same. If you look at last year, again, compared to this year, you might see a version of the same type of distribution wherein generally speaking, Q3, you have the worst seasonal quarter for almost every one of our businesses due to holidays and then sort of the shorter quarter into February and then a really strong seasonal Q4. And that's generally true with U.S., Canada, U.K., even Russia and even across a little bit into Asia and also true for Spain. So I'm glad you asked the question, I would think it'll look an awful lot, generally speaking, like the proportions we saw last year.","Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then just on FX, what types of rates are you assuming in guidance now? Are you assuming recent rates or maybe rates from the beginning of the year? Just a little clarification on that.","David E. Mangum","Yes. Great question as well. Each quarter, when we have this conversation with investors, we update our outlook for FX based on actuals as of, frankly, the day before. And so when we look at this, this particular quarter, look at the rest of the year, and this is the topic of conversation amongst investors and analysts, generally speaking, I'd say our outlook for the full year really remains unchanged in aggregate from where we were a few months ago at the beginning of the year. That doesn't mean the rates on a country-by-country basis don't match what we expected. But generally speaking, what we've seen even in the first 6 months is dead on almost in aggregate what we thought we'd see. So for the 3 months ended this last quarter, as you know, our revenues increased by about $900,000 and earnings by about $0.01, but for the 6 months ended for the year to date, we're down $15 million of revenue and down earnings of about $0.03. So for the rest of year, here's what we're expecting. On a sequential basis, we think the U.S. dollar very slightly strengthens against the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the euro. If you stop and say what does that mean for the full year given what we have to date, that means year-over-year full year, you've got slight strengthening against the pound, very, very slight strengthening against the Canadian dollar, more pronounced strengthening though, obviously, against the euro, the koruna and the ruble. And then given the profitability of those markets, when you're talking about wherever we're seeing strengthening, that's how you aggregate to kind of an $0.08 bad guy for the year. And I know -- I saw a couple of notes out about FX helping and maybe some good guys there. We actually saw the dollar weaken a bit against some of our currencies in December. I'd tell you a little more color. Those same rates swung right back the other way so far in January, as of yesterday. So obviously, it's difficult to predict. And quite frankly, I'm trying not to be in the business too deeply trying to predict this stuff. But I would say again that the rates so far this year have been dead on what we thought they'd be. And hence, the conversion to our financials have been right about what we thought. So there's the outlook in detail. Maybe a little more than you wanted, but I thought I'd get it all out there.","Operator","Next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I wanted to revisit Europe for a second. I appreciate the 15% constant currency number. But can you give here what was the reason for the growth? Is it -- can you parse that out a little bit in terms of pricing opportunities, strategically that you put in market relative to a bit of a market rebound? Is there a significant mix towards Russia that was disproportionate this quarter out of U.K.? Because that number was stronger than I also was looking for.","Paul R. Garcia","And I think you have add one word too, Dan. I mean, just business performance, adding merchants, taking market share. I mean, I think we enjoyed all of that.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you're saying it's pricing, it's market share, we added a bunch of people. I mean, it was just the typical blocking and tackling, and all of a sudden, they just kind of started hitting this quarter or...","Paul R. Garcia","Go ahead, David.","David E. Mangum","So Dan, a couple of things that are happening. We are seeing -- so there are really 3 keys. Paul has provided the foundational answer. There are 3 key markets and 3 primary things happening that drive the kind of growth you saw. First is Russia where we're seeing really rapid growth. Two things: adoption and sort of acceptance of general adoption, 140 million Russians transacting, more and more; also, a little bit more of the year-over-year impact of the Alfa acquisition, which is now fully annualized but we got some help from that in the quarter. So outsized growth in Russia from Alfa married to really just strong growth general organically in Russia. The Spain business that has growth in, again, the high singles, but really, growth you might not expect from Spain given macro when you sort of stare at us from the outside. That's been fueled by the partnership with la Caixa in general, so the sales and the execution Paul described, but also by new products, including DCC we've introduced in the Spanish market. And then the final piece of the puzzle is the U.K. where we're seeing solid performance even though the macro is challenging. Average tickets are challenging in a market like the U.K., as you might expect given macro, given economic. But we're seeing really nice card-not-present growth in our international acquiring platform there. Now with that comes a little less profitability, little lower margin, which you can see in some of the other parts of the income statement when you look at international. But it's really driving great growth for the United Kingdom overall for the quarter.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then if I could revisit the notion of referral partnerships. I have -- I guess the question is when you're talking about first mover advantage, sometimes that worries me a little bit in terms of giving up pricing to gain share early on. It doesn't sound like that, but if you could just kind of maybe talk a bit about how that might play into the equation? And then the last thing I have in relation to that, is there anything unique and different that would surprise us about how some of these have to be accounted for?","David E. Mangum","Dan, so you cut out at the beginning of your question. Was that a question about some of the mobile partnerships or the market?","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sorry, I'll repeat it. The question was in the referral partnerships that you guys are looking forward to, hopefully later in the year, when you talk about first mover advantages of those markets as one of the things that are exciting, sometimes I ask kind of is it indicative of having to give up pricing early on in those relationships to gain that kind of a share early on? And I just want to know if that's something that we can just alleviate and we don't have to worry about? And then secondly, is there anything that you unique and different that would surprise us about how some of these partnerships have to be accounted for?","David E. Mangum","Got you. So great question. You're really speaking to the commentary about Asia and the new partnerships and sort of the tail helping a little bit with the Q4 hockey stick in Asia. The answer to your question is these are very traditional-looking referral arrangements. These aren't ISOs. So we don't have the beginnings of ISO accounting in Asia with the stuff that's on the table in Asia right now. What you do have is expanding referral basis and then expanding source of the kind of leads we need to close and grow more rapidly in the markets in which we already operate. Maybe the opportunity to accelerate those since we can now, after having closed the acquisition of the other half of Asia, actually talk to other partners who might not otherwise have wanted to process through a joint venture with a competing bank. So it's actually very traditional. And really, I don't think you'd find if you saw the details on any sort of risk to how you understand referral partnerships work around the world from a market perspective. Just sort of right down the middle for Asia right now.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So there's no kind of disproportionate fixed costs versus variable costs or anything like that in that market, right?","David E. Mangum","No, it's the usual -- the more we can get these leads, the more we get more merchants. And then the fixed cost leverage is what comes into play as soon as we can process it.","Operator","We will take our final question for today from Steven Kwok with KBW. After which, Mr. Garcia will give his closing statement.","Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question on surcharging. I believe merchants have the ability to surcharge at the end of the month if they choose to. But they also need to notify the networks and the merchant acquirers as well. So I was wondering if you could provide any context around any indications on merchants, whether they're looking to do that or not? And what are your thoughts on there?","Jeffrey S. Sloan","Yes. Steven, it's Jeff. So those rules just came out. Those operating regulations just came out from the networks right before Christmas and the holidays. So you're right, the effective date is the end of January. The merchants do have to give their acquirers, the networks, 30 days advance notice, is what I believe you were referring to, of the desire to surcharge. And there's a fair amount of training, signage and changes to billing statements that have to go into effect to enable that to happen. Sitting here today, I'm not aware of widespread notifications to us or other acquirers that matter of the desire to surcharge. We are making changes to our operating rules pursuant to what the networks have asked us to do as part of the settlement to enable surcharging. I'd also point out, it is restricted in a number of states in the United States by state law. So the networks are subject to that, and the settlement is as well. So I think, Steven, more to come, but there have not been a lot of initial pre-notifications, 30 days in advance of the end of January to enable the surcharging. I do think that some will try it, and we'll have more update on that as time goes on.","Paul R. Garcia","Okay. Thank you, operator. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us this afternoon.

We are delighted to have delivered double-digit organic growth once again this quarter, driven by strength in our technology-enabled businesses. This performance coupled with of outstanding execution across our markets also resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 17% and adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points.","This quarter's adjusted net revenue plus network fees growth also marked and acceleration from a terrific first quarter. And we produce these results as our team simultaneously advance our transformational merger with TSYS.","These outstanding accomplishments serve as further proof points that the successful execution of our strategic objectives continues to deliver a consistent industry-leading financial outcome.","We are focused on providing innovative payment solutions to our customers across our distinctive distribution channels and diversified geographic footprint. And our partnership with TSYS will significantly enhance the scale and scope of our technology enabled software driven ecosystem globally.","I will provide an update on the significant progress we have made with TSYS in a moment, but first, I would like to cover a few of the key milestones we achieved across the three pillars of our strategy this quarter.","Starting with our integrated and vertical markets, businesses, we yet again delivered sustained a strong organic growth. Our partnered software business performed well as our new ISP partners are exceeding our expectations and contributed to the mid to high teens top-line growth we delivered in this channel. And the competitive differentiation of our integrated payments technologies continues to drive new wins.","Notably, we signed a new agreement with Togetherworks, which provides a management platform for a group of 22 innovative SaaS companies with solutions that span multiple vertical markets, including fundraising, recreation, and fraternal organizations. Togetherworks annual payments buying opportunity is currently $4 billion and growing, and we look forward to working with our new partners.","As for our own software assets, we also achieve strong results across the portfolio, as we leverage our distribution and payments capabilities to scale are leading SaaS solutions in their respective vertical markets.","Starting with active network, booking trends for its core products remain consistent, continuing the solid trends we have recently seen in the business. We were pleased to sign our largest ever international camp and class manager relationship this quarter.","AdvancedMD also had another great result, including its best quarter to date for referrals to OpenEdge is our streamline interface and leading product suite is driving strong adoption of our payment solution by physician practices.","Turning to SICOM. We successfully deployed our kiosk solution to over 200 Tim Hortons' locations in Canada over the last few months and will roll out to an additional 500 locations by year-end.","We have also started to deploy our kiosks across Burger King franchises in the United States. Our kiosk solution allows restaurants to reduce labor costs, improve order accuracy, and increase sales through marketing and up sell opportunities.","Moving to our e-commerce and omnichannel businesses, we are making significant progress with our new Unified Commerce Platform or UCP, which provides a single omnichannel payment solution worldwide through one API.","Specifically, we made our UCP API available for testing globally at the end of the first quarter. And we just released our new chargeback Management API this month. We are now live with full omnichannel payments across our new infrastructure in Canada and Asia Pacific.","We remain on track to complete the rollout of the new platform to all of our global markets by the end of the year, uniquely positioning Global Payments to seamlessly combined both virtual and physical worlds to serve complex merchant needs.","Several of our most sophisticated multinational clients are streamlined their payment operations by integrating to our new platform, and it's already driving new marquee wins.","Specifically, in conjunction with our partner Caixa, we're expanding our relationship","with Spanish clothing retailer Desigual across four continents for both in-store and e-commerce payments, Desigual will leverage our new platform to allow their customers to seamlessly shop across channels globally.","Additionally, we are delighted to have recently expanded our relationship with a premier French luxury retailer into more than two dozen markets worldwide. This customer will simply leverage our platform to meet evolving consumer demand and to simplify and centralize their payment operations.","We're also pleased to have recently reached an agreement to expand our omnichannel partnership with one of Canada's largest retailers into a new online marketplace offering.","Lastly, we've established a new e-commerce win in Asia, with Star Cruises. We have a long-standing relationship across Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. And we are excited to expand our partnership beyond the physical point of sale to provide a full omnichannel solution.","Finally, we continue to deliver outstanding results in our faster growth markets. Regarding our newest geographies, we are making excellent progress with HSBC in Mexico, since our launch in January 2019. Our leadership team is in place, as is our new facility in Mexico City. And we are continuing to ramp our sales and support organizations.","We are already seeing growth accelerated double digits organically in this market and remain enthusiastic regarding the long-term opportunities for this business and across Latin America as we bring leading technologies into these new markets.","We also announced the expansion of our joint venture with the Erste Bank into its home country of Austria last quarter. And we are now working to scale our business, to capitalize on the favorable secular trends in this market, by leveraging our distinctive partnership, exactly as we said we would do.","HSBC, Erste and Inbursa which recently agreed to join Caixa and us as a strategic partner in Brazil, are some of the largest most complex and sophisticated financial institutions or FIs globally.","We are proud of the company that we keep, and we could not be more pleased to partner with these leading institutions, highlighting the differentiation and durability and extensibility of our position is a partner of choice to leading multinational FIs.","Turning to our biggest strategic milestone for the quarter, we were delighted to announce our agreement at the end of May, to combined with TSYS, in a landmark transaction for our industry. This partnership creates the preeminent pure play payments technology company at scale, focused on SMBs and leading FIs in the most attractive markets globally.","The merger accelerates our technology enabled software driven payment strategies and positions our merchant business as the leading provider of integrated payments in e-commerce and omni channel solutions globally.","Further, the addition our dishware solutions dovetails with our strategy, providing mission critical software and processing services for card issuing customers worldwide, increasingly in the cloud, and on a SaaS basis.","This business is ranked number one in market share in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and China, and number two across Western Europe. No peer has a business at that scale across those markets, which will bear substantially on our revenue synergies.","The combination will also provide us exposure to additional faster growth geographies and enhances our scale and markets overseas. We're both companies operate today. Combined, we will have a physical presence in nearly 40 countries globally and will do business in over 100.","The highly complementary nature of these leading payments focus businesses provides for significant revenue enhancement opportunities. First, inside the United States, we will meaningfully enhance the value proposition for TSYS customer base of more than 800,000 merchant locations across over 50 vertical markets with our software solutions, analytics capabilities and unified commerce platform.","We will reciprocate by cross-selling TSYS products like Vital POS for retail into Global Payments\u2019 merchant base. TSYS will also add more than 500 sales professionals and will more than double our domestic financial institution base of referral partners. In some, we will have the preeminent U.S. merchant business focus predominantly on SMEs.","Second, outside the United States, the expanded breadth of our combined 1,300 FI Partnerships also provides large untapped opportunities for new issuer and merchant referral relationships.","TSYS more than doubles our existing FI base globally. And we have already had FI's expressed interest in our ability to cross-sell issuing into acquiring partnerships, as well as the reverse. And just the two months since we announced the merger.","It is worth noting that Global Payments is fully operational today in 31 markets outside the United States, something our legacy peers with recent corporate exits last now and for the foreseeable future.","In that context, it will be quite some time before purchasers of those businesses will be able to effectively cross-sell, issuing and acquiring services. As we also mentioned, at the time of our transaction announcement. We expect, our merger to open further avenues for inorganic growth internationally, given our unique positioning.","Third, we believe the combination of our issuing and acquiring businesses globally will enable us to emulate the benefits of debit network ownership technologically, without the need to actually own a debit network in any geography generating superior return opportunities.","We will therefore be uniquely positioned to develop new products at scale on a worldwide basis, including multinational domestic and cross border onus routing, enhance loyalty and analytic schemes, more effective merchant, initially joint sales strategies and Strong Customer Authentication or SCA approvals internally.","On that last point, we expect our e-commerce businesses to benefit from higher authorization rates via our own proprietary SCA that will be uniquely available to Global Payments.","Fourth, and finally, we expect TSYS' consumer solutions business to provide us with new B2B, B2C and P2P capabilities and opportunities in new geographies. As just one used case, we believe we can bring net spend into new markets based on Global Payments existing acquiring partnerships outside the United States. And of course, here in the U.S., we expect NetSpend pay for products to help substantially expand the target addressable markets for Heartland's Payroll Solutions.","As to the merger itself, we have made great progress and are now tracking ahead of our previously announced plans and expect to close the transaction as early as the beginning of the fourth quarter.","We also successfully closed in our new credit agreement on July 9th, an important milestone in establishing the new capital structure for our combined company. Our integration planning is underway and based on preliminary work, we have even more confidence in the expected synergies and increasing targets that we outlined in May.","We could not be more excited about the future as you bring together two premier payments companies with strong businesses, management teams and cultures that will generate significant opportunities and long-term value for our employees, customers, partners and shareholders.","Now, let's turn the call over to Cameron.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone.","We are very pleased to report another quarter of exceptional financial results driven by our differentiated growth strategy and ongoing relentless focus on execution.","Total company adjusted net revenue plus network fees for the second quarter was $1.114 billion, reflecting growth of 13% versus the prior year period.","On a constant currency basis, adjusted net revenue plus network fees grew over 15%. Once again driven by low-double-digit normalized organic growth. Adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 32.4% and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.51. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share again grew over 20% this quarter.","We're proud of these results remain encouraged by the momentum we have seen in the business throughout the first half of 2019. We're also pleased with the milestones we've achieved in parallel on our merger with TSYS, which I will cover in a moment after highlighting the performance our team delivered globally.","Starting with North America. Adjusted net revenue plus network fees was $840 million, reflecting growth of 17% over 2018. This included an approximately 50 basis point headwind from weakness in the Canadian dollar.","Adjusted operating margin in North America expanded 160 basis points to 34%, driven by growth in our technology enabled businesses and continued strong execution across the segment.","Our U.S. direct distribution business once again delivered low double-digit normalized organic growth in the quarter led by strength in our integrated and vertical markets businesses which grew in the low double-digits organically. We continue to see high single-digit organic growth in our U.S. relationship-led channel while our wholesale channel declined mid-teens consistent with our expectations.","Our recent acquisitions, AdvancedMD and SICOM contributed approximately $60 million in the quarter, our Canadian business grew mid-single digits in local currency, which was largely offset by headwinds from the Canadian dollar.","Moving to Europe reported adjusted net revenue plus network fees grew 9% in local currency, or 3% on a reported basis. As foreign currency exchange rates remain a significant headwind in the quarter.","Local currency growth was again driven by strength in our businesses in Spain and central Europe, each of which grew well into the teens. We did see a slowdown in organic growth in UK this quarter at the macro environment further deteriorated with the April Brexit deadline passing without resolution. The declining consumer spending in the UK accelerated in Q2 versus Q1, and we expect this weakness to persist.","Our E-com and omni solutions business was another bright spot in Europe again growing mid-teens this quarter as our unique value proposition, including the new elements of our UCP continues to resonate with customers and drive new wins, such as those highlighted by Jeff earlier.","Adjusted operating margin in Europe expanded 120 basis points to 48.6%, driven by consistent execution and the benefits of increased scale in our central European business.","Turning to Asia Pacific. Reported adjusted net revenue plus network fees grew 7%, or approximately 11% on a constant currency basis. While we saw strong trends across most of the region consistent with Q1, local currency growth was negatively impacted by the recent protest in Hong Kong, which is our largest market in Asia. We estimate these protests negatively impacted growth by approximately 200 basis points this quarter.","These headwinds and those from the foreign currency exchange rates as well as our ongoing initiatives to reinvest in the business. Adjusted operating margin in Asia expanded 160 basis points to 33.1% due to continued outstanding execution of our team in the region.","As of the end of the quarter, our leverage was below 3.2 times. During the quarter, we invested approximately $78 million in capital expenditures and returned approximately $72 million to shareholders through share repurchase programs. Prior depositing our repurchase program ahead of the announced merger with TSYS.","In connection with our plan combination with TSYS, we successfully closed a new unsecured investment grade credit agreement earlier this month, consisting of a $2 billion term loan and a $3 billion revolving credit facility. This new credit agreement will become effective at the closing of the merger and we will replace Global Payments' existing secured credit facilities and TSYS' unsecured revolving credit facility.","Further, the new facilities will also reduce our interest rate, double our revolving credit capacity and extend our maturities. We are delighted with the execution of the new agreement, which create substantial financial flexibility for the combined organization.","The terms achieve highlight the competence of our bank partners have in the new organization and position us well to continue to pursue our capital allocation strategy going forward.","Moving to our outlook, the momentum in our business allowed us to exceed our expectations in the first half of 2019, positions us well to achieve our financial objectives for the full year. We are however facing incremental pressure from foreign currency and now expect FX to be a more meaningful headwind in the back half of the year. That said, we expect the strong underlying trends we are seeing in the business to offset this impact.","To that end, we continue to expect adjusted net revenue plus network fees to range from $4.4 billion to $4.49 billion, reflecting growth of 12% to 13%, over 2018.","This outlook assumes foreign currency headwinds of approximately 100 basis points in the second half of 2019, which equates to an incremental headwind of roughly 50 basis points for the full year relative to the guidance we provided in May.","In addition, we expect the recent process in Hong Kong to again be a moderate headwind to growth in Asia in Q3, and that the macroeconomic environment in the UK will continue to be weak for the balance of the year.","Notwithstanding these headwinds, we are increasing our outlook for both margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to expand by up to 90 basis points. And we expect adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6 to $6.15, reflecting growth of 16% to 18%, over 2018.","Please note, our outlook does not include the impact of the TSYS merger that we expect to close as early as the beginning of the fourth quarter.","We could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead. Together with TSYS, we will focus on delivering distinctive and differentiated payment solutions to customers in the most attractive markets globally.","We will leverage our competitive advantages and global leadership position to drive industry leading top line growth, margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth. The future is indeed very bright.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks, Cameron.","We are delighted with our team's accomplishments in the quarter and the first half of 2019. And our outlook reflects the strength and resiliency of our business model. We were at the forefront of the evolution of our industry, having made significant investments in cutting edge technologies and defensible and distinct distribution.","Our transformation over the last six years has driven best in class results not only relative to our legacy peers, but also compared to the card networks, e-commerce providers and other high-tech software and SaaS companies.","This outstanding performance is starting to be recognized. And we take great pride in noting that Global Payments was recently highlighted as one of the 10 best performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the last five years. And we were the only financial technology company to be so acknowledged. But we were very proud of our past, we are similarly delighted with our future potential.","Our merger with TSYS will accelerate that ongoing evolution. And we are eager to finalize our partnership in the near-term.","Together, we will continue to invest in purely payments innovation and deepen our competitive mode across each element of our strategy. We have the very best employees, providing the very best technologies and experiences to our customers in the very best markets globally. We are fortunate to be in the position we are in today. This is truly an exciting time to be a part of the new Global Payments. Winnie?","Winnie Smith","Before we begin our question-and-answer session, I'd like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your question, please.","Andrew Jeffrey","Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. Jeff, I'm kind of intrigued by the comments you made about Togetherworks and your partnership there. I wonder if you could expand a little bit on that. And then generally, Global Pay fact strategy and positioning in the U.S.?","Jeffrey Sloan","Sure Andrew, thank you. I'll start, I'm sure Cameron will add as well. So, I would step back and say Togetherworks is yet another example of a recent win in our integrated and vertical markets businesses, and particularly in our OpenEdge business.","So, as we said in our prepared remarks, another mid to high-teens quarter, OpenEdge is probably gone three quarters in a row, whatever is with sustained and accelerate growth. And Togetherworks is just the latest example of that.","Now more specifically on Togetherworks, I think the nice thing about that business is really we and they think very similarly about where the world is going. That is a cloud-based SaaS company. That is involved in aggregation of smaller payments businesses, I listed some of them and then prepared remarks in the interest that providing more value and volume-based scale economics to those are related businesses.","Those are areas that touch on things that we think we're already good at. Examples include universities, education stuff, Andrew, that we have a significant, we have a significant role in. And we're delighted yet another smart, sophisticated buyer chose us as their provider of payment services going for.","I noted in our prepared remarks that there is about $4 billion of volume at Togetherworks today growing at a good rate. And we're just getting going, which makes us feel really good about the trajectory going forward. It reminds me a little bit of our calls in February and May, where we talked about Tower Technologies and some of the other folks.","On your second question, regarding payment facilitation. Prior to TSYS, and I'll come back to post-TSYS in a second. But certainly prior to TSYS, I think we already have one of the largest payment facilitation businesses in the world.","As you know, Andrew, for many, many years, going back to the HSBC UK days, PayPal has been a customer of ours, in most of the markets, Europe and Asia Pacific, in particular, around the world for many years. In fact, I think in October, November, Cameron, we announced that we renew that relationship for another period of years with PayPal.","So, outside the United States, I think we have a terrific payment facilitation business. I also noted in my prepared remarks that we just signed up a marquee partner in Canada, for more marketplace activities through our unified commerce product offering, which is coming in the immediate term.","So, I think, in most markets, we've got a great payment facilitation business, but we're very excited about in conjunction with TSYS is the ability to extend that more directly into the United States market or TSYS through pro pay as a very good facilitation business. And the ability to get access to some of their disbursement related technologies, think of things like Uber and Lyft and that kind of thing. TSYS for example has Mary Kay, in the United States market.","So, we really view payment facilitation. Andrew is something we've been in for a long time and are very good at. But we think TSYS takes it to the next logical layer and level, which is to say, a complete rounding out of our products suite, particularly here domestically in the United States.","And I think as we announced at the time of the merger, we believe will have one the largest e-commerce and omnichannel businesses in the world at about $900 million estimated of revenue, and of course, payment facilitation is a big part of that.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.","David Togut","Thank you and good morning. You highlighted a number of new cross selling opportunities with TSYS and increased conviction in both the revenue synergy and cost synergy target. Is there anything in particular that's driving that increased conviction? Two months post deal announcement?","Jeffrey Sloan","Dave, it's Jeff. Why don't I start, I know Cameron is going to join in as well? Yes, what I would say is, as we mentioned, both in our press release and our prepared marks that we've started our preliminary integration work. And as you know, in most deals, you make assumptions about where you think benefits are going to be. And as we've gotten further into our integration work, we certainly feel more strongly of our better ability to cross more effectively. So, let me just give you a number of examples for that.","Let me start here domestically in the United States with the merchant business. I think Heartland and we talked about as David in our last call has done a fantastic job in the restaurant vertical market. That's particularly true with Xenial and SICOM.","But as we talked about David in May, Heartland Register here in the United States and Heartland Restaurant are very significant initiatives, in combination with Xenial, we think we have the broadest base of restaurants, solutions, hardware and software, front end, middle end and back of the house that anyone has on any of our markets worldwide.","That is not an area while restaurants are something certainly something that TSYS does on the merchant side. We think we've got fantastic depth of markets and bring those solutions into TSYS.","Conversely, we think TSYS has the same thing in the case of Vital POS, which is focused on retail. Again, a market that we're in, but not in the way that we're in with Heartland Register and Heartland Restaurant.","So, having spent some time with the TSYS folks and the TSYS merchant folks in particular, post the announcements. We're very excited about the ability to bring Heartland Vital point of sale into the Heartland, into the Global Payments based here in the United States.","And secondarily, stepping back there is not a lot of dialogue, which I'm sure you'll appreciate about strong customer authentication or SCA, particularly in Europe as the September date approaches.","So, Global Payments today is well-positioned for that day. There have been some conversations as you know, about having that date roll in over a period of 12 months.","Having said that though, TSYS going into the partnership announced at the end of May, which is the ability to combine TSYS's issuing business, which has tremendous positioning in the United Kingdom, in Ireland in Western Europe, for purposes of the EU.","Our ability to combine that issuing business with our inquiring businesses is of TSYS we had going into the announcement for purposes of higher authorization rates now that strong customer authentication is upon us and I think the initial reactions from that TSYS over the last couple of months since the deal announcement within the four walls of TSYS and Global Payments have them positive.","So, I think what I would say is, you have an idea when you head into these things but less two months of integration work within the two companies provide us with more conviction on how real those synergies really in intermediate term.","Cameron Bready","And David, its Cameron, I'll maybe just build on that to talk a little bit on the expense side as well. We continue to believe that there is over $300 million of expense synergy opportunity by combining the two businesses.","And to Jeff's point, the more opportunity we had to spend with our colleagues at TSYS to export those opportunities in greater detail, the more conviction we have as it relates to our ability to achieve that target at a minimum, but I would say more importantly, the more conviction we have regarding the ability to continue to scale margins as a combined business thereafter.","As I said when we announced the transaction back at the end of May, we\u2019re very focused on taking whatever action we\u2019re going to take in a relatively quick timeframe so that we can achieve the expense synergy target we have, position the business on a combined basis to be successful in the marketplace, but really continue to focus on growing and expanding because we believe we'll have the best rate of top line growth in the industry going forward as a combined company.","That said, we see a long runway for us to continue to scale margins effectively by driving more efficiency in the business over the course of time, even after we achieved that first layer of synergies that were targeting for the business at that over $300 million level.","So, I\u2019m particularly excited about the ability to drive margin expansion in the business at very attractive rates for a long period of time really through the benefits of increased scale and increase economies of scope in terms of how we operate globally.","David Togut","Thank you. Just as a quick follow-up, Jeff you announced a number of new and ongoing initiatives in Europe and you are really the only merchant acquirer that has set high growth in bank JVs in Europe, how are you thinking about expansion of bank JVs into new countries in Europe. You mentioned in Austria would say versus inorganic growth opportunities in Europe?","Jeffrey Sloan","David, I think there is a little bit of ball there, let's start with the bank JV. I certainly think that while we always being pursuing bank JVs in all of our geographies, I still I think that the partnership with TSYS positions us better than anybody else going forward.","I think to have a poor strategic product issuing combined with acquiring in those markets is actually critical to where I think that businesses are evolving over a period of time. That also ties into the inorganic point as we mentioned before, there are many transactions we look at around the world but especially for these purposes in Europe that had issuing elements and acquiring element and historically Global Payments will look at those and say, I'm good at acquiring but I don\u2019t really have an issuing scale presence to marry up with the issuing assets in those targets.","TSYS of course we do the same thing they would look at those business in Europe and they would say, we're delighted with the issuing opportunities, but we're not in acquiring on outside of United States.","So, certainly as I think about organic but also inorganic opportunities in Europe, the combination of issuing acquiring I think may put us in a unrivaled position relative to anybody else to be a strategic partner to those assets and I'd say both companies have a long history of durable, extensible, bank partnerships worldwide as they mention prepared remarks on the combination of TSYS and Global Payments results in a sophisticated financial institution based of 1300 FI's around the world and I would tell you that durably and extensibility of those partnerships is unmatched relative to all of our direct peers.","David Togut","Thanks so much and congrats on the strong results.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Wanted to just ask about the UK slowdown, we've heard Visa make similar comments, could you just maybe quantify the impact that you guys maybe percentage of exposure. And then Jeff you did touch on SCA, just your latest thoughts there, do you think that will also weight on European results as that goes through regulation over the next 12 months.","Cameron Bready","Hey Bryan, its Cameron, I'll kick it off and then maybe turn it over to Jeff on the SCA side. So, as it relates to the UK market, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we did see consumer spending slowdown in the second quarter, relative to Q1.","If you look at Visa data which I think reflects I think fairly accurate what we're seeing in the marketplace, I think consumer spending declined in the first half of the year, something like 1.1%, 1.2% something in that range. So, we're obviously seeing the impact of Brexit sort of manifest themselves and consumer confidence in the market. We continue to grow in local currency in the UK. So, we're certainly pleased about that. We continue our trend of growing above the rate of market growth.","In the UK, but obviously, it's not at the same level that we had been growing in the 2018 timeframe, or even in Q1 for that matter. The UK for us today, as you know, on a pro forma basis for TSYS [ph] is probably 4% to 5% of the market of the company, excuse me, as a revenue manager.","So, it's not a particularly big exposure for us going forward. But I think we're continue to be well positioned in Europe overall, as I commented on, in my prepared remarks, Europe overall grew at our targeted rate of growth.","Again, we're well diversified across the continent, the trends that we're seeing in the UK really haven't -- I'd say infected the rest of Europe and our cross-border business in Europe. For e-com omni remains very strong, tailwind for our growth in the overall region. So, I think we're well positioned in the region and we're obviously prepared derived through sort of the choppiness in the UK market that we expect for the foreseeable future.","I'll let Jeff, maybe a comment on the SCA question that you asked.","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, sure. So, the only I would add to what Cameron said on the UK, as you probably have one of the best new sales periods in the first half of 2019 with new sales in the UK for us at the very significant percentage. Well, in excess of our historical numbers, the last number of years, year-over-year. So, as Cameron said, we like our positioning there. And the rest of Europe seems to be separate in terms of its economic growth, you can see that reflect our numbers.","On SCA, I think these said the same thing, Brian, that the regulators I think, smartly. Even though, the rule becomes effective in September of 2019, have provide some guidance that as long as people continue to make progress, that that will be ruled out really over a 12-month period from September of 2019, I suppose through September of 2020. So, I think that would be less of an issue that otherwise might have been.","Speaking for Global Payments, I would say we're really well prepared. So, I think the way to think about it is not so much how Visa is doing or MasterCard or Global Payments. But instead where the small bank issuers and the small merchants and the tertiary gateways and like, I think that's the area of particular focus.","It's not something that we're altering our view on, as it relates to what our e-commerce and omnichannel business is going to grow at for the remainder of the years. As Cameron just finished saying that businesses coming off of a really good, another really good quarter into the mid-teens consistent with the performance that we've seen over the last three or four years.","So certainly, it's something we're focused on. We think we're ready for it. I would say that over the next 12 months, particularly since TSYS will close a bit earlier now. We're in a unique position, I really mean unique, because the presence of TSYS on the issue inside in the United Kingdom, in Western Europe, in Ireland with the business that they have marrying that issuing solution presents with the acquiring solution that Global Payments has in those markets will allow us. As I said my prepared remarks to affect our own unique and private SCA solution.","So, our ability to avoid any issues but importantly, our ability to avoid started to provide value added services to our customers by keeping SCA authorizations within the four walls of Global Payments and TSYS. It's a unique valid value proposition that we're going to have over the next 12 months is that will also become effective.","So, to be honest, Bryan actually think it speaks to our strengths and further positions Global Payments and TSYS as the partner of choice to merchants and financial institutions, and really nobody else had that if you think about the nature of their businesses.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful, solid results. Thanks.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Glenn Greene","Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on results. I guess the first question, Jeff, on your prepared comments talking about the revenue synergy opportunities. You talked about the debit opportunity, which is kind of someone, it's different from what I've heard before. But maybe you could just elaborate on what she sorts of mentioned the key opportunities there?","And then the follow up question would be capital allocation thoughts once the deal closes, given your sort of significantly improved capital position, actually, and your strong currency, stock currency. So, I'm kind of just thinking about your priorities in terms of doing larger software deals versus International Bank JVs, and just sort of the thoughts on capital allocation close the deal?","Jeffrey Sloan","Sure Glenn. I'll start in the first one and Cameron will address the second question. So, on the first one, and listen, I think our philosophy on marrying issuing with acquiring and not needing a gateway to do it. It's not all that unique to us, and not all that new to us. I think it's similar to what we said in May.","So, some of the examples I gave, I just finished talking to Bryan and in response to Bryan's question about strong customer authentication, our ability to validate as a flood matter those transactions without having to go outside the four walls of Global Payments and TSYS is unique to us, and that's one of the thing that I meant when I talked about marrying issuing with acquiring.","The difference with us Glenn versus everybody else is we don't need to own a debit gateway to do it, instead, we do it technologically. So, if you look at the construct of new Pfizer, or new Fidelity, the way they get at this, and by the way, they only get at in one market, i.e. the United States. And the reason for that is that's where those debit gateways are physically present.","So, number one, we don't actually need to own a gateway and compete with the car brands who are very good at doing that, in order to affect the solutions that I'm describing. Instead, we do it technologically. Hence, the source of my commentary about providing superior return capabilities for our shareholders and for our customers, because we actually do it through tech, we actually need to own the underlying processing in its own right. So, in that instance, and that's what I was referring to Glenn, that is distinctive, number one.","Number two, we can do this globally, putting aside how we do it, because of the presence that TSYS has in North America, in Asia and in particular for these purposes in Europe as it relates to things like strong customer authentication, we can emulate a lot of the value that's provided by the networks by doing within the four walls of Global Payments and TSYS globally.","If you think about new Pfizer, the new Fidelity, those were only based in the United States for purposes of debit services, and gateway services. So, I think we'll have a double advantage of the one I think it's a better mousetrap as it relates to construction of the solution. And number two is worldwide in scope, particularly in markets like the European Union where SCA is already upon us. And that's really what I was trying to refer to. Cameron, you want to dress that.","Cameron Bready","Yeah, Glenn on capital allocation, so just a couple of comments maybe to kick it off. First of all, you're right in terms of how the combined business will be positioned upon closing, we expect to be roughly 2.5 times levered on a pro forma basis, we expect to have an investment great balance sheet generated in the neighborhood of $3.5 billion of year of EBITDA on a pro forma basis and $2.5 billion of free cash flow again on a pro forma basis.","So, very well-positioned as it relates to the - I think scale and financial flexibility, that's combined business is going to have to continue to pursue its capital allocation priorities.","I would say however, our first and foremost priority upon closing the transaction is going to be to ensure that the combined business is coming together that we're well-positioned as a go-to market strategy, that integration is going smoothly, and that we're executing on and delivering on the commitments that we've made as part of the merger with TSYS. However, obviously, as time passes, we're going to have a lot of capacity to continue to pursue that discipline capital allocation strategy that we have historically.","And I think you should expect that it's going to be focused on many of the same things that we have been focused on historically. Obviously, we're very bullish of our software driven payment strategy. So clearly, adding more vertical software businesses that fit the TSYS, that have the right nexus between obviously SaaS software components and Nexus with payments that allows us to grow both the software side of the business and the payment opportunity and to monetize that effectively, as a combined business will be a core part of the capital allocation strategy.","I think to Jeff\u2019s point earlier, we do continue to see opportunities, particularly with our new issuing capabilities to combine those with acquiring capabilities to pursue additional joint ventures and acquisitions outside of the U.S., particularly in Europe and LatAm for example, where we think those capabilities will be distinctive in terms of our ability to compete for assets in those markets. And obviously, that'll continue to be a part of the capital allocation strategy as well.","And then lastly, I would say, and I want to reemphasize our commitment to maintaining the investment grade balance sheet going forward. Obviously, that is something that as a combined company will pride ourselves on having and we certainly remain committed to maintaining that going forward and maintaining leverage at a level that will support that investment grade balance sheet.","But that being said, we obviously will have ample capacity, I think to pursue a capital allocation strategy that allows us to effectively do the things we've been doing now for the last five to six years in terms of growing and expanding the business globally.","Glenn Greene","Okay, thank you.","Jeffrey Sloan","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your question please.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks. Hi, Jeff, hi, Cameron. Hey, good stuff here. I want to start with asking, you highlighted just the multinational and expanding relationships with HSBC, Caixa, Erste, stressing on the complexity and scale of these, then clearly linking this to the opportunity as it relates to TSYS.","The question is, knowing how large even a single additional one of these sorts of relationships can become, would seem to eclipse the revenue synergy target you have. So, what's your interest level in mining this opportunity immediately is that really fast be factored in, I just want to get a sense of prioritization where this particular opportunity fits for you?","Jeffrey Sloan","Yeah, it's a great question Ashwin. I would say just to be honest, the revenue, sorry, the lowest hanging fruits right here in the United States with the merchant business. So, I gave you few examples, in response to I think David's question earlier this morning.","So, if you just look at the area of most direct overlaps here in the United States in merchant, there are products and services that TSYS has and I gave Vital POS as an example, NTR certifications [ph] would be another one, that Global Payments and Heartland are not as well positioned in today.","Conversely, there were things that Heartland has with Heartland Register, there are things that OpenEdge has, in our 70 vertical markets with OpenEdge that TSYS doesn't have today directly or has a complementary fashion.","So, as it relates to revenue enhancement acceleration, there is a lot of low hanging fruit right here, and that's on the complexity that you just referred to as it relates to those multinational FI partners.","There is a lot of overlap and a lot of ability to - from a product, from a technology point of view to drive incremental revenue right here in the immediate term. I think Cameron was alluding to this, when he talked about a lot of the things being front end loaded, rather than more traditionally, kind of middle and back end, as you might see, in other transactions. So, I think that's the area that's right down the middle of place.","Now, if you step back further, to your point, and you say, well, what else can we do? So, one example would be and Global Payments is doing this already, but TSYS is absolutely going to help immediately is we're already out pitching, you see all this stuff in the newspaper coming out with large FI here domestically have said, we don't think we have the ability to sell cross-border multinational e-com and omnichannel corporate customers at the banks that we'd like to have today.","So, here's an example of large MNCs where Global Payments is already pitching this stuff today with our unified commerce platform I talked about at the beginning of my prepared remarks. Well, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind, and that's straight sales pitch.","In my mind that TSYS helps accelerate that strategy immediately. So, TSYS can provide additional avenues into more multinational FI that we don't have. And that's a sales pitch that we're already executing on today.","So, I would say now, we're saying the complexity of some of the folks that you just mentioned, there is no doubt in my mind that there are immediate opportunities to help accelerate revenue enhancement, in addition to some elements of the merchant business.","The last thing I'd point out on the same TSYS side, I think its immediate, so maybe immediate to medium term area is the NetSpend. So, I want to make sure we just got that which is to say that their merchant business at TSYS and their NetSpend business at TSYS is a U.S. only business, say for historical reasons.","Well Cameron and I, we're in a number of markets over the last number of months, there is no reason that many of those businesses, merchant we already do overseas. But let's just take NetSpend for this example. There is no reason that business can exist in markets outside the United States.","So, certainly with our footprint with the combined companies scale and scope, our ability to bring NetSpend on prepaid to markets outside the United States is something we're very optimistic about. And by the way, that's not a two-year undertaking, that's something I expect to see happen in the next 12 months.","So, I think very different than some of the other transactions that have been announced. There really is a fair amount of confidence in our near-term ability to affect many of the strategic things on the revenue enhancement side that we've described.","Cameron Bready","Ashwin, maybe just to build on that a little bit further, as we think about the revenue synergy potential in the business, all the things that Jeff described, but generally think about as organic things that we can do, or start to do day one as a combined company.","To your point, given the new capabilities that will have with TSYS combined with our existing acquiring capabilities, particularly outside of the U.S., the opportunity to leverage that into additional markets, or additional joint venture opportunities that may require some level investment,","I really think of that is incremental, frankly, on top of the revenue synergies that we've targeted generally, because there's investment that's going to go behind the need or the ability to expand into a new market or to establish a new joint venture as we have historically.","So, to your point, to the extent that were able to do that, yeah, on the top line that may eclipse the overall revenue targets that we've established as part of the deal, but I really think about that as being largely incremental to store the organic opportunities that Jeff highlighted in his prepared remarks. And then again, obviously and his response to your question.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it, understood, thank you for that. And then the follow-up is on the earnings themselves, you quantify the incremental FX impact on revenues, but you're also absorbing an impact on margins while still raising margin guidance. Can you comment on what -- so what you would absorbing from a margin standpoint?","Cameron Bready","Yeah, it's a good question, Ashwin. So, I would say for the full year, I expect currency to be anywhere between a 20 to 30 basis point headwind on margin and probably 400-ish basis points on the bottom-line.","So yes, we've quantified it as a top-line basis, largely because again, we've maintained the current revenue guide, which really is a function of the incremental revenue headwinds from foreign currency offsetting the strong momentum kind of we have in the business. So, we still feel good about the overall revenue target.","But obviously, the execution we've been able to achieve over the course of the year gives -- positions us well to achieve an increase in our overall expectations around margin expansion and earnings per share for the full year. So, the way I generally think about it is the earnings guide is 16% to 18%.","Interestingly, that's our roughly our cycle guidance in terms of earnings target growth, but that's absorbing probably 300 to 400 basis points of currency in earnings. So really on a constant currency basis, that's north of 20%, which I think is a really strong number as an earnings matter for the business.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Thank you. Okay.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Koning from Baird. Your question, please.","David Koning","Yeah. Hey guys, thank you. And I guess my first question, North America looked to us like on an organic constant currency basis accelerated maybe 1.5% of the strongest it's been in about two years, I think we had about 9.5% organic constant currency. And I know that's a function of wholesale keeps getting smaller, Canada was good and U.S. direct is good. I'm wondering, you actually hit easier comps in the back half, is that type of growth sustainable and is US Direct, continuing -- I mean it's obviously taking share within your North America segment. But is that strong level pretty sustainable and maybe even accelerating in the back half?","Cameron Bready","Yeah, David, its Cameron, so I think your math is pretty good to be honest with you. I've got North America kind of normalized constant currency growth in the quarter of about 9.5% pretty close to what you what you suggested and X wholesale, that's almost a point higher, so closer to 10.5%, which is really at the high end of our cycle guidance.","Obviously, the U.S. Direct business is north of that, which, again, reflects continued very strong performance across our integrated and vertical market channel as well as our relationship channel continues to perform really well.","So, I think the short answer to your question is yes, the back-half expectation sitting here today is that those trends can persist around those same levels. I think we feel good about the momentum we have in the business and notwithstanding, the incremental currency headwinds, we're absorbing and revenue, the way we're really offsetting that is strength in the North America business and more particular strength in the US Direct channels that continue to help us absorb incremental FX in regions outside of the US.","So, the long and short of it is yes, the expectation for the balance of the year is that this level of performance in the North American business persists. And we continue to feel good about the momentum that we have as we enter into Q3 and Q4 as a revenue matter.","David Koning","Great, thanks. I guess just the one follow-up, it looks like free cash flow in the first half was a little lighter than normal. Does that mean you get a big catch up in the back half and have just a ton of free cash flow kind of that used for buybacks or whatever else in the back half?","Cameron Bready","Yeah, I would look at its extra timing items that we've sort of highlighted on the schedule, because I think that's the best representation of really cash it\u2019s in the business and available for us. And if tracking close to $0.5 billion for the first half, so we're on target for the billion dollars target we have for the full year.","There is a lot of noise in that sort of timing items, some of it is flip between reduction of liabilities, but it's coming out of restricted cash, because we're holding customer cash then rolls out in the next quarter. So, it's the best way to look at it sort of extra timing items the way that we've highlighted on the trended financial statement. That's really the cash that's in the business and available for us to utilize.","David Koning","Great, thanks, guys. Good job.","Cameron Bready","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Steven Kwok from KBW. Your question please.","Steven Kwok","Hey guys, good quarter. And thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick questions, just one around the U.S. wholesale market, improved a little bit, but I believe TSYS has a little bit of the wholesale market as well. What's your thoughts on that, is that going to be a bit of a runoff as you integrate TSYS as well?","And then second question is just around the interest rate environment, given the outlook for lower rates. Now, is there any further potential to lower your debt costs? Thanks.","Jeffrey Sloan","Yes, Steven, it's Jeff, I'll start on the U.S. wholesale. I'm sure Cameron will comment on the rates question. So, what I would say is if you back up and you look at how we think about it, when I came to Global Payments, the U.S. wholesale business was probably 50%, if not more of the US business, number one.","Number two, we also lacked in addition to math, we also lacked the diversity of distribution. So, with the exception of our gaming business, with the exception of APT when we bought it in 2012, we didn't really have a lot of direct sales in the United States away from the wholesale business. So, I think those two things really drove on the strategy that we've been talking about for last four or five years which is the same emphasis that the direct business and less of an emphasis on the wholesale business.","We're lowering that position, so we have plenty of direct distribution on a combined basis with TSYS the wholesale business partner 5% of the commodity company but probably most important this event we have a lot of direct distribution affable payments and certainly at TSYS.","So, I don\u2019t think about it the same way as I thought about it in six or seven years ago, because those two issues we have there predominate Global Payments which is to say lack of diversity of distribution and concentration are not issued the Global Payments have today but especially for these purposes, there are not issues that pieces in Global Payments will have.","So, I certainly think we feel very different about that, I would also add in there that Global Payments historically going back six or seven years have a lot of concentration among very few customers in the ISO business, TSYS doesn\u2019t have that either. So, I think going forward too much better mouse trap overall with a combined companies and I don\u2019t think we approach it the same way rather I think we look at it openly and think about what's the best thing for the combined business.","Cameron Bready","And Steven on your rate question I'll start by saying of course loss on us that we're in a very attractive rate environment in general and I will start with the credit agreement that we executed earlier in July, we were delighted with the outcome of that, we prized our revolving credit facility in term loan A, given our expected credit rating and LIBOR plus 137.5% basis points, which is obviously an improvement over where our pricing is today and interestingly where TSYS is as well.","So, we feel good about gotten that aspect of the permanent capital structure in place at very attractive terms. The remaining aspect of the capital structure that we need to put in place prior to closing is really in expectation around about $2.5 billion senior notes offering that we expect to execute here over the coming months as we lead up to closing of the transaction and actually to your points we recognize at the rate environment in which to get that done is pretty attractive for us today.","We also recognize that, given the mix of the business geographically particularly overseas there can potentially be opportunities for us to take advantage even at lower rate environment in the UK and Europe that would allow us to lower the overall cost of debt for the pro forma business as well.","So, more to come on that as we continue to execute against our plans to establish the permanent capital structure for the combined business between now and close but I would say certainly the rate environment that were seeing and the execution we been able to achieve thus far gives us a lot of confidence that there's some potential upside as relates to the accretion expectations we have for the transaction on the heels better-than-expected financing rates.","Steven Kwok","All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Winnie Smith","Thanks Steven. On behalf of Global Payments, thank you very much for your interest in our company and thank you for joining our call this morning.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."]}}
