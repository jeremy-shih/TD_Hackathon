Phone lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period.","I will now turn the conference call to Mr. Brian Angeli \u2013 excuse me, Vice President, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Angeli, please go ahead.","Brian P. Angeli - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. With me today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who will review our second quarter performance and business segment results, including an update on the integration of Cheminova, and discuss our outlook for the second half of 2015. Also, with me is Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will give an overview of select financial results.","After the prepared remarks, we will be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health & Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director , FMC Lithium, to address your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references and pro forma, revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website.","Our 2015 Outlook Statement, which provides guidance for the full year and third quarter of 2015, can also be found on our website. I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In my comments, I will refer to the Q2 2015 earnings presentation posted on the FMC Investor Relations website. We have not used slides for previous earnings calls, but we have taken this approach today in order to help explain our results more clearly as we transition through 2015. I will refer to each slide by slide number as I go.","The second quarter of 2015 was perhaps the most significant quarter in the long history of FMC Corporation. We completed the sale of the Alkali business with Tronox and closed the acquisition of Cheminova. These transactions marked the completion of the transformation of FMC's portfolio to one focused on the Ag, Health and Nutrition markets. Following the close of the Cheminova transaction, we moved quickly to integrate Cheminova into FMC Ag Solutions. During this quarter, we took multiple actions that will drive strong future performance of FMC and allow us to deliver target synergies of $120 million ahead of 2015 (sic) [2017] (3:51).","In particular, we successfully combined commercial organizations in key regions earlier than we had originally expected, which means we are well positioned to deliver the benefit of the acquisition more quickly than initially forecasted.","These recent changes, however, make it more difficult to compare the reported performance of Ag Solutions and Cheminova to their prior year's performance as standalone businesses, even just a few months after closing. Consequently, we will focus on comparing performance of Ag Solutions including Cheminova to the pro forma results for prior period. The full year 2014 pro forma results were filed with the SEC on June 5. Pro forma results for the second quarter are included in the schedules of the quarterly earnings release issued yesterday.","Before discussing FMC's earnings for the quarter, I will make a few general comments on two of the factors that have had a significant impact on FMC's reported results: the state of the global crop protection market and the impact of foreign exchange movements.","The global crop protection market continues to face multiple headwinds that have created one of the most challenging operating environment of the past decade. Demand for crop protections products remains weak, due to the high channel inventories, poor planting conditions, low pest pressures and soft agricultural commodity prices.","Through the first six months of 2015, on a U.S. dollar basis, we estimate the global crop protection market was down by double digit percent compared to the same period of 2014. Market conditions in Brazil are the most difficult. We estimate that through June the crop protection market in Brazil was down approximately 25% compared to last year, when measured in U.S. dollars.","Declines in demand reflected in lower volume are compounded by the rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real, which makes it harder for local currency price lists to keep pace with exchange rate movements, resulting in lower revenues when converted into U.S. dollars. In addition to the real, all of our major currency exposures have weakened against the U.S. dollar, creating a significant headwind to reported revenue and earnings across each of our businesses. The negative impact of foreign exchange and the challenging crop protection market, particularly in Brazil, overshadowed otherwise strong operating performance across the FMC portfolio. During the call, I will highlight where unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations most impacted FMC's financial results.","Turning to slide one, FMC reported $887 million in second quarter revenue, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit was $159 million for the second quarter, a 5% decrease compared to last year, and we reported $0.70 in adjusted EPS, a decrease of 15% over the second quarter last year. The benefit of ongoing cost reduction programs and synergies related to the integration of Cheminova largely offset the impact of lower sales volume, higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in the quarter. However, price increases in local currencies were not enough to offset negative foreign currency fluctuation, which I will discuss in more detail in each segment.","Turning to slide two and Ag Solutions. In order to provide greater clarity as well as to be consistent with how FMC is currently operating the combined businesses, I will discuss segment performance on a pro forma basis; that is, as though we owned Cheminova for the full quarter of 2014 and 2015.","On this basis, revenue in the quarter was $684 million and segment earnings were $117 million, a decline of 23% and 30% respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2014. Foreign exchange had a significant negative impact on segment revenue and earnings in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange pro forma revenues declined 14%, while segment earnings increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2014.","Multiple factors contributed to this performance. First, let me focus on the regional crop protection markets; and in particular Brazil, the primary driver in the decline in sales volume compared to the second quarter of 2014. As I noted earlier, we believe the crop protection market in Brazil was down almost 25% through the first half of 2015. It is important to understand that this decline was not evenly spread across all product or crop segments.","With respect to product segments, the volume decline was concentrated in insecticides. We estimate that insecticides, which we would typically expect to account for more than 40% of the market, through the first six months of the year were down 50% over this period, reflecting weak insect pressures and high channel inventories.","Offsetting this decline was a 16% increase in the fungicide market, making fungicide the largest crop protection category in the first six months of the year. This mix shift was dramatic and unlikely to persist through the remainder of 2015. However it demonstrates how unusual the crop protection market in Brazil has been so far this year. Historically, insecticides have contributed the largest part of FMC's revenue in Brazil for the first half of the year, while fungicide is a segment where FMC was historically under-represented.","The addition of Cheminova gives FMC a broader and more balanced product portfolio, and enhances our future fungicide offerings. In other countries in Latin America, we observed encouraging demand growth, particularly for selective herbicides in Argentina and niche crops in Colombia and Mexico.","North America delivered another solid quarter. Demand for FMC's Authority brand herbicide was strong compared to the second quarter of 2014, driven by the continued increase in glyphosate-resistant acreage.","In Europe, volumes were stable compared to last year, driven mainly by Cheminova sales in the region. We are very excited by the opportunities we see in Europe, as we move to sell through Cheminova's direct access model in most of Europe for the 2016 season.","In Asia, we saw good results from newly launched product in China, specifically herbicides for wheat, and we saw further growth in Pakistan across the portfolio. Higher sales in these countries were partially offset by lower sales in Australia and Indonesia. Sales were also weaker in India, largely due to weak early monsoon season.","Contributing to the decline in sales volume in the quarter, where specific actions FMC took related to the way the new Ag Solutions segment will operate. First, we initiated a process to sell our Brazilian subsidiary, Consagro. This subsidiary is primarily a distributor of third-party product to smaller customers in Brazil. Given the opportunities the Cheminova portfolio brings, Consagro and its business model no longer fits with FMC.","Second, we reduced our investments in certain FMC fungicide in Brazil, electing instead to shift our commercial focus to the fungicides portfolio acquired with Cheminova, which we believe will be better suited to the crops and areas (14:06) that FMC targets.","Third, we continue to reduce the level of third-party sales across all regions, in particular, reducing sales of lower margin products that are less valued by our customer.","Lastly, and very importantly, given the underlying market conditions in Brazil, we have remained disciplined in our willingness to extend credit into the Brazilian market. We recognize this would reduce our revenue in the period, but the rising cost of hedging our local currency exposures given the ongoing rapid depreciation of the Brazilian real and the preference of growers to delay their purchasing decision led us to the conclusion that this is the right business decision for FMC. All these factors taken together had a significant impact on FMC's revenues and segment earnings in the second quarter, but leave FMC in a position to deliver stronger earnings growth and cash generation through the second half of 2015 and beyond.","Given the environment in which we are operating today, we are intensely focused on the cost structure of Ag Solutions. In late 2014, we initiated a series of program intended to reduce costs across the segment. This program, combined with early cost synergies from Cheminova integration, helped to partially offset lower volume in the quarter. We will continue to implement these cost reduction programs while also driving the cost saving benefits of the Cheminova transaction as quickly as possible. We believe these actions will deliver increasing cost saving over the second half of 2015.","Let me now provide you with an update on the Cheminova integration. On slide three, we have provided additional detail regarding the synergies we discussed during our May 11 Investor Day. To remind you, we are targeting $120 million in synergies by the end of 2017; $90 million in synergies will come from cost reduction, principally headcounts, with $30 million in synergies coming from various commercial opportunities.","Immediately following the close of the Cheminova acquisition, we moved to begin integrating Cheminova and FMC. The integration is progressing well and gaining momentum, and the results achieved over the first 100 days reinforced our confidence in the ability of FMC Ag Solutions to deliver the targeted synergies of $120 million ahead of 2017.","Our first priority was to combine and integrate the commercial organization across key regions. In North America and Brazil, and in other key countries in Latin America, we have already made changes to our sales organization and internal systems that allow us to approach the market as a single company. This was critical to deliver targeted synergies in the coming quarters, and I'm very pleased with the speed in which it was achieved.","We also initiated our plan to sell FMC products through Cheminova, which for the first time will provide us with the direct market access across the majority of Europe for the 2016 season. As we integrate the commercial organization, we're also focused on reducing cost by streamlining the business and removing overlapping or redundant functions and capabilities.","The majority of the near term cost savings are driven by head count reduction, and we expect more than 75% of all head count actions to be taken by the end of this year. Further cost synergies are expected from a number of different non-head programs, including supply chain efficiencies, procurement savings and closing surplus facilities. These specific synergies will begin to impact the result in 2016 and throughout 2017.","On slide four, we have summarized our progress to-date to achieve the synergy targets. We are targeting net head count reductions of 500 to 550 position. Through the end of June, we had achieved approximately 65% of that target. As it relates to the other cost reduction synergies, we have so far identified over 150 procurement project, and by the end of June we had completed a quarter of them. We expect to identify and target additional procurement project in the future.","Turning next to commercial synergies, sales and marketing organization has so far identified approximately 50 targeted growth programs; 60% of these programs have already been launched. Cost savings from our actions are coming in faster than initially planned, and we are pleased to see a number of recently launched commercial initiatives already gaining traction. As a result, we now expect 2015 earnings to benefit from synergies of $30 million to $40 million, up from our prior guidance of $25 million to $30 million. The impact of these actions will be seen in the second half of 2015 and will serve as a catalyst for future earnings growth for FMC Ag Solutions.","As you might expect, we are finding many opportunities to realize additional synergies that we have not yet quantified. In the coming quarters, we will provide further updates on the progress to achieve our synergy targets and, to the extent possible, quantify the additional synergy opportunities.","Moving on to Health and Nutrition on slide 5, the segment's underlying performance in the quarter was good; although, adverse currency movements led to flat revenue and segment earnings up by just 3% compared to last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 6% and segment earnings increased 8% compared to the second quarter of 2014.","Prices remained stable across the portfolio. Sales were driven by continued volume growth in MCC-based product for the pharmaceutical and food end markets. Demand growth was strongest in the pharmaceutical industry, especially from multinational companies in Europe and generic producers in India.","During the quarter, we were encouraged by increased demand for colloidal MCC product in both Asia and North America. In China, demand for colloidal MCC beverage application remains below peak level. However, volumes are now consistent with historical averages prior to the steep pullback in demand for colloidal MCC product in Asia that we saw in the latter part of 2014. Slightly offsetting these positive trends is continued weakness in nutraceutical product, specifically omega-3. While sales volume trends have improved, we have yet to see a meaningful rebound in what would bring omega-3 growth rate back to historical levels. We believe excess production capacity in the omega-3 market will continue to be a headwind for prices, at least for the foreseeable future.","The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continues to improve. We returned to normal level of seaweed supply in our alginate operations during the quarter, and manufacturing excellence programs are delivering higher yields in our Norway facility. As a result, we remain confident that by the end of the year we will be able to recover the earnings impact of the seaweed shortage through the first four months of 2015.","Now turning to Lithium on slide six, reported revenue of $55 million decreased by 3% compared to last year and segment earnings of $5 million were 39% lower than the same quarter in 2014. Foreign currency, specifically the Argentine peso and the euro, continued to have a significant negative impact on Lithium reported results. Excluding impact of foreign currency, revenue increased 2% while segment earnings increased 17% compared to the prior quarter. The Lithium business continues to operate extremely well. During the second quarter, the business achieved record production rates at our carbonate operation in Argentina and at our hydroxide plant in U.S.","We continue to see improved pricing for both products on the back of strong demand growth. The Lithium organization continues to focus on the specialty segments in the market, in particular, hydroxide, high purity metals and butyl (24:55). Given our technology strength and product expertise, as well as the market conditions for these segments, these are the areas with the greatest opportunities for growth for FMC.","Turning to the outlook for Q3 and full year 2015, as we discussed, we remain cautious about the strength of the crop protection market compared to last year. The third quarter represents the start of the growing season in the southern hemisphere and, as a result, market condition in Brazil and Latin America will be the primary drivers of our performance in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","Given the difficult market conditions currently seen in Brazil, there are higher than normal levels of uncertainly as to when growers will make purchasing decision, which could impact the timing of sales between the third quarter and fourth quarter. While this will not change our expectations for the second half of the year, it does make it difficult to estimate the balance between Q3 and Q4. Despite this environment and continued unfavorable foreign currency moves, we expect very strong earnings performance over the next six months driven by ongoing cost saving initiatives, acceleration of cost and revenue synergies from Cheminova and targeted growth programs.","Once again, excellent progress to date on the integration underscores the strategic and operational benefit of the Cheminova acquisition to FMC and increases our confidence in Ag Solutions' ability to deliver strong earnings growth during the second half 2015. We expect full year Ag Solutions segment revenue to be within the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and full year segment earnings in the range of $510 million to $550 million.","Over the next six months, we expect segment earnings of between $315 million to $340 million, an increase of approximately 40% compared to pro forma segment earnings in the second half of 2014. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $105 million to $125 million. Third quarter guidance is a wider range than previous year, reflecting the higher than normal uncertainty in the crop protection market; however, this does not impact our outlook for the future.","In Health and Nutrition, we expect third quarter segment earnings to increase in the mid-single-digit percent over 2014, driven by continued demand for MCC in both pharma and nutrition end markets. For the full year, we are anticipating segment revenue down low single-digit percent, but segment earnings growth in the mid-single-digit percent over 2014 supported by ongoing operational improvements and targeted restructuring program within the segment.","In Lithium, we continue to see strong demand and positive pricing trends for key product. As a result, we reiterate our expectation for third quarter segment earnings of $2 million to $4 million, and full year segment earnings of $15 million to $25 million.","On a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted earnings to be between $3.00 and $3.30 per diluted share, a 3% decrease at the midpoint of the range compared to adjusted earnings per share for 2014.","I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. So today, I'm going to focus on two main items: first, the impact of recent currency movements on FMC; and second, an update on how we're doing on our stated objective of increasing cash generated from operations.","Starting with FX, Ag Solutions was hardest hit by currency movements, and the two currencies that drove most of this impact were the Brazilian real, which depreciated against the dollar by more than 40% compared to Q2 last year, and the euro, which depreciated by almost 20%. We were able to pass a proportion of this impact onto customers through higher prices, but the earnings impact of the shortfall between the price increases and the FX movements was still approximately $35 million. This was largely due to the rate at which the currencies moved, as the local currency price lists could not be amended quickly enough to keep pace with the exchange rate movements.","In Health and Nutrition, the movement in the euro was the largest single impact; although this reduced revenues more than operating earnings, given our relatively large euro or euro-linked cost base. For Lithium, failure of the Argentine peso to depreciate at the same rate as local cost inflation was again the main driver, although the depreciation of the euro also contributed.","Included in these numbers are the hedging costs we incur in our businesses, driven almost entirely by the cost of hedging Ag receivables in Brazil. As the base interest rate in Brazil has climbed in recent quarters, the cost to hedge a dollar of exposure has increased accordingly. Today the cost of hedging has increased by 30% per $1.00 of exposure generating almost $4 million of additional costs in Brazil alone for the second quarter, and an expected full year increase of over $10 million. This hedging cost is included in our segment earnings as an operating expense. Given the extreme volatility we see in the real, and indeed in other currencies, we will continue to hedge our exposures in order to reduce the potential for large swings in our earnings.","However, we will seek to decrease our total hedging cost by reducing wherever possible our real-denominated sales, therefore reducing the need to hedge. We have undertaken a program to identify products or customers which at today's all-in costs don't make economic sense to continue to serve on the same terms. We do not expect this to result in a significant change to the way we conduct business in Brazil, but we will continue to exercise tighter discipline on what products we sell, to whom, and on what terms. In fact, this is one of the factors that contributed to our decision to reduce sales of third-party products to our customers.","This brings me on to the second topic in cash generation. Slide seven highlights some of the underlying contributors to our cash flow. As you can see, for the first half of the year our adjusted cash from operations, which excludes all Cheminova, one-off M&A, and integration costs, was more than double last year at $189 million.","Perhaps most importantly, our segment operating cash flow, which we define as EBITDA less or plus movements in working capital and before unallocated corporate costs, increased by 44% in the first half of the year despite a year-on-year decrease in EBITDA over this period. The driver of this improved cash generation is a decrease in the level of working capital in our businesses as a direct result of multiple programs initiated across FMC.","Ag Solutions has focused on both inventory and receivables balances this year, with programs designed to ensure we are not making or buying products for resale before they're needed and that we are not selling product sooner than we need to, or to customers that carry an unacceptable credit risk.","Health and Nutrition has also focused on its inventory, reducing levels by over 10% in the year as it uses ongoing manufacturing excellence programs to bring greater reliability to manufacturing operations, reducing the need to carry excess inventory to meet customer needs.","Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding our cash flow performance. We're seeing traction in all of our major focus areas, and we will continue to focus on improving our cash flow performance in the coming quarters.","We've also continued to be disciplined in overall capital spending, which in the first-half of 2015 was 30% below the same period last year at $71 million. We expect total capital spending for this year to be in the range of $150 million to $175 million.","Finally, a comment on our quarter ending net debt balance at just over $1.8 billion. I don't want anyone to get too excited by this number as we have a significant tax payment related to the alkali sale, which has not yet been made. This payment will be approximately $300 million over and above our ongoing tax payments and will be paid across the third and fourth quarters. The higher than normal cash balance we are carrying at quarter end is a function of these anticipated payments. Adjusting for this timing difference implies a net debt balance closer to $2.1 billion.","Before I hand the call back to Pierre, just a clarification of the increase in interest expense for Q2 and the rest of the year. We saw a temporary increase of approximately $5 million in the quarter, which was caused by certain local debt facilities of Cheminova in India, Brazil and Argentina, which were incurring average annual interest rates in the mid-teens percent. Although these facilities were relatively small, they had a disproportionate impact on our interest expense in the quarter. The terms of those facilities, which reflect the non-investment grade status of Cheminova, did not allow us to immediately replace them with much lower cost to FMC borrowings. However, we have now replaced most of these facilities and we'll replace the remainder through the rest of 2015, bringing our interest expenses closer to more normal levels by the fourth quarter. With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul. To conclude, we are very pleased with the performance how the remainder of the year is shaping up. Our results from the second quarter were in line with our expectation. But for the unexpected temporary increase in interest expense in the quarter, our results would have been at the top of our guidance range.","As for Ag Solutions business, we are highly focused on controlling what we can control. We are in a down cycle with currency challenges. We are actually more concerned about currency fluctuations than we are with the market, which is still in line with our views as stated at our Investor Day in May. The cycle will turn around, as it always does, and FMC will be ready with a strong portfolio and a proven business model.","In the meantime, we are very confident that our strategy is staring to pay off. Our focus is to deliver earnings growth via the synergies from Cheminova, including revenue synergies and stringent cost control, regardless of where we are in the Ag cycle; and this starting in the second half of 2015.","The integration of Cheminova is progressing faster than expected. Combined with our FMC portfolio and operated under the FMC business model, we will demonstrate in the coming quarters the potential of the new Ag Solutions business. We're also very confident that our earnings growth will accelerate rapidly into 2016.","Our Health and Nutrition portfolio continues to demonstrate its qualities, specifically, its resilient earnings profile. The cost control and manufacturing excellence programs undertaken in 2015, combined with our technical strength and strong portfolio, will also see higher earnings growth as we enter 2016.","The Lithium business strategy, to focus on downstream specialty product, is now in place and the business continues to operate well.","I am very pleased with the progress we're making in our efforts to reduce capital invested in the business through tighter control of capital spending, multiple efforts focused on reducing our working capital and very tight cost control. With the business environment that we are operating in today, it is extremely important that we continue to prioritize cash flow and capital discipline in all areas.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go to the line of John McNulty from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matthew Freedman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. This is Matt Freedman on for John McNulty. I was wondering if you could please provide us some color on Ag Chem inventories in Brazil. What are the biggest overruns either by crop or type?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Hi, this is Mark. The inventory situation in Brazil is pretty significant, as we've talked about since the end of last year. The inventory balances that we see in the channels are pretty much spread across nearly all segments. In Pierre's comments, he talked about the impact on insecticides with channel inventories. We see, also, significant channel inventories in herbicides and fungicides. Obviously, cotton is one area that we're exposed to and we see channel inventories there; we also see in soy and in corn. So in summary, for us, channel inventories are pretty widespread. Obviously, we're entering into the growing season and those channel inventories are weighing on growers' decisions of when to buy, which we've commented already, but it's pretty widespread right now.","Matthew Freedman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. That's helpful. How big was the rationalization of third-party sales on the top-line? You indicated it was $15 million of earnings.","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah, obviously, through third-party sales we make less margin. So it's less than you would normally see in terms of revenue, but in the $50 million \u2013 $30 million to $50 million range overall.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think it's a much higher number.","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","That's the third-party, but that does not include Consagro \u2013 the Consagro entity.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, yeah. Not including Consagro. Correct, Mark.","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah.","Matthew Freedman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got you. And then, lastly, if there was consolidation in the Ag market, would you say FMC is more likely a buyer or a seller of assets?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In term of \u2013 you know, if you look at M&A, we've made our move. We have acquired Cheminova. We are integrating Cheminova. We believe that with that strategic move we now have a very solid geographical balance and very solid portfolio. So we are not a seller and we are not a buyer. We are very pleased with where we are right now and this is the way we intend to operate our business.","Matthew Freedman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","My assumption is that if you were a seller of Ag, you're basically a seller of the company because that's what you guys are. You've done a great job of focusing the company there. Of course, we are \u2013 we've hit a little bit of an air pocket here on the Ag side, given the commentary. But, Pierre, I wanted to just take a moment and \u2013 the guidance for 2015 of $510 million to $550 million, at Investor Day you outlined, I think it was, $635 million to $685 million, which would be a 25% increase for 2016. Is it still feasible that you'd be able to increase your Ag earnings by 25% at the midpoint for next year?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Frank. If you look at \u2013 first to your comment, yes, selling Ag would mean selling FMC, and we are not selling FMC. That's a true comment. Regarding the earnings for 2016, if you look at the speed at which we are increasing our synergies and the way they will impact 2016 with a full year benefit, I think the targets we have ahead of us for 2016, at this stage, are unchanged.","We are not banking on any change in the Ag cycle for next year. We believe and we are still at the same place, our vision for \u2013 our view for the Ag market has not changed since Investor Day, which is it's going to be a rough second half of 2015. And 2016, we'll look at it as a bit similar as 2015: no down, no up, about the same. Within those condition, targeted growth on key technologies plus revenue synergies plus cost synergies should still bring us to the same level we had forecasted for 2016.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, terrific. That's very helpful. And clearly, with the acceleration of the synergies or the benefits on the Cheminova integration, that would be a positive now that you've owned the property for several months here. What about on the other side of the ledger? Have there been any \u2013 what other sort of positive surprises have you found in \u2013 or perhaps negative surprises have you found with the transaction?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think Cheminova is all we expected. It's really the company we wanted to buy. What I would say is that the biggest surprise is the easiness in which we are capable of integrating the two companies. And that's why we are seeing the revenue synergies and cost synergies coming that fast. The culture are matching, and there is no pushback from one company to the other. So when you look at places, Latin America, Brazil, Europe, we are operating truly as a single company, and that's why we are seeing this acceleration of synergies. There is no big issue we've uncovered. Actually there is none. So far it's as good, if not better, than what we were expecting.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. That's helpful (44:13). Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Frank.","Operator","And your next question is from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","When you think about the second half, just curious if you can \u2013 third quarter is going to be difficult for Ag, and then you have a big fourth quarter. I know Brazil tends to be stronger, but just could you frame up maybe what needs to happen to sort of hit that really strong fourth quarter for Ag Solutions?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, because it's really an important second half for us because we've \u2013 the way we've been preparing the second half with the acceleration of synergies in the second quarter, I think it's when things start to come together. I know the numbers look big, but there is a solid logic behind those numbers. So if you think about year-on-year, what we've said is second half of 2015 will be about 40% up versus second half of 2014. Think about it that way. It's about $100 million of EBIT increase. Two big buckets: the $100 million EBIT increase in the second half of 2015 versus 2014 is about $70 million of cost control and cost synergies. And then, there is another bucket, I would call, of about $30 million of commercial benefit net of FX.","So if I look at the commercial benefit, it's in a few categories. First, as you know \u2013 and we've been relying on it for many years now. We have a very strong herbicides portfolio and we are seeing growth and market share gain in the herbicide portfolio. We are seeing, as I said in my script, quick synergies, specifically in Brazil and Latin America, on fungicide. There is some specific pest pressure on cotton we are seeing in Brazil, which \u2013 from which we will benefit. So, all of those three, we believe, will be bringing the growth. Now we believe that would be less a \u2013 the impact of the lower insecticide demand for Latin America, mostly Brazil, and as I said before, less impact of FX. So think about that $17 million cost control, cost synergies, $30 million commercial benefit net of FX impact.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, 2015 obviously a difficult year. What are your initial thoughts on \u2013 obviously, you're going to get a lot of integration and savings in 2016, but how would you help us think about how Ag Solutions could do in 2016; maybe is there a couple of scenarios, depending on what crop protection globally could potentially do as a market?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It's \u2013 as I said in my closing comments, we are very, very highly focused on controlling what we can control. So our assumption today and the plans as we have defined \u2013 actually, if you look at the way we are looking at the market today, we are still exactly at the same place as we were at Investor Day in May.","We see a very tough back end of 2015, and we see no improvement in 2016. Now, looking at what is in the channels, all indication we have is we should start to see products being flushed out of the channel by the beginning of 2017. That's what we're expecting to see the cycle ending. Under that, the focus will be on revenue synergies, cost synergies and cost control. And the numbers, the one Frank mentioned are the one we still believe we could achieve.","Today, where we are, we believe our view of the markets is correct. That's what we're expecting. I can tell you that where we have the highest level of uncertainty, and there isn't much we can do about it, is around currency. I mean, the real is depreciating at incredible speed. We believe the euro has stabilized. Still very hard to know what's going to happen with the \u2013 in Argentina and what will happen with their currency. It could be positive. So, that's where we have the highest uncertainty. So right now, the scenario we have is about the same as the one we were outlining in Investor Day, potentially with harder currency situation which could be balanced by faster synergies coming into 2016.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. So in short, that sort of the range of the growth that you thought in 2016 you can get versus 2015 is still generally in the cards?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct. We have no reason to change.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, guys.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Most of my questions have been answered, but \u2013 excuse me, just a couple of follow-ups, if I can. Can you repeat your CapEx guidance for the year? I'm sorry, I missed it.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure; and it's in the outlook sheet. It's $150 million to $175 million for the full year.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's a significant reduction off of the rates you've been running at. Is that a sustainable level going forward or is this just one year, given that Cheminova is bringing a lot of capacity that you can do something with?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it's very sustainable. That's our target. That is the number we are looking at going forward. Remember, today one of the big CapEx user was Health and Nutrition, and that business is very well capitalized for the years to come. So it will be Ag growth, and I can't wait to have to increased capacity for the Ag business, and Lithium, if we decide to increase capacity in lithium hydroxide; so much more focused capital spending. So $150 million to $170 (sic) [$175] (50:46) million is about the number we have to look forward for the years to come.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just bear in mind as well, Dmitry, that if you think about historical numbers, you're probably remembering numbers that had Alkali in there, too.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, you're right. So, then, you got about $100 million a year relief of CapEx from selling the Alkali business. Okay. The decline in Lithium operating profit sequentially, what \u2013 I mean, looking back, it doesn't seem to be a seasonal pattern to it. So what drove the sequential decline in operating profitability of Lithium?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, it's always \u2013 and I hate to get into those discussions because I hate when a leader of this business explained to me that way, but it's just the way accounting works. When you have \u2013 when you operate in Argentina, there is always operational difficulties and permits, and the way you focus your standard cost is very hard to do because you don't always have the permit or the surprise you have on the cost endpoint. The problem is you always get those negative impact in the time when the products are sold. So you capitalize your variances. So some of the earnings decrease you see are mostly linked to issues operating in Argentina which are due to previous quarters.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's just the way the GAAP accounting works.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you, Pierre. That's all the questions I had. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Dmitry.","Operator","And next, we go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","I guess, two quick ones. First, can you \u2013 as you look at the market environment in Brazil, how severe would things need to get to change your working capital strategy?","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry. How 'what' would things need to get?","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","I guess, what flexibility do you have to change your working capital strategy if conditions \u2013 assuming that the tough conditions do spill over into 2016, what is your thinking about managing working capital days down there?","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a great question. We've done, as you can imagine, an enormous amount of work and spend a lot of time focused on this. We \u2013 the whole industry operates on exactly the same terms. It is extremely difficult for any one of us down there, in my view, to individually change the terms on which we do business without having a significant and serious impact on the commercial operations down there. The most important factor that we're really focused on today is ensuring that we think very carefully about who we extend credit to, which products economically make sense to be sold on those terms.","And that does change rapidly when you have interest rates of 15% and a real depreciating rapidly. And also thinking about credit risk, we think very carefully about credit risk, as you can imagine. And so, I don't think you will see a fundamental change in the terms of business, but I think discipline around who we sell to and when we sell to them is really the biggest tool that we have, and we've been very disciplined around that in the first half of the year. I think we'll continue to be disciplined, and our outlook assumes that discipline continues through the rest of the year.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And then, secondly, can you give an update on your thinking around the biologicals partnership with Chr. Hansen, field trial data, what sort of products testing you're going to be doing next year? Any sort of updates that you have there?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah, Laurence, this is Mark. The alliance is going very well indeed. As we talked about at our Investor Day in May, we have seven really large projects that we're working on. The first of those projects is due to be launched at the end of this year and it's for North America, and it is a bio-stimulant that we will be using with some of our synthetic in-soil insecticides. Trials have gone very well. And that product will be coming to market on target. Following that, we have some seed treatments coming in in the 2016 timeframe, and then high value bio-fungicides, mainly for the fruit and veg and specialty niche crop markets. And then, following that are the more difficult areas, the bio-nematicides and the bio-insecticides, and they'll come through in the 2018 timeframe. But the collaboration goes very well; it's exactly what we thought it would be. We have a pipeline of products and, obviously, that pipeline is growing. So right now, we feel very confident about our BioSolutions platform.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments. Please go ahead.","Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investments","Hi. Good morning, good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Peter.","Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investments","Regarding your very important Ag program, there is a company called Origin Agritech in China who is talking about starting to sell corn seed technology, GMO technology, globally, outside of China, and it claims to have better and cheaper technology than Monsanto. Would something like this be of interest as a way to get into the GMO business, say, in a country like Brazil?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Peter, I think we are an Ag chemical company. That's what we do and that's what we do best. We believe it would be highly distractive for us and, truthfully, very expensive to try to be a competitor in the seed business. There is formidable companies in the seed business, like a Monsanto. We are very good at what we do and they are very good at what they do. So I think we're going to stay where we belong, which is really the Ag chemical segment.","Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investments","How are you feeling about you're research productivity? Have there been any new developments? Are there any vibes coming from the laboratory on new stuff that you haven't talked about?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm going ask Mark to give you more detail, but from where I sit we are confirming everything we talked about in term of platforms at Investor Day.","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah, Peter, this is Mark. Peter, I just talked about the BioSolutions platform that continues to grow, and you know at Investor Day I talked about the nine active ingredients we have in the pipeline. They are all on track. They're due \u2013 the first ones come in in 2015 and it goes all the way through into the early part of the next decade. We're not stopping there. We have a number of leads that we're following up in areas where we think we have gaps that we'll need to fill as we go into the next decade. But right now I can tell you that I really believe that the platform and the pipeline we have in Ag right now is probably the best we've had in a number of decades, and it will bear fruit as we go through into the end of this decade, early next decade.","Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investments","Sounds good, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions today. Thanks again, also, for the slides. I think that helps separate out what was a pretty noisy quarter. But I was struck on slide two by the amount of the FX hit to the Ag segment and I can't recall FX being a major driver of the earnings, one way or the other, in the past. So just wondering if there has been a \u2013 and I realize currencies have moved a lot in the last year, but just wondering if there's been a change in the hedging policy or if there is some impact of hedges in here? And maybe on the flipside, would the impact have been any worse if you hadn't done some hedging activity or \u2013 I guess just trying to disaggregate the number there from what it would have been without any hedging activity?","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, no, if you think about it, Brian, there's two factors to bear in mind. We can only hedge at the prevailing rate, and the prevailing rate itself has moved year-on-year. And so, ultimately, without price movements on our real price list, we're always going to have that headwind simply because the forward rates as well as the spot rates are significantly different. So our hedging policy has not changed; the extent to which we hedge has not changed. The cost of that hedging has increased. So a significant portion in the quarter, I think it's about $4 million, increased year-on-year of hedging costs as a result of the real.","A second factor is bringing in Cheminova. Cheminova has a big European business, and so we have a big euro exposure compared to last year that we historically would not have had. So we wouldn't have suffered in quite the same way, because our European business was so much smaller. They also have a sensible sized Brazilian business, so it's magnified the impact of those two. So, it's really those factors. It is really, though, the extent of the exposure to those two major currencies has increased and those two currencies have depreciated significantly, as you know.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Brian, the \u2013 it's unprecedented. I mean, it had an impact in the past, but, as Paul said, with hedging we're able to be more predictable. But when you have a 40% change over the real during a period of 12 month, and I think 20% for the euro, the speed at which it was impacting our results is never happened in the last five or 10 years. And then, consequently, the hedging cost is also becoming much higher. So it's just the magnitude of the problem which has changed with us being bigger and bigger in Latin America and Brazil.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And just to give you just another data point, when we had our Investor Day in May, the forward rate for the real against the dollar was sort of 3.30-ish, and the most estimates about a 3.30, 3.35 end of year rate. We hit 3.47 yesterday. So it's moving in a way that's incredibly rapid and incredibly unpredictable.","Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, I think that explains it very well. Paul, I was wondering if you could also comment on any change in collection behavior you are seeing from your customers in Brazil as they come under some pressure either from the currency or weak Ag markets. Do you see any change in your ability to collect on receivables down there? Thanks.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's an interesting dynamic down there. One of the beneficiaries of the depreciation of the real is essentially the Brazilian farmer because as the real depreciates, his real profitability is going up significantly. Unfortunately, he is getting paid too wait. He is getting paid to wait with selling his dollar currency commodities, and he is also getting paid to wait because of the pace of the depreciation. So, we are not having any real meaningful change in credit profile of our customer base. It remains an important core competence of ours to get out there and collect what is owed to us. Those conversations are no more easy today largely because of the inherent preference of a Brazilian farmer to not pay until he absolutely has to. So it's difficult. It's difficult to collect, but not because of credit reasons, but largely because it's just a battle to get out there and persuade the growers to pay us what they owe us. And that's true for everybody.","Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our last question will be from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Pierre, I was wondering if you could talk to us about the omega-3. You have this new plant in the UK. The game plan was to go after pharma application as opposed to food application, but it doesn't look as though anything much is happening. Could you give us a feel for what is going on and what you expect in 2016, for example?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think omega-3 \u2013 I have to admit that our acquisition we did faced two significant problem. There was a slowdown in the market, whether it's pharmaceutical or nutraceutical, mostly nutraceutical, because of some comments \u2013 article which are public even if they were based on junk science, but it had a very big impact on the market; and the fact that it is a market when we came in there were three suppliers, and by now we have about 11 suppliers of omega-3; so a very strong over-capacity.","So we are fighting two fronts right now. One front is price, as any market facing over-capacity would face; and a market where demand, even if it's coming back a bit, is still not back to historical level.","Our focus for us, as you said, has never been the food industry, but I would say the big difference, even what you're seeing, it's more in pharma. I mean, our real focus is to penetrate strongly the high-end nutraceutical market. So the two markets where we should be playing are pharmaceutical and high-end nutraceutical. We are making some progress, but needless to say that it is not at the level that we were expecting when we made that acquisition.","So right now we're focusing on multiple front: increasing our product offering in the nutraceutical, still participating in the pharmaceutical, and our team in Health and Nutrition is looking very, very strongly on cost and what are options to be even more competitive than we are today.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Is that an area in which you need to be in order to gain customers, for example, by offering omega-3 as well as your other products, or you can dispose of it?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We could dispose of it without impacting \u2013 it's more like \u2013 if you think about it, we believe that we could penetrate the omega-3 market faster than others by using our relationship with nutraceutical companies and pharmaceutical \u2013 it is the case. I have to say that the larger product offering to a customer base we have is \u2013 our customers are happy we're in omega-3. We aren't as happy because the price is not where we would like it to be and the opportunities are not as strong as what we would like to be. So from a strategic standpoint, could we be out? Yes, we could be out. Is it time for us to get out? No, it is not time. I think we still have opportunities to participate in this market and see a return on our investment, but more challenging than what we were expecting. So we're going to keep on driving that business as well as we can through 2016.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","That's very helpful. Thank you. And I was wondering if you could bring us up to date on the new MCC plant in Asia, and is it ready to offer products to your pharmaceutical customers or not, yet?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So MCC, as you heard in the script, it is becoming very tight. The growth has been strong. Health and Nutrition is looking at a strong back end of the year and on both side, which is the pharmaceutical part and the beverage food application for colloidal MCC. So we are at a place now that we have made \u2013 actually, we made that decision yesterday to go ahead. We're starting the plant. We are expecting the plant to open up in 2016 and we also have confirmed the decision we're very well advanced on the engineering side to do the pharmaceutical lines. So the plant will start up in 2016; if not, we're going to be too tight in capacity. I think we're going to get close next year to 95% capacity utilization. So, we're going to start up the plants in both MCC food and pharmaceutical.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think I'll close the session.

Mr. Wherley, you may begin.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Pierre will review FMC's third quarter performance and provide the outlook for the full year and fourth quarter. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2017 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call.

Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information.

A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's call, are provided on our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Before delving into our third quarter results, I just want to state that we successfully closed our transactions with DuPont on November 1 as expected. This was a great achievement for the hundreds of FMC and DuPont employees who worked diligently in a very compressed timeframe to carve out and stand up the acquired portion of the DuPont Crop Protection business for day one operations and to separate our Health and Nutrition segment for divestiture.","We are excited about this transformation at FMC and the way it positions our Solutions business as a leader in crop protection. FMC now enters its next phase as a focused growth company in both Ag Solutions and Lithium. We continue to expect that we will conduct a separate listing of FMC Lithium in the second half of 2018 to create two independent public companies with each becoming a pure-play investment opportunity for shareholders. As we prepare for that listing, we will continue to expand both our lithium hydroxide and our lithium carbonate capacities to capitalize on the significant demand expected in the coming decades.","But first, I will review the overall third quarter performance where FMC had a very strong quarter in both Ag Solutions and Lithium. Next, I will update our full-year and fourth quarter projection which now include two months of contribution of the DuPont Crop Protection acquisition. Paul will then provide commentary on select financial results. I will then finish with a few highlights of the 2017 performance of the acquired business, followed by updates on our 2018 assumptions.","Turning to slide 3, FMC reported third quarter revenue of $646 million, which was up 3% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $0.70 in the quarter, nearly 60% higher than the same period a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by strong operating results in each of our two segments.","We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Both of our segments posted record third quarter earnings. Ag Solutions faced challenging market conditions, and many of our ag competitors discussed ongoing price and volume pressure in Brazil.","FMC was able to outperform the market due to the work we did in 2015 and 2016 to proactively reduce channel inventories. In Lithium, we executed our phase one lithium hydroxide expansion extremely well in a market where delays have become the norm.","Let me now move on to slide 4 and Ag Solutions performance. Third quarter segment earnings were very strong, growing by 31% year-over-year to $118 million. We also saw strong sales performance with 6% revenue growth excluding India. The growth was driven by the 12% increase in Latin America with Brazil volumes especially robust, and a 9% increase in North America.","Offsetting this growth was a 4% decline in Europe and a 32% decline in Asia which was largely due to sales decline in India. We decided to take actions in India to prepare for the integration of the different market access channels between FMC and the acquired business which reduced overall Ag Solutions revenue by 7%. India is the only market where FMC and DuPont have significantly different channels to market. In total, third quarter global revenue of $552 million was down 1% year-over-year.","The 31% segment earnings growth was driven by volume gains around the world excluding India, improved performance of our Brazilian business and overall lower operating cost. As you can see on the segment earnings bridge, the negative impact of the India sales decline was far smaller than the positive EBIT impact of the volume gains in the rest of the world. We expect overall profitability of the Indian market to increase significantly as a result of the DuPont acquisition. Foreign currency movements in the quarter offset modestly lower prices. Year-to-date, the net revenue impact from price declines is 2%, which is consistent with our expectations for the full year.","Moving next to slide 5 where we outline three main drivers of the ag business so far in 2017. First, we have seen significant volume growth across many markets. In Latin America, FMC volume is 20% higher year-to-date, driven largely by Brazil where we are outperforming the overall market. We have also seen continued improvement of the fundamentals of Brazil's cotton and sugarcane market, two markets where FMC has significant share.","We now expect the overall market in Brazil to be down high single-digit for the full year 2017 due to ongoing channel inventory actions being taken by some of our competitors. However, we believe product usage is largely flat. In Asia, excluding India, FMC volume is up 9% year-to-date. This growth has been driven by successful product launches in China, strong demand for rice insecticides in Indonesia and increased herbicide demand in Australia. We believe the overall Asia market will be flat for the full year 2017, slightly worse than we thought three months ago.","In North America, FMC has posted a 2% volume gain year-to-date, which is largely in line with our market expectations. Our results were driven by stronger demand in the first half for pre-emergent herbicides, as well as third quarter strength in post-emergent herbicide and full year insecticides. We now expect the North American market to be roughly flat for the full year due to higher demand for full year insecticides.","In Europe, FMC volumes are down 6% year-to-date, which is slightly lower than the overall market. Our results were largely due to the impact of FMC's business in France moving from distribution to direct market access. You will recall, France is the final country to make this transition from the Cheminova acquisition. We continue to expect the European market to be down in the low to mid single-digit range for full-year 2017.","Moving to the second key factor in our year-to-date performance, which is the significant improvement in profitability in Brazil. The primary driver has been higher sales volumes, leading to 24% revenue growth. One of the main reasons FMC is outperforming the market in Brazil is a proactive management of channel inventories over the last two to three years. Our actions have reduced channel inventories of FMC product by 35% year-over-year and by 50% since the peak at the end of 2015. We believe that we are operating with closer to normal channel inventory levels of FMC product today. We have also benefited from a significantly lower cost base and improved product mix. Combined, these drivers have led to operating margin Brazil increasing nearly 400 basis points year-to-date.","The third factor in our year-to-date results is the significant top-line headwind from the volume decline in India, which was primarily felt in the third quarter. As we stated earlier, this needed to be done so we could integrate two different channels to market after November 1. These actions mostly impacted the lower value in use portion of our business, hence the low impact on earnings. I will address the outlook for Ag Solutions after covering Lithium's third quarter performance.","Moving now to slide 6. Lithium delivered an exceptional quarter, driven by the successful ramp-up of production from the new hydroxide facilities in China. Revenue of $94 million was up 28% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Segment earnings increased over 50% sequentially and more than doubled year-over-year to $37 million in the quarter. Significantly higher volume and prices were the main contributors to the growth, driving the segment earnings margins of 39% versus 33% last quarter and 25% in the prior year period.","Regarding the ramp-up of our new hydroxide operations in China, we operated at an annualized rate well in excess of the 8,000 metric ton nameplate capacity in the month of September. We are very pleased to have delivered this capacity expansion on time and under budget and it speaks to the engineering expertise of our Lithium business.","Our debottlenecking project at our operation in Argentina also contributed to our Q3 results. The completed project has a deferred run rate of 2,000 tons per year of carbonate and will be at the full 4,000 ton run rate by the end of 2018. We continue to move forward with the expansion in Argentina where we plan to add at least 20,000 tons of lithium carbonate capacity with an initial investment of $250 million to $300 million. We are progressing the engineering work, and we are in discussions with the local authorities to finalize these plans.","Turning to slide 7 and the year-to-date results for Lithium. Revenue has increased by 21% compared to the same period last year and earnings are up nearly 70%. From an overall market perspective, much of the focus remain on the supply-demand balance. In 2017, we have seen conditions tighten further as demand growth continues to exceed supply additions. Incremental supply of lithium carbonate continues to be provided from high-cost spodumene resources.","In lithium hydroxide, FMC was the only producer to add significant capacity in the year. As we have discussed previously, pricing for FMC lithium is significantly higher compared to last year. Year-to-date, the average price per LCE is more than 20% higher than the same period last year, with hydroxide being the largest contributor, but all major product groups showing increases.","Late in the quarter, our two China hydroxide units produced at full capacity, creating the second-largest driver of improved performance, which is higher volumes. These two hydroxide units, which were completed in less than 12 months, had a capital cost of less than $20 million operated in September at a rate of 9,000 tons per year, which is 12% higher than their nameplate capacity.","Just as important, the customer qualification process has gone very smoothly, and the vast majority of our customers have signed off on the quality of the product we make in these two units. This means that we are now producing and filling at an annualized rate approaching 9,000 tons per year, doubling our lithium hydroxide capabilities compared to the same point a year ago.","Moving to slide 8, which summarizes our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year including the impact of two months of results from the acquired business. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.59 to $2.69 which represents year-over-year EPS growth of 35% to 40%. This includes guidance for fourth quarter adjusted earnings in the range of $0.98 to $1.08 per share. We expect full-year Ag Solutions revenue to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion and segment earnings will be in the range of $465 million to $485 million.","We anticipate the legacy Ag Solutions business will contribute $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion of revenue and $425 million to $445 million of earnings in 2017. The earnings guidance for the legacy Ag business represents 9% year-over-year growth and a $5 million increase versus prior guidance at the midpoint. Fourth quarter segment earnings are forecasted to be in the range of $168 million to $188 million.","In Lithium, we are leaving our full-year revenue guidance up for the segment at a range of $340 million to $360 million, a year-over-year increase of over 30% at the midpoint. We are raising our segments' earnings guidance to a range of $124 million to $128 million, a year-over-year increase of nearly 80% at the midpoint and a $6 million increase versus prior guidance. We expect fourth quarter Lithium segment earnings in the range of $41 million to $45 million, which represent 17% sequential improvement at the mid-point as well as a doubling of earnings year-over-year.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Pierre. Looking at cash flow on slide 9, we continued to improve our cash generation performance with adjusted cash from operations 9% higher year-to-date compared to the same period last year. This is underpinned by improved collection in Brazil as mentioned earlier. Although the credit environment in Brazil remains weak, our overall credit exposure has improved significantly in the last 12 months with account receivables in Brazil 13% lower than a year ago despite strong sales in Q3 of 2017 and past due receivables declining significantly.","We're not yet able to give a detailed forecast for full-year cash flows given the short amount of time we have owned the acquired business. However, our cash flow expectations for the legacy FMC business, excluding the acquired business, remains in line with our forecast of three months ago with adjusted cash from operations in the $400 million range.","Looking forward to the end of the year and our forecast for our year-end net debt balance. We ended the third quarter at just over $1.6 billion, down $233 million from a year ago. Since the end of the quarter, we have fully drawn a $1.5 billion term loan to fund our acquisition of which we transferred approximately $1.2 billion to DuPont under the terms of the transaction.","The remaining $300 million will be held as cash to meet various obligations related to the transaction, primarily tax payable on the sale of Health and Nutrition. The actual payment of many of these obligations will fall into the first quarter of 2018. In addition, we expect to receive significantly higher customer prepayments related to the acquired business in North America.","Given this, we expect to carry a significant cash balance at the end of December 2017, with higher cash outflows relative to historical patterns in Q1 and Q2 of 2018. The net result is that we expect our gross debt at the end of calendar year 2017 to be approximately $3.2 billion, with net debt of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Paul. I mentioned at the start of the call that I would give you a few highlights on how the acquired business is performing this year. The revenue growth for the acquired business has been robust year-to-date. For full year 2017, revenue is expected to grow about 6%, which is driven by very strong performance in India, as well as increased sales of insecticides.","The overall performance of the business is largely in line with our forecast made in March. A second key driver in 2017 has been the acquired business strong work this year to reduce channel inventories in its product in the Americas. We believe the acquired business have normalized inventory levels in both North America and Brazil. This performance positions FMC well to continue growing the business in 2018 at a pace at least as high as the 2017 growth. We believe this provides upside to our prior assumptions for the growth of the combined Ag Solutions business in 2018.","This brings me to slide 11. We have updated some of the numbers, and we would also like to refer a comment about how we feel after owning the DuPont business for a few days. As we mentioned earlier, we have increased our 2017 earnings guidance for both our legacy Ag business and for our Lithium segment. We have also lowered our estimate for incremental D&A related to the acquisition, and we now have more certainty on the expected financial impact of the regulatory remedies in Europe and India.","We are not changing the cost synergies range. As we have explained, these cost synergies are not the usual savings seen in acquisition. Remember that we are getting the business from DuPont with almost no corporate or macro fee structure. Cost synergies, in our case, are a combination of real cost decreases such as opportunities to operate plants at a lower cost and cost avoidance opportunities where we add less cost than were anticipated in the acquisition model.","Our assumptions for EBIT growth in the combined Ag Solutions segment has the potential to have the most upside relative to the initial forecast when we assume 2% to 4% revenue growth in 2018. Based on what we have seen so far regarding the current business, we are feeling more positive about 2018 growth for Ag Solutions. We will be able to give more clarity on this topic during our February 2018 earnings call.","Moving over to Lithium, We expect the positive trend we have seen year-to-year to continue through 2018, and we continue to expect Lithium earnings to increase by $40 million to $50 million.","In summary, we feel very good about where FMC is today. Our current Ag Solutions business delivered record Q3 earnings, and we are set to deliver a strong Q4 driven by Latin America. The integration of the acquired business is in full motion with our team already \u2013 teams already operating together. Lithium had a very strong quarter and is on track to deliver even higher earnings in the fourth quarter as the new hydroxide units are in full commercial operations.","I want to thank you for your attention, and I will now call \u2013 turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. We'll take our first question that will come from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. As your platform further transforms toward the discovery phase and AI development, can you just comment on your initial thoughts you have on long-term strategies and how you're positioning your team for success. And just that and any initial thoughts on product procurement given the size of some of the new products you'd now have and how that rolls through onto various global agreements and asset utilization? Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Hey, Chris. It's Mark. I'll take the R&D piece and then I think Pierre is going to take the procurement piece. On the AI, obviously, we have strong research capabilities with the DuPont acquisition, and we've already had our first initial set of meetings. What we're going to be looking at going forward is in excess to what we have today, we're looking at what pests, what crops are going to be our focus in the future. If you look at our portfolio today, you can see we obviously now have a very strong insecticide portfolio. We have a very balanced herbicide portfolio.","Where I feel we're behind the market is in the area of fungicides. So that's going to be an area of attention where we're going to be looking for hits coming out of basic discovery to help broaden that portfolio of fungicides. In addition, the area of nematicides also springs to mind, very much allied to our insecticide work but an area of focus that we'll also go for. So I think you can see that the fungicides space is something that we really want to boost going forward.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thanks, Mark. Regarding procurement and the size of the new Ag business, I think needless to say that when we talked about synergies and cost synergies that is typically one of the place where we are looking at significant synergies. We are still quantifying all of that. We believe that one of the number one source of cost saving will be with our toll processors who are producing active ingredients. We do have the former DuPont business and FMC lots of toll processors in common, and we know that we have possibilities to create significant saving here.","We also have the same situation on some of the critical raw materials. So, we are quantifying all of that. It will be part of numbers we will be reporting early next year. But we clearly have two source of cost saving. One is tollers and one is direct raw materials.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just a quick follow up. I know it's obviously a little bit early, but just given what you've seen for Rynaxypyr this year, can you just give us some quick color on what you're seeing on a regional basis in your expectations? I imagine Brazil might be a slight headwind. But what do you see in the intermediate to long term on the opportunity front in Asia and any rice markets? Do you have any line of sight as it pertains to 2018 and 2019? Thanks.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Well, since we've only had it for a few days, Chris, that's a deep question. I would say if you look at the spread of where the products are, obviously Asia is an area of focus for us. The business itself has a superb route-to-market in India, which is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. So, I think you can expect us to see \u2013 make more headways in India. Obviously, on rice, Rynaxypyr is a big product. But I also feel Cyazypyr on the more niche crops, the fruit and vegetables area in Asia will also be a benefit to us as well.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","On your comment about Brazil, Chris, which is a valid comment, remember, Rynaxypyr is not a Brazil story. It is much more of an Asia, Europe or North America story. The market is fairly, sales are fairly small for us in Brazil. The other point I would like to add, which is not a direct answer, but I want to use your point here of your question to talk about what we understand the team has done, and we went through there a number as quickly as we could. The team, when they were separated from DuPont and operating as a stand-alone organization, Rynaxypyr and other product did a tremendous job in removing excess inventory from the channels. So think about a situation where not only this business in 2017 grew at 6%, but at the same time was capable of bringing its level of inventory in the channel almost to normalized level, which is giving us very strong expectation going into 2018.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on the closing of the transaction.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Hey, Frank.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Regarding the assumptions on 2018, it looks like your EBITDA is coming in somewhere around $1.2 billion or something on that order of magnitude. I was wondering if you could do a bit of a walk on where free cash flow may come in based on the guidance that you're \u2013 the range of guidance that you're offering on the EBIT side for 2018.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Sure, Frank. Let me just give you a bit of color around what we're watching out for. I mean, clearly, when we run from EBITDA down to free cash flow, the two big areas I tend to keep my eye out for are number one, clearly, working capital movements, and in our business historically, it has been a Brazil issue.","As Pierre just mentioned, the acquired business really is not a large Brazilian business. And so we do not see a big headwind from what I'll loosely call rebuilding receivables in Brazil. As you'll recall, the terms of the transaction were that we do not receive any receivables from this business, so there will certainly be a rebuild. And I would expect that almost all the sales that you see happen in the last two months of this year will run through (33:46) Latin America, run through in an increased receivables balance. Offsetting that though, we continue to make very, very positive progress in Brazil with the legacy Ag business. You've seen some of the data we've put down here. We continue to reduce the capital tied up in that business, and I expect that trend to continue through 2018.","When we look at the rest of the business, clearly, the single biggest factor that we will then be looking at will be capital spending. The business we acquired from DuPont is a little more capital intensive than our business, but it is still not hugely capital extensive.","The Lithium business, we've made statements about $250 million to $300 million of investment in Argentina alone. Most of that will take a couple of years to spend. So again, while we'd expect capital spending to be higher in 2018, I certainly would not expect it to be a huge swing on that data, so I expect that we will have a pretty strongly cash-generative year next year. It's a little early to put specific numbers on it, but I certainly don't see anything that doesn't encourage me that we would expect to see significant cash generation in 2018 across the business.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And with respect to Argentina and that 20,000 ton expansion costing $250 million to $300 million. I don't believe you've made a final investment decision on that. Have you? And if not, when would you anticipate going down that path?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. I think, Frank, we are very close to making a final decision. Hopefully, we are just a few weeks away from this, potentially bringing that to our board at the December board meeting for approval. So we are getting very close to making that decision.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you so much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","And I must say also, as long as talk about that, 20,000 today \u2013 we are studying the market. 20,000, I would say, is a minimum, and we are looking at building capacity, potentially beyond that all the way up to 40,000. So it's a work in progress but just a few weeks away from it.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. So, I mean, the basic point is that if you do decide to go ahead and do this, this project will be well underway prior to the IPO in the back half of next year.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Absolutely.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Had a couple quick lithium questions. First, I was wondering, do you guys make today more money selling carbonate or converting that and selling it as hydroxide?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Hi, Bob. It's Tom. We make more money today selling our hydroxide.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you. And then the expansions you mentioned, there hasn't been a lot of industry incremental expansion. Obviously, there's a lot of incremental enthusiasm for the high nickel batteries and hydroxide. What do you see from the industry in 2018, and are you sensing any anxiety on the part of the battery supply chain about availability of hydroxide to feed some of this demand enthusiasm?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah. It's a good question. What we're seeing, and it's very significant in China and then we're seeing it around the world with OEMs, is the ramp-up of the higher nickel cathode material capacity. So it is definitely accelerating, and we're already having discussions around 2019, 2020 volumes and contract discussions are getting longer, not shorter.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And have you picked, Tom, where you're going to put those next modular hydroxide plants? I think you mentioned there's a couple more in the queue, but hadn't quite defined where those would go.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yes. So again, similar to the carbonate comment that Pierre made, the 12,000 to get us to 30,000 total is a minimum, and we're ready to progress more than that, if need be. And the next units are going to go at both of the existing sites we're operating today to get the benefits of the infrastructure there.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Both being China and North Carolina.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","One in each.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ian Bennett - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. In the Ag business, year-over-year growth was influenced by costs in other was a large contributor. Can you talk a little about what that cost other line was and what the expectation is for 2018?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Let me talk a little bit about margin improvement in general in the Ag business. First, let's talk about costs. We are operating with just a lower operations cost across the company in mainly in Latin American and Brazil. Remember Brazil two years ago was over $1 billion with a very large organization. We shrank that organization and tightened up our structure in order to focus on more technical and higher margin products.","So we have a lower operating cost from a structure standpoint. We also have a lower operating cost in Latin America and Brazil because we are now, with the work we've done operating with a much cleaner balance sheet. So we do have, yes, less financing cost, less hedging cost. So we do have a much, much cleaner balance sheet, which is lowering our balance sheet expenses. So that's one part of the improvement of the margin in the Ag.","The second one is, especially this quarter, is geographical mix. As we explained, we realigned or we are realigning the channel to market in India because DuPont is coming with a very robust system and channel to market, business and channel to market. So we have lowered low-margin sales in India, while we had a very strong quarter in North America, which is the highest margin. So we are benefiting from a good geographical mix.","And final, you remember over the last two years, all the way to the end of 2016, we have been decreasing our sales of non-differentiated generic products or third-party distribution. And that also is contributing to a strong increase in our margins. So those are the three key drivers. Mark, did I forget anything?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No, you got them all.","Ian Bennett - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, you mentioned earlier that year-to-date price is down 2%, but the outlook for volume growth next year looks quite favorable due to destocking. How do you think about price mix in the industry as we move into 2018, and are there particular areas or products that you're experiencing intensifying price mix pressure?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think the price pressure has been mostly in Latin America and Brazil, and it's linked to two things. First of all, one is the competitive nature of the business where competitors maybe are starting to see the need to decrease the level of inventory in the channel which is always creating price pressure and also the fact that Brazil is a place where the price is indexed on currency. So that's the main driver. If you look at our, what we're expecting this year is to have a 2% price decrease. That is mostly coming from Latin America and Brazil. So most likely to remain next year because we believe our competitors are going to need a good couple of years like we did to clean up the situation. So those are the main drivers but we don't expect more pressure than that in the market going into 2018.","Ian Bennett - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering with all the conversions that you're doing to lithium hydroxide, can you update us on how much lithium carbonate capacity and lithium chloride capacity you have left to serve other non-battery markets, and where you are in sort of your drive to convert more and more of your carbonate to hydroxide? And I'm obviously asking prior to this 20,000 ton expansion that you're looking to add.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah. So again, this is Tom. Thanks, Dmitry. We expect to come in between 18,000 and 19,000 tons of LCE production this year. We will be over 20,000 next year and up to 22,000 run rate by the end of next year. That's before any expansions. We may get a little bit more than that. Overall, in terms of the strategy, you have to realize we're trying to stay long carbonate. Some years will be a little bit longer than others. We don't yet see a year where we're going to be short carbonate, but we don't have as much to offer to the market as some do. In 2019 also, we'll have the Nemaska volume begin to come to us for conversion as well, and then we'll have the expansions coming in as well.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the non-battery market, the butyllithium and the stuff that goes into greases and more industrial applications. Are you seeing strong pricing there as well? I mean is that market becoming short just as the battery market seems to be a little bit shorter of demand right now? And what are the pricing in those markets look like compared to the battery-grade stuff? I'm just looking in terms of year-over-year increases, not in absolute levels obviously.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah. So lithium is a pretty segmented market especially outside of energy storage so you need to look at case by case. In general, prices will go up. We expect prices to go up next year across the board. You do have some regional markets and then you have some different dynamics between the regions. (44:28) is that way to some extent, but across the board, we expect to see price increases.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Pierre, I'm just wondering what your updated view on the overall market is. I know you said in the past you thought 2017 would be the third year of decline, albeit there less of a decline and that you saw growth in the overall market for 2018. Is that still your view? And then when will you have a better idea on the synergy side in terms of \u2013 specifically on the costs you need to bring in? I'm thinking specifically on the distribution side because it seems in the past you just used industry average percentages to come up with your forecasted cost savings.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. Let me talk the synergy aspect first. We want to be very clear, and I think that's what you're implying in your question. Synergies here are not your regular type of synergies where you're measuring your head count decrease and consequently you're monitoring how much cost you are removing from your operation. We're going to have two type of what we call, maybe a bit loosely, cost synergies.","One is the real cost synergies, we talked about procurement is one driver. We believe there is significant opportunities here, and there is opportunities in plant operation and supply chain. Those are real cost synergies. The rest is just we are trying to define what is the operating cost we need for this business versus the model we had when we made the acquisition.","Now, understand that the business which is coming at us, I know there is a tendency to push very large synergy number because we sometime believe DuPont being a large corporation, they come with large corporate cost. But remember, none of that is coming to us. We are getting no corporate cost, we are getting almost no back office people, no back office structure. So, we're only getting the manufacturing, the research, the sales, the marketing supply chain people and that's it.","From this, we are adding very carefully to operate the business with the TSA we have with DuPont. We believe by the time we get to January, we will have defined our operating cost to run the business. That's where we're going to be. We're going to be looking at it.","So by the time we get to the February earnings call, we \u2013 by the time we get to the February earnings call, we should be able to give you a very good sense for the bucket of real synergies and what is the operating cost of the business with those two businesses together. So our guidance in 2018 should be pretty firm when we give it with our Q4 numbers.","Regarding the ag market outlook, the way we are looking at it today, we would say globally flat, maybe low-single digits, but that's about \u2013 we believe and we sense a stabilized situation. We definitely do not see decline, but more a flat to low-single-digit picture getting into 2018.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question that comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. When you talked about the $40 million to $50 million of Lithium EBIT growth for 2018 can you maybe at least generally talk about how that might divide into buckets in terms of price, volume, and margin? You talked about the volume on hydroxide, but maybe a little bit on how it might split across the different buckets. Thanks.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Hey, Joel. This is Tom. Thanks for the question. I would expect it to be a little bit more than half price and a little bit less than half on volume. We're still early in the price discussion, so we may be able to get a little bit more than that. But it's hard to relay that to you right now.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thank you for that. Also back on crop protection, you talked about channel inventories of the acquired business to be somewhat stable, somewhat just at normalized levels. Can you maybe give a little more color on what \u2013 in what regions do you think that the acquired business' channel inventories are tight or normalized, and maybe which ones are a little bit higher than normal? Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. What we've seen, what we've studied, I mean, clearly, there is two place where there was a very high level of focus, where they have normalized their inventory level, that would be Brazil, Latin America and North America. What is not \u2013 China too. What is normalized? It depends upon the market, but anything around 25% is a number where you would consider you have normalized channel. And so, those are the three places, China, Brazil, to some extent Latin America and North America, where the biggest work has been done.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the Argentina expansion. I think, Pierre, you mentioned that you're within a few weeks of making a final decision there. Does this also mean that you're within a few weeks of getting the government approval for the project as well?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. When we say a few weeks, it's about everything which is required to build expansion, to get approval to separate the business within a few months. So, yes, it includes all approval, internal, external.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then a follow-up on lithium pricing question. Does your 2018 lithium forecast at this point carry the risk of pricing being higher or lower? In other words, do you still have a lot of volume, a lot of negotiations to conclude for the next year in terms of price?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah. This is Tom. I'd say that it's a muted risk. We've got defined pricing and most of the volumes already under contract, so there's still some discussion as to the actual 2018 price within a defined range. But I don't think we carry a lot of risk there.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice quarter.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You had a bunch of \u2013 not a bunch, but you had a number of molecules you were developing on the legacy Ag business. How are those unfolding and will you have any impacts in 2018?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah, Mike. The portfolio itself, the pipeline is absolutely on track to where we've communicated in past quarters. One of the first molecules that comes to market is bixafen. That will hit in the second half of 2018 in North America. So it will have some impact but it will be somewhat muted. Then, we have the rest of the range coming through really in the 2019, 2020, 2021 timeframe. But everything is on track exactly as we said before, so we feel really good about that part of the pipeline. Obviously, as you know, the DuPont pipeline is much more early stage and it comes in anywhere from mid-decade to end of next decade, but we're well suited across the whole portfolio right now.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. Okay. And then in terms of the DuPont business, as you think about next year, I think you noted on the legacy business would be up mid single digits. But what about DuPont's asset for next year, what type of growth do you expect to see from them on the year-over-year basis?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think we need to dive into the numbers and specific customers and crops to really finalize that. The initial look we had, I'd say it was a look we had especially driven by this call here because we knew we'd have to give you a sense. The business is going to grow in 2017 6%, knowing that the 6% was driven by specific countries, region and crop plus was done with a significant work to decrease channel inventory. Between the drivers and the decrease of inventory, we see absolutely no reason not to have at least the same growth rate going into 2018. Actually, with the analysis we've done, we are looking to demonstrate that very early in the year with a solid growth in Q1. So 2018, at least, the same number, starting pretty strong in Q1.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question, that comes from the line of Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, just on Europe, year-to-date the volume has been probably the weakest region for you guys. I know that there were some weather issues there, but is there anything else happening in Europe and can you kind of frame how 2018 could evolve there? Thanks.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. No, nothing really else apart from the weather impacts that we saw earlier on the year. And then obviously, as we're going through the rest of the year, we alluded to it in the script here from Pierre that France is the last country that we're changing the distribution channel from the Cheminova acquisition. So where we would normally be selling in Q3 and Q4 into that distribution channel, we're not selling right now because we'll be doing that directly ourselves as we go into the season in the first part of next year. So that has a somewhat meaningful impact. But apart from the weather impacts which have been pretty severe depending on the north and the south, there's been no other fundamental issues in the business.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just another really quick one. If I remember last year in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, you guys had a very strong pull forward of pre-emergent herbicide sales into the U.S. As you see the fourth quarter evolve this year, are you seeing the same type of trend or could that be a headwind if it doesn't work? Thanks.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No. We're seeing exactly the same trend. Pre-emergents are doing well and there's a lot of changes in the herbicide market in North America but our pre-emergent Authority brands are a market leader and continue to do very well and orders are strong.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","One comment about that question which I want to make sure is clearly understood. We had a very strong third quarter, but we see same trend in the fourth quarter, which mean it was not moving forward orders or just things are falling in space and the fourth quarter is as strong as we're expecting it before with significant growth driven mostly by Latin America but also a healthy situation in North America despite the strong third quarter. So there was no pull by our customers or early buys. So it's important to see sales are fully in place in the right quarter.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier one. You talked about or provided some color on your Ag R&D focus going forward, really talking about product categories. So I was just wondering if you can provide a little color on the crops that you're going to focus on.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Brett, we've said in the past that obviously we have more of a niche focus, a niche crop focus. When you look at our mix, we're somewhat more heavy in some of the niche crops such as cotton and sugarcane, less so in corn, and then all the various tree fruits and vegetables. I think with the acquired portfolio, obviously, that expands Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr big on niche crops. Going forward, I think on the fungicides, if we can go into that space, we will focus on niche crops. But also Asia soybean rust down in Latin America is a major, major issue. If we can develop products into that space, we will be happy to do so, and that would give us more of exposure in soy in Brazil. But outside of that, it's going to very much depend on the types of products that come out with regards to the crop focus.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question now will come from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. It's Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. How are you? You mentioned that focuses for growth going forward would be nematicides and fungicides. Is there a particular end crop that would be a focus as well to kind of go with those or that shows the most promise in terms of how they apply with those products in mind or those product categories in mind?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Just to clarify, what I said was, from an R&D perspective, from discovery, we would obviously like to expand our fungicide and nematicide, that's much more longer term given that it takes 10 to 12 years to bring a product to market. Our near-term focus will be continuous across the niche crops and then bringing products that are differentiated to any of the row crops whether it's soy or corn. Obviously, with the acquisition, we have a much broader portfolio for cereals now, so we're going to be looking at potential growth opportunities there with the strong portfolio that we have.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then with regards to Brazil, you've kind of laid out how things are going there. But is there any concerns about maybe farmers trading down to cheaper products this year as just as a counter to what with the environment that's occurring there?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No. I don't think any more than normal having \u2013 Brazil is a very competitive marketplace. We're used to operating there. You will remember we jettisoned a lot of our generic third party products a couple of years \u2013 over the last couple of years. So we've really been focused on more of our proprietary portfolio. Doing very well in sugar cane, insecticides, specialty insecticides for the soy area are doing well. Obviously, cotton is strong. So we're not big there but it's no worse than it normally is in my opinion.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning. I had a follow-up in for each segment. Just in ag following up on the discussion around synergies with the DuPont acquisition. I appreciate the opportunity there is really focused on \u2013 or the big piece of the opportunity there is more about cost avoidance, in other words, costs you don't have to layer in as you absorb that business. But I'm curious about how that is juxtaposed against the TSAs that are in place. So what are the magnitude of TSAs? As you identify cost avoidance opportunities are those mutually exclusive or do you have to \u2013 or as you figure out what costs you don't need to avoid, do you then have to fade some of the costs associated with current TSAs in place. I'm just trying to understand when you'll be able to recalibrate on what the real costs are necessary to run those businesses.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. So we have a TSA with DuPont which had a cost, we were expecting in the $50 million range for very well-defined services. And over the next 18 months, this TSA is going to be phasing out, which mean we don't keep the TSA all the way to the end. Once this TSA was defined, our functional team finance, IT and others define the bare minimum structure they would need to operate that business. And that's what we are putting in place and we are making good progress, to almost get to this.","At this point, we're going to pose. These points will be well below the model but we are not sure that this place where we'll pose will be strong enough for us to be able to operate the business for the two-year period while we have a TSA in front of us. So that is the process we are following our targets. I would say by early into next year we should have a pretty strong idea of bare minimum plus what do we need to run the business which will create the operating model going into 2018.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just following up on the Lithium business here, looking at the fourth quarter guidance for I think 17% sequential earnings growth. Just curious about, one, that pricing assumption that's baked into that sequential earnings progression. And then also you mentioned that in the month of September, your new hydroxide plant was running at 9,000 metric tons. Is that to imply that the product you're producing is fully qualified or are you in the process of still ramping up the qualifications? And if that's the case, can you just talk about how you see that qualification progressing sequentially in the quarter and into 2018?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Hi. This is Tom. So starting with the question. The customer qualifications went extraordinarily well. Traditionally in these markets, it's 9 to 12 months. I've seen even multiple year of qualification processes. We are qualified across our customer base. There's a few still in the process but it relies on customer processes. So there's no concern. We're qualified for the sales that we have forecasted. And in terms of the pricing, it's relatively minor impact Q3 to Q4 the way that the mixes go, it's relatively minor on price, mostly volume Q3 to Q4.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","And then could you just extrapolate on that last comment into 2018 at this juncture? Based on the contract that you took. Thank you.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","So earlier I had indicated we expect more than half of the benefit going into 2018 to be price and we just started those conversations. So it could be a little bit better.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'd like to turn the call over to Michael Wherley for closing remarks.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","That's all the time we have for the call today.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Alisha Bellezza, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corp. Ms. Bellezza, please, you may begin.","Alisha Bellezza","Thank you, Keely. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FMC Corporation's first quarter earnings call. With me today are Pierre Brondeau, President Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who will review our quarter performance, business segment results and provide an update on our 2014 outlook; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will present select financial results. Pierre will conclude with an update on the plan to separate into 2 companies. Following his comments, we'll be joined by Mark Douglas, President FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President FMC Minerals; and Mike Smith, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition, to address your questions.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based on these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's conference call, are provided on our website. Our 2014 outlook statement, which provides guidance for the full year and the second quarter of 2014, can also be found on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Alisha, and good morning, everyone. In the release, you saw that we generated $942 million in revenues, an increase of 3% over the first quarter of last year. We delivered $0.95 in adjusted EPS, a decrease of 12% over last year, largely due to lower earnings in Agricultural Solutions. This was driven by the widely reported weather factors that impacted the entire industry. Combined with currency movements, the lower ag performance reduced EPS by approximately $0.30 compared to the guidance we gave just over 3 months ago. Offsetting this, were strong results in Health and Nutrition and Minerals, with both segments returning results in line with our guidance and well ahead of the same period last year.","First quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $467 million, down 6%, and segment earnings were $120 million, down 26%. Segment operating margin was lower compared to the prior year primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, continued investments in sales, marketing and technical personnel and changes in product mix caused by difficult weather conditions.","As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we were encouraged by the prospects in North America and Brazil, and we had expected segment earnings to be up low-teens percent.","We had seen strong early demand in North America for 2 emerging products: Capture LFR insecticides and Authority herbicides. The increasing concern over corn rootworm and glyphosate-resistance supported our expectation that these brands would continue to outpace market growth throughout the first and second quarters of 2014.","However, as the actually cold weather persisted throughout the quarter and into April, farmers delayed their use of these products, and it became clear that product wasn't moving through the distributions channels.","In Brazil, our results were impacted by the record-breaking drought in S\u00e3o Paulo state. This is the region that represents 61% of the country's sugarcane market, the market in which FMC holds over 20% share with a broad portfolio of insecticide and herbicide.","Our herbicide products are important in sugarcane, as they control difficult weeds that can severely impact yields. The drought conditions reduced crop replanting that would have normally taken place during this growing season, resulting in fewer herbicide applications compared to the previous year.","Compared to our initial guidance, the adverse weather conditions in North America and Brazil reduced adjusted earnings in the first quarter by approximately $0.25 per share, with unfavorable currency movement, reducing earnings by a further $0.04 per share.","Looking across quarters, we had a very successful 2013-14 season in Latin America. We are extremely pleased with the advances that were made in expanding our Latin American soybean presence and our market position in these crops, such as tomatoes and potatoes, segments that leverage our portfolio of insecticide and fungicide.","In Brazil, we successfully launched Locker, a new 3-way fungicide for soybeans, and we gained traction with Talisman, a broad-spectrum insecticide for use in both soybeans and cotton. We also grew in Southern Brazil by expanding our relationship with cooperatives and further strengthening our most important customer relationship with another successful year of customer events.","As widely reported, planting in North America remains later than historical averages. We now believe that the combination of delayed planting and lower corn acres could result in fewer applications of Capture LFR to control corn rootworm. However, we remain confident that the change in crop mix toward additional soybean acres will be favorable to us and will drive increased demand for Authority brand in herbicide. These products provide superior control of glyphosate-resistant weeds from growers throughout the Midwest and South.","We also continue to focus on our strong presence in these crops, such as sunflowers and rice, that contribute to growth opportunity in this region.","In 2014, we are strengthening our portfolio with several new product introductions into key segments within both North and Latin America. We have developed 3 new herbicide products for corn, Anthem, Solstice and Marvel, which will complement our resistance management portfolio in North America.","Additionally, in the second half of the year, we expect strong market reception in Brazil, as we introduce our new cotton fungicide, Eclipse, and expand our Rugby insecticide into soybeans. Our strong customer relationships, along with these new product introductions, would allow us to further benefit from the expected increases in soybean and cotton acres.","With the second quarter earnings increasing high teens to low 20% and the second half up approximately 35% versus the previous year, we expect that 2014 will follow a different pattern from our original outlook. However, a second half year-on-year increase above 30% is not unprecedented and is actually in line with what we have seen in recent years.","We will compensate for the potential loss of some Capture LFR sales in North America in multiple ways. There will be a recovery in Q2 and early Q3 of delayed first quarter sales. We are seeing a favorable change in crop mix toward additional soybean acres in Brazil and North America, combined with a strong cotton and soybean planting season in Latin America in the second half of the year.","We continue to gain market share in corn, soybean and cotton, driven by the strong portfolio of new products. Given these factors, we are highly confident in achieving outlook of mid-teens percent year-on-year growth in 2014, leading to another record year of earnings.","In conclusion, our existing portfolio continues to demonstrate its resilience. We continue to gain market share in soybean and corn, and we are successfully introducing new products, including the 7 major brands already mentioned today.","In addition, we have a very rich pipeline of products in development, including our Biosolutions research. Our innovation engine will continue to make FMC the fastest-growing ag company for years to come.","Now turning to Health and Nutrition. Segment revenues of $226 million increased 18%, and operating profit of $51 million was up 17% over last year. In the quarter, demand for colloidal MCC and carrageenan-based ingredients increased in Nutrition end markets. We continue to work closely with our customers to help develop new applications for protein delivery such as our non-milk in North America and cereal-based beverages in Asia. Our new Thailand MCC plant, which is expected to start at the beginning of 2015, will support our growth in Asia.","In Health end markets, we saw robust demand for our pharmaceutical excipients, especially binders, which was consistent with our expected growth rate and confirmed our view that overall pharmaceutical demand has returned to historical growth patterns. Our Avicel platform continues to benefit from a strong brand recognition. As we expand our product portfolio to include new encapsulation solutions and Omega-3 offerings, we expect to leverage our resources and deliver higher growth rates from our Health portfolio than we have seen historically.","In Omega-3, our new Seal Sands facility received the necessary regulatory approvals, and we delivered our first customer shipments of pharmaceutical-grade products. Seal Sands utilizes advanced technology to manufacture high-purity, high-concentration products that command a premium price over low-concentration Omega-3 and is essential for pharmaceutical-grade applications. We were pleased to see 3 new prescription formulations of Omega-3s approved by the FDA earlier this year. We see this as a positive development for near-term demand for our products. Our technology allows us to efficiently serve the pharmaceutical market and, over time, will enable cost-effective penetration into the high-concentration Nutraceutical end markets.","The Health and Nutrition business faced some headwinds during the first quarter. Asian currency movements and continued increases in seaweed cost had a modest impact on business performance. We have been working closely with customers in successfully offsetting this higher cost through a combination of price increases, ingredient substitutions and reformulation that create new solutions to meet their market needs.","Looking forward, in Health and Nutrition, we expect second quarter segment earnings to increase low-teens percent over the previous year. In light of the strong first quarter performance and trends in the Health and Nutrition end market, we continue to expect that full year segment earnings will increase mid-teens percent.","Now let me review Minerals. In the quarter, revenues of $249 million increased 11%, and operating profit of $37 million increased 27%. The businesses performed as planned, with improved operations, resulting in additional production volume.","In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $185 million were 2% higher than last year. As anticipated pricing, excluding freight charges, was above the previous year, the most notable increase in Asian export prices.","Higher products and volume in the quarter also contributed to the sales growth. Revenues increases were partially offset by higher energy cost. Prolonged cold weather contributed to a spike in natural gas prices that was unfavorable in the quarter.","Additionally, our contract prices for coal were higher than last year. We are looking at alternatives to reduce this cost, including renegotiation of our coal contract and alternative supply sources.","In Lithium, revenues of $64 million increased 45% over the previous year. Higher volumes out of Argentina allowed us to take advantage of increased demand for Lithium, particularly in energy storage application. Pricing remained stable during the quarter, with product mix more heavily weighted toward primaries, which account for most of the volume growth.","The business achieved a low-teens operating margin in the quarter despite continued inflation headwinds in Argentina. We expect the operating margin to continue improving sequentially throughout 2014.","Looking at the second quarter, segment earnings in Minerals are expected to be up low-teens percent over the second quarter of 2013, driven mainly by increases in volume.","For the full year, we expect segment earnings to increase high-teens percent in 2014.","As we described during our last earnings call, our outlook for Alkali Chemicals only includes price increases that are specified in existing short- and long-term contracts. We remain optimistic that the soda ash pricing environment is improving, and we continue to be very supportive of ANSAC's efforts to pursue additional price gains in export markets. We remain confident that we'll produce record volumes as we operate within normal geological conditions and continue to benefit from higher products and volumes as a result of the Manufacturing Excellence programs.","In Lithium, higher production volumes supporting increased demand will be the largest driver of improved business performance. Increased sales in primaries are expected to significantly contribute to revenue and earnings growth in 2014. However, it is important to remember that more than half of our production is further processed into downstream products. We maintain leading-market position in these downstream segments, and we'll continue to manage our supply to maximize overall margin. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering operating margin improvement sequentially throughout this year.","Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.15 per diluted share, a 17% increase versus the second quarter of 2013, at the midpoint of the range. Although weather resulted in a slower-than-anticipated start in ag, we expect a strong second quarter performance, with segment earnings of high teens to 20% over the second quarter 2013.","In Health and Nutrition, we expect to deliver a low-teens percentage increase in segment earnings, driven by strong demand across all product categories and in all major end markets.","In Minerals, our outlook includes continued Lithium margin improvement and sequential pricing improvement in soda ash. This combination, along with higher production volume in both businesses, is expected to increase segment earnings by low-teens percent compared to the second quarter 2013.","For the full year, our expectation of adjusted earnings continues to be $4.35 to $4.55 per diluted share, a 15% increase over 2013, at the midpoint of the range. We are maintaining our outlook for full year revenues in segment earnings in Agricultural Solutions to be at mid-teens percent over the previous year.","The second half of the year is expected to show strong results, driven by increased soybean and cotton acreage in Latin America, improved sugarcane production in Brazil, new product introduction and our investment in market access channel around the world will continue to strengthen our customer relationship.","We are confident 2014 would be another record year for ag, building on the 10 previous years of record performance.","In Health and Nutrition, we anticipate full year revenue growth of mid- to high-teens percent, with segment earnings up mid-teens percent over 2013. We see strong market demand for our stability and texture solutions in Nutrition end markets, and we are extremely pleased with how our Health ingredients portfolio is performing in markets that exhibits solid underlying growth.","In Minerals, both Alkali Chemicals and Lithium will deliver record annual volumes in 2014 as a result of our Operational Excellence programs. We see strong market demand in Lithium and favorable pricing trends in soda ash. We continue to expect segment revenues to increase in the mid- to high-single digits percentage and segment earnings to improve high-teens percent over 2013.","I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights.","Paul W. Graves","Thanks, Pierre. Today, I'll focus on a few specific items that were notable in the quarter, including foreign exchange movements and cash generation. I will also touch on capital spending, the closing of the Peroxygens transaction and separation costs incurred to date.","As Pierre mentioned, foreign exchange was a headwind in the quarter. Across all of the businesses, unfavorable currency movements impacted adjusted EPS by approximately $0.05. In particular, adverse movements in the Brazilian reais, a range of Asian currencies and the Argentine peso all hit our reported earnings despite a counteracting favorable movement in the euro.","We continue to mitigate our exposures with appropriate hedges wherever practical. This quarter was an unusual one, with multiple factors contributing to lower-than-expected operating cash flow. In the quarter, cash required by operating activities was $85 million. The largest single factor was the lower EBIT performance in Agricultural Solutions, although some temporary working capital increases in Health and Nutrition and lower receipts from government receivables in Lithium also contributed to the lower performance.","The second quarter is traditionally our strongest cash generation quarter, as a significant proportion of our Latin American season sales are collected. We expect this year to follow a similar pattern.","Our actions to reduce our working capital remain on track, with significant progress made today on inventory levels in Agricultural Solutions. We're now rolling out similar programs in Health and Nutrition. We have initiated programs focused on our terms of sales in every business and have commenced the final step in implementing a global procurement system that will allow us to take a more dynamic approach to how we handle payment terms to our vendors.","As we've said before, we remain very focused on increasing our operating cash flow, but we will tread very carefully around any major changes to our working capital policies, given the importance of the use of working capital to support our customers and our business model. We expect to see the benefits of our efforts to start to show later in 2014 and into 2015.","As expected, capital additions were approximately $47 million in the quarter, compared to a total of $26 million in 2013. Increased spending in the quarter was primarily associated with construction of the Thailand MCC facility, which remains on track to begin commercial sales in early 2015.","In the quarter, we completed the sale of Peroxygens, receiving net after-tax cash proceeds of $193 million.","With regard to the separation process, we incurred approximately $3 million in separation cost in the quarter, largely a result of spending on external advisers. We expect that costs to increase in the next few quarters, as we start to execute on the complex process of separation.","We are currently performing a thorough review of the expected additional costs, and we'll report an updated estimate with our second quarter results.","Finally, in the quarter, we announced an 11% increase in our dividend rate, in line with the earnings growth we delivered in 2013.","With that, I will now turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Paul. Before we turn to Q&A, let me brief you on the separation activities. We have made steady progress since announcing our plan to separate FMC into 2 publicly traded company. A dedicated program management office is in place to manage the separation-related activities. Work on this complex separation is well under way, and the P&L model ensures that our business teams can remain focused solely on their operations. We have named several internal leaders who will be aligned with each new company. And importantly, our search for a CEO for FMC Minerals is progressing well. We expect to make an announcement about this in the second quarter.","The separation process is complex, but we are confident that we are on track to complete the transaction in the first half of 2015. We will continue to update you on our progress over the coming months.","Now I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you discuss how the weather-related impacts might have broken out between North America and Latin America and, basically, the polar vortex versus the drought-related pressures that you referenced in S\u00e3o Paulo?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I would say, as you know, the first quarter in Latin America is much smaller in size than our business in North America, where usually the first quarter is a much larger quarter. So if you'll look versus our expectation, by far, the biggest gap will reside in North America. That is where we were expecting to have the biggest sales because of the dedication. Now on top of that, which did not help, we had slower sales in Brazil than what we would be expecting. But once again, it doesn't help in a situation which is difficult from a weather standpoint, but the vast majority of the gap came from delay in pre-emergent planting, pre-emergent product. There was a delay also in Capture LFR for us for corn, so the vast majority of the problem came from North America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, Pierre, just a follow up on that. You obviously left your annual EPS range unchanged. Is it a case that these are entirely transitory and you'll make it up in future quarters? Or is some of it lost permanently just due to the vagaries of the season and you have other counterbalancing positives to get to the same place for the annual EPS?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I think it is the latter. First, what we lost in Brazil, if you look at a quarter when the season is back end of the year, is lost. But it's not that critical in size. So the focus in terms of what did not happen in the first quarter should be on North America. A large part of what was not sold in North America will be sold -- will be recovered throughout Q2 and Q3. That, we know. But we believe, especially for corn and Capture LFR, we believe that there is some sales which are being lost, and that's why you don't see a complete transfer of what was lost in Q1 into Q2. We won't have a robust Q2, but you will not see a 100% transfer. But there is mitigating factors, which I see, if I look to the future, as overwhelmingly positive. First, there is, for multiple reasons, I'm sure you have heard, there is a transfer to more soybean crops, which for us, is important as our market share in soybean is much stronger than our market share in crops. There is, today, a strong planting season with solid acreage increase in Latin America, possibly beyond what we're expecting. Most importantly, we have introduced multiple new products. I mentioned in the script 7 new brands we've put on the market. And I have to say that those products are taking off very, very strongly and seeing a very strong demand. So if I look at where we are, the possible loss we could see in one specific product, which is for corn, will be more than compensated by what we see happening around that and a penetration of new technology.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate the color, Pierre. Last question, if I may, maybe for Paul. Can you discuss your payment terms by region and\/or product line and how they might change in the future, if at all, as you increase your focus on working capital?","Paul W. Graves","I think if I was to go through payment terms for every product and every region, I might take up most of the rest of the call. I mean it certainly varies. If you mean in payment terms, you mean our terms of sales rather than our payment terms, it's certainly the case that, generally speaking, we have our shortest terms in the Americas, North America. We have probably our longest terms, particularly in ag, down in Latin America. Europe tends to be closer to the North American example. And Asia tends to be a bit further out. So generally speaking, as our mix of sale changes towards emerging markets, we tend to experience longer collection terms. Now, as we look forward, I think the question is open for others to how we want to think about going to market with some of our customers and with some of our products. It's early stages in most of our business to have that assessment, so I think it would be premature for me to try and predict what the impact would be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So with regard to your North American ag business, my understanding was, historically, it's always been a very large pre-emergents business. It sounds like that may be changing a little bit where it's more of an even mix. But can you walk us through how we should be thinking about the mix in North America? Or how much is -- what percent, say, is pre-emergents versus post-emergents?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I'll get Mark to comment. But there is a change. I mean, there is change. Pre-emergent has always been big for us, but we are evolving. And I do say that we are strengthening, also, our position in corn and soybean and beyond pre-emergents. So there is an evolving product line, and we are gaining market share in crops where we've been, historically, claiming were not a target. But we have such a strong portfolio and we are at the size now that, clearly, we are evolving our portfolio with those crops. And I must say, very successfully, with a lot of runway. Mark, you want to add?","Mark A. Douglas","No. I think, John, what I would say there is the pre's are very important to us. They have grown significantly over the last few years, as you know, both on soy for glyphosate resistance and the corn rootworm resistance. But now we're introducing some new suites of products, in particular, Anthem in North America, as a soy herbicide that can be used both as a pre and a post. But we see the post side growing. We're also expanding into corn on the post side. So I think you'll see it creep keep up over the next couple of years as we gain traction with those brands and market access. So definitely, pre's is not going to go away for us. We see resistance acres continuing to grow, especially on the soy side. So you'll see that as a major area, but expect the posts to start to grow and become more of a significant part of the portfolio, especially as we go into the '15, '16 seasons and the next couple of years.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up. I know, historically, there's normally a pretty solid margin drop off from the first half of the year to the second half just because of geographic mix. And I guess I'm wondering how we should be thinking about that in 2014, just given that, again, some of this pre-emergent products is actually moving kind of later in the year on the North American side. So how should we be thinking about the margin progression?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I think, John, what you're seeing is because there is a push, a transfer, from Q1 into Q2, Q3 so you will see lots of those North American high-margin product being pushed in the second half of the year. So you will have a more uniform or less of a differential in the margin this year because there is a delay in the North American season. So those high-margin product will be pushed into Q2 and into Q3, smoothing out the differential in term of margin.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe one last question, if I could. On the Health and Nutrition side, your outlook for low-teens growth in the second quarter, I guess, why is it, sequentially -- why is that growth moderating, especially when you've got the Omega-3 platform actually, it sounds like, up and running now and it should be a contributor to revenue and profits?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. It is -- that's actually a good question, John. It is just the fact that, today, because we are starting into the Omega-3 business, the orders are a bit more lumpy than for our other products. So we're going to have a pattern of order for Omega-3 as we are starting to sell to some large customers, and we have not yet reached a number of customers such that we'll see a very smooth ordering pattern for the year. We expect to see that much smoother in the '15 and '16. But this year, there will be some lumpiness in Health and Nutrition just because of the order pattern on Omega-3.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Robert Walker of Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, in ag, what is the difference in margins between North and South America? And how much was mix a factor in the Q1 margin decline?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. Go ahead, Mark.","Mark A. Douglas","Yes. Robert, we don't actually disclose the margins between North and Latin America, but they are different. North America is the higher-margin area for us and Latin America tends to be a little lower. Obviously, it depends on mix. Mix is an impact, given where we saw North America come out and where we saw Latin America come out, given the weather conditions Pierre already talked about. But there is a difference between the 2. You can't look at the whole Americas and say that they are the same. And as North America was down versus our forecasts, given the weather conditions, we saw that mix change from a year-on-year.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Without going in too much detail around regional, but to give you a sense for last year, if you take the first quarter, usually, which is very strongly driven by North America, we tend to have an operational margin for FMC ag business, which is north of 30%. Last year, it was 33%, where you usually see a fourth quarter, which is more in the 20s to mid-20s. So that give you a sense -- and the fourth quarter is usually very much driven by Latin America. So that gives you a sense of the difference in mix and product line we are selling in those 2 regions. Just the question John asked around the way our product line is evolving with a change in pre and post mix, we're going to see, potentially, over the years, not this year, this being different and changing, with maybe a smoother differential from a quarter to another.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And how much of your normal Q2 sales in ag slipped into Q3 because of the delayed planting?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Well, if you look, we were initially forecasting in Q2 in the mid-teens growth. And now we are looking maybe in the low 20s, so that gives you a sense. About 1\/3, 1\/4 of the growth in the second quarter is coming from Q1 sales. And then we're going to have Q3, but Q3 is a bit more complicated because we're going to have a combination of some of the sales pushed up from Q1. We're going to have a very favorable mix around soybean. And we're going to have new technology. Maybe I can take the opportunity to talk a bit about the second half because I know a 35% increase in the second half of the year year-on-year seems to be like a big number. We are quite comfortable here with that number. First, if you look at historical pattern, look at your '12 versus '11. We had a 37% increase in the second half versus the first half, with a fourth quarter which was up 52%. Even last year, which was not the most spectacular growth, we still had a fourth quarter with a 24% growth year-on-year. So those numbers, from 24% to 52%, don't make this second half that different from historical data. If you look at the way we look at it, it's a fairly simple break. If you take our growth rate to get to the mid-teens, there is 3 big buckets. About 1\/3 of our growth is going to come from what we see as acre change and a change in the mix between soybean and corn. There will be 1\/3 which will be coming from the market share gain we have in soybean and corn, and most of that driven by new technology. I think it's a trend we see. We like it. Our strategy is evolving. We will be more of a player in larger row crops. And then 1\/3 is really new technology for other crops. We've talked about the secondary type of crops. So those 3 1\/3s are very well-defined and makes us quite comfortable around the numbers we are contemplating for the second half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","I wanted to sort of kick the dead horse one more time on the ag discussion. In the first quarter, obviously, besides North America, you're looking at sort of Northern Hemisphere sales overall as being contributive to the quarter. So if you look at the European sales and Asian sales versus your North American sales, was the North American sales -- in other words, were the regions outside of North America, where the weather was more normal and hopefully you're benefiting just from share gains and new product introductions, were volumes or revenues up in Europe and Asia, even though it's a small business for you, offsetting the weakness in North America a little bit?","Pierre R. Brondeau","If you look -- I'm going to ask Mark to comment in more detail. But if you look, at the end of the day, the first quarter for us is an Americas story and mostly a North American story. I mean, remember, I think Europe is about -- or EMEA is about 6% of our sales and Asia is about 16% of our sales. You put on top of that, that's usually because of our market share in pre product, in pre-emergent product, in North America, and we have the end of the Brazilian season, usually, it's mostly a North American story. So yes, we didn't suffer like other companies did. We didn't suffer. Europe was, overall, healthy, and Asia is in good shape. But Asia, for the rest of the year, we do have some great growth expectations. But in the first quarter, those are too small to influence the -- our numbers. Mark, you want to add?","Mark A. Douglas","Wouldn't add a lot to what you said. I mean, Asia is doing well. We have, as you said, good growth expectations. We have good market access strategies in place in Indonesia, Philippines. We see good growth in China. Europe, as we said, is only 6% of the portfolio, so it doesn't really swing a lot in Q1. But we do expect a number of our activities in Europe to benefit on the herbicide side as we go through the year. So we do expect growth as we go through Q2, Q3 and possibly into Q4 for Europe. But Q1 was not a factor.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","And as a follow up and switching gears a little bit. On the Lithium business, you talked about expectations of sequential margin improvement there through the year. How should we think about where sort of the fourth quarter should end up in terms of margins and where we should -- what we should look for in 2015?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I think we're going to go this year from a low-teens margin to mid-teens EBIT margin. That's the range we are expecting for the Lithium business.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then in 2015, hopefully, you'll start with low teens -- with mid-teens and go from there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. Correct, correct. We've always said this business is simply north of 15% EBIT margin when it's operating. So we clearly are on the recovery part. We like what we see. We like our market position. We are able to renegotiate those contracts we've been away from. When I think I said with 45% increase in sales in Lithium, it's a lot of renegotiations to take place on contracts. So it's going to improve to the mid-teens and take off from mid-teens in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Pierre, I appreciate your confidence for the second half there for ag, but can you maybe share some of the risks that you might see in the second half? I mean, some of the North American business, as you noted, was pre-emergent, can some of your customers skip that potentially and just move on? I just want to understand what, maybe, things you need to watch out for potentially.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Well it's the ag world, there is always risk. Let me talk about North America. We are in April. We know the second quarter was a slow start. But right now, I mean, products are moving, so there is no doubt that we are on a positive trend. So the numbers we are giving, at least for the North American part, are quite solid. The question always -- I mean, the question will always be, \"Should we suffer from a terrible weather condition, which is not predictable today in Brazil?\" You never know that, we don't see it. The demand is robust. The plan for acreage planting is robust. Our new product introduction is incredibly successful beyond our expectation. Listen, I would dare to say, Mike, that it would not -- we would not have had the weather we had in the first quarter, looking at the fact that we will close the year at 15% increase despite the first quarter, we would have had, in our ag business, an absolutely incredible year beyond what we're expecting. That's why we have a level of confidence, which is strong, assuming there is not anything -- we are not -- we could not predict in Latin America in the back end of the year. From the North American market, products are moving, we are following that on a daily basis. But so far, so good.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about 1\/3 of the improvement coming from market share in soybean and corn. What is it in terms of the new technology that you're rolling out that is giving you the edge? And then when you talk about that, is that a business that customers have said, \"You won this, we'll just take it when we need it\"?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I'll let the world ag expert answer this one.","Mark A. Douglas","Thanks, Pierre. Yes, Mike, when you look at soybeans, as an example, and let's take the Latin America acreage, it's a big market. If you go back to 2011, we had about a 3% market share in what was over a $3 billion market. If you look at our business last year, we were at 6.5% market share in a $5 billion market, and that's all coming through our insecticide portfolio and now our new fungicide portfolio. So we're definitely increasing market share. Why are we doing that? We have some technologies that are broad-based. Pierre mentioned in the script a product called Talisman. That was a product we've had for cotton growers for many years, for the last few years, and certainly it's a broad-spectrum insecticide. It's now playing very well into the soy arena, where we see different types of pests coming and the growers want to utilize a broad-spectrum insecticide. We already have, as you know, and we talked about very strong relationships with cotton growers. We have a high market share that allows us to translate that market access to soy. So it's a combination of bringing new technologies like the Talisman, new fungicides like Locker, plus our strong market access and already exposure to current crops. We like that mix and we're going to push more new products down that pipeline as we go forward. I think we've said in the past that about 25% of our portfolio comes from new products introduced in the last 5 years. As we head through 2015, we expect that number to increase to 30%. So we're seeing that throughput of new technologies, and it'll continue at a rate.","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think, Mike, we've talked a lot about R&D model, how we access actives, then do tax and formulations. This technology engine is giving us one of the fastest product invention that any ag firm might have. And we've been, right or wrong, because things have been good so far, but we've been careful on how aggressively we would penetrate the soybean or corn market. But when we see the possibilities we have to resolve some of our issues our customers are facing, and some of the technologies we have, I think we're not going to hold back and we're going to focus as much on crops like soybean and corn as we've been in the past on cotton and sugarcane or other smaller crops like potato or rice. So it's working. And those are new products, which are responding to a changing environment and customer needs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","On the Lithium side, can you comment a little bit on what you're seeing in organometallics, particularly as you get into the ag business, where there have been some changes there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Could you repeat that question, please? I couldn't understand what you said.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I was wondering about organometallics within the Lithium market, and if you're seeing any weakness in butyllithium, in particular. I know that you guys have exposure in polymerization, but was wondering if you were seeing weakness in ag or crop protection synthesis products.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. Ed can answer. I mean, there was a major change, where a customer, Bayer, moved away from a product which was using butyllithium. So I would say no weakness for us or our competitors, from a market standpoint, in butyllithium. But certainly, an impact we have been seeing because Bayer was such an important player in that space as a customer for us, that him walking away from a formulation, which was butyllithium-containing, has been creating a hole in this market. But the rest of the market growing fast, it has allowed to, little by little, compensate for that. Maybe, Ed, you want to give more color?","Edward T. Flynn","Not much to add. It was just that the market that's affected is Europe, and we haven't seen any impact in Asia or in the U.S. And there are some rumors that there will be better butyllithium demand in Europe down the road from other products.","Pierre R. Brondeau","So I think the weakness we see in numbers, for me, the way we look at them are more specific-case related than they are an across-the-board weakness. For us, it's been a pretty healthy business.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And as I look at the Alkali business, it sounds like the pricing in Asia is improving, and you mentioned some higher costs that you encountered during the first quarter. So as we look into Q2 for margin there, should we expect a pretty meaningful step up there or are there other costs that we should keep in the consideration? You mentioned the coal contract as well, so a lot of moving pieces.","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think there is a lot of -- lots of moving pieces for us in Alkali. Through the year, the trend is up in term of margin. I'm not going to say today it is dramatically up. I mean, it's -- in our forecast, we were looking at a stronger margin in Q2 than we would look in Q1. The positive for us, the 2 big positives are the volume and a better utilization of our assets, the plants are operating extremely well. I must say we had 4 tremendous months so far, including April, and pricing is going up. On the negative, we have coal, which is still a challenging situation for us. Now realize that when we forecast, and we're going to stick with that for a while until we have better clarity, we are not forecasting major changes in pricing. Today, the price, overall, for us in the first quarter year-on-year were up in the mid-single digits, around 5%, mostly driven by price in Asia. When we go forward into the rest of the year, we are forecasting not as much as a year-on-year increase because we are not speculating on any inflection points on Asia prices. So right now, despite the fact that we have a mid-single-digit price increase and double-digits year-on-year price increase in Asia, we are still forecasting pricing, overall, to be in the low-single digits for the year because we are not speculating on pricing until we understand better where the markets are going. The trend is positive. We've been burned before, so we're careful. So to answer your question, slightly up on volume and pricing, with adverse effect of coal price.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investment.","Peter Butler","Pierre, considering all your contract obligations, et cetera, is there a rule of thumb on what would be the P&L impact on FMC if soda ash prices rose 10% in a year?","Pierre R. Brondeau","If soda ash, on average, goes up 10%, overall. I mean, think about -- we are selling about 4 million tons -- call it, 4 million ton of soda ash in the world. The 10%, on average price would be something in between $10 and $15 per ton, so you're talking about a number around $60 million of EBIT impact, if I did the calculation right. So that's the kind of number we're talking about. That is the range.","Peter Butler","If you have the opportunity to declare victory on your 2015 goals, when would you take the victory lap and perhaps set some goals for 2020?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Actually, that gave me a good opportunity to tell you how we're going to be doing that. What we are planning to do is we are working today the Vision 2020. And we're going to have a series of session with our board. That will end by October or November to have a Vision 2020 for FMC Minerals and a Vision 2020 for FMC, the New FMC. What we will do is we will hold a Vision 2015 -- a Vision 2020 Investor Day in December. The way we look at it is we will first see where we are, because when you are at the end of 2014, you should be able to say if you will reach your 2015 goal. And we'll be in 2015, so we'll start the day by looking at FMC as it is today versus 2015, and if we should take a victory lap. And then we will present Vision 2020 for FMC Minerals and Vision 2020 for New FMC. Now I can't tell you versus Vision 2015 highly, highly confident that we will beat 2015 in ag. Very strong confidence around Health and Nutrition. Looking at the evolution of Lithium, I believe we will be able to declare victory. The only place where we have a question is on parts of the Alkali business, soda ash. We know, first, in Vision 2015 everything we wanted to do around plants, capacity, we will; around domestic market, we are online. The only question mark is Asia pricing and export pricing. So where we are today around Vision 2015, I think we're going to hit the mark everywhere, except in half of the sales of soda ash, which today we just don't know. I mean, it's still 1.75 years away. We are seeing positive trends but we don't have the answer.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Pierre, on the Lithium, you said that you are processing about half of your production into downstream products. Those are higher-margin products, if I am not mistaken. Is it at all possible for you to move more than half of your production into downstream?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No. It is difficult, Rosemarie, because, let's face it, our high-margin product -- and butyllithium is one of the products which is complex to do, too complex to move around, for which you do have higher pricing and higher margin. But there is a single-digit growth for this market. The growth is mostly coming from primaries: carbonate and hydroxide. So if you look over time, the business will continue to grow. We do expect to see a low-double-digit growth rate, but it will happen mostly because of growth in the primaries, which tend to have lower margin than a product like butyllithium.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay. And I was wondering, as you are moving more into crops like corn and soybean, are you -- you are now going to go against a bigger player. So are you anticipating more volatility? Are you anticipating more pricing pressure? Or are your offerings totally different from what they are offering?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I think the way we are evolving, I think, in this -- I don't want to sound arrogant, but I think we're looking at ourself as a big player now. And we believe we have the technology capabilities to compete with anybody on the chemicals front. So we do have unique offering, which differentiate ourselves. It doesn't mean that a company like a Monsanto or Syngenta, which clearly have a broader spectrum of product, we're going to go head-to-head against them with respect of their business. But we believe we have a technology portfolio which is such that we can make very interesting offering to our customers in highly technical places where we'll protect our margin. Don't confuse what I say with us deciding to grow very broadly into soy and corn with competitive products, lowering our margin. We're going to stay very technical, very specific. But yes, we believe we have the size today and the reach, which allows us to compete in most markets.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","That is very helpful. If I may ask one last question. Looking at the complexity of the separation, could you give us some idea as to the elements which are making it take so long to achieve?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Our timing, and I'll ask Paul to jump in. But our timing for separation, if you look at any of the other companies which have done separation in the past or which have -- which are in the process of separating, the timing, we are still targeting the end of the first quarter. So it's about 1 year from the vote of the board to the actual separation is about standard. There is lots of complexity. Think about the number of legal entities a company will have which will have to be changed. Think about system like IT and being able to replicate that. So we are very much in the norm. Paul, do you want to add?","Paul W. Graves","Yes. No, look, I think there's nothing particularly unusual about what we're going through. It's logistical [ph] legal tax and regulatory transfers and approvals that take by far the most time. They just take time going through various authorities to get the sign-offs that you need. We obviously have to perform separation of some functions, whether that's the finance functions, computer systems, et cetera, which also take some time. And we also have to have one eye on the complexity around SEC reporting around 2 different entities and how that might factor in. So cutting through all of that complexity, it's sort of a 12-month process. No matter which way you cut it, driven largely by factors outside our control.","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think what we really want to do is, I mean, of course, when you do a separation, you want to happen -- that to happen as quickly as possible. But we are building 2 great companies for the long run. It would not be appropriate for us to take any risks to shorten this process by a couple of months that would not make a difference in the long run. And we do not want to take any risk. We want to have a flawless process in 2 companies ready to go from day 1. So the timing is appropriate. We believe we are on track, but we will not rush the process. The other thing we are doing is isolating our business organization from this process. We need to make sure they keep on focusing on technology and customers and running their plants. So it's also something we have to take into account during the process.","Alisha Bellezza","I want to thank everyone for joining us today. That's all the time we have for the call.

","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Pierre Brondeau. Pierre?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Brennen. And good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results provided a strong finish to a year of remarkable accomplishments for FMC. We achieved record financial performance in 2011 and made great progress implementing our Vision 2015 strategy plan. ","Here is a brief summary of our accomplishments in 2011. Sales and EBIT both increased 13%, excluding the prior year impact of exited businesses. Earnings per diluted share grew by 21%. Free cash flow of $180 million was generated. Return on invested capital increased to 23.9%. Agricultural Products delivered its eighth year of record earnings. Specialty Chemicals achieved sixth consecutive years of record earnings led by the seventh consecutive year of record earnings on BioPolymer. Industrial Chemicals realized robust earning growth, the highest profit growth among our segments, on the strength of our soda ash business and continued shift towards Specialty Peroxygens. ","Across our businesses, we completed 4 company or product line acquisition, formed 2 joint ventures and established 2 product developments and distribution agreements, all designed to strategically broaden our capacity to serve customers and enable us to capitalize on organic market growth opportunities. And alongside these external growth initiatives, we returned $206 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchase. ","2011 indeed was a very good year for us and we are confident that we'll deliver another record year in 2012.","Moving to our fourth quarter 2011 results. Sales of $909 million increased by 17% last year excluding the prior year impact of exited businesses. Adjusted earnings of $1.58 per diluted share increased 44% versus the year quarter ago. This stable adjusted earnings is well above the $1.30 to $1.40 range in the guidance we issued last quarter as we benefited from a lower tax rate than projected in our previous guidance. We do expect this lower tax rate to be a sustaining contributor to our highest earnings profile going forward. Kim will review the details of this lower tax rate later in our call.","Our gross margin of $294 million increased by 11% versus last year, while on a percent basis our percent gross margin essentially equaled that of last year.","SG&A spend of $115 million was leveled to a year ago despite the significant sales gain. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $145 million increased 24% versus last year. On a regional basis looking at the result, excluding the prior year impact of exited business, we have clearly demonstrated our continued success in penetrating rapidly developing economies. Asia had the highest sales growth, up 15%, as Specialty Chemicals nearly doubled. Latin America, grew 30%, driven by robust growth in ag product and soda ash, while EMEA increased 11%.","Let's take a more detailed look at the performance of operating segments in the quarter. First in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $409 million increased 22% versus the year ago quarter led by robust sales growth in Latin America. The sales gain in Latin America were driven by strong demand in key Brazilian market segments, such as cotton and sugar cane, as well as by new product in production and sales from a new venture in Argentina. Sales in EMEA increased significantly based on the strength of insecticide and herbicide sales in France and Italy. In North America, sales were lower than a year ago due to a shift in the turning of fall application sales, where we recorded in the third quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of last year. In Asia, sales were essentially leveled to a year ago as higher insecticide volumes in China, Indonesia and Korea were offset by lower herbicide volumes due to less favorable weather conditions in China, Pakistan and India, which impacted the regions with crops.","Segment earnings of $73 million increased 17% versus a year ago, driven by the higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material and manufacturing costs, as well as increased spending on targeted organic and external growth initiatives.","Moving now to Specialty Chemicals. Fourth quarter revenues of $223 million increased 9% versus the prior year quarter driven by higher selling price across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer, especially in Asian food and pharmaceutical markets, as well as in downstream lithium specialties.","Segment earnings of $51 million increased 11% versus the prior year driven by the sales gain and favorable mix, which more than offset higher raw materials and energy costs and increased spending on targeted organic and external growth initiatives.","In BioPolymer, we realized volumes gain in all 3 product lines coupled with higher selling price in key market segments. On the demand side, microcrystalline cellulose, or MCC, continued to realize the highest growth rate. In food ingredients, we continue to see robust demand growth in dairy and beverage market in Asia, especially in China.","And in pharmaceutical excipients, a strong position service generic manufacturers in India continue to offer the higher growth.","BioPolymer earnings growth was driven by the higher sales and favorable mix, which more than offset higher raw material costs and spending on targeted growth initiatives. Pricing gains realized in the quarter more than offset higher raw material costs, principally higher wood pulp and seaweed costs.","Moving now to Lithium. Sales gain were driven by higher selling prices in both primaries and specialties and volume gain in energy storage and synthesis markets. The Asian energy storage market continued to be the highest growth driver, supplemented by steady growth in butyllithium and other downstream products, which serve polymer and pharmaceuticals synthesis markets.","So in summary, a very strong finish to a record year in both Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals.","To complete our look at segment performance, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Douglas for a review of our Industrial Chemicals segment. Mark?","Mark A. Douglas","Thank you, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. A pleasure to be with you today to highlight our Industrial Chemicals segment, review our fourth quarter performance, and provide you with our 2012 outlook. In many respects, Industrial Chemicals' strong performance in 2011 was a clear reflection of the significant steps taken in 2010 to realign and transform our businesses to deliver higher performance. Higher performance in the form of less sensitivity to the economic cycles, sustained higher margins, greater earnings stability, stronger cash generation and superior return on assets.","In my view, 2011 was the first year in which you could see the true strength of our soda ash business and our increasing shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.","In 2011, sales of $1.04 billion increased 11% and earnings of $155 million grew 26%, excluding the prior year impact of exited businesses. The result in operating income margin of 14.9% continues to significantly increase and is on track to achieve the 20% operating margin objective in our Vision 2015 plan. For comparison, the operating margin reported in 2009 was 9% and in 2010 was 12%.","Moving to the fourth quarter 2011 performance. Sales of $277 million increased 14% from the year ago quarter, excluding the impact of exited businesses, driven by higher selling prices for soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash.","Earnings of $42 million increased 47% versus the year ago quarter as a result of the broad-based sales gains, greater soda ash volume as our Granger plant came online, the absence of prior year boiler tube repair costs, and the continued favorable mix shift toward Specialty Peroxygens.","In soda ash, volumes remained firm throughout the fourth quarter.  Export demand through ANSAC remained strong, and we benefited from higher ANSAC prices as tighter than anticipated market conditions for soda ash in Asia created a rising price environment. As we have commented on in prior quarters, these tight market conditions were driven primarily by increased China synthetic production costs.","Our domestic volume also held up well through the quarter with the demand constant in our magic glass chemical and detergent markets.","In Peroxygens, sales and earnings growth was driven by higher selling prices in all product and regions augmented by volume growth in European hydrogen peroxide and in our specialty growth initiatives focused on environmental, energy and antimicrobial markets.","With that summary of the fourth quarter of 2011 completed, I'll now shift to our 2012 outlook for Industrial Chemicals. ","In a sentence, we are anticipating yet another strong year. On a full-year basis, we expect earnings to increase approximately 20% driven by higher volumes and selling prices and our continued portfolio shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.","Before commenting specifically in each businesses, allow me first to summarize at the segment level the impacts of the 3 major drivers of profitability for the segment. Volumes, selling prices and input costs.","First, volume. We are experiencing an increased demand across our businesses, particularly in soda ash export markets and in specialty peroxygens serving environmental, food and aseptic packaging applications. Overall across the Industrial Chemicals, we expect aggregate net volumes to positively impact earnings by approximately $22 million in 2012.","Regarding pricing impacts in 2012. As many of you know, the significant majority of this segment's business has tended to be on an annual or semiannual contracts rather than on a spot basis. Though this will remain true for domestic soda ash and global peroxygens in 2012, our export soda ash business, as it did last year, will once again have a large degree of quarterly contracts, mainly in Asia.","Overall, we expect aggregate net price tailwinds of approximately $38 million for the segment in 2012.","And finally, input costs. In aggregate, raw material, energy, soda ash royalty payments and other input costs for the segment in 2012 will result in headwinds of $30 million when compared to 2011.","The majority of this cost increase is driven by 2 factors. Firstly, the recent reversal of federal soda ash royalty rates, now raised to 6% from the previous 2%. And secondly, the renegotiation of the long term coal supply contract for our soda ash business following the expiry of our previous contract.","I will now review each business in more detail starting with soda ash. ","As we begin 2012, the global soda ash market remains healthy. Global demand is expected to reach an all-time high in 2012, growing 5% over the previous high in 2011 and taking global demand up to 55 million tons. Despite this record, and as it did last year, the world will remain oversupplied with an excess of high-cost synthetic soda ash capacity primarily based in China and Europe. In 2012, we expect the overall global capacity utilization rate to be in the low 80% range. However, given that the U.S. is the base for the world's lowest-cost natural soda ash production, we fully expect to be running at maximum capacity rates throughout 2012.","In the U.S. market, demand continues at a solid pace, though lower than other parts of the world where demand is more robust. We expect U.S. demand in 2012 to grow by 2% to 3% driven by flat glass, glass containers and chemicals. As a point of reference in the domestic market, glass in all forms makes up 47% of market demand. ","Turning to pricing. In North America, increases in soda ash prices for 2012 vary by customer depending on contract provisions. We realized an average increase in the domestic market that was in line with our expectations and comparable to the prior year's increases. In export markets, ANSAC expects to increase average prices in 2012 and at the same time maintain their market share.","During 2011, ANSAC demonstrated its ability to maintain its market share while increasing prices as the cost of synthetic production increased. A very clear reflection of this was the decline of Chinese export volume in 2011 to 1.5 million tons, a low level not seen since 2004.","Given the high utilization rates of U.S. producers, Latin American customers' primary concern during the 2012 contract negotiations was security of supply. This dynamic has afforded ANSAC the ability to maintain its significant supply position into Latin America, as well as raise price.","In Asia, as expected, we achieved the highest price increases. Given the shorter contractual dynamic in Asia, we are keeping a close watch on Asia demand to ensure ANSAC maintains pricing strength while holding market share.","As we have commented before, over the longer term, we fully expect prices to continue to rise in Asia as the cost of synthetic production from China continues to escalate, driven by higher input costs for energy such as electricity and coal, raw materials such as salt and ammonia, labor, and the strengthening currency.","As with prior years, the rate of price increases in the export market will be materially higher and will result in export and domestic pricing that is almost at parity. The net result of domestic and export pricing actions is an expected $1 per ton increase in global average pricing in the low double digits. These pricing moves will result in a global average selling price FOB Wyoming in the low $1.40s per short ton.","Given our world-class, low-cost position in natural soda ash and the projections for continuing demand growth, we restarted our Granger facility mid last year. We are now producing at the full 500,000 tons per year rate. For comparison, we produced just over 200,000 tons from Granger in 2011.","In addition, we are in the mid stage of an engineering study to look at the feasibility and timing for bringing on-stream a further 700,000 tons of soda ash capacity at our Granger facility. We will make this decision as we move through 22012.","In summary, our soda ash business will once again deliver significant earnings growth in 2012. Let me remind you, however, that we own 87.5% of the earnings stream of our soda ash business. The balance is owned by our 2 Japanese partners. ","Moving now to Peroxygens. We look for a record year in Peroxygens driven primarily by continued growth in specialty markets such as in persulfates and peracetic acid while we primarily compete with technology solutions different than ours. We see robust growth, particularly in environmental, food safety, electronics and oil field markets, where our products offer customers unique quality, performance and technology, with an incremental benefit of being green in nature and meeting sustainability goals.","As we noted in last quarter's call, we strengthened our portfolio late last year with the acquisitions of RheinPerChemie and Adventus, both support our drive to specialties and extend our geographic reach.","Prices in 2012 are expected to be higher across Peroxygens product lines driven by mobile and supply and demand dynamics. We expect to benefit further from continued manufacturing cost reductions and realignment projects across our plant network.","Let me conclude this detailed outlook for the businesses that comprise industrial chemicals by summarizing our 2012 aggregate view for the segment.","We expect full year 2012 revenue to increase approximately 10%, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash export markets.","We expect full year 2012 earnings to be up approximately 20%, driven by the sales gains and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens. And for the first quarter, we expect segment earnings to be up approximately 10% versus last year, lower than our full year forecast for 20% year-on-year growth. This is mainly due to soda ash mix, increased soda ash royalties based on our mining plan, and operational expenses that are occurring in the quarter. Partially offsetting these factors is the increased volume from our Granger plant. Clearly, we expect yet another strong performance from our industrial and Chemicals group. ","With that, I look forward to taking your questions during the Q&A period, and will now turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Mark. I'd like to now share with you the progress we made in 2011 implementing our Vision 2015 strategic plan. Recall that is something I intend to do twice annually, at the midpoint of each year and at year end. When we announced Vision 2015 in December 2010, we set out a plan with an overriding objective to drive total quartile shareholder return. Our plan included an aggressive growth target aiming to reach $4.2 billion in sales in 2015 solely through organic growth and augmenting the growth with external growth opportunities to drive 2015 sales to $5 billion overall.","As I look at our 2011 results, we are solidly on track to meet these objectives. We delivered robust organic sales growth of 13% in 2011 and more than 1.5x the annual organic growth rate required to reach our $4.2 billion 2015 target.","Further, we continue to see rich opportunities for organic growth across all of our business, which gives us the potential to accelerate our sales to $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015.","And on the bottom line, our 2011 results continued to demonstrate the earnings power investors should expect from the FMC portfolio. Earnings before interest and taxes grew 13% versus 2010, a rate consistent with the average annual growth rate required to deliver our Vision 2015 organic EBIT goal of $1 billion.","During 2011, we took several steps to support the continued delivery of this higher level of organic growth. We established regional leadership teams in Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey to work across our businesses to drive faster growth in revenue-moving economies. We have already seen results with more than 46% of 2011 sales coming from all these versus 40% in 2009. ","We also invested in critical infrastructure, including breaking ground for Asia Innovation Center, which will house agricultural product BioPolymer and Lithium technical and commercial teams to accelerate our growth largely by tailoring products to local markets in the region. We expect the center to be operational in early 2013. We continued our organizational evolution to better capture the value of co-ownership shifting from a highly decentralized organization to balance centralize -- de-centralized model, to better leverage our sales -- size and scale. Particularly in disciplines that transcend businesses and regions such as procurement, strategic planning, M&A communication and most recently operations, by acting as one FMC where it matters, we are realizing increased efficiency while maintaining strong accountability in our business units.","We also made great progress in our external initiative. Though externally derived, sales growth was not a marginal factor in 2011 as nearly all of our initiatives closed during the fourth quarter last year, I'm excited about the potential for the eighth transaction closed in 2011.","In our Agricultural Products Group we acquired the Rovral and Sportak fungicide product line from Bayer CropScience. These established fungicides are highly effective, registrant management technologies that are used worldwide with brands well recognized by leading agricultural customers around the world.","We entered into 2 exclusive agreements covering development and distribution of biological with Chr. Hansen for agricultural and ornamental market and Marrone Bio Innovations for biofungicide in Latin America. We also established Ruralco, a new Argentinian agricultural chemical distribution company, enabling FMC to accelerate its growth in Argentina as $1.7 billion crop protection market, the second largest in Latin America.","In our Specialty Chemicals Group, we acquired South Pole BioGroup, a specialty food ingredient manufacturer based in Chile. BioGroup provides FMC an entry into the natural colors market, a rapidly growing market expected to reach more than $1 billion in size by 2015.","And as Mark said in his remarks, in our Industrial Chemicals Group, we made 2 acquisitions and formed 1 joint venture. These 8 transactions will present meaningful steps for us in reaching our $5 billion 2015 sales goal. Collectively in 2012, they are expected to add more than $90 million in sales, $15 billion in EBIT and to be accretive EPS by $0.07.","Including the related growth organic investments to further the growth of each of these transactions, we are on track to meet our goal for external growth to continue to $800 million or more in 2015 revenues.","I will now turn the call over to Kim Foster for a report on our financial strength and its role in enabling the achievement of our Vision 2015 objective. Kim?","W. Kim Foster","Thanks, Pierre. And good morning, everyone. FMC showed strong cash generation in 2011 with free cash flow of $180 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $200 million to $225 million largely due to a shift in financing of Brazil's receivables from a higher cost local financing to lower cost U.S. financing sources.","Cumulative free cash flow over the planned period reached $436 million, on track to meet our $2 billion cumulative free cash flow goal for 2010 to 2015.","For 2012, free cash flow is projected at $225 million to $250 million. This projection is after capital expenditures of approximately $250 million to support expansion initiatives in BioPolymer, Lithium and Soda Ash.","As I do each quarter, let me remind you that our free cash flow projections do not include funds for acquisitions or share repurchases. Consistent with the Vision 2015 plan, cash deployment in 2011 was balanced across reinvestment in our existing businesses, external growth and returning cash to shareholders.","Capital expenditures of $190 million in 2011 was at a faster pace than originally anticipated in Vision 2015, reflecting the stronger outlook for organic growth that we now see.","We deployed just under $200 million through our external growth initiatives, which represent an 8.9x forward multiple of 2012 EBITDA for these transactions, a lower multiple than projected in our Vision 2015 plan and further evidence of the discipline and value creating-focus of our external growth strategy.","And alongside these focused investments, we returned $206 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2011. Cumulative cash returned to shareholders over the planned period reached $378 million, well ahead of the pace required to reach our target of at least $1 billion returned to shareholders cumulatively through 2015.","In December of last year, we announced a $200 million buyback with the intention of completing the repurchases by the end of the first quarter this year. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 55 million shares, which is included in the numbers I just gave you. We fully expect to complete the remaining $145 million by the end of the first quarter. Return on invested capital for 2011 expanded 160 basis points to 23.9%, demonstrating clearly the earnings power of the FMC portfolio. With our rich organic growth opportunities, robust external growth pipeline and disciplined cash deployment, we are confident we'll be able to maintain our return in invested capital measurably above our mid-teens target while delivering our Vision 2015 growth goals.","And finally let me outline our tax rate for 2011 and provide our projection for 2012. As Pierre mentioned, we benefited in 2011 from the achievement of a 26.3% tax rate, considerably lower than our prior guidance of 29% due to a higher component of foreign sourced earnings, which are taxed at lower rates than the domestic earnings.","To address a recalibration question, you will likely have, if we were to recalibrate our fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $1.58 per diluted share using the prior guidance rate and associated higher duties, our adjusted earnings would've been $1.37 per diluted share.  But this recalibration is largely academic as we continue to increase our presence in rapidly developing economies both in sourcing our products and revenues and our overall tax rate has reduced to this new level. With our plans to continue to invest in these economies, we would expect this lower tax rate to be a sustaining contributor to our higher earnings profile. For 2012, we're projecting a 27% tax rate.","Thank you, and I look forward to taking your questions. I will now turn the call back to you, Pierre?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thanks, Kim. As you've seen, 2011 was a year of major progress toward the achievement of our Vision 2015 objectives. I am increasingly confident in our ability to meet or exceed the long-term targets we set for ourselves back in December 2010.","$5 billion or more in sales, $1.2 billion in EBIT with return on capital sustained above the midteens, we are maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet and disciplined cash inflows.","We believe then, as we do now, that our Vision 2015 plan was the right plan to deliver these objectives. Moving to our outlook for 2012, we plan to deliver another record year with full year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 15% increase versus 2011 at the midpoint of the range.","Our Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth straight year of record earnings, up approximately 10% versus the prior year, driven by expected strong market condition and growth in new and recently introduced product, while increasing spending on growth initiatives.","Our Specialty Chemicals segment plan to deliver its seventh straight year of record earnings, up approximately 10% versus last year, reflecting higher sales across all businesses.","In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to increase approximately 20%, driven by higher volume and selling price across the segment, and the continued mix shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.","Moving to our outlook for the first quarter of 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $1.90 per diluted share, a 21% increase versus last year at the midpoint of this range.","In Agricultural Products, we look for first quarter earnings to be up approximately 20%, reflecting robust early season demand in North America, coupled with the expected shift to some sales in the region from the second quarter, a strong finish to the crops season in Brazil and volume gains in Asia and EMEA.","In Specialty Chemicals, we expect first quarter earnings to be level to a year ago, as higher selling prices in all BioPolymer and lithium product lines are offset by higher raw material and energy costs and onetime operating costs related to capacity expansion projects.","In Lithium, we will incur about 6 weeks of downtime across our brand and lithium carbonate plant in Argentina as we complete the tie-in, enabling the 30% capacity expansion.","As previously communicated, product from the expansion is planned to enter the market by midyear. Meanwhile in BioPolymer, we will take a planned outage associated with the alginates capacity expansion at our facility in Norway. This expansion is largely in support of our pharmaceutical business. The additional capacity will be brought on later in the first quarter.","The impact of the Lithium and BioPolymer outages will be contained to the first quarter. In the absence of this impact, segment earnings would've increased 10% to 13% consistent with the segments' planned line performance.","And as Mark mentioned, in Industrial Chemicals, earnings are expected to be up approximately 10% driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygen, the benefit of volume growth in soda ash export market and the continued shift towards Specialty Peroxygens.","With that, I thank you for your time and attention. I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess first question was just curious to get a little more detail around the CapEx plans, I guess particularly around soda ash and lithium, or could you kind of roughly size that $250 million around your segments?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Certainly. Kim, do you have the breakdown of the capitals?","W. Kim Foster","Without going into too much detail, there's about $100 million of expansion capital in that $250 million in capital that we're guiding for 2012. Three projects, the beginning of the Granger expansion in Green River, the beginning of the lithium expansion in Argentina and some expansion capital in our BioPolymer business make up about 90% of that expansion work, roughly equally distributed.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great, it's very helpful. And then could you just give us a rough sense of your expectation in ag, in terms of how much sales in Q2 are going to be pulled forward into Q1?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Milton, go ahead, sales in Q2 being pulled forward into Q1.","Milton Steele","Rob, I would imagine if you want to talk in terms of EBIT impact, somewhere of a $5 million to $8 million.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just quickly, I'm kind of trying to see and get a sense for what your guidance implies for share buybacks next year, looks like around like 1.3 million, 1.5 million shares?","W. Kim Foster","This is Kim. When you look at the guidance, I wanted to remind you how the shares work in the diluted share calculation, which is not just outstanding shares and not outstanding shares at a point in time, but a year average. And then there's an adjustment for the treasury method for the diluted share calculation. So what happened during 2011 is the shares came down continuously through the year as a result of the share buyback that we did. So when you look at the average shares for 2011, that's the average for the year, not the year end numbers. So when you continue the share buyback, as I outlined in my remarks, and finished that about 145 million buyback in the first quarter, the average shares that we're projecting assumes no further share buyback beyond that point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Sabina Chatterjee - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Sabina Chatterjee in for Frank Mitsch. Just going to your outlook on Specialty Chemicals, it looks like you're calling for flat margin in 2012, and I think you explained that partly by capacity expansion costs. But can you just help us understand maybe the selling price to raw material situation, like have you been able to offset raw through price, or are you still playing catch-up in some areas?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think in BioPolymers, the price increase has been covering the raw material cost increase. I think there is really one -- I may call it an issue, it's not really an issue, is we do have 2 expansions for which we need to stop our current plans, which will not be operating and the lithium plant will be off first 6 weeks to do the tie-in for the expansion, and that is the only reasons for which there is a slowdown of growth in the first quarter. It's pretty much level to the previous year and the full impact margin. But everything else is pretty much balanced. We're still expecting very strong growth in MCC. And we are sill expecting to recover as we've done in 2011 raw material increase with price increase.","Sabina Chatterjee - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So seaweed and wood pulp, those are all being offset?","Pierre R. Brondeau","That's right.","Sabina Chatterjee - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just on ag products, can you remind us what your optimal breakdown is between insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and maybe how your margins are when compared across those products?","Milton Steele","Sabina, we don't give you margins by the breakup between herbicides, fungicides and insecticides specifically. And you opt for the optimal, I guess, the optimal would be a footprint that agrees with the average in the world. We are predominantly herbicide and insecticide today. Insecticide is around 48%, herbicide is about 43%, and then the growing fungicide business of around 9% or 10%. So what we're focusing on is building positions and products, or expanding our products in each of these segments. Obviously, we are significantly underrepresented in the fungicide market, and hence this recent acquisition of the 2 fungicides from Bayer CropScience is our effort to increase our footprint there. And it's going to depend on our success in expanding our product lines in each of these categories, which we are trying to do at the moment. I mean, I think that's the best way I can answer you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of 2012, can you give us a feel for what sort of gets you to the top end or the low end of your range?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, I think as always, the place where -- there is a couple of places where we do have some possibilities to see numbers going higher. Mark talks about pricing in soda ash. You know that on the export market, we do have shorter contract, which always could imply an upside, queen player [ph] downside depending upon the export productivity of others, but it could also imply an upside. And we always have -- and it's hard to predict at this stage in the game, the possibility of a more robust year-end performance in ag especially in Latin America. So those 2, I guess, would be accounting for the majority of the upside we would have in the business plan.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on soda ash, Mark, you mentioned the potential of adding more capacity. Will you be -- when will you run out? You just started up Granger, as I recall it's sold out. So is -- will you need capacity at a certain point over the next 12, 24 months?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Mike, we're full. So we are -- as you know, we've been expanding our capacity by 500,000 tons and we are selling on the export market every time we are producing. So the question for us now is -- it was a very easy decision, if I may say, to increase by 500,000 tons because the capital spend was very low for the volume we are bringing to the market. We are now looking at the timing, more than a question whether or not we will do it, we are looking at the timing when it will be more appropriate to do the next phase, which will be a higher capital spending, to bring another 700,000 tons on the market.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the last question on lithium, I saw another competitor adding capacity, you're adding capacity. Can you update us on what you think the growth rate for that business can be over the next several years?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, Mike, this is Michael Wilson, and  we see the trend line growth rate that we've been on continuing for the next couple of years. So real demand growing 8% to 10% a year. We see that continuing through 2015. And then in the latter half of the decade, we expect that to pick up. So that I would say it appears between now and 2020, overall, probably 11% in trend line growth.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That 8% to 10% is higher than what you had at your Analyst Day, is there any area that has gotten better?","D. Michael Wilson","I think, really, the only thing that we've taken a look at is the battery penetration into not only light-duty vehicles but other types of vehicles, 2-wheel vehicles, municipal buses, airport vehicles, those kinds of things. And we're seeing the penetration rate on that increasing a little faster than we thought.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Butler from Glen Hill Investment.","Peter Butler","I think you might be hiding your light under a basket here with you casually mentioned your Bayer ag chemical acquisition, but I think there's a heck of a story there and how this acquisition fits your model. And maybe you should flesh out your view here with a few numbers and discuss some of the synergisms to back up the rationale for acquiring it.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, Peter, I could not agree more in terms of the value of such an acquisition for us. But it goes along the line of -- this Bayer acquisition and these 2 products we have acquired, goes along the line of all of the 8 transactions we are doing. And what we have been doing is we're proving that our approach to acquire potentially growing companies or additional product line, or new product lines, new segments for us in the white space at low price, low multiple, giving us a product to grow, denies the need for any type of medium or large acquisition. I think we want to get to this $800 million of external originated growth as we have in 2015 with this type of move. Now the Bayer move is excellent to us, it's a very good multiple. When I say \"good,\" I mean low. It is accretive on the first year. It increases our participation in the fungicide market, which we are trying to do. And certainly, Bayer is a great company for which we do have a lot of respect. It's a great partner. But I have to say we tend to have a, maybe, a stronger focus on this type of product and formulation capability, and we do expect we should be able to take the growth rate of this product beyond what Bayer was doing with our participation in different geographies. So all in all, it's an acquisition which will grow our ag portfolio very nicely. But I would expect more like that. I think that the story we would like to show in the future for all of FMC is 8 transaction this year, and maybe an incremental number, or one less or going to be 4, 5 or 8, but small transaction like that, which are contributing to the growth of the company without a lot of spending.","Peter Butler","The second thing, I think earlier there was some discussion about Mark Douglas being your new cost czar, and supposedly had an interesting cost reduction program that he had been studying. But you didn't mention this in your conference call. Did anything occur on this front during the year?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, I think maybe the place where we've talked in terms of numbers and we said a few things with out-sizing. But we are very much on track in places where we have structured our sales to do cost saving, and we were expecting to be in the $20 million run rate by the end of this year on procurement, and by the end of 2011 solely on procurement, as a run rate. That's where we are. We are targeting an $18 million by 2015. That's where we are. And certainly we do have opportunities beyond that. So we are very much on target with the cost reduction plans we put in place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Pierre, I noticed recently that the Chilean government launched a tender process to open lithium production to new entrants in that country. I'm wondering how you view that in terms of the competitive landscape, generally, and whether or not Chile might be attractive to FMC at some point in terms of future expansions. I realized you just completed 30% but looking down the road, would that make any sense for FMC?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, Kevin, we certainly are looking at any opportunity to diversify our source of lithium. And, of course, Chile is an opportunity now. A couple of comments, I think, as QM and Rockwood are well established in Chile. Chile will be opening the door for another supplier, but as you can guess, it's going to be a process which will most likely be difficult and expensive. We do not expect the Chilean government to give that opportunity to a company for free. And it's going to be an economical balance for us in between keep on expanding in Argentina, as you said, we just expanded 30%, but we do plan to go one step beyond. I think we only had in the midterm, maybe 10,000 tons, maybe another 10,000 ton in the future. The question is we do have facilities, people and structure in Argentina. And we are very well established there. And how much would we have to pay to go to Chile to diversify our source. So yes, we'll look at it. Would the probability for us to go to Chile instead of keep on growing in Argentina be high, no, it is not, I would put that on the very low side.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow up, if I can shift gears to soda ash, Mark, would you comment on the price realizations by region, U.S. as well as some of the ANSAC realizations in Asia and Lat Am? And then second, related to that. It seems that the average contract durations continue to shorten. What is driving that? Is that a conscious decision on the part of ANSAC or counterparties or both? Maybe you could just provide a little more color on where your contracts are in places like Lat Am, quarterly, annual mix, things like that?","Mark A. Douglas","Sure, Kevin, I'll take the pricing piece first. Basically what I said was we had the pricing in the low double digits dollars per ton. Obviously, that indicates a spread -- the lowest amount of increase was in the domestic market, and I would say that was in the single digits, mid to high. And then in ANSAC, the highest increases were in Asia, significant double digit increases, followed by Latin America. So quite a spread actually depending on local conditions. And as you know, both Latin America and Asia are important for ANSAC and very important for FMC. On the contract side, there has not been significant changes in terms of contract length. Obviously, domestic in North America, we have most, if not nearly all, on year or multi-year contracts. Latin America is predominantly year or multi-year contract. And Asia has anywhere from 30% to 50% on quarterly contracts, and that really hasn't changed much. So if that came across in the script, it was given a wrong impression. So Asia, more quarterly. And the rest of the world that we deal with, especially Latin America and domestic, more annual and multi-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eugene Fedotoff from Longbow Research.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions on Industrial Chemicals. Mark, can you talk about the Peroxygens, mix shift or Specialty Peroxygens. You're moving into food and environmental markets, what percentage of your total capacity are those markets right now, and what the goal is for 2012? Can you provide a little bit more color on that. And also if you can mention the difference in margins for a low margin business versus high margin business?","Mark A. Douglas","Sure. I'll take the mix shift first. If you think back to what we presented at our Investor Day way back in 2010, we had a North American business that was essentially 75% what we would call commodity business, which is pulp and paper mining, and 25% specialty, which is all our persulfates and our peracetic acids and hydrogen peroxide into other specialty application such as electronics. Since that time, we've actually globalized the business. And if you look back in 2011 on a global basis, it was probably close to that 75-25 range on a global basis rather than just North America. But I would say in 2012 going forward, we are much more likely to be closer to a 60-40 mix. So 60% commodity and 40% specialty. I would also like to point out that we value both of these businesses. We need the commodity business to run our plants. We need the volume through the plants to get our operating rates. But our focus is clearly on aseptic packaging, our environmental applications, the electronics business. From a margin perspective, they are fundamentally different in terms of margin production. Commodity businesses are very low double digits in terms of gross margins, and then the specialty side is anywhere from 45% to 75% gross margin depending on the application. So you can tell, the mix shift plays an important part for us and we're driving that hard. We're not only driving the mix shift hard, we're driving the geographic expansion hard. We recently put people into China for aseptic packaging. And with our RheinPerChemie acquisition in Germany, that affords us opportunities to improve our environmental business into Central and Eastern Europe. I hope that helps.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, definitely. Could you also remind us what the current capacity, hydrogen peroxide capacity, is right now and what kind of utilization rates your plans are running at?","Mark A. Douglas","Utilization rates are pretty high in the U.S., pretty optimal for us. And also for us in Europe, I would say in the mid 80% range.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","Great. And a couple of questions on soda ash. I guess first, do you plan to move the longwall in 2012 or is it going to be a 2013 event?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, we move the longwall about every 15 months, and last year it occurred in July. This year it will occur in September. So that we know quarter-to-quarter change, it occurs within the same sequential quarter.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","Same third quarter, right?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","And could you also comment on any changes, if you see any behavior of Chinese soda ash producers?","Mark A. Douglas","No, I think in my script I explained that their export volume was down. Obviously, they have demand in their own country that has slowed a little bit as we entered out of last year. But fundamentally, they're focused on their domestic market with a declining export volume. So I haven't really seen any change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Young with ChemSpeak.","William Young","On the China question, how do you think the chances are for further expansion in soda ash capacities, synthetic capacity there in China? And what's the outlook for growth and capacity in Turkey and other places in the Eastern hemisphere?","Mark A. Douglas","Bill, it's Mark. I think in China, as we went through the end of last year, there was about 2 million tons of new capacity came on stream in the fourth quarter in China, mainly in domestic demand. If you look at the projected numbers that are out there, there is something like another 3 million tons of capacity to come onstream throughout 2012. And when you're in a market that has something like 29 million tons of capacity, that's a fair amount, it's roughly 10%. Whether all that comes onstream or not, we really don't know. Some of it may do, some of it may not, depending on what the economic conditions are like. In Turkey, I really don't know at this point. I've seen so many different conflicting numbers about what they're doing. Clearly, Turkey is expanding, as you saw they are expanding, but to what degree, we don't have a good handle on that right now.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Harrison from First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I was hoping that you could comment maybe in a little more detail on what kind of pricing traction you're getting in on the lithium front, on the primary side and the specialty side, particularly after we turned over the new calendar year and some of your contracts rolled over.","D. Michael Wilson","Mike, this is Michael Wilson, and we did get significant price increasing in lithium, really across the portfolio of products. To put it in sort of a relative perspective, we saw the highest increases on the lithium salts, which were in the primaries area. And somewhat to a lesser degree on the downstream organics, like butyllithium. As you may recall, however, we had announced more significant increases on the primaries than on butyllithium.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And have you guys had any impact from adverse weather in Argentina that may have pushed out your lithium expansion timeline?","D. Michael Wilson","Nothing really significant. We had talked mid last year about some operational issues we had related to weather. We did see high precipitation at the end of 2011, late in December, early January, but nothing of significance that's affecting the expansion timeline.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And can we get an update on the potash processing capability at your Lithium operation. Is that something that's up and running yet or is that something that's part of the outage that's going to happen in the first half?","Mark A. Douglas","Actually the potash project will be completed later in 2012. It will be completed sometime in the second half of the year, probably in the third quarter. And we'll begin production beginning of fourth quarter in the current timeframe.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. Now quick one for Kim, just on the tax rate. Should we assume that you're also seeing lower cash taxes in addition to the lower book rate?","W. Kim Foster","Mike, this is Kim. The answer is yes, and we think it will be sustained.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I've got one in ag. When I look at the margins both on your long-term target and kind of how things have moved and the margins came in maybe a little bit lighter than what we were looking for in 2011 and below your kind of longer-term target. Now you highlighted a lot of investment expenses, but I guess it seems like a lot of the investment is acquisition of licenses and small companies, which shouldn't, I don't think, go through the P&L. So I guess, can you walk us through what expenses tied to growth in that segment are actually running through your P&L and help us to understand that?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. A couple of things, John. First of all, ag had a -- saw an increase in raw materials. And we are increase pricing, I think we can say, in BioPolymers, that we covered the raw material increase with price in ag. We do have a one or two quarter lag. So there is a lag in between the price increase and the contract we have, and the raw material cost increase we've been seeing which has been impacting slightly our gross profit. The number two reason for EBIT margin decrease are below the line cost. We keep on -- we have increased our spending even this quarter end. So over the year, in R&D and the technical field in general. And also we had this quarter expenses, which will linked to the acquisition we took. We had to mobilize resources to go through due diligence process and go through the acquisition which had an impact. So it's external growth, acquisition, it's technical investment in R&D, and it's the lag on raw material. We should see that getting back in line with the target very quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Reitzes from Broad Arch Capital.","Robert Reitzes","I just have 2 kind of pedestrian questions. One, based on your numbers that you're forecasting, you guys should generate, in this coming year, 2012, about, it looks like over $300 million -- around $300 million of free cash after dividends and CapEx, is that fair?","W. Kim Foster","This is Kim. We guided, as you know in the call, about $200 million to $225 million. And below what you may see if you were thinking of capital spending being largely in line with D&A, but our capital spending is going to be about $100 million to $125 million above our D&A, and that's what would give us the slightly lower free cash flow number. I don't know how you calculated your...","Robert Reitzes","Okay. Well, I just took -- anyway, the second question is just a point of clarification. What did you say your EBIT target was for 2015?","Pierre R. Brondeau","For 2015, organic plus external, we have a target of $1.2 billion in EBIT. Of this $1.2 billion, $1 billion is the target organic growth.","Robert Reitzes","You have $1.2 billion. That's almost double where you are now, is that correct?","Pierre R. Brondeau","That's correct.","Operator","Mr. Brondeau, please continue.","Pierre R. Brondeau","All right. Well, I want to thank you very much for your time. We had what I view as a very strong 2011. We have a very high confidence that we are going to deliver another very strong 2012, with earnings in between $6.70 per share and $7.05 per share, a 15% increase. And we are intending to demonstrate that we're going to start with a very strong first quarter. We're going to keep on doing that, not forgetting that we want to strengthen our portfolio with external growth. And do that small acquisition, but smart and highly strategic acquisitions, to continue our journey to deliver a target growth for 2015. ","I want to thank you, again, for your attention.

Phone lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's first quarter performance, and then discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2017. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and the 2017 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call.","Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will then join to address the questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. FMC has had a strong start of 2017. A previously announced transaction with DuPont, which we will transform FMC into the fifth largest agchem company globally, and significantly enhance our R&D capabilities, remain on track for a Q4 close.","And we are pleased to announce solid performances of both our ag solutions and lithium businesses in the first quarter, reflecting FMC's competitive position. I will focus on the performance of these two segments today and will also provide a few more thoughts on the acquisition, in particular, what we expect from the business immediately after the transaction closes.","Turning to slide 3, FMC reported revenue of approximately $600 million, which excludes $177 million of revenue attributable to Health and Nutrition. Adjusted EPS was $0.43, which excludes approximately $0.21 attributable to the reporting of Health and Nutrition in discontinued operation. On a like basis, with our initial guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share, adjusted EPS would have been $0.64, which is $0.09 or $0.16 \u2013 $0.16 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Later on this call, Paul will walk through how the move to have Health and Nutrition to discontinued operation impacted adjusted EPS in Q1 and how it impacts our full year guidance assumptions. For the full year, we have amended our adjusted EPS guidance to reflect the removal of Health and Nutrition and now expect to report adjusted EPS of $2.20 per share to $2.60 per share.","To be clear, this guidance excludes any earnings from the acquisition of the DuPont business that we may benefit from in the last few months of the year. Before I get into specifics regarding our Ag Solutions results, let me start with a market update.","As you may recall, when we gave guidance in February, we talked about how we saw the market performing by regions. We saw North America down from the prior year, in Europe flat to slightly up. For Asia, we expected an improving market with mid single digit growth and in Latin America, we expected to see improved market performance, primarily benefiting the second half of the year.","We expected the bulk of the revenue and earnings from the two Northern Hemisphere regions to be delivered in the first half of the calendar year and noted that the timing of sales between Q1 and Q2 was difficult to predict. North America remains a difficult market and our review of the market hasn't changed.","Europe has gotten off to a slow start, especially in the large Northern markets where the weather has been poor. We now expect the European market to be flat to slightly down in 2017.","In Asia, we have seen even more favorable conditions than expected in Australia so far, which we expect to continue, and I'm now slightly more bullish on the region as a whole than we were three months ago.","In Latin America, we are pleased with what we have seen in the region with a large selling (6:23) crop enhancing grower finances, improved fundamentals in areas such as sugarcane and cotton, and lower inventory in the channel compared to the same period last year. We are therefore confident today that this market will grow as we head into the second half of 2017. In the context of these market conditions, let me now move onto FMC's performance on slide 4.","First quarter revenue of $530 million was down 3% compared to the same quarter last year and earnings of $83 million were up 1%. This is a significant improvement over where we guided for the quarter. However, it appears to us to be mainly a shift in timing from Q2 to Q1. As I will discuss later, we feel confident confirming our full-year guidance as a result of this strong quarter and overall solid market in Asia and expectations of a strong Latin America season in the second half of the year.","Overall, we believe that our strategy of maintaining discipline on price and terms, and limiting credit risk while pursuing top line growth only where it makes sense for our business is the right one. We see opportunities in Asia and Latin America and we will act responsibly in pursuing those opportunities continuing to balance earnings growth with earnings quality, credit risk and cash flow generation.","Turning to slide 5, I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions regional performance starting with North America. Revenue increased 1% in the quarter, ahead of our expectation. These reflect a shift of demand from Q2 to Q1, rather than improvement in conditions for the market as a whole. Distributors and retailers in North America continue to purchase pre-herbicides earlier, and we have seen this in the strong performance of our Authority brand.","In Latin America, sales were down 6% compared to last year. Mexico has performed well, despite the challenges from the movements in the peso against the dollar. We continued to grow in Latin America outside Brazil and our move to direct access in Argentina has been a success. In Brazil, we continue to be encouraged by the benefits of our decisions to focus on collections and drawing down customer inventory. Compared to the same time last year, we believe channel inventory of FMC products has declined by 35% and by over 50% since the end of 2015, which sets us up well for the Q3 and Q4 selling season. And as Paul will comment on later, we are seeing strong cash collection performance in the region. However, I will remind you that Q1 and Q2 are relatively quiet periods in Latin America for us. And we remain focused on conditions heading into Q3 as a predictor of our performance in the region.","In Europe, revenue declined from last year by 14% in the quarter. Much of this was timing as Northern Europe started slowly as well as some impact from the strengthening of the euro. For the first half of the year, we expect revenues to be slightly down, largely due to this currency headwind. European markets are an important focus for FMC and we are very happy with our performance given our country, crop and product mixes.","In Asia, revenue increased 19% in the quarter due to favorable conditions in Australia driving strong demand for herbicides and successful launches of new rice herbicide in China. In Indonesia, we saw increased demand for rice insecticides as favorable weather extended the rice growing season. We continue to expect that Ag Solutions 2017 revenue will be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billon, which is roughly flat to 2016. Our view on segment earnings is also unchanged with segment earnings of $410 million to $450 million, an 8% year-over-year increase at the midpoint.","Earnings performance will be driven largely by improved mix, new product introductions and lower operating cost, which will be partially offset by FX headwinds. We expect continued margin improvement with high teens margins for the full year. We expect second quarter segment earnings in the range of $80 million to $100 million, with mid to high teens segments earnings margins. This will result in a first half of 2017 that is slightly down compared to the first half of 2016, with earnings decline in North America and Europe offsetting increases in Asia and Latin America.","Our implied guidance for the second half of 2017 is for year-on-year earnings growth in the high teens percent. This reflects the improvement in conditions in Brazil that we have already discussed as well as an improved pricing and lower cost, particularly with regard to factors such as aging, bad debt and product returns. In addition, the restructuring of our market access model in Argentina will continue to deliver significant additional opportunities in the second half of 2017 compared to 2016.","As you see on slide 6, Lithium delivered another strong quarter. Revenue of $66 million was up 9% as lower volumes were offset by improvements in prices in both product and customer mix. Segment earnings increased 45% from Q1 2016 to $22 million in the quarter as significantly higher prices and improved mix offset headwinds from lower volumes. The lower volumes were caused by reduced carbonate sales as we continue to divert carbonate to China for the ramp up of the new lithium hydroxide facility. Segment earnings margins was 33%. Approximately 11% of Q1 revenue was generated from the sales of upstream products, like chloride and carbonate, and this will decline to around 8% of second half revenues.","As you know, we have built two new 4,000-ton lithium hydroxide units in China this year. And we are well into customer qualification processes. Our quality and application testing shows the hydroxide we are producing in China is equivalent to the hydroxide that we produce in Bessemer City. We believe that our customers will reach the same conclusion, allowing us to move to commercial sales by the start of the third quarter.","It is these additional hydroxide sales that will drive most of the growth in the second half of the year, when hydroxide is expected to represent over 50% of the segment revenue compared to about one-third of first half revenue. We expect lithium segment revenue in 2017 to be $325 million to $365 million, an increase of over 30% at the midpoint, driven by a combination of increased volume and higher prices. The combination of increased hydroxide volumes, higher prices and improved mix as well as greater confidence of the timing of full commercial operation for hydroxide expansion, gives us the confidence to increase our guidance for full year segment earnings to $100 million to $120 million.","This represents over 55% growth at the midpoint of the range. We also expect to achieve the low 30%s earnings margin percentage for the full year. We expect second quarter segment earnings in the range of $19 million to $23 million.","Let me spend a few minutes on where we see the Lithium business going in the near future. As we stated in March, it is our firm intention to separate Lithium into a standalone public company and we will continue to assess the appropriate timing. There are two factors driving our decision on timing. First, practically speaking, our organization is focused on the successful integration of the DuPont acquisition and we do not believe it would be wise to distract ourselves from this in the next 12 months or so.","Second, we believe that we need to further develop key areas before pursuing a separation. The first of these areas is the Phase 2 expansion of the lithium hydroxide operations. Our first phase has gone extremely well. The units have come online quicker than planned and at a lower capital cost. As I mentioned earlier, our tests show that the product produced is equivalent to that produced in Bessemer City. So, we have very high confidence that we can pursue Phase 2 when the market demand warrants it. And in this regard, the rates of growth of hydroxide demand continues to be greater than the rate of increase in capacity.","As a result, we expect starting Phase 2, we will add a further 12,000 tons of capacity across three separate units. All three of these units will be online before the end of 2019. We will give more details on the timing, the cost, and the locations of these additional units later this year.","A second key area is securing the carbonate supply we need to serve our downstream operations. Today, we are not exposed to the market price of carbonate in any meaningful way. In the second half of 2017, when the two additional hydroxide units are in full commercial operations, only about 5% of our revenue will be generated by sales of carbonate as we will use the majority of our product internally. As we look to continue to grow our hydroxide capacity, we recognize the need to secure reliable cost effective supply of lithium carbonate, and we have always stated that we will pursue multiple paths to do this. Our agreement with Nemaska to buy 8,000 tons a year of carbonate, starting in late 2018 is an example of one path we will continue to explore.","A second path is to produce more carbonate from our existing facility in Argentina. We have therefore initiated a program of debottlenecking and other small capital investments that will increase our carbonate production by 4,000 tons a year by the end of 2018. These investments will require less than $30 million in total capital.","The third path we are considering is a significant expansion in capacity at our Argentina location. This location is one of the lowest cost producer in the world, and we have started the process of assessing the doubling of capacity through a major expansion there. We are progressing the engineering work and are in discussions with local authorities regarding this investment. We expect to complete our analysis on the economic merits of such an investment this year and we expect to announce our plans including timing, capital cost and total capacity to be added before the end of 2017.","Moving briefly to slide 7, which summarizes our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. On a consolidated basis, our guidance for second quarter adjusted earnings is a range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. As I mentioned previously, we are maintaining full year earnings guidance for Ag Solutions, while raising it by 10% at the midpoint for Lithium.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Pierre. Clearly, our results this quarter are impacted by the move of the Health and Nutrition segment to discontinued operations. The Health and Nutrition segment itself delivered operating earnings in line with our prior guidance range. The move of these results to discontinued operations impacts our results in three primary ways: first, the segment operating income is excluded from our adjusted earnings per share and will be excluded for the entire year; second, a portion of the interest expense, around a quarter of it will be allocated to discontinued operations until the transaction closes; and third, the tax rate now reflects only the tax rate on the earnings of continuing operations, that is Ag Solutions and Lithium.","This tax rate on continuing operations earnings is much lower, since the Health and Nutrition earnings are taxed at a higher rate. We expect it to be in the 12% to 15% rate for the full year. For those who wish to reconcile our adjusted EPS back to the guidance range of $0.50 per share to $0.60 per share for the quarter. And as Pierre mentioned at the start of today's call, that on the same basis as t guidance, our adjusted EPS would have been approximately $0.64 per share for the quarter or 16% above the midpoint of our guidance range.","Moving onto cash flow on slide 8. As with the income statement there is a large impact of the move of Health and Nutrition to discontinued operations embedded in here. In the first quarter, we lose around $50 million of reported operating cash flow as a result of reclassification.","And for the full year compared to our prior guidance, almost $250 million of the $350 million reduction is related to the move of the business out of continuing operations. To be clear, the majority of this cash will still be received by FMC during our ownership of Health and Nutrition through the end of October, and our net debt balances will reflect that cash collection.","Regarding Q1, overall cash collection was seasonally strong for FMC. As you know, Q1 has historically seen a large cash outflow driven by the Ag segment and we have been working to reduce that outflow over the last few years.","Last year, we benefited from a one-off early collection in North America, which we chose not to repeat this year. Once you adjust for this item, our Q1 operating cash flow in Ag Solutions was roughly flat with Q1 2016. In Lithium, we saw a small reduction in cash flow despite higher earnings related to a build in inventory associated with the start-up of the hydroxide units.","Our focus on Brazil collections continues to pay off with Q1 cash generation in Brazil up over 50% compared to the same quarter last year. Equally important, the quality of the remaining receivables continues to improve. Total past due receivables continue to fall in dollar terms while the collateral we hold against the receivables whether in forms of crop liens or other legal claims continues to climb as a percentage of total balances.","Supporting the comments Pierre made earlier regarding the Latin American market, FMC is heading into the Brazil season in four or five months' time with a far healthier balance sheet than in either of the last two years. For the full year, we expect to see continued benefits from the reduction in receivables in Brazil, reflecting the healthier financial condition of many of our most important customers. However, against this we see two headwinds that will result in full year operating cash flow for Ag Solutions being lower year-over-year.","The first and largest factor is a planned build in inventory for sale. This reflects our view, that there is a real possibility that demand will be greater in Latin America and parts of Asia than we have seen in recent years, and given the long supply chains in our business, we do not want to find ourselves short of products to meet that demand.","This inventory build should be viewed as an insurance on our part in the event we are being overly cautious on demand in these markets. The second factor is our expectation that prepayments in North America may be lower in 2017 than 2016, reflecting the reality of the market conditions in North America.","The net effect of these three items is a reduction in cash flow for the segment of around $100 million, compared to 2016. Foreign currency had a somewhat limited impact on our earnings in the quarter with the real particularly stable compared to recent volatility. The one area that we did see some impact in the quarter was in Ag Solutions in Europe, as the euro strengthened against the dollar, creating a small headwind to both revenues and earnings.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Paul. As I mentioned at the start of the call, that I would give some more thoughts on how we view the performance of the business we are acquiring from DuPont. A couple of weeks ago, Paul shared with you some modeling assumptions and we thought it would make sense to update you on where we are on those assumptions today.","As you can see on slide 9, we continue refine each line item in our model, reflecting work our financial, commercial and integration teams are performing. We remain confident in the numbers we presented to you in late-March and our underlying assumptions as to what will drive the increased earnings have not changed. We are starting to look at weather range estimates to some of these numbers, particularly in areas such as the potential for earnings growth in 2018 over 2017. We also are starting to refine our estimate of the accounting treatment of certain items, particularly taxes.","Clearly, the item that we are most focused on refining is the year-over-year earnings performance of the acquired business. Given today's market conditions, we have been quite cautious in our assumptions as to earnings growth. We have assumed a lower rate of revenue growth than was presented to us by the seller. We believe this is the right approach to take until we own the business and can therefore develop our own views as to the near-term growth potential.","The same is true as to our assumptions on cost synergies as we have not yet quantified the short-term cost synergies impact versus the acquisition-spending model. The end results remains clear, however. We expect an increase in earnings per share over the $1 per share in 2018 as a result of this transaction.","In summary, we feel very good about where FMC is today. Our current Ag Solutions business delivered a good Q1 on the back of a strong performance in Asia and North America. We are reaffirming our full year earnings guidance at $430 million at the midpoint, with the growth driven by a strong second half in Latin America and a strong year in Asia.","Lithium also had a good first quarter, and is on track to deliver higher earnings in the second half of the year, as the hydroxide units commence full commercial operations. We are therefore increasing our guidance for earnings for the full year by 10% to $110 million at the midpoint. And we have received very positive feedback from our customers, shareholders and employees on the announced transaction with DuPont, which will fundamentally transform our position in the global crop protection industry and bring greater clarity to the FMC investment story.","I want to thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will go to Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","This is Ben Richardson sitting in for Don. Thanks for the question. So, just on the issue of sales timing and sales being pulled forward from the second quarter into the first. Is it the case that, given the wet conditions in North America and Europe, you might see sales pushed now to the third quarter?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","So, I think we're facing a situation which is not surprising. You've seen that with many of our competitors. We've said that also in the previous earnings call. We have a difficult time today under the current market condition to exactly understand the timing at which customers are buying. And it seems like in this market and you've seen that with many of our competitors, lot of our customers decided to make purchase of pre-emergent products in the first quarter rather than the second quarter.","I think, we are trying to think more in term of first half and second half. So, the first half is going to be very much in line with what we're expecting in total, but with a shift in North America from Q2 into Q1. Europe is also pretty much in line, except that there was a slow start with cold weather in the Northern part of Europe.","H2 is still the same, we don't see any move to Q3, Q4 from the first half of the year and H2, second half is very much for us based on the strength of our Latin America and Brazil market. Actually, on the (33:41) side, Mark and I, we were in Brazil last week. It feels very, very different than it did a year ago. We met with our sales organization. We met with customers. Discussions are strong. Confidence is strong. If you look at what we need to meet our objective in the second half we believe that last week, which was the last week of April, we already bought half in the book, half of the orders we need to do our second half, which is much better than where we used to be in previous years.","So a first half, which will be pretty much in line with what we are expecting with a tough market in North America, despite the very strong first quarter. And a second half, which is looking very good right now, with what we have in hand in Latin America and Brazil. And across the entire year, a very solid Asia.","Mark, you may want to add something on customers, Latin America.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No, I think what Pierre said is exactly what we saw, the customers are \u2013 obviously, they've come off a bumper crop, so they have cash. As Paul commented, we saw better cash collection that's indicative of the way they feel about their business today. We feel very good going into the second half of the year, both in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Mexico, we performed well in those two countries, which are growing for us. But overall, I think we are very solid on Brazil. Obviously, it'll be interesting to see how the North American market develops in terms of yield as we go through this year, but I can tell you, Brazil for us is in much better shape than it was. And we talked about this a lot over the last few calls, so if you looked at our growth rates over the last 18 months, we've been lower and we've been unwinding our inventories deliberately in the field so that we could get to this position where we had a good forward view, and that's exactly where we are.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","So, as a summary, only surprise so far this year, if I can call that a surprise, we're potentially expecting it is movement in North America from Q2 to Q1. And the other positive is we feel stronger than we felt in a long time around Asia, Latin America and Brazil.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. And are you seeing a tail from any Cheminova synergies? Are those done or do we still have any to come here in 2017?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","I think all the hard synergies are done at this point. We talked a lot about that over the last few calls. I think where we're starting to see and continue to see is opportunities with some of the active ingredients and formulations that we acquired, we're seeing progress in North America on fungicides and also in Europe with fungicides and insecticides. Latin America, distribution is helping us, continues to help. So, yeah, I think we're very much where we said we would be, and more to come in terms of growth from the active ingredients.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Excellent. Thank you much.","Operator","And we'll go to Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good morning.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Pierre, I was wondering if you could go back and give us a little bit more color on operations in Argentina. First of all, it looked like costs were a little bit of a drag in the quarter, can you comment on that? And then I just wanted to make sure I understood that in Argentina you're pursuing a debottlenecking effort that's going to cost you $30 million and would bring on 4,000 metric tons of new material, but then you're also considering a bigger expansion down the road?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","That is correct, Mike. So, cost in Argentina is nothing to be worried about. You see that every year, it is very seasonal, depending upon summer, winter, and rainy period in the towns. We do have quarterly changes in manufacturing cost very often, hitting us in a quarter, which is not the quarter where the challenge were or the conditions were because of the way you are accounting for manufacturing cost, but it's just the seasonality of the manufacturing cost in Argentina.","You are correct, you got it right, we are right now working on debottlenecking and we have a strong certainty that the spending of $30 million will drive to an increase of capacity by 4,000 tons by the end of this year regarding \u2013 at the end of 2018. We are also considering the possibility to double the capacity of Argentina with a full-blown expansion we would do in the same location where we are currently producing lithium carbonate. We are doing the pre-engineering work now. We believe we'll come to conclusion sometime end of the third quarter or fourth quarter in terms of the spending the timing, the exact capacity and we're currently in discussion with the authorities in Argentina.","That would be roughly an additional 20,000 tons of lithium carbonate. So, if you think about it, today we're in the 18,000 tons range, we're adding 4,000 tons, we'll take it to 22,000 tons and then we're considering doubling the capacity.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thank you for that. And then question on the Ag Business. Just going back to this North America issue where you're seeing pre-emergent demand being pulled forward, but still sounds like channel inventories are still elevated in some areas. Can you help us understand kind of where you're seeing the inventory channels still at higher levels and how you expect that to play out over the next several months?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Mike, certainly on insecticides, we see inventory levels are high in insecticides. We've \u2013 I think as most people know, there's been low pest pressure in North America the last few years. So that's an area that we've been focused on. For us, pre-emergents get used very early in the season. So, yeah inventories are high now, but they should be because product needs to be moved to the field. So that's normal where we would expect it. We're not a big player in fungicides, so I can't really comment on that. It's an area that's growing for us. Assuming, we have pest pressures this year, I would expect to see insecticides come down, but it may take more than one season to get us back to normal levels.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go to Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. It's clear that Asia remains a solid opportunity for you guys, but can you just breakdown any other key trends pertaining to the recent product launches in China as well as any similar initiatives in Central or Southeast Asia or even Australia. Just trying to get a sense of how you should perform versus the market in the next two years to three years. And then also any comments on how we should think about Rynaxypyr, adding Rynaxypyr to your Asian portfolio. Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Chris, China has \u2013 the market has been difficult in China. I think a number of people have commented on that over the last month or so. We saw a great success with a new product that we've launched for rice herbicides, weed resistance in rice continues to be a problem. We've had good success there. I see that continuing as we go through this season and into the next season, the team is very focused on that.","I would also say an area that we've highlighted before is plant health. These are micronutrient products, biostimulants. We have invested a lot in China and other parts of Southeast Asia and we're starting to see the benefits of those investments pay off.","Other parts of the region that we should look for Indonesia, we have very good rice exposure there, markets doing well, the weather was good. So, we saw an extended season. In Australia, really it's a herbicide play for us with some insecticides, weather conditions have been good. I suspect over the next few years, you will see us grow faster than the market in Asia.","With regards to Rynaxypyr applications, obviously we're still learning that business, but given the scale of Rynaxypyr in Asia and our markets to, and our channels to market are very strong. I would expect to see growth with Rynaxypyr in Asia over the coming years.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And just another long-term question, over the last two major crop protection acquisitions, you've diversified yourself from a regional sense and also balanced both your insecticide and herbicide portfolios. But on the fungicide front, just how are you thinking about your owned portfolio, you have a few in the pipeline, I guess, you have four or so in discovery from DuPont. So just from a strategic sense, how should we think about this in your kind of intermediate to long-term total solution offering to growers? Thanks.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. It is a focus, we've talked about it a lot. Our pipeline, we have two fungicides coming from the pipeline that launched \u2013 our own pipeline, that launch in 2020.","Obviously with the acquisition we are making and the discovery capabilities that we will have, fungicides will be an area of focus for us. We will also look as usual to partner with other people who have fungicide active ingredients from a technology standpoint. So, I mean, all areas are of a focus, but more so than most will be the fungicides piece.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Awesome. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Good morning, Frank.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, Pierre, couple of questions on the DuPont transaction. One is, do you guys have some visibility on how the portion that you are going to acquire performed in Q1 and the expectation for that here in Q2 relative to what your expectations were? As you mentioned, I think you said that you were expecting \u2013 you are forecasting a lowered growth rate. Is there anything that was indicative of what's happened so far this year that leads you to that conclusion.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Frank, we don't have visibility at the level of the product line growth. As you know, we manage the business very independently. The comment we are making is through the process of buying the product lines from DuPont, we got their historical numbers and their forecast for the years to come based on historical numbers in the market. And DuPont tends to look at product lines like Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr as long as those products are under patent protection to be mid-single digit to high-single digit growth rate, pretty much regardless of the market. So we have not, in any of our projection and in the model we have here, come close to this right now. The only thing we have factored is a low single-digit growth rate more as a placeholder. But our numbers we have in the model are more conservative than numbers they have been able to demonstrate in the past or they have in their future forecast.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'm stunned that DuPont's investment bankers would try and project a very rosy outlook for their products, that's absolutely stunning. But on slide 9, just staying with the DuPont transaction and adjusting the incremental EPS for 2018, what \u2013 can you update us on your thoughts on the synergy side between \u2013 for that transaction?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes, Frank. Once again, this number we have here is pretty much of a placeholder. The synergies \u2013 it's a very different type of synergy process than what you usually experience when you do an acquisition. Pretty much, we're going to get a couple 1,000 people coming \u2013 from 2,000 people coming from DuPont. Think about that as 1,000 people in manufacturing, 500 people in technology position and 500 people in commercial. Very few back office people finance, IT, supply chain or communication et cetera. The question is we have a model, which we presented, which had a 16% to 18% SG&A spend. The question is how many people will we have to add in addition to the TSA, which will result in our 2018 spending and that's what will create the synergies. We don't believe at all that we will need to add as much cost as the one we had factored in the acquisition model, which was based on a standalone business.","But we have not yet defined the delta between the cost we have in the model and the number of people we will need to operate the business by November 1, when we close on the acquisition. That's what will create the synergies, those are easier synergies to create than when you do a Cheminova where you have to let go people and it takes time. Those synergies hit you right away, but we just don't know the number yet.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey guys. Nice start of the year there.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Pierre, I think you guys talked or Paul might have mentioned that, you're building inventory \u2013 just in case demand is a little bit better in Asia and South America. Are there any particular crops or areas that you think could come in better that the inventory is being built on or is it fairly across the board?.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I'll make a couple of comments and then have Mark adding on. I think, we worked a lot to lower the inventory of our product in the channel and it's starting to show significant result. Plus I have to say that the financial conditions of the growers in Brazil with the soybean situation have improved and our trip last week was very telling in term of the potential demand.","If you look at the orders we have in hand, at this point of the year for what we need to accomplish in the back end of the year are much higher than what we had in previous year. All of those indications are leading to a potential strong Brazil and Latin America season. This is why we are looking at building inventory to face a demand, which could be at least what we're expecting potentially better.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Mike, herbicides is a key focus for us given when we get into the later part of the year, obviously, we're looking at inventory builds for the future North American season. Obviously, Brazil is well on the way by then, and then looking at Asia, and especially Europe. So, herbicide is a big focus, also fungicides from the Cheminova portfolio, also a focus for us. And then selective insecticides in certain parts of the world, Brazil being one and Asia being the second. So, it's across the board, but with more emphasis on herbicides.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And a quick follow-up, on slide 9, you gave us $1.09 to $1.41 incremental EPS for 2018. Just to make sure that excludes potential synergy and a low growth rate for DuPont's business that you're buying. What does it assume for just kind of ag crop protection, recovery, growth for the industry?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","What we decided to do, if you look the line before last, which has 2018 incremental pre-tax earnings. We have set as a place order again, and we feel it's a conservative number, we agree we \u2013 anybody could challenge us on this number. We've put a $50 million to $80 million of earnings growth. If you think about it, it would be a $30 million, $40 million of synergies, a $30 million, $40 million of top line growth, which would mean minimum synergies and low-single digit growth rate in a fairly flattish market or a low-single digit growth market. So those are very conservative assumptions. We intend to refine that as soon as we have our hands on the business. So what you could expect from this $50 million to $80 million. The part which is cost synergies, we believe we'll have that sometime in the third quarter. We will know better this number. The part which is business growth, it will be more once we have our hands on the business toward the end of the year.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And we'll go to Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning. Just wanted to sort of get back on the Ag business a little bit, but obviously when the first quarter guidance was provided, there was a talk of pull forward into the fourth quarter from the first quarter. But it sounds like you've also experienced a pull forward from the second into the first here. So, I guess, the explanation or the interpretation is that the second quarter is going to be a little bit weaker. Is all of this timing sort of transitory or is the market evolving as we go through this or. I'm just trying to understand kind of all of these pull forwards from quarter-to-quarter and whether or not they are just related to this season and this weather or whether this is something that we look forward to next year, we should be cognizant of?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think, those movements are very much North American movements in a market where there is a difficult situation from an inventory standpoint. And I think growers are making the decision to buy the product they absolutely need to buy. They tend to buy those earlier to secure the product, and buy then at the last minute the product which are not needed early. So, I would say, what we've seen depending upon the market situation, inventory and we tend to reason to think more in term of adds of years or in crop season, then we really tend to think in term of calendar quarters. And that's something we've seen more and more over the years. When the markets are very strong, then we tend to buy early. When the market become a bit more challenged, people buy when they have to buy and you see those kind of movements.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So, I guess, does that mean that the pre-buy indicates that there is a little bit of a stronger expectation for the market?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","No. I think it's for pre-emergents, it's just timing of the crops and they want to make sure for the product, which are required early in the season, they have those on the shelf. But it doesn't mean it creates a lot of expectations that the business will be stronger in North America.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And as a follow-up just on the lithium really quick, I mean obviously you're scrambling as quickly as you can to build out the lithium hydroxide capacity and covert as much of carbonates to it as possible. What happens to this market, as everybody is sort of trying to follow that playbook? What happens to the supply and pricing, and sort of the service in the butyllithium and some of these other derivatives that are not going into the sexy EV part of the business, but are still critical to the market segments where they do go? Is there a danger that those markets will get shorted or is that a good thing?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Hi, Dmitry, it's Tom. Yeah, the market has been recovering from being short for probably going on 24 months now, starting to see a little bit more balance in the products that everybody can supply. The way that we're approaching this is to very specifically target applications that we want to serve and most of that is on long-term contracts.","So, we're identifying the demand, locking up the demand and building the capacity to do that. And as we do that, as we ramp up our hydroxide production, these debottlenecks that are taking place in Argentina, it's not one big project, it's a lot of small projects. So, the 4,000 tons that Pierre spoke about earlier, we'll get more than half of that or at least half of that to more than half of that by the end of this year.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. I just want to understand some of your commentary on lithium, as it seems like you do have a lot of opportunities on the go, whether expanding some carbonate, expanding hydroxide in different places, spinouts, versus a month or so ago when you talked about some of the options of spinning out the Lithium business, has your thought been that this could take a bit longer? Because you think you have more on the table, looking at the supply\/demand for carbonate and hydroxide, looking at what you can do that maybe there is more things that you can do in this business before looking to spin it out. So, has your timing delayed a little bit out of some positivity in the business or maybe give a little color on that? Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think there is no fundamental change to the timing. We do not want to be in a situation, where we make a decision to spin this business, without most of the key projects being on their way with a very clear strategy. We are not going to wait, for example, to have the doubling of the carbonate expansion in Argentina finished to spin the business. But we want to make sure that we have total clarity when we \u2013 when we're going to be on a road show for this business to become a standalone company, we'll have a full story around capacity. So, what we believe at this stage is we should be able to make a decision, as we said before, toward the end of 2018 or early 2019, but there is no change to what we said before.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here at the end. On a regional basis, are you seeing any pressure on CP pricing given the ongoing lighter volumes and elevated inventories, again, in certain regions? And I get that that's going to be product specific. And then also, are you seeing any pressure on pricing in the channel? Thanks.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Brett, it's Mark. Let's quickly run around the world. In Europe, not a lot of pricing pressure. We're seeing improved margins in Europe mainly through our mix. We've gone through a lot of portfolio rationalization. So, things are looking reasonably good in Europe.","In Asia, overall, pretty good, less channel inventory pressure with the exception of, I would say, India right now. Everywhere else is looking good. In Latin America, currency has been pretty stable. So, pricing movements have been limited. Hopefully, the currency stays stable as we go through the rest of the year. So, not so much there. Obviously, price \u2013 a significant price increases in Mexico given where the peso has been moving. And then, I would say, North America, yeah, there is pricing pressure in North America. We talked about how the market has inventory in the channel and growers are under pressure. So, I would say, around the world, it's pretty balanced with the exception of North America.","Operator","Now, we will go to the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much. Maybe question for Tom, just trying to understand better the competitive dynamic in the hydroxide battery markets. I guess, specifically, is there something different or unique about your own hydroxide versus the growing production in China from the Australian spodumene base production, is there a threat to your business there? Is there an opportunity for you? And as you change to an external lithium carbonate supply, does that complicate matters for you? Thanks.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah, Bob. Thanks for the question. Our product does perform differently than the competitive products. If you look at the applications we are targeting there is really two producers who have been capable over a number of years of serving that application and we are able to use multiple inputs of carbonate in order to produce the products we make. So they see a benefit on the production of the cathode material and we expect that to continue.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And Pierre, if I might, since those before me snuck in a second one. In Argentina, you're mentioning spinning the business. Is there a limitation and can you explain a limitation to a sale of the business there?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","So, the only reason for which we want to spin the business versus a sale is purely tax. It is the fact that we have a very low tax base for our Lithium business, I think it's about a $100 million. So if you look at potentially the value of this business, looking at where the EBITDA could be in next couple of years, it would be a very significant tax bill. So, we believe the best way for us to return the value of this business to the shareholders is a spin.","Now, shareholders after that could decide whether they want to keep or sell the stock, but we believe it's more responsible to spin and not to pay such a big tax bill.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Perfect. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. You mentioned a couple times about pre-buying or just some sales shifting from the second to the first in North America. I was wondering, if a similar scenario could unfold in South America and Brazil in particular?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No. I don't think so, I think the market in Brazil for us, especially as we said is a lot stronger. I think what you have to realize when we talk about this subject, in North America the difference between buying in March and buying in April is very dependent on conditions and of course that's Q1 to Q2.","The same thing occurs in Brazil, September is a very large month, but so is October. So, you can have flow between the two months, which is a very short timeframe in the ag space, yet it falls in different quarters. So, I think you've got to be careful of how you look at this, but I fundamentally don't see any reason why we would see a shift from Q4 into Q3 in Brazil in particular.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","It is something and we'll have the same comment when we'll come to Q3, Q4 guidance, most likely for Latin America, we're going to give numbers, but we're going to make the same comment. There could be shift from Q4 to Q3. I think today, our level of confidence for Latin America and Brazil is the highest in a long time, but as Mark said, a Q4 to Q3 or Q3 to Q4 movement is still possible. What we believe is H2, H2 to H2, it will be a high teens growth, that's what we have in the forecast. How it will then flow between Q3 and Q4 is still to be defined.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then you \u2013 we've talked extensively about your big push into fungicides and just expanding the product portfolio. In the future, would that include maybe moving into biologicals or is that kind of too far outside the core business or just too different to consider via M&A or just organically growing into that field or putting R&D towards that?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Laurence (sic) [Dan] (1:03:38), we are already pretty significantly into biologicals. We have an alliance with Chr. Hansen that we've been running for the last three plus years very successfully. And we have products in the marketplace. We consider ourselves already in biologicals. We have about nine new microbial biologicals in the pipeline, expect those to come to market within the next two years to three years. But yeah, microbiologicals are a very much part of our portfolio as we go forward.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","And our last question will come from Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, just two quick ones on the DuPont transaction. The manufacturing assets you're acquiring with that. Do you have any updated thoughts about how you can optimize your supply chain. Is there a possibility to shift some of your total active ingredient production into these sites and save on cost that way? And secondly you definitely have been spending some or trying boost your working capital efficiency. So I am wondering how that program fits in as you acquire these DuPont assets? Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","It's a highly regulated industry, so over the long-term owning large assets like the one we have plus our network of processors would allow us to do, to think strategically about a subtraction in where we make product, but there is not much options you have in the very short-term because of product registration.","And you know, re-registering a product could take anywhere from two years to five years, and depending upon, and the manufacturing location matters in the registration process. So in the long run, yes, in the very short term, if you talk about the next two years, there will not be a lot of changes in places where we manufacture a product.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","The working capital, I think we're going to be \u2013 we're going to be pretty much on the same track as we are today, it's a very high focus. We don't believe that the acquisition we did from DuPont is going to fundamentally change the work we do. One good thing about working capital is the situation where we can rebuild. As you know we discussed DuPont retaining the receivable. So we're rebuilding that, so we're starting with a blank sheet of paper allowing us to do that in a very organized way, and maybe not falling in the traps we fell in a few years ago. So no fundamental change, maybe more flexibility for a very structured approach to it.","Operator","And speakers, I'll turn it back to you for closing comments.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Thank you.

Mr. Angeli, you may begin.","Brian P. Angeli - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Roxanne, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's fourth quarter and full year performance, and then discuss the outlook for 2017. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2017 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call.","As with our prior calls, Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, President, FMC Health and Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will join to address questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references, and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. Reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to, Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In 2016, FMC continued to focus on execution. We consistently produced earnings in line with our expectations, and delivered 14% growth in our EPS. The actions taken over the last two years have improved our visibility into the business, and positioned FMC to deliver significant earnings growth in 2017.","In Ag Solutions, we focused on maintaining price and terms and took a disciplined approach to volumes in the face of elevated channel inventory levels, matching sales to market demand. Despite headwinds from Omega 3, Health and Nutrition delivered another year of strong margin and cash flow. Lithium increased its earnings by 200% by executing on its downstream-focused strategy and taking advantage of favorable market conditions.","As we enter 2017, we expect each of our businesses to deliver growth in segment earnings, and for FMC to deliver adjusted earnings per share of between $3.20 and $3.60, an increase of 20% at the midpoint of the range. I will provide details regarding our outlook later on the call. But first, I will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 performance, starting with FMC's full-year results on slide 1.","FMC reported revenues of about $3.3 billion in 2016, roughly flat to reported revenue for 2015. However, adjusted EPS increased 14% to $2.82 as a results of 180 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, which was driven by a combination of higher prices, favorable mix and lower operating costs.","Fourth quarter revenue was $866 million, an increase of 4% compared to the same period last year, as revenue growth in Health and Nutrition and Lithium was offset by lower revenue in Ag Solutions. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 was $0.88, 14% higher than Q4 last year, largely driven by the significant increase in segment earnings across the businesses.","As you can see on slide 2, FMC delivered significant growth in reported segment earnings and adjusted earnings per share in 2016. Segment earnings increased by $79 million (5:48), driven largely by Ag Solutions and Lithium. The increase in segment earnings more than offset higher corporate expenses and taxes in 2016, driving the 14% increase in adjusted EPS. I will comment further on each segments' fourth quarter performance, starting with Ag Solutions on slide 3.","Fourth quarter 2016 revenue declined 6% to $618 million in line with the market, and mainly due to lower sales in Latin America and Europe. Despite the decline in revenue, Ag Solutions delivered a 25% increase in segment earnings, to $127 million in the quarter. The increase in segment earnings was driven by regional mix, with higher sales contribution from North America and Asia, and by our ability to defend pricing in Latin America despite the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Segment earnings margin improved by over 500 basis points to 20.6% in the quarter. This marks the first quarter since we closed the Cheminova acquisition that Ag Solutions segment earnings margin has exceeded 20%. We remained confident in our ability to return segment earnings margin to above 20% on a full-year basis.","Overall, we continue to execute very well in the context of a strategy that focuses on maintaining discipline on price and churn, and limiting credit risk, while pursuing top line growth only where it makes sense for a business.","Turning to slide 4. I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance, starting with North America. Revenue increased 8% in the quarter, but declined 6% for the full year. The quarterly and full-year performance in North America was in line with our expectations at the start of the year. The increase in Q4 revenue was driven largely by strong early season demand for FMC's Authority brand pre-emergent herbicides. Returning of sales in 2016 is consistent with the trend that we have seen emerging over the past two years.","Growers in North America are generally purchasing pre-herbicide earlier, while deferring other purchases until later in the crop seasons. In Latin America, sales declined 13% in the quarter, and 21% for the full-year. Lower volumes in Brazil and FX headwinds from the Mexican peso drove the reduction in revenue in both the quarter and the full year.","The lower volume in Brazil was a direct result of two decisions made by FMC, rather than lower end user demand for FMC products. First, we allowed inventory in the channel to reduce. Second, we were very disciplined with regard to credit exposure. As expected, the disciplined exercise on volumes allowed FMC to defend price and maintain terms despite FX movements. Combined with lower operating costs, we delivered a significant increase in segment earnings in the region for the quarter and the full year.","In Europe, revenue declined 17% in the quarter as a result of FX headwinds and lower volumes. Sales activity in Q4 is generally limited as the primary sale season in Europe is in the first half of the calendar year.","For the full-year, sales were down 12%. The shift in timing of sales closed by a move to direct market access model across Europe and product rationalization, each contributed to the decline in full-year revenue.","In Asia, revenue increased 8% in the quarter due to a strong winter crop in Australia, and strength in Indonesia. Full year revenue fell 6% on the back of softer demand in China, and directions to reduce channel inventories in India, following two years of drought.","As we look forward to 2017, our expectations of market conditions remain unchanged from what we saw in November. We continue to expect on a U.S. dollar basis, the global crop protection chemical market to remain flat in 2017 creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solutions than we have seen in the last two years.","However, we expect the market in North America to remain challenging. Continued elevated channel inventories combined with low commodity prices will result in more cautious purchasing decision by growers. In Asia and Europe, more normal weather conditions should lead to an improved demand environment next year, although we expect FX to be a headwind.","In Latin America, we expect the market to be up slightly. Based on what we saw in 2016, we have higher confidence that the 2017-2018 season will see increased demand across the region. We expect Ag Solutions revenue will be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion, which is roughly flat to 2016, as lower sales in North America will be offset by increased demand in other regions.","Segment earnings are expected to grow to $410 million to $450 million, an 8% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Earnings performance will be driven largely by improved mix, new product introductions and lower operating costs, which will be partially offset by FX headwinds. We expect continued margin improvement with margin of approximately 19% for the full year. We expect first quarter segment earnings in the range of $60 million to $70 million with mid-teens segment earnings margins.","As we mentioned earlier, grower in North America are increasingly purchasing pre-herbicides earlier and delaying other purchases until later in the growing season. We anticipate similar buying pattern in 2017, and will remain disciplined around when we sell products, allowing sales to fall in the quarter in which growers demand it. As we have seen in recent years, Q1 will contribute to lowest revenue of any quarter, but we still expect sales over the 2016-2017 North America crop season to be roughly flat.","Turning now to Health and Nutrition on slide 5, which delivered fourth quarter results that were in line with our expectations. Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $177 million. The 3% year-over-year increase was due to higher sales volume of Health excipients in Asia and Nutrition ingredients in both Asia and Europe. Segment earnings increased 17% to $54 million driven as expected by lower costs, this was largely the results of lower manufacturing costs as noted on our Q3 call.","For 2017, we expect Health and Nutrition to deliver full-year segment revenue of $750 million to $790 million, which is an increase of 4% at the midpoint. Increased volumes of MCC based products are driving most of the year-on-year increase as we ramp up production at our MCC plant in Thailand.","Segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million in 2017, an increase of 2% at the midpoint. We expect segment earnings margin to be the same as 2016 at around 25% as cost savings achieved in 2016 will offset the cost of bringing our new MCC plant online. For the first quarter, we expect earnings in the range of $45 million to $50 million.","As you see on slide 6, Lithium delivered another strong quarter. Revenue of $71 million was up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 as higher prices across all product groups were offset by lower volumes in the quarter.","A decision to direct lithium carbonate to a lithium hydroxide start-up process resulted in lower volume in the quarter. Segment earnings nearly doubled to $21 million in the quarter due to higher prices and improved mix. These factors combined to drive an increase in segment earnings margin to 30%.","In 2016, approximately 75% of our revenue was generated from the sale of downstream products by managing our sales mix and capturing price increases across the portfolio, our revenue per LCE in 2016 increased approximately 25% compared to 2015.","FMC Lithium is well-positioned to deliver another year of significant earnings growth in 2017. Demand across our key downstream market continues to grow with most contracts in place for 2017. Sales of downstream specialty product will comprise about 90% over 2017 Lithium revenue. This largely insinuates us from volatility in prices for lithium carbonate and chloride.","We expect Lithium segment revenue in 2017 to be between $315 million and $355 million an increase of over 25% at the midpoint, driven by a combination of increased volume and higher prices.","Hydroxide expansion will result in a significant increase in volume in 2017. Our expansion remains on track. We have produced several trial runs of material and are putting this material through internal quality and performance tests. We expect to begin offering product to customers for qualification testing in the coming weeks. Based on the product to-date, we remain confident that we'll begin commercial sale in July 2017.","The combination of increased hydroxide volumes, high prices and improved mix is expected to deliver a segment earnings in the range of $90 million to $110 million. This represents over 40% growth at the midpoint of the range. We also expect to achieve earnings margin of about 30% for the full-year 2017. We expect first quarter segment earnings in the range of $18 million to $22 million.","Slide 7 summarizes the 2017 outlook for each segment as we discussed earlier, and shows we expect adjusted earnings to be between $3.20 and $3.60 per share. We expect the 2017 quarterly earnings guidance to be similar to what we saw in 2016, driven by returning of Ag's sales in North and Latin America, and the ramp up in lithium hydroxide production. First quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.50 and $0.60.","I will now turn the call over to, Paul.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Pierre. As usual, let me start with the income statement before I move on to cash flow and the balance sheet. First tax, our adjusted effective rate for the year was around 22.8%, broadly in line with our expectations. Since, we were accrued a 23.5% for the year-to-date, this resulted in a slightly favorable impact on our Q4 tax rate, although clearly not as large as we have seen in prior years. While lower than guidance, the tax rate compared to Q4 2015 was a drag on our earnings of around $0.12 per share.","Looking into 2017, we expect that rates to fall into a range of 16% to 20% for the full year. As I discussed on our last call, this is mainly due to the impact of the full integration of Cheminova, a large European business, into our supply chain, combined with our current view as to what our regional earnings mix will look like in 2017.","Touching on currency next. For full year 2016, across all businesses and regions, currency was a small tailwind to earnings compared to 2015. Favorable movements in Brazil were partially offset by the weakening of almost every other major currency in our business, most notably the euro and Mexican peso.","Almost all of the tailwind occurred in Q4. Looking into 2017, we would expect, based on current forward rates, that currency will be a drag of as much as $45 million on our earnings, almost exclusively in Ag Solutions, and spread across multiple currencies. This headwind is factored into our guidance.","Let me also give a few comments on the higher guidance for corporate expenses in our 2017 numbers. We are guiding corporate expenses to be approximately $10 million higher than in 2016. As you know, FMC allocates almost all centrally-incurred costs to the business results. And therefore, all of the savings we have achieved from Cheminova integration are reflected in the segment level results. The remaining corporate costs reflect only those costs which reflect the cost of managing a publicly listed company that we've historically not allocated to the segments.","For 2017, we have approximately $10 million of non-repeating costs related to various programs which will give immediate benefits to either segment earnings, cash flows, or the corporate tax rate. Some of these programs commenced in Q4 2016 and all of these programs will be completed in 2017, with the benefit starting to accrue in late 2017.","Moving on to cash flow on slide 8. We delivered adjusted cash from operations, $561 million. However, this included a decision we made in the fourth quarter, as markets moved in our favor, to take advantage of an opportunity to annuitize our remaining UK pension obligation. By injecting $21 million into this fund, we have now removed all future funding requirements and eliminated a significant annual management cost of this exposure.","Without this item, our full-year adjusted cash from operations would have been at the high-end of our Q3 guidance range of $550 million to $600 million. Even after this payment, we delivered a 55% increase in cash generation compared to 2015, with higher earnings, stronger working capital performance and tighter spending discipline, all contributing to the year-on-year increase.","In 2016, we collected almost $700 million of outstanding receivables in Brazil. While this is solid progress, we saw no signs in Q4 that the credit tightness being felt by our customers is easing, and we remain cautious about extending further credit to some of our customers through additional sales. This lack of broadly available credit is the reason that the receivables balance in Brazil remains higher than we believe it should be, and we will continue to bring the same focus and discipline to collections in 2017 that we did in 2016.","Based on our current visibility, we believe that we will reduce the current balance further in 2017. We reduced net debt by almost $250 million in 2016, ending with an adjusted net debt to EBITDA of approximately 3 times. We will continue to manage our debt to a level that is consistent with our current credit rating.","Looking into 2017, we expect our capital expenditure to remain similar to 2016, just ahead of depreciation, allowing for our planned expansions in lithium hydroxide. This does not include any capital investment decisions that we may make with regard to a significant expansion of our lithium carbonate capabilities, which is something we are analyzing today.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Paul. Despite the challenging Ag market conditions, we believe that our 2017 plan is very achievable. It relies on things we control, rather than expectations of positive external events. We expect to deliver earnings growth in each business, and strong EPS growth of 20% for the whole company. The strategy of each business is aligned with its respective market conditions.","We expect revenue and earnings growth in our Lithium and Health and Nutrition businesses, and we will continue a very disciplined approach in Ag Solutions to ensure earnings growth while positioning the business strongly for the eventual upturn in that market. We expect, in 2017, the same predictability of results for the company than we demonstrated in 2016.","Thank you for your attention. And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much. Good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good morning.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Pierre, I was hoping you could talk maybe about what you see as the path, in terms of giving up some volumes in order to tighten up your margins and improve the credit profile? When do you start to lap that? When will we start to see your underlying volumes echo more of what's going on in the end markets?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think, at this stage, we believe that it is very important to do two things; let the sales happen in the quarter when there is the demand, and be very disciplined around potential credit risk.","I do not see us lightening that behavior in the next six months. I think we are still observing the market. There is multiple signals and feedbacks, the market that we could see some signal of an upturn for the 2017-2018 season, especially driven by Latin America. So if I will have to pick a date where we will be more focused on a top line growth in line with market, and maybe a less prudent approach to market, I would say, in the back-end of the 2017.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you. And then briefly, your carbonate sales, you mentioned that those upstream sale is only a quarter of your portfolio, yet there was a pretty big volume decrement. Does that mean, you're filling the pipeline, and we should get the benefit of those carbonate volumes converted to hydroxide sometime in 2017?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. So what happened in the fourth quarter are two things. First of all, just to make sure we would have the volumes needed for the start-up of the plant. We put in inventory, some carbonate just to make sure we were fully prepared to load the plant as soon and as fast as we can, the hydroxide expansion, that is one.","The other one, which is more important from the volume impact in Q4. Last year, we had quite a few sales of \u2013 resell of third party, we would buy product, convert what we would need to hydroxide and whatever we would not need for hydroxide, we sell on the open market for carbonate.","The problem in the fourth quarter, if you look at the differential between which and which (30:34) we could buy this carbonate, and we sell it, even make it very valuable from an earnings standpoint. So all of our focus was to line up the volume of carbonate with what was needed for a downstream business. So those were the two key reasons.","From a benefiting of the carbonate sales going into hydroxide, yes, you will see that in the second half of this year where we have a significant volume ramp-up of hydroxide coming from carbonate.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Perfect. Thanks for the help.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. You hit on this a little on your prepared remarks, but can you just give a little more color around the shift in your sales in Europe within the Ag segment, and comment just generally on the materiality of the shift, and how it's potentially incorporated into your 1Q guidance? And then also, is there any other region where this could potentially occur throughout 2017? Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Chris, it's Mark. Yeah. Well, as we've gone through this direct market access model in Europe, we're seeing movement, you saw it in Q4, you'll see some of it in Q1. But really, it impacted the 2016 numbers.","We get back onto a more normal run rate in 2017, with the exception of one final country, which is France. It's the last direct market access, we'll be putting that in place towards the end of this year. So we might see a little bit at the end of the year in France, but essentially, it will be done as we move through 2017.","We haven't really put a number on the size of that, although clearly, that was a significant reason for what you see in 2017, along with FX. FX is a number in 2017, Q1 that is a reasonably large number that's impacting Europe. I don't think you're going to see that anywhere else in the world. We're pretty much finished with all our direct market access movements.","If you watch the press, we've purchased our joint venture in China, and also in Argentina as we went through the end of last year. So, we're pretty much done in terms of the rest of the direct market access.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. And just a quick follow-up actually. Just on the product rationalizations in LatAm and Europe, can you just give us some general color of the magnitude and the cadence of those efforts? I mean, is that mainly something that's going to appear in the first half?","And then also, just any general thoughts on how the rationalizations are going to be netted against the launch of some of your new molecules over the next few years and how that flows eventually into longer-term margin guidance? Just any broad thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. (33:19) we've done a lot of work over the last 18 months on rationalization, it's coming to an end. I think, we'll see less of it as we roll through 2017. There's still some inventories to be sold as we go through the process.","New product introductions; we have about 40 new products to be introduced in 2017. Obviously, that's the first year of those products being sold, so the revenue is smaller than it will be at peak. Those products in many formulations, new mixes that we have for our proprietary molecules, tends to be herbicides and fungicides.","And then, obviously going forward in 2018, we have the launch of our first of the platform molecules and then that rolls through all the way through 2023. We have netted that out against the rationalizations that we've seen already. We've set our pipeline has a peak sales of about $1.5 billion in revenue, that still holds true. So you will see that potential new growth coming through as we go through the rest of this decade.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","To give you a sense of product rationalization, as Mark said, we are getting to the end of the process now. But if you look back, we have walked away through this process in 2015 and 2016 of annual sales of $461 million, of which 63% were in Brazil. So it was a very significant move.","One of the reasons for which, and besides the careful approach of the market and the already-increased risks and the timing, I think we moved away from $461 million of annual sales. It's a big chunk, 53% in Brazil, 12% in EMEA, and 11% in Asia. I think we're seeing the end, which could make us more aligned with market growth in the future.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's a very helpful color. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison, Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good morning.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Pierre or Mark, could you maybe talk a little bit about this trend towards increasing Q4 sales of pre-emergent herbicides, and then the fact that you would see delaying in purchases of other chemicals as the crop season progresses, what does that mean for business, and what does that tell you about the market, and is this trend here to stay?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Let me make a color on the first half of the year; and then I'll let Mark comment on the move towards early pre-emergent. The way we look at the market today for North America, we are trying to give a quarterly breakdown, but for us we tend to look at it more on a seasonal basis.","So we're giving two numbers, one for Q1, one for Q2. But we are looking more at a six month time period, and for this time period, we believe sales would be shifting more towards Q2, but frankly, you we could see $10 million shifting from Q2 into Q1, and that's Q1 higher by $10 million and Q2 lower by $10 million. That is what we are seeing today, more of a trend for the post, not the pre-emergent market, within the season to value really when you need them, but all depending upon price of commodities and confidence, you can see (37:13) that shifting.","So the number, and I know as a public company, we have to talk about quarterly numbers. It's fair game. But look at the numbers as a six month, knowing that you could see $10 million shifting from one side to the other. And Mark you want to talk about the pre-emergents?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Mike, I think one of the things that we see is distribution and retail are prepared to hold inventories of products that they know they're going to move and they know they're going to need early in the season, hence, what we've seen on the pre-emergent side.","You think about our market share in pre-emergents. We've grown that share over the last seven to eight years. And we have about 28% of the market in North America now with our Authority family of brands. So distribution and retail know those products are going to move, so they're willing to put them in place earlier, hence we've seen that shift from Q1 to Q4. I would expect to see that to continue as we roll through to the next few years.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you. And then, another question on the Ag business. Just looking at the cost structure overall, I'm wondering if there are some typical costs, things like merit pay increases, incentive comp, travel expenses that you've been holding a lid on during 2015 and 2016, and those costs are going to be higher this year. And if so, what would be the magnitude of those higher costs?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","No, we're not expecting costs to be higher. I think via the cost controls which have been put in place, are mostly cost synergies which have come to us with the integration of Cheminova, those are very sustainable. We believe, we have a right sized the organization, and we're not expecting at all to have to make any significant changes on our cost structure.","As you've seen in the numbers, we will increase earnings by 8% in the Ag business in a flat market. The only place where we are looking at a temporary cost increase is what Paul talked about, which is at corporate costs, because we do have programs which will have a fast payback around SAP, systems and taxes, for example which knowing that we are heading towards a decent year, we have good visibility for 2017, I think, we feel very much in control, we believe it was the right time to put those program in place, which will pay dividend quickly as you could see on the tax rate.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Daniel Jester, Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good morning.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So in Brazil you spoke about drawing down your own inventories, and you can talk about that for a while now. So can you give us any sense as to where you believe your inventories are relative to an old part of the cycle, and sort any comments about sort of industry-wide inventories in Latin America. Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think we're in a good place right now. We worked very hard on the \u2013 managing the inventory level in the channel. I would say, Brazil and Latin America we're expecting for FMC, with all the work we've done, and we're going to keep on doing in Q1 this year, that's going to be the bright spot of the business in 2017. That's why we're having good expectation.","We are at the right level, I don't think we need to further control all over our inventory. We still have work to do in North America, don't get me wrong. But I believe, we are in good shape in Brazil and Latin America right now to be able to push sales at a normal rate. (41:23) cautious around credit risk, but beside that we are feeling quite confident, and the numbers should show it in Q3, Q4 this year.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then on Lithium, you've spoken today about sort of the benefit of hydroxide pricing, but I think you were out last year with a price increase in (41:45) so, any update on that?","And then, as you become more downstream in your Lithium business, does that change the seasonality of your profit margins? I know in the past, third quarter has been sort of a weaker quarter, but as you go more downstream, does that change that seasonality, as we model out 2017? Thank you.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Daniel. This is Tom. On the pricing question, we are expecting to grow our revenue per LCE again. We grew, as Pierre had mentioned earlier, by 25% year-over-year this year, and we expect to grow another 20% going into next year.","Hydroxide's going to be the bulk of that, other specialty products like metals are also above the average (42:31) at a higher price point, and some of the other specialties that are at a higher price point will be kind of lower than that average, but it will go up year-over-year.","As it relates to seasonality, the specialty product portfolio is very stable. It really isn't a sales seasonality, and it never was in the first place. The seasonality we are continuing to improve, but that's more of an operational improvement process. As we continue to improve efficiencies and reliability in Argentina, we're improving seasonality to the extent possible.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think what is important for us in our move towards more specialty and downstream is, we have way less exposure to the variability of pricing depending upon supply\/demand. You see \u2013 and you could see in 2017 around carbonates and chloride. The seasonality, which is due to our operations in Argentina, the fact we are 12,000 feet, and the winter season, that we'll have to live with, we're trying to improve our operations, but we'll have to live with from a cost standpoint and production standpoint in Argentina.","But the big, big benefit is really the fact that, by moving all of the carbonates into a downstream, we have much more visibility, with most of the contracts signed by now, by 2017. I would say the only variable we have this year is to confirm, which we are doing today, that our plant's going to start to have commercial sales of lithium hydroxide, a new plant in July. But beside that, everything is pretty much set.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitsch, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, everybody. Paul, you mentioned that material decline in the tax rate and it was driven by your regional expectations on where the profit's going to grow in 2017. Can you expand upon that a little bit more?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Sure, happy to. Ultimately, when we acquired Cheminova, and we did talk about this at the time, it creates \u2013 I wouldn't say an opportunity, but the truth is a requirement to realign our supply chain to reflect the fact that we now have a larger business, Mark talked earlier about a direct market access business.","Just bear in mind though, historically, we serviced Europe and sold to Europe essentially from the U.S. Today, none of the product we sell in Europe really touches the U.S. anymore. And so, we're more aligned with the physical flows. And what that does is, change essentially where we recognize profit around the world, tying it more closely to the reality of how we operate our business.","And so, this is not a tax planning program per se. It is a tax benefit of the supply chain integration that we've been doing linked to the Cheminova integration. In fact, some of the extra corporate spending and some of the work we'll be doing in 2017 just reaffirms that point. It's realigning where we invoice from. It's realigning our SAP systems to reflect those flows, and the impact is that we do tend to recognize more profit in the future in lower tax jurisdictions, because we're making more sales in those regions.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So it's primarily an expectation of generating greater profitability in Europe, is the simple answer, correct?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Correct.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. And then I should ask the obligatory question, Pierre, regarding your most recent thoughts on possible participation of FMC in some of the divestitures that may be mandated as part of the mega Ag mergers that are going on there. What are your current thoughts on your possible participation there?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","We are still very attentive to what is going on, listening to the process. I think we've seen that most of the companies involved in the mega mergers are all having discussions with antitrust authorities. We believe it will result in opportunities, so at this stage, it's a very high priority for us to watch what is going on and stand ready, if we have an opportunity which makes sense for FMC. But we would like to participate if we can.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Perfect. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn, Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that, perhaps, were addressed previously. On the Health and Nutrition, you were expecting sort of pretty decent results to both the top line and bottom line. You talked about MCC ramping up in Thailand. What other drivers are there of both your growth expectations on the top line, as well as your ability to preserve margin on the EBIT line?","Eric W. Norris - FMC Corp.","Hello, Dmitry, it's Eric here. So, I'll answer that question. On the top line, it is, as you referenced already, it is MCC that is a driver for us. The Rayong plant in Thailand is ramping up, that is serving largely the food marketplace today, and that market in Southeast Asia remains robust. China remains steady. We see it steady going forward. And so, that's a modest growth there as well. So that's a positive revenue growth driver in the food market.","Another driver that has been with us all year long, and we don't see changing into the coming year of 2017, or this year of 2017, is the growth in the pharmaceutical market, the health excipient marketplace, which again is largely MCC marketplace for us. Those would be the two largest drivers, going forward, for growth in the coming year.","In terms of preserving margin, that's a story that we've \u2013 that Pierre has told, and continues to be a focal point for us. We're bringing on a lot of cost. We're bringing on a greenfield plant. We simultaneously are going through a lot of manufacturing excellence programs to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in every single operation we have, not just our two legacy MCC plants, but also our seaweed-producing plants around the world as well. So that remains a focus for us.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just to follow-up on the tax rate question. Should we be modeling sort of the \u2013 kind of the 20% that you've delivered over last couple of years, Paul, or in light of your comments, we'll be looking for maybe high-teens by the time we get into 2018-2019 timeframe?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","No. We've guided in 2017 for 16% to 20%. That range \u2013 it may be a little wide, but as we go into the year, we'll get more clarity where in the range it's going to come out. We're pretty confident, it will be inside that range in 2017, hence the guidance. I don't see that materially changing. Based on what I know today, but as you know, things can move quick in our business. I don't see that materially changing for 2018 versus 2017.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So, as we sort of \u2013 if I follow your commentary about more and more revenue coming from lower jurisdiction or lower tax jurisdictions; within that range, is it reasonable to assume that you're going to gravitate towards the 16%, 17% versus the 19%, 20% part of that range over time?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","It's a little early to tell, to be honest, Dmitry. It's going to be in the 16% to 20%, obviously depending on the strength of the regional Ag businesses, which is the biggest driver here. A big rebound in North America versus a big rebound in other regions makes a difference to that rate. So at the moment, I feel most comfortable saying that it's between 16% and 20%. And as it becomes clearer to us as we go through 2017 and into 2018, we'll give you new guidance.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, Paul. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Connelly, CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Two things. First, we're seeing quite a lot of M&A and joint venture activity in biologicals, even as all those big stuff is going on. Should we expect FMC to announce more deals or ramp-up spending to keep up there?","Eric W. Norris - FMC Corp.","Yeah, Mark. On biologicals, I think everybody knows that we have a very strong alliance with Chr. Hansen, and we've been investing in that alliance over the last few years. We're starting to see the first products coming out of that pipeline. I'm not so sure that we're going to do any \u2013 what I would call M&A, because we're fully invested in the alliance itself. And frankly, with the liber that we have in the discovery mechanisms that Hansen has as well, we're very, very happy with where that alliance has gone.","So the real investment there is on the pure R&D money, funding scale-ups, funding trials, registrations, et cetera, to get that platform moving. But we're absolutely committed to biologicals, we like where it's going, and we will be committing more R&D dollars to that as we go forward.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Okay, I'll leave that one there then. And second, India is talking a lot about local manufacturing, and we've now had two pesticide companies tell us that they may respond to that push for local manufacturing. I'm just curious, does that have any indirect implications for FMC in terms of maybe freeing up capacity elsewhere that might get you some better deals on your contract manufacturing, or is this too small in your mind?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No. We are embedded in India. We have our own manufacturing site in India where we manufacture active ingredients. We actually have toll manufacturing agreements in India. Our philosophy really on the toll manufacturing side is to have a balanced portfolio around the world.","Obviously, we're heavily weighted towards China right now, has been for the last 15 years. India is a very important market to us. It's a growing market. We are likely to put more formulating capabilities into India. But from a toll manufacturing, we will view India as we always have been, it is a source of active ingredients that can help balance our footprint around the world.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Super. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli, Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Going back to Ag, are you seeing any trends or are you hearing anything about the movement towards less sugar in drinks and everything else we eat? And would that have a large impact on your sugarcane business in Brazil?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Rosemarie, not really. You look at sugar prices today, sugar prices are at a pretty high level. And really given, not that demand is dropping, but supply is being tight given the conditions we've seen in Brazil. And over the last three to four years, replanting in Brazil has been at a very low level. So, therefore, overall production in Brazil has been lower.","We're expecting that in 2017 to 2018 season, that we know we'll start to see planting come back given the high value of sugar in the world market, and the opportunities there are for Brazilian growers. So if anything, I would say we've have been in a bit of a trough in the sugarcane business in Brazil. My expectation is, we should start to see that come out a little bit better in 2017 through 2018.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. So, no real impact. Maybe that is coming five years down the road, I suppose. Looking at what you call not going back to a normal growth rate in Brazil and Latin America, I was wondering what you consider a normal growth rate? And if I may sneak one in, one additional one, how much leverage are you willing is acceptable to FMC in order to participate in the opportunities created by the big mergers?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. Regarding the big mergers, it's always \u2013 we believe we do have financing capacity if we need. It's a matter of what products, what growth potential and how they fit with our portfolio.","So we haven't capped anything or limit our expectations on what FMC could not do. We want to be highly opportunistic. If there is something of interest, which is a high-quality product line or technology which fits our portfolio, it's all going to be a matter of price and return. And if it is there, we'll act.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. And then a normal growth rate, please?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. In Brazil, I mean, you've seen some huge volatility in growth rates in Brazil over the last few years. But if you take the long haul, I would say it's low-single to mid-single-digits in terms of market growth. When we get there, probably later on 2018 into 2019, I think we'll start to see those numbers come through.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question is from the line of Don Carson, Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hello. This is Ben Richardson sitting in for Don. Just wondering about CapEx on an ongoing basis. You're running at $130 million to $160 million, a little elevated versus the year ago. And that given the Lithium expansion and whatnot, wondering what level you see that in the out years?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","So the CapEx of our business, if you (56:33) boil it down to purely non-discretionary, it's probably a little bit behind depreciation or lower than depreciation.","So what we see each year is clearly some decisions that we make depending on market conditions, depending on cash flow expectations of where we want to deploy capital. We have seen a fallback in the last two years, and an expansion in the Ag business as we've had enough capacity, clearly, as the rebound comes, we would want to get ahead of that, and make sure we have enough capacity around the world, particularly in our toller network, and also in our formulation plant.","They are not typically very high capital requirements. The key \u2013 we've invested historically of course in Health and Nutrition business, particularly with the Rayong plant that we've talked about already, today.","As we sit here today, there was a bit of source of spending that takes us above that base level of maintenance CapEx of the Lithium business, and we've talked about the hydroxide expansion and we're spending some money on debottlenecking down in Argentina to free up capacity down there as well.","We'll continue to look hard about what is the right capital deployment particularly into the Lithium business in the next 12 to 24 months, and we'll continue to monitor carefully what we need in the Ag business. They'll be the two places that I think we'll be paying the most attention in the near-term. I'd expect the spending as a result to remain just a little bit higher than depreciation levels for that reason.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And what was the total spend associated with the Argentina debottlenecking?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","So, the spending as we look into 2017 is what we're looking at. It's a relatively small amount of money. It's low double-digit millions in 2017 going into that.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","All right. Thank you for your participation and thank you for all of your questions. We feel confident that we'll deliver on our promise for 2017. I will expect the year to be a no-surprise year of execution in what is a challenging, but more stable and flexible-like market and a very strong Lithium market.","At this point, I want to thank you very much, and hand the call back to, Brian.","Brian P. Angeli - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Pierre. Thank you, everyone for participating. That's all the time we have for the call, today.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Sandifer, Vice President, Strategic Development and Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Sandifer, sir, you may begin.","Andrew D. Sandifer","Thanks, Shannon. Welcome, everyone, to FMC's Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call and Webcast.

Pierre?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night, we delivered another strong quarter, with earnings per share up 20% versus the prior year period, continuing a trajectory to deliver another record year for FMC.","Let me walk you through the company's overall results for the quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.92 per diluted share, an increase of 20% versus the year-ago quarter. Total company sales of $905 million increased $93 million, or 11%, versus last year. The strong performance was led by continued robust performance in our Agricultural Products segment and with sales growth in all businesses. Sales grew most rapidly in Latin America, up 32%; followed by Asia, up 13%; and North America, up 9%.","Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, decreased slightly less than 4%, reflecting principally the impact of a weaker euro. Gross margin of $341 million increased by $42 million or 14% versus last year.","Gross margin percent of 37.7% improved by 88 basis points over last year, driven by higher selling prices, higher volumes and improved mix, only partially offset by higher cost. SG&A and R&D of $148 million increased $18 million, or 14%, largely due to increased spending on targeted growth initiatives. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $127 million increased $16 million, or 15%, compared to last year.","Let's now take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter. First, in Agricultural Products. Second quarter sales of $394 million increased 19% versus the prior year quarter, with substantial sales gain in Latin America and North America. Latin America sales growth was driven by continued strength in sugarcane, growth in soybeans and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina.","North America showed strong demand for proprietary herbicides and higher insecticide sales due to strong pest pressure and growth in the corn segment. Asia and EMEA sales were marginally down versus the prior year period.","Segment earnings for Agricultural Products of $111 million increased 18% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. Another development of note for our Agricultural Products Group in the quarter was the reapproval of bifenthrin for use in the European Union by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. Bifenthrin has long been recognized as a valuable and effective crop protection product by growers around the world. It is a unique, versatile insecticide that works quickly on a range of destructive insects. It will once again be available to growers in the EU, where it will be registered for oilseed rape, cereals, vegetables, ornamental and other uses. FMC will also continue to develop new and innovative formulations for this product, which should lead to increased sales and market shares in key EU markets. Though we are very excited about this news, due to the time line to register bifenthrin across target countries in the EU, we do not expect any sales or EBIT impact until 2014.","Moving now to Industrial Chemicals. Revenue in Industrial Chemicals increased 9% to $277 million, driven by higher selling prices across the segment, especially in soda ash and volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $43 million increased 18% as a result of the sales gains and the continued favorable mix shift in peroxygens towards specialty applications, partially offset by an anticipated production downtime in soda ash.","In soda ash, we continue to see higher overall selling prices versus the prior year. Domestic prices showed continued year-on-year improvements and, as you saw, we announced in July a $10 per ton increase in off-list soda ash prices. As is the case every year, this increase will have very low impact on 2012 results since the vast majority of domestic contracts have prices fixed for the calendar year.","These price increase announcements does, however, form the basis for 2013 contract negotiation, which typically occur in November and December. Export prices overall were also up year-over-year in the second quarter.","In Asia, soda ash prices declined sequentially in the second quarter as anticipated in the first quarter call, following the slowdown in soda ash demand growth in China that impacted export prices in Asia. Soda ash prices in Asia were, however, still up high-single-digit percent compared to the prior year period.","As sales to Asia represent less than 1\/3 of our total soda ash exports, sustained price increases in Latin America and other export markets helped maintain the upward trajectory of overall soda ash export prices. Soda ash prices within China and Chinese export markets are both now at or below Chinese producers' cash cost. In the mid-term, we are confident that prices in Asia will rebound due to a combination of demand recovery and the continued cost pressures related to energy, raw materials, labor and currency appreciation. That said, we expect to see continuing pressure on Asian soda ash prices as we enter the third quarter.","In light of these changes in domestic and export pricing, we now expect our global average selling price for the year to be up in the high-single digits on a dollar-per-ton basis. Soda ash volume was also up in the quarter, but growth was limited by unplanned production downtime at our Green River site. The issues were one-off in nature and have been resolved. Overall, a very positive quarter for our soda ash business.","Moving to our Peroxygen business. Peroxygens delivered sales growth in the quarter with somewhat higher volumes, higher prices and improved mix. We continue to be pleased with the transformation of the Peroxygens business with steady growth in a targeted specialty application in the quarter.","The new Environmental Solutions business, formally launched in May, is well underway. With a focused growing team now on the ground, we're excited about the future contribution of this business to Industrial Chemicals' overall growth goals.","Let's now move to our Specialty Chemicals segment for an in-depth review of our BioPolymer and Lithium business. But for Specialty Chemicals, I'll turn the call now over to Michael Wilson. Michael?","D. Michael Wilson","Thank you, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to review with you the current performance and outlook for our Specialty Chemicals Group. After updating you on our second quarter performance and near-term outlook, I will share some insights on the terrific progress we're making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business. I will also address some of the mid-term issues facing our Lithium business as we continue on our path to delivering Specialty Chemicals' portion of FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan.","First, a review of second quarter performance. Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $235 million, up 3% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by higher selling prices in all businesses and strong volume growth in specialty food ingredients. The revenue gain was partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate impacts from the weakening euro on the BioPolymer business. On a constant-currency basis, Specialty Chemicals sales were up 5% versus the prior year period.","Segment earnings of $53 million were down 6% from the prior year quarter as anticipated, with higher prices across the segment offset by higher manufacturing costs in Lithium, higher raw material costs in BioPolymer, increased investment to support growth initiatives such as the natural colors effort in BioPolymer and unfavorable exchange rate impacts.","BioPolymer delivered another solid quarter, achieving record EBIT. Sales grew in the low-single digits, driven by price increases and stronger volumes, particularly in food ingredients, which were partially offset by the impacts of a weaker euro, affecting mainly pharmaceutical ingredients.","Lithium sales growth was driven by continued price increases as the lingering impacts of the operational issues we faced in the first quarter kept volumes flat and continued to affect costs and efficiencies in the quarter. Combined with the sustained high inflation in Argentina, this led to weaker profitability in Lithium as compared to the prior year period. Sequentially, Lithium profitability improved versus the first quarter of 2012, but continues to be well below our expectations. I will address our expectations for improvement in Lithium in a few moments.","Looking ahead to the third quarter and the remainder of the year for Specialty Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be down approximately 5%. In BioPolymer, higher selling prices and volume growth will be offset by higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives. In Lithium, poor evaporative conditions during the Argentine winter have not allowed brine concentrations to recover from the impacts of the heavy rainfall and flooding in the first quarter as we previously expected. This has limited our ability to exploit the capacity expansion brought online in the first quarter and will result in continuing capacity constraints and higher manufacturing costs through the third quarter.","For the full year, we expect revenue to be up approximately 5%, driven by higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer. We anticipate full year segment earnings to be flat, with sales gains offset by production constraints and continuing cost increases in Argentina and Lithium, as well as higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer.","I should note that while we expect considerable improvement in Lithium earnings in the second half of 2012, with earnings essentially doubling versus the first half, we will not see significant benefit from the recent expansion until the fourth quarter.","Let me now share with you an overview of the significant progress we are making in the strategic evolution of our BioPolymer business, particularly in the area of specialty food ingredients. When we launched FMC's Vision 2015 strategic plan in 2010, we established several strategic imperatives for our BioPolymer business, including 4 specific imperatives for our food ingredients business: invest in core products to strengthen our leadership position, leverage customer relationships by broadening our texturant portfolio, increased participation in higher-growth, high-value added ingredients and expand our RDE position by investing in growth markets.","I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress on each of these imperatives. We have reinforced our leadership position in colloidal microcrystalline cellulose, or MCC, and alginates through a series of capacity expansions in our Cork, Ireland; Haugesund, Norway; and Newark, Delaware facilities. And last week, we announced that FMC's Board of Directors has approved a $100-million-plus investment to build a new MCC plant in Thailand to serve the rapid demand growth for this highly differentiated food ingredient in Asia.","In addition, earlier today, we announced yet another major new development: FMC's entry into the pectin market through the acquisition of Pectine Italia. We have, for many years, explored opportunities to add pectin to our portfolio of texturants as it complements our existing product line well, particularly for low-pH applications. Our technical team already regularly works with pectin in solving specific customer problems. Pectin is a sizable global market, roughly $650 million in 2012 and is growing into high-single digits annually, substantially faster than the overall food ingredients market.","We're confident we can leverage our global market knowledge and deep customer relationships to grow this business into a meaningful product line for FMC, approaching $100 million in the 5-year time horizon. While our initial entry into pectin is small, as with many of our external growth investments, Pectine Italia is rich in technology and know-how. It will provide the basis for future organic and inorganic investments as we build out this product line. Pectine Italia is also strategically located near important raw material sources. We expect to close this acquisition by the end of the third quarter, and we'll certainly share more about our plans in pectin at our December Investor Day.","We are equally as excited about our substantial progress in natural colors. Natural colors is an even faster growing market than pectin. Roughly $750 million in size today, the natural colors market is growing at least 12% per year, or 3x the rate of the overall food ingredients segment. This growth is driven predominantly by the strong consumer pull for more natural ingredients in food products, which is driving a worldwide conversion from synthetic to natural colors.","The natural colors market is currently fragmented, with only 2 truly global players and a large number of local and regional companies who lack the customer access and global reach to fully capitalize on growth opportunities. FMC first entered the natural colors market in late 2011 with the acquisition of BioColor business of South Pole BioGroup, a Chilean-based company that was an emerging technology leader in natural colors. In June of this year, we acquired Phytone, Ltd., a more established natural colors company based in the U.K., which was led by 2 technical and commercial pioneers in the natural colors industry. With both BioColor and Phytone, the previous owners have remained with FMC in advisory capacities as we build our technical depth.","We see tremendous potential for natural colors as a part of BioPolymer's food ingredients franchise. As with pectin, we plan to build this into a $100-million-plus product line for FMC over the next 5 years through a mix of continued acquisitions and focused organic investments in additional manufacturing, commercial and technical capacity.","And finally, as I hope is clear through the various actions I've highlighted thus far, through acquisitions and new plant investments, we are greatly increasing our participation in rapidly developing economies. This is a very exciting time in BioPolymer's food ingredients business, and we have great expectations for this business to continue to be a key franchise for FMC going forward.","However, I would be remiss to focus exclusively on the food ingredients portion of BioPolymer in my comments today. The FMC BioPolymer pharmaceutical ingredients business continues to be an anchor franchise for FMC as well. The MCC capacity expansions and the new Thailand plant that I mentioned earlier will also support continued growth of our pharmaceutical ingredients franchise, particularly our leading line of Avicel brand MCC tablet binders. We continue to build our RDE presence in pharmaceutical ingredients, especially in India, where we will open a new customer technical support lab later this quarter.","Turning now to FMC Lithium. We continue to have high expectations for growth and profit improvement in this business. The global market for lithium, at roughly $1 billion today, is sizable and growing rapidly. We continue to expect robust growth in global demand for lithium from roughly 100,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, or LCE, in 2010 to above 260,000 tons of LCE by 2020, an overall compound annual growth rate of approximately 10%. This growth comes from a combination of sustained low-single digit growth in traditional, industrial and polymer applications, coupled with high-teens growth in demand for energy applications broadly, including electronic devices, transportation and other emerging applications. So the demand side looks very promising for lithium, both in the near and the long term.","On the supply side, we continue to believe the existing industry leaders are best positioned to supply the growing needs of the market. While there's much attention paid to early-stage development projects in lithium around the world, no new source has been successfully commercialized in over a decade as the technical and logistical challenges in exploiting lithium reserves are formidable. The existing industry leaders are situated on the best resources in the world and will continue to have a substantial cost advantage over new entrants. Further, the existing industry leaders have deep technical expertise in the extraction and purification of lithium that new entrants cannot readily develop. And while lithium pricing continues to increase, the likely cost position of many new entrants is such that even with strong price increases, they will be challenged to make a reasonable return on investment.","That said, FMC's current lithium base in Argentina does face some challenges. Putting aside the recent operational issues, which are well understood and being addressed, the biggest obstacle to continued long-term supply growth for FMC is the current political and economic situation in Argentina. While the stand-alone project economics of reinvesting at a proven, existing reserve are compelling, the current high inflation and challenging political\/economic environment make it difficult to commit to a significant investment decision in Argentina at this time.","Consequently, as we shared with you in last quarter's call, we have delayed any decision on future expansion in Argentina through the end of the year as we continue to monitor the situation there. Meanwhile, we're evaluating other capacity alternatives outside of Argentina.","Let me be clear, FMC is committed to the Lithium business for the long term. We have deep technical expertise in both operations and applications and strong customer relationships that support a long-term successful position. And we have multiple options for future expansion, including in Argentina if the situation there improves. We will update you as we advance our future capacity plans, and I expect to be able to provide clear direction on our path forward in the near future. In the meantime, we will continue to work with customers to maintain our leading positions, particularly in energy applications.","So in summary, for Specialty Chemicals, I'm very pleased with our progress in driving strategic evolution of our businesses. We are greatly strengthening our BioPolymer franchise, positioning it for continued strong performance over the long term, and we will maintain our leadership position in the global lithium industry. The outlook for Specialty Chemicals Group is bright, and I'm honored to lead the talented group of FMC employees driving our efforts.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Foster, who will be happy to answer any questions during the Q&A.","W. Kim Foster","Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll report on our free cash flow, the recent stock split and finally comment on our tax rate.","First, as a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after all uses, except acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. We are reaffirming our previous forecast of $200 million to $225 million for the year. As previously stated, the full year free cash flow guidance included -- includes forecasted capital expenditures of $250 million. Through the first 6 months of 2012, cumulative free cash flow has been $153 million, which includes capital spending of $81 million.","Clearly, the pace of capital spending in the second half of the year will be significantly in excess of the pace during the first half. This will include the first phases of the Asia MCC plant project that Michael described to you a few moments ago; completion of the Newark, Delaware MCC expansion; as well as other smaller expansion projects and maintenance projects across all of our businesses.","As I mentioned during the first quarter conference call, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock at the April board meeting. The split was affected in the form of a distribution paid on May 24, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2012. Trading in the common stock on a post-split basis began on May 25, 2012. Consequently, we all need to adjust our key metrics by 2. For example, our previous full year guidance of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share translates to $3.40 to $3.52 per diluted share. And our shares outstanding are revised from 69 million shares to 138 million shares. And, of course, our 3-digit stock price is now on its way back to the 3-digit level.","Regarding share repurchases, our strategy of returning cash to shareholders continues to balance prudent financial policy with the competing demands of investments to support organic growth and the capital to support selected external investments. While we have $245 million of repurchase capacity remaining under our existing board authorization, we made no additional share repurchases in the second quarter as we prepare to fund heavy capital spending in the second half of this year.","Moving to taxes. Let me note that we are now forecasting a full year tax rate of 27.5%, 50 basis points higher than our previous forecast. This increase is driven by significantly higher profits in the United States, largely due to higher sales of ag products in the first half of 2012. The tax rate in the second quarter was 28%, and the tax rate for the last 2 quarters is projected to be 27.5%, which will result in a full year tax rate of 27.5%.","With that, I will now turn the call back to you, Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Kim. And I must say, we are fortunate to have one of the best CFOs in America in our ranks, as recognized yesterday by The Wall Street Journal. Well deserved, Kim.","Before we get into outlook for the third quarter and the full year, I'd like to give you a brief update on Vision 2015 progress. As we begin the second half of 2012, I am pleased to report that we continue to be well on plan toward realizing our Vision 2015 objectives.","First, relative to our key P&L objectives, 2015 sales in excess of $5 billion and EBIT of $1.2 billion. We continue to deliver results at or above the trend line required to reach these targets.","In terms of return on capital, we are delivering results on average invested capital well above our commitment of sustained mid-teens. In fact, return on average invested capital in 2011 was 23.9%, a strong performance, well above our minimum commitment. We continue to show improved earnings stability, especially in our Industrial Chemicals Group, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and impact of actions we took in 2010 and 2011 to exit the underperforming and highly volatile phosphate and sodium percarbonate business lines.","As Kim has highlighted, we remain disciplined stewards of cash with a balanced deployment among organic and external growth investments and return to cash to -- of cash to shareholders. In fact, not quite halfway through our Vision 2015 plan cycle, we have already returned or have committed to return $750 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This is more than half of the minimum commitments of returning $1 billion of cash to shareholder that we announced at the launch of the plan. So from a cumulative perspective, we are making great progress.","Beyond the metrics, we also delivered against our overall Vision 2015 strategic imperatives in the first half of 2012. First, growing our leadership position. As Michael described, we broadened our specialty food ingredients platform with the acquisition of Phytone, Ltd. in the natural colors space and the announced signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Pectine Italia.","Increasing our reach. We continue to increase our participation in rapidly developing economies with sales in RDEs at 25% in the first half of 2012 and sales in RDEs representing nearly 47% of the total company sales for the last 12 months.","Capturing the value of common ownership. We continue to shift from a highly centralized organization to a balanced centralized\/decentralized model that better leverages our size and scale and to act as one FMC where it matters, realizing efficiencies while maintaining stronger contact with our business units. Our global procurement team is making great progress, and we're on schedule to deliver projected cost savings.","Our operations group is also making great strides in building excellence in operations, supply chains and environments, health and safety across FMC. We are beginning several exciting initiatives on the operations area, particularly around manufacturing efficiency improvements. I will share more on this effort in the future.","Proactively managing our portfolio. Industrial Chemicals' portfolio has been an area of focus. We've addressed businesses that were competitively disadvantaged and underperforming for an extended period of time. In 2010, we exited the phosphate and sulfate derivatives business. In mid-2011, we announced our exit of the sodium percarbonate business line, which was completed in early 2012. With these moves, Industrial Chemicals has been transformed into a segment with sustained higher margin, greater earnings stability and significantly higher return on assets.","Finally, disciplined cash deployment, which I updated you on a few moments ago. In short, we are making exceptional progress towards delivering our Vision 2015 strategy plan, and I and the FMC management team look forward to sharing much more detail and context of our Vision 2015 progress and long-range plans at our Institutional Investors Conference to be held on December 11, 2012, in New York.","Moving on to our outlook for the full year 2012. We raised slightly the midpoint of our previous outlook for the full year 2012 and now expect adjusted earnings of $3.42 to $3.52 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of the range. Our Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth consecutive year of record earnings, with year-over-year earnings up in the high teens, reflecting increased volumes, especially in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to strong market conditions and growth from new and acquired product, but partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives.","As Michael described earlier, segment earnings in Specialty Chemicals are expected to be flat for the year. We are forecasting the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer, with higher selling price and volume growth, partially offset by the impact of higher raw materials costs, increased spending on targeted growth initiatives and unfavorable exchange rate impact.","However, segment earnings will be dampened by weak performance from the Lithium business with the operational issues Michael highlighted, as well as continuing cost increase in Argentina offsetting higher selling prices.","And now, Industrial Chemicals segment. We expect earnings to be up in the high-teens percent due to higher volumes and selling prices in soda ash and the third consecutive year of record earnings from the Peroxygens business, reflecting the continued mix shift of that business toward specialty applications.","Now moving to our outlook for the third quarter 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share for the third quarter, a 9% increase at the midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 10% reflecting strong growth in Latin America, especially Brazil, partially offset by continued investment in targeted growth initiative. Specialty Chemicals' third quarter segment earnings are projected to be down approximately 5%, as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating cost in Lithium, as well as higher raw material cost and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. And Industrial Chemicals, we expect third quarter segment earnings to be up in the mid-teens percent, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and specialty peroxygen, volume growth in soda ash and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens, partially offset by a planned maintenance outage in our Tonawanda, New York peroxygens facility.","With that, I thank you for your time and attention. I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, on your ag outlook, I know, last year, I guess there was an issue with a relatively severe drought down in Texas, and that nicked the quarter and the outlook in the middle of last year. This time around, where we've got a huge drought across most of the U.S., we're not hearing really much of any commentary on that, and it doesn't seem like you're actually seeing much in terms of weakness. So I guess what's changed in your ag business? Or what's maybe helping to offset some of the issues that you may be seeing in the U.S.? And how should we think about that going forward?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thanks, John. Yes, if you look for us, the ag market in North America is mostly in the first half of the year. So yes, the drought could impact the third quarter in North America. I mean, we could see some impacts on rescue applications for example. But we really expect this to have a very limited impact. In addition, it's important to remember that we have a very global footprint and that our Ag performance in the second half largely relies on Latin America. So at this stage, we do not foresee a major impact of the drought situation in North America because of what I just said.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then with regard to the -- also sticking to ag, with the reapproval in Europe for bifendal [ph] or bifuden [ph]. Can you give us some clarity as to what that might mean in terms of sales when they do come back in, in 2014?","Pierre R. Brondeau","We -- once again, I want to reiterate the fact that there will be no impact in 2013. We need to have the reregistration process. But it's a multi -- in 2014, it's a multi-ten millions of dollars, which we would be expecting coming from bifenthrin. It's an important product with high profitability.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one last question. When we look at the Specialty Chemicals segment, there's a lot of moving parts between the Newark expansion this year and some of the Lithium issues. And I know 2013 is a ways away. But if we just kind of assume that pricing stays relatively level and the demand volumes kind of stay roughly in line, I mean, how should we be thinking about growth in '13 versus '12? Because it seems like '12 is just unusually kind of artificially low for a whole host of reasons.","Pierre R. Brondeau","If you look at Specialty, we believe that how our BioPolymer business is well established, I think we're going to benefit from the capacity expansion we did in Cork and the one we did in Newark. So this is a high -- a mid- to high-single-digit sales growth business for BioPolymers. And we expect continued growth in this business, which will be even better with the addition of the pectin and the BioColor business. So we can keep on looking at the same time of performance year-after-year we've been having in BioPolymer. Now the big upside for us is obviously Lithium. We do expect to have turned around the performance of the Lithium business during the fourth quarter and not only benefit from better operation, replenished inventory, but also benefit from the capacity expansion. So there should be a significant driving performance going forward, but not in the BioPolymer, which has been stable growth, but by the turnaround of the Lithium business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess a few questions on BioPolymers. First, congratulations on penetrating pectin. I know you've been looking at that for a number of years. Can you speak to the initial sales contribution from the Pectine Italia deal? I think you mentioned it could ramp to 100 million as a category in 5 years. So what might that look like? And then as you broaden the portfolio into both pectin and natural colors, can you speak to cross-selling opportunities in the category?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I think we have -- what Michael said is when we look at those 2 business combined, it would be a contribution of a couple of hundred million dollars in the next 4 to 5 years. Now today, it is a business which sales are quite small. I think the natural colors business is a few tens of millions of dollars of sales, and the pectin business is more on the single-digit million dollars. What we are doing with the Pectine acquisition is truly acquire a plant, knowledge and the process. And we are going to be, from that acquisition, organically expanding that business by increasing our capacity around the world. So it's a step for us to get the product and the technology and the manufacturing capability. And we're going to grow from this. So in the short term, those businesses have a slight dilutive impact on earnings in the next couple of quarters, should become accretive fairly quickly. But it's mostly an organic growth now from acquired capabilities.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, you cited some raw material cost pressures. Is that on the lithium side or seaweed for biopolymers or both? Can you maybe elaborate on the sources of increases there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, the market has been tight. It's mostly in biopolymers, mostly in specialty pulps and -- that we are seeing significant cost pressure.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then final question, if I may, switching gears into Industrial Chemicals. What was the financial impact of the unplanned outage that you had in Green River in the second quarter? And then looking ahead to 3Q, a similar question, what's the anticipated impact of the maintenance outage that you have scheduled there in Peroxygens?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Kevin, we don't go into detail at this level. I would say, for the outage we had in soda ash, it was mostly a problem of tons of product we were not able to sell more than the operating cost. It's a single-digit million dollars impact we see on the business, same range looking at kind of one-time next quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","In the Lithium business, Michael, I was hoping that you could help us understand what specific actions you're taking to get operations back on track. And particularly, how does limiting production, in order to increase your pond inventory, contribute to the long-term health of the ponds or operations overall?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, Mike. As you recall from the discussion at the end of the first quarter, what had happened is we had very unusual rains in the December through February period. So what the impact of that was, was it diluted brine that we have both in pre-evaporation ponds, which is prior to processing, and also our final solar brine. So as we moved into the second quarter, we began to produce more lithium. But because the concentration of lithium in the brine was lower than ideal, that creates a manufacturing inefficiency. You think about the energy that you have to consume, et cetera, I mean, you're processing twice as much water, evaporating twice as much water if your concentration is half of what you would ideally like it to be. So we have sort of suffered through that situation with manufacturing at below optimal conditions and brine concentration for some period of time. And we finally got -- and what we had hoped was that we would see evaporative conditions that would improved that situation over the course of the second quarter. But the reality, as it turned out, was that during the Argentine winter, we didn't have very favorable evaporative conditions, so the brine concentrations haven't improved all that much. So rather than continue to process those brines at low concentrations, we've sort of taken the difficult but necessary decision to scale back production to give the brines time to concentrate so then when we do produce, it will be at an optimal condition, and we'll have a much better cost position for the product that we produce.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And when you talk about limiting production, is it primarily lower volumes of the commodities or primary lithium products or specialties, or both?","D. Michael Wilson","In particular, we've taken an extended outage, maintenance outage, if you will, for our lithium chloride operation. And we're allocating product predominantly to carbonate, which is the predominant feedstock for the downstream products like lithium hydroxide. So as you know, we're sort of preferentially looking at our marketplace and our customers based upon strategic importance and profitability and allocating on that basis. That means that -- that's not to say that we're not still producing any lithium chloride or lithium metal that would be produced from that. But we've clearly shifted the focus of what we are producing, and we're taking that outage on the chloride side.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Right. And then in terms of the Ag business, I know the warm spring weather resulted in some pull forward from Q2, and the view was that we probably, with the warmer weather and early season, might have a bumper crop of pests in North America. Given the drought and just what you've seen through Q2, did customers work through the pesticide volumes that they purchased in Q1? Or were -- is it your view that they were left holding some additional inventories that maybe hurt your volumes in the next growing season?","Pierre R. Brondeau","We're not expecting to see our volumes being hurt. We do not believe. I think they worked more or less through the inventory, and the demand was very strong in the first quarter, very strong in the second quarter. So we do not have worries today about our situation in North America. The strong second quarter, which we saw as a possibility, did happen, and we believe we are in an acceptable situation around the inventory, which is around the supply chain right now.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then last question, just on soda ash pricing. To what extent are you guys able to shift -- or ANSAC, I guess, export mix away from Asia? And you did comment that Asia export pricing was lower quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Can we just get some more detail on how you expect pricing to trend in Asia exports for Q3 and Q4?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think just to correct one statement, I'll let Mark comment around how we shift on that volume from Asia to other markets like Latin America in which -- how can we do that. Just to correct, pricing was not down quarter-on-quarter. Just to make sure, pricing were down sequentially. But year-on-year, our pricing in China is -- in Asia is still up in export. And Mark, do you want to address the -- how do we potentially shift volumes?","Mark A. Douglas","Sure. Mike, it's Mark. We do have, through ANSAC and through our own direct exports around the world, have some ability to move from region to region as demand sees fit. But as you can imagine, a lot of our business is either quarterly or longer-term contracts, so we are tied to some extent. But we do have some freedom of movement. And in fact, if you recall, in the first quarter, we did talk about the export mix for FMC being very favorable. That occurred because we were not shipping to some countries in the world where we have lower prices. So we do have some flexibility, but it's not probably as much as you imagine.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Alright. And just, Pierre, just so I understand, you were saying export pricing to Asia was higher year-on-year but lower sequentially. Lower quarter-on-quarter. Correct?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Exactly. That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Butler from Glen Hill Investment.","Peter Butler","It seems like you have a rather unusually large amount of investment spending and CapEx, et cetera. And I'm wondering whether this is more than you had anticipated in your 2015 goals or targets. And what I'm hoping you're going to say is that the business has been coming along better; the cash flow, better; et cetera; and this has allowed you the luxury of increasing your investment spending.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Well, we -- Peter, the comment is good and is important. Really, we still have a lot of work to do, and we intend to give a full picture of cash utilization toward capital spend and acquisition when we get together in December at our Investor Day. But directionally, what we believe is capital spending will be higher through the period, that what we were expecting initially when we brought Vision 2015 in place for 2 reasons. One is that our business is growing faster than what we're expecting, leading most likely to higher contribution of organic growth toward our target than we initially thought, and the fact that we had significant capacity limitations. So yes, we should be looking at stronger capital spend. I think, this year, we're contemplating $250 million of capital spending, which is higher than what has been done in the past. So it could be, and we are looking to that at a different balance of cash utilization between capital spending and M&A versus where we were originally planning to spend the money. We still have to do some prioritization. As you know, we have big-ticket items coming toward us like lithium expansion or our Granger II expansion for soda ash. So those have to be prioritized and discussed in terms of timing.","Peter Butler","To circle back on an earlier question, could you give us some semi-quantification of -- quantification of the year-to-year costs or the delta you're going to have in Lithium? It seems like you have a lot of issues this year that you feel that are going to be put behind you going into next year. So what sort of delta in earnings might one expect?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Peter, I'm sorry if I missed some of your questions. It's very hard to, for some reason, to hear you, but...","Peter Butler","Okay, I'll -- let me restate. What sort of delta are you expecting year-to-year in your Lithium business? If you're hurting this year in Lithium, and it looks like maybe next year, you could be back above trend. What's the delta in earnings?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I mean, it all depends. Delta in earnings all depends how quickly we turn the performance of the business around in the fourth quarter. But generally speaking, if you look at Lithium, we have all the reasons in the world to believe that the Lithium business is a business which has an EBIT-to-sales ratio, under normal operations, in the 20% to 25% range, like most of our business at FMC. This business this year is operating more into the low-double-digit range than the 20% to 25%. So if you look at what we could expect as an upside, that's the kind of differential.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones, first on BioPolymers with the mix shift. How do you see now the margin -- the margins trending over the next, call it, 3 years?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I'm not sure, Laurence. The importance of the mix shift, if you talk about mostly food, toward the pharma or -- but generally speaking, to answer your question, margins in BioPolymer are trending up.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess do you have a sense for what you think will be sort of the upper limit? Or is the growth going to be 25, 30 basis points a year?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Michael, do you have anything to say? I...","D. Michael Wilson","Yes. I think if you look at -- if you go back to our Vision 2015 plan that we put together, we had margins in the business that were in the low 20s, and we indicated that we expected those to grow to the 25% range by 2015. I think we're still on track to do that. We're obviously making a lot of investments, and I think the acquisitions that we're bringing in are going to bring us the same kind of margins that we have in the business as a whole. So I don't see any reason that it's going to be different than that.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if the current economic environment persists for several more quarters, so we stay in a choppy environment, how long -- what's your read for how long it would take for the soda ash pricing behavior to normalize? That is, for the Asian competitors to switch to allow -- moving prices up above their cash breakeven levels?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think, for us, first of all, even if there is pressure on the business, we are sold out. So we do have a situation where we do not expect to suffer from an underutilization of our assets. From a pricing, today, we are assuming with the context, the economical context we are in, that we're going to see pressure into Q3, potentially Q4. But we believe we are renegotiating contracts going into 2013 with a pretty strong situation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of your outlook for Industrial Chemicals, you reduced it a little bit from the first quarter plus 20 to high teens. Is that largely due to the maintenance impacts that you have versus, let's say, any significant changes in the fundamentals of soda ash near term?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. It's maintenance and operational. Nothing -- no fundamental change. Normal bumps on the road you have when you operate a large facility like the one we had.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. Then in terms of Peroxygens, that continues to be a nice little positive here as you look to transition to more specialty areas. Can you give us an update of roughly where you're at in that strategy?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Mike, it's Mark here. I think we've indicated for quite some time that the mix has been roughly 70-30 in terms of commodity to specialty. I think, where we are today, we're more in the 65 commodity to 35 specialty. So we're well on our way in terms of delivering on our Vision 2015. And I have to say that the specialty applications that we're involved in, they're growing well above GDP rates for many of the markets we're in. So we're seeing a lot of good traction.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And last question, Pierre, when you talked about getting your new pectin business to $100 million plus, can you do that with this business alone? Or will you need to add a couple acquisitions here and there over that time period?","Pierre R. Brondeau","We have a couple of ways to do it. I think the favorite way we have today is to replicate the kind of plant we are buying in other regions of the world, which is more of an organic approach to the growth. We're still looking at a couple of small acquisitions in that field, but acquisitions are fairly uncertain. So we want to look at both ways. We will definitely grow that business, most likely, organically, with building another plant somewhere else in the world. Could take advantage of another acquisition, but it's not absolutely necessary.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Guys, a couple of questions, if I may. First of all, on the crop protection business, you talked about strong North American and Latin American sales, but you saw some weakness in Asia and Europe. Was the European weakness a foreign exchange issue in terms of sales? Or was there real demand downside? And then also, why were sales weaker in Asia?","Milton Steele","Dmitry, it's Milton here. Yes, a part of the answer on Europe certainly was the exchange, lower prices, of course, because -- with Southern European. And in Asia, it was a combination of also exchange and some lower pest pressures. But nothing fundamental to the business.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So there is no -- are you impacted at all in Europe by the austerity programs and lower subsidies from governments to farmers? Or is the European market like the U.S. market, it's mainly dictated by the price of commodities?","Milton Steele","No, that's not the issue, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Secondly, on the Lithium business, when you talked about exploring options for your future capacity expansion, whether in-country in Argentina or outside of Argentina, I'm a little bit -- I'm interested in following up on the line of thought of what you can do if you decide not to expand in Argentina. I mean, do you have current leases that you can exploit in other countries? Or how much groundwork would you have to do to get the business outside of Argentina up and running in Lithium if you had to?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, Dmitry, we're going to stay quiet on this one, because we are in the middle of exploring options. We have a few options we are contemplating, but we will be happy to report on these options and the direction we take as soon as we are in the position to do it.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. All right, fair enough. On the soda ash business, just -- we're seeing a second quarter in a row of declining Asian pricing. Assuming that they are on just -- on this trajectory for a couple of more quarters or even flatten out at this level, you're probably going to get into flattish comps in terms of pricing in the second half of the year and year-over-year basis. Pierre, I think you talked about -- or you just mentioned, an answer to your previous call, that the soda ash businesses is pretty solid as you enter the negotiating season for 2013. But you only had one price increase announcement this year, which, typically, if you read between the tea leaves, indicates that the business is not that strong in terms of pricing realization for next year. Just looking at the global economy and looking at the auto builds of construction, glass demand, so on and so forth, how confident are you in the soda ash business beyond the Asian pricing issue, just overall demand and pricing environment in other parts of the world?","Mark A. Douglas","Dmitry, it's Mark. I'll take that one. You're right, we have had a price announcement for the domestic market, and it's round about its normal time. And when you look at anybody that wishes to follow a second announcement, which we sometimes do, it's usually later in the summer when we do that. So the fact that we've only made one announcement at this point, I wouldn't read anything into that at this time. I would say, secondly, from a demand standpoint, as Pierre just said, we're in sold-out mode, and we have been for some time now. So we're very confident being the world's lowest-cost producer of natural soda ash that we'll be able to place our volume at premiums around the world. I would say, the other thing you've got to remember is North American demand is still some 10% below its peak of 2008. So any signs that these markets come back further from where they are today, it's going to get tighter. So we're very confident moving into the 2013 season that we have pricing leverage.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. All right. That's very encouraging. And then final question, just maybe for Kim. On the working capital inventory, if you sort of look at the inventory turns, working capital as a percentage of sales, both of those metrics have gotten worse year-over-year. I would assume that working capital would get better, as well as inventory, as raw material pricing declines, but you're not as exposed to raw materials as some of the other chemical companies. So sort of what's behind the inventory and working capital inflation we've seen? And do you have any plans? I mean, is this a concern at all? Or is it a part of the strategy? Or kind of what's going on there?","W. Kim Foster","Dmitry, that's a good question. This is Kim. And we have spent -- we spent a lot of time working on inventories. I would like to at least offer to you, if you look, however, on a rolling 12-month basis so you can address the seasonality that we have in our businesses, we don't -- actually don't have deteriorating working capital performance and\/or inventory performance. It's difficult when you take 6 months of 1 year and compare it to a sequential period of time. Having said that, Dmitry, I think the thing, the lesson we're learning on the Ag business, as you've seen, is we've continued to have some upsides realized on our Ag business. And I think you know how that works, which is if you don't have the product on the shelf and you end up having to air express it around the world, there's a lot of inefficiencies in that. And as Milton has mentioned and Pierre mentioned, there is -- we are entering into the Brazilian season. So we want to make sure that we have the right amount of inventories in the right places in our Latin American market.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So you would say that the inventory increases are mainly a preparation for a strong Latin American season. We should see this work down as that season comes to an end.","W. Kim Foster","Right. Dmitry, I'd like to also take, since you asked me a question, opportunity to mention something. Pierre, in his prepared remarks, mentioned that we had returned and\/or committed to return already, in which case he was referring to the dividend that we announced following our July board meeting, which is payable on October, and mentioned a number of $750 million. He meant to say $570 million, which was the amount that has been returned or committed to return since the Vision 2015 program began in 2010.","Operator","Mr. Brondeau, please continue with closing remarks.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you very much. Thank you, all, for your questions. I think we can all see that FMC continued to perform very well in the first half of 2012, with sales up 15% and EPS up 25%. As we said during the question-and-answer, we have begun to see some indicators of overall economic health trending downward slightly. Examples were soda ash, consumption in China and lower hydrogen peroxide volumes in Europe, for example. However, more than 80% of our portfolio is not linked to GDP cycles. We have a limited line of sight on leading indicators for the global economy beyond what we see and hear going into the second half of 2012. We continue to see a strong performance for FMC through the remainder of the year despite any macroeconomic trends. Overall, we are forecasting second half sales growth in the high-single digit and EBIT growth in the low-double digit. So the bottom line for FMC is still very positive, and we should result in another record year for sales and earnings. Thank you very much for your time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

All lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin.","Michael Wherley","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Mark Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Here we will review FMC's third quarter performance and provide the outlook for the remainder of 2019. Mark will take an in-depth look at our Latin America business followed by Andrew, who will provide an overview of select financial results, we will then address your questions. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and our 2019 outlook statement are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call.","Finally, let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding.

Please note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings, and EBITDA shall mean adjusted EBITDA for all income statement references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.","With that I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you Michael and good morning everyone.","FMC continued to deliver strong financial performance in the third quarter and navigated difficult market conditions, particularly, in North America and Europe. This performance is consistent with prior quarters due to our unique blend of balanced geographic exposure, strong sales in specialty crops and the technology advantage portfolio.","A good example of how all these elements drive strong growth is our diamide franchise that has grown 35% since we acquired the business two years ago. This growth was enabled by the previously mentioned elements in addition to robust commercial approach that has led to volume demand in previously untapped markets. We believe that our business is well positioned to consistently deliver strong growth.","Turning to Slide 3, FMC reported more than $1 billion in third quarter revenue, which reflects a year-over-year increase of 10% on a reported basis and 12% organic growth excluding FX headwinds.","This increase was mostly driven by double-digit organic growth in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, France, India, China and Pakistan, as well as, price increases across all regions. Adjusted company EBITDA was $219 million, an increase of 18% compared to recast financial from last year and $19 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Company EBITDA margins were 21.6% - 140 basis points year-over-year despite $42 million in combined headwinds from raw material costs and tariffs.","Adjusted EPS was $0.94 in the quarter, an increase of 32% versus recast Q3 2018 and $0.14 above the midpoint of our guidance. The strong outperformance versus our guidance was driven primarily by higher volume and pricing, which led to a $0.125 beat on the EBITDA line.","Moving now to third quarter revenue on Slide 4. Q3 revenue growth by 10% versus prior year with volume contributing 8% growth and pricing for another 4% growth. This was offset partially by a 2% headwind from FX. This was the third consecutive quarter that we posted year-over-year price increase in every region of the world.","Our growth in Q3 was stronger than expected due to an forecasted demand opportunities. We saw no shift of demand from Q4 as a growth in the third quarter was due entirely to Q3 demand.","As expected, Latin America made a 45% of third quarter revenue. Sales in Latin America grew 21% year-over-year or 22% organically, continuing the trend from the first half of 2019. We posted very strong growth across the region, driven by higher volumes and price increases. Our pricing actions more than offset the impact of FX.","Demand was high for applications on cotton and sugarcane in Brazil. It is important to note that we continue to monitor channel inventory levels in Brazil, which are well controlled and in line with expectations for this point in the season.","Our market access continues to improve in Argentina, which allows us to take advantage of increasing demand for a product, especially for Rynaxypyr insect control and Authority herbicides. Growth in Mexico came from more normal weather conditions compared to earlier in the year.","Year-to-date, our sales in Latin America grew 29% organically. In EMEA, herbicide and insecticide demand drove year-over-year revenue growth of 4%, despite another very hot summer and fall. Demand for our new Battle Delta herbicide benefited from a stronger than predicted cereal market across Europe, led by France and Germany.","Cyazypyr insect control continue to benefit from new country registrations. Price increases more than offset a full percent FX headwind. Organic growth was 8% in the quarter and stands at 10% year-to-date.","In Asia, revenue increased 5% overall and 9% organically year-over-year. Following a strong Q2, India again delivered commercial outperformance driven by demand for insecticides to combat fall armyworm as well as share gains in the rice granule market with the Rynaxypyr based for Terra insecticides.","Cyazypyr insect control was also strong on fruits and vegetables. We continue to benefit in India from a new commercial organization structure which we put in place about a year ago. We also had significant revenue growth in Pakistan, driven by strength in the diamide demand and new product introductions. Year-to-date, our sales in Asia grew 7% organically, excluding significant FX headwind across many currencies.","In North America, revenue was down 3% year-over-year in a seasonally smallest quarter. As expected, we saw reduced demand for herbicides in the Midwest and Canada as the weather issues this spring resulted in higher channel inventories of those products.","This was partially offset by continued price increases and by share gains for diamides for specialty crop applications. Despite the extreme weather related challenges in this region, our year-to-date sales in North America are up 1%.","Turning to Slide 5. Third quarter EBITDA was $219 million, a year-over-year increase of 18% compared to recast results from Q3 2018. Price increases in all regions and volume demand in Latin America, Asia and EMEA were drivers of these very strong performance.","Looking ahead at the full-year earnings outlook, we are raising full year guidance for 2019. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $4.58 billion to $4.62 billion. Total company adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion.","We are also raising our guidance for 2019 adjusted earnings to a range of $5.80 to $5.90 per diluted share. EPS estimates include the impact of $300 million in share repurchases completed year-to-date through September 30th as well as, an additional $100 million in share repurchases expected in Q4 2019.","Fourth quarter revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.21 billion, representing 8% growth at the midpoint compared to recast fourth quarter 2018. Total fourth quarter company adjusted EBITDA is now forecasted to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million, representing a 13% increase at the midpoint versus recast Q4.","We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.56 in the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 3% at the midpoint versus recast 2018 and assuming diluted shares outstanding of approximately $130.5 million. Year-over-year EPS growth will be constrained by the very low tax rate in Q4, 2018.","Looking at the global market. For the crop protection products, we continue to expect 2019 will be flat on a US dollar basis compared to 2018. We expect the Latin American market to grow in the high single-digit and the North American market to be down in the mid-single digits.","We expect both EMEA and Asia market to be flat-to-down low-single digits. Our forecast for the Asian market is slightly reduced due to the strengthening of the US dollar over the past few months. This market forecast does not change our expectation that FMC will continue to deliver financial outperformance related to the market.","Turning now to a full-year EBITDA bridge and revenue drivers on Slide 7. The main driver of the improved forecast is volume gains, which now contribute 17% year-over-year EBITDA growth. Pricing actions around the globe are expected to offset about two-third of the combined cost and FX headwinds.","Supply from China has improved throughout the year, but some challenges remain. The last of strategic toolers that was inspected by the recent shutdown in China is set to restart its production in two weeks.","I will also like to highlight the full-year revenue drivers. We now expect revenue growth of 7% overall and 11% organically. Both the volume and pricing gains have been consistent through the year. As a reminder this full-year growth of - in 2019 follows organic growth of approximately 13% in 2018 on a pro forma basis.","Moving to Slide 8. We provide the key drivers for EBITDA and revenue growth in Q4. As stated earlier, we saw no shift in demand from Q4 into Q3. In fact, we raised our Q4 revenue guidance by $15 million at the midpoint, however, we reduced our EBITDA against for the quarter by $10 million at the midpoint, due to higher costs and less favorable FX benefit as compared to our July guidance. The positive combined impact over Q4 EBITDA from volume and price mix is exactly the same as we showed in our prior guidance.","Fourth quarter performance will be driven by strong volume growth in all regions. Included in this volume are new product launches, which are expected to deliver about $20 million of total revenue growth of $90 million in the quarter.","These launches include Lucento fungicide, insecticide biofungicide in North America. And Cyazypyr insect control in South Africa, Malaysia and Vietnam. Pricing actions are expected to fully offset the FX headwinds at the revenue level.","We would also like to highlight the rapid growth of Cyazypyr insect control, which has become our fastest growing molecule and is now our fourth largest by revenue. Forecasted 2019 sales of Cyazypyr insect control are expected to be around $300 million driven by registration in new countries and crops.","I will now turn the call over to Mark to take an in-depth look at our Latin America business.","Mark Douglas","Thank you, Pierre.","Turning to Slide 9. It has been some time since we reviewed our regions in depth. We thought it would be appropriate to start with Latin America, since that is one of our key markets in the second half of the year. It is our largest region by annual revenue and as margins in line with the rest of the world. Over the next few minutes I will walk you through the business and highlight our country exposure, as well as crop diversity.","In addition, our review our go-to-market strategies and market shares as well as discuss growth drivers for the coming years. And last of all, I will explain some of the key factors that are driving much higher margins than we had five years ago in this region.","In the Latin American North sub region our annual revenue was approximately $130 million to $140 million with Mexico delivering the vast majority of that revenue. In a market that is only grown 1% over the past few years, we have increased our market share to approximately 9%, as we have grown our business by double-digits over the same period.","Our route to market is generally through local distribution and retail companies. We have a strong presence in the corn market and we are market leader in several specialty crop markets, where our innovative products help protect fruits and vegetables, that will be exported to the US and Europe. We sell the full range of crop protection products in Mexico, but we have a leading market position in insecticides.","Our portfolio is also complemented by a growing plant health business, particularly biologicals, which represents approximately 5% of our business in the country. Our Mexican organization also supports our team in Central America, where we work with distributors in all countries for sales into specialty crops such as bananas.","Moving South, we come to the Andean sub-region comprised of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. This sub-region is our smallest and least penetrated in Latin America, with revenues of only $15 million to $20 million. We have less than a 5% share of this market, which is mainly focused on a variety of specialty crops including bananas, flowers, rice and avocados. Our growth is coming from new distributor relationships, which we're improving our grow reach and exposure.","Turning to the South Cone sub region where we have revenue of approximately $200 million from Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay. We have a market share of approximately 6%. Argentina is the most significant contributor of revenue in the sub region and in 2019, it is expected to be FMC's fourth largest country globally.","Our Argentinean business is focused on row crops with a major emphasis on soybeans, which account for about 70% of our revenue in the country. Over the last three years, we've undertaken a major transformation of the business moving from an exclusive distribution partnership to now, a wholly-owned subsidiary that sells to multiple distribution and retail companies.","Today, our sales and technical representatives are present in all the major production areas of the country. Our Authority brand pre-emergent herbicides are market-leading and continue to show strong growth as glyphosate resistance builds across the country. We also sell a broad range of insecticides and fungicides into these markets.","Our products are also used on corn, sunflower, wheat and specialty crops, such as the growing wine segment. Chile is an important country for fruit and vegetable crops. Similar to the US, the key to access the Chilean market is to partner with a few large national distributors, a model we have successfully transitioned to over the past few years.","Finally, Brazil, our largest country from a revenue perspective. Represents about 20% to 22% of our total company sales and remains an extremely important to our long-term growth plans. We have about 9% market share, which was approximately $10.5 billion in 2018. We've had a direct commercial presence in Brazil for decades covering all the major regions.","Today, we have approximately 700 employees in the country, of which 300 are agronomists. These agronomists focus on demand generation, both directly with growers and by partnering with retailers to help growers find solutions for their problems. We have leading positions in the sugarcane and cotton markets, and serve growers and sugar mills either directly or through alliances and cooperatives. We are also one of the top three players in citrus, rice, coffee and tobacco.","As we expand our market access, we have seen soybeans and corn become our fastest growing segments. We have developed multiple routes to access these large yet fragmented markets in Brazil. This access enables direct sales to the very large growers in the Cerrado area mainly Mato Grosso and Goias.","We also have partnerships with regional retailers throughout the country and long lasting relationships with virtually all the leading cooperatives. These co-op started in the south serving soybean, corn, coffee wheat and sugar crops, but are also expanding into the Cerrado area. They are very important relationships for our growth.","As we advance our market access initiatives, we've also paved the way for future launches of new products out of our pipeline, especially for row crops. And finally, we are also a leading player in the biological segment, particularly, bionematicides has quickly taken substantial market share in sugarcane and most recently in coffee, since it was launched for the 2018 growing season.","Presence bionematicide was launched at the same time and has grown very fast as a seed treatment on soybean and cotton. Combined Quartzo and Presence bionematicide cover a broad range of crops and provide nematode control both in furrow applications in permanent crops and seed treatment in annual row crops, completely replacing older synthetic chemistries. We have a growing pipeline of new biological products that will allow further growth opportunities.","Turning to Slide 10. You can see in the table in the upper left that FMC's Latin American business is expected to grow revenue by about $400 million from $1 billion in 2017 to approximately $1.4 billion in 2019. The map on this page highlights the breadth of coverage we have across the region.","In addition to FMC being a much larger company in Latin America than we were a few years ago, we believe we are a market leader in the way we proactively address structural market challenges, particularly in Brazil since 2015. Our disciplined business practices are driving our outperformance and position FMC to continue to thrive in the region.","As you may recall, we took four broad actions in the 2015 to 2016 to better position our business in Brazil and to raise profitability. First, we reduced our cost base and restructured our business to better match market conditions at the time. Second, we became more disciplined in our sales process, mainly with sales terms and cash collection.","Third, we eliminated sales of low value products from our portfolio, selling only products where FMC was able to achieve acceptable financial returns. And fourth , we significantly reduced the amount of FMC products in the distribution channels. These actions dramatically improve the performance of the business beginning in 2017.","When you layer in the significant benefits that came with the recent acquisition from portfolio enhancements to customer access to R&D capabilities and a deeper pipeline, you can understand why we are confident about our potential to continue to grow in this region. As you know, Latin America can be a volatile region in terms of markets and currencies.","However, we have put in place several proactive levers to ensure our business growth is sustainable. These include diligently tracking channel inventory on a monthly basis in Brazil to keep it at a low level, implementing a lead hedging program to mitigate FX risk in Brazil. Borrowing in local currency practical to reduce currency exposures.","Robust pricing process to quickly react to local currency volatility, building a team of credit specialist to assess credit worthiness of potential customers and to limit sales when necessary. And finally, utilizing more collateral and barter arrangement to mitigate collection risk. All these factors helped to create a Latin American business with earnings margins to be comparable our margins in other regions.","I'll now turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Sandifer","Thanks Mark. Let me start this morning with a few specific income statement items.","Interest expense for the quarter was $5.5 million higher than implied by our prior full year guide, primarily due to higher than anticipated foreign borrowings, additional interest resulting from the refinancing completed in September, as well as, slightly higher than anticipated commercial paper balances in rates. Interest expense for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $153 million to $157 million.","We revised our expected adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to 14% to 15%, reflecting our updated expectations for earnings by jurisdiction. With this change in full year expectations, the resulting adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 12.6%.","Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter was $131.6 million, down nearly 5 million shares versus the prior-year period, reflecting the benefit of the $500 million in share repurchases we've made over the past four quarters.","EPS growth was particularly robust in the third quarter. Lower share count taxes and minority interest more than offset higher interest expense to expand EPS growth to 32% versus the 18% growth in EBITDA.","As Pierre outlined earlier, we are expecting very strong financial performance in the fourth quarter with revenue growing 8% and EBITDA growing 13% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Expected EPS growth of 3% is muted by a very low tax rate in the prior-year period, which resulted from a year-end true-up of the full year tax rate last year.","Moving the balance sheet and debt. In September, FMC raised $1.5 billion of new debt equally weighted across 7-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities. We use the majority of the proceeds to immediately reduce both term loan debt and commercial paper balances.","We will use the remaining proceeds to redeem $300 million in senior notes maturing in the fourth quarter. As all proceeds are being used to pay off other debt this offering will be leverage neutral. However, we successfully extended the maturity profile of our debt at attractive rates.","Further, the offering was 4.5x oversubscribed, which is the Company had not been to the bond markets in some time was a strong endorsement of FMC strength in the eyes of fixed income investors. Gross debt as of September 30th was $3.6 billion, up roughly $360 million from the end of June.","After adjusting for the $300 million in remaining proceeds from the September debt offering that are held aside for the retirement for - of our 2019 senior notes in the fourth quarter, gross debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA at quarter end was 2.8x. This is above our targeted leverage of 2.5x due to some shifts in working capital across quarters versus our initial forecast and the timing of share repurchases. We continue to expect to see leverage drop to 2.5x or lower at year-end, a level at which we would expect to remain at or below on average through 2020 and beyond.","Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted cash from operations was $301 million for the third quarter. Despite strong earnings and collections, cash from operations was somewhat lower than expected due to payables. Payables were negatively impacted in the quarter by purchases made from alternate suppliers to limit the impact of disruptions from Chinese suppliers.","Payable terms with our Chinese suppliers are generally longer than the temporary terms with these alternate suppliers. This situation will naturally reverse in the fourth quarter as we rebuild payables with Chinese suppliers and enter into longer-term arrangements with alternate suppliers.","Capital spending accelerated in the quarter as expected, while legacy and transformation spending was largely in line with expectations. Resulting in free cash flow before dividends and repurchases of $198 million. We are maintaining our full year guidance for free cash flow of $375 million to $475 million.","This implies very strong cash from operations in the fourth quarter, given our cash generation year-to-date and our expectations for capital spending and legacy and transformation costs. Cash from operations will be driven by robust profitability and working capital release, including the expected improvement in payables.","We continue to explore a smaller product line acquisition and may accelerate the start of certain capital investments to support the rapid growth of our diamides platform. These opportunities if pursued would reduce full year free cash flow somewhat that they would further reinforce our growth trajectory. We have repurchased 3.7 million FMC shares year-to-date at an average price of $80.95 for a total of approximately $300 million including 1.1 million shares purchased in the third quarter.","We intend to be a regular purchaser of FMC shares. Although we have not purchased any shares since quarter-end, we intend to purchase an additional $100 million of FMC shares during Q4, bringing the full year total to $400 million. Our full year EPS guidance reflects the benefit of anticipated repurchases in the fourth quarter, so this benefit is modest given the limited be remaining time in the year.","Before turning the call back to Pierre. Let me also give a quick update on progress in implementing our new SAP S4 HANA ERP system . After successful go live in Brazil in July, the third quarter was the first quarter in which we closed with roughly 20% of the Company on the new system. The close was uneventful and our Brazil team is excited about the many new tools and capabilities of S4 HANA.","We expect to exit the TSAs in February when we will go live with S4 HANA across the acquired business. The remainder of the Company will migrate to S4 HANA later in the year 2020. The new system will thoroughly modernize our business process environment, delivering meaningful near-term benefits and providing us a platform for driving further improvement in the future.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pierre.","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you, Andrew.","In December 2018 we shared a five-year plan with annual sales growth of 5% to 7%, EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% and EPS growth about 10% per year. Based on our guidance for Q4, we expect to deliver at the high end of the range in the first year and expect to meet our objectives in the remaining four years of the plan. We continue our focus of driving strong growth for technology. In 2019, we expect about $16 million over total revenue growth of $315 million will come from new product.","Our discovery and new product pipeline are advancing as expected. Two new molecules have moved from discovery to development in 2019 including an insecticide in January and herbicide in October. These are significant steps in advancing products toward commercial launch.","We are pleased with the performance of the Company. We delivered another strong quarter and are expecting strong year. Our technology advantage portfolio, geographical balance, crop exposure and diversified product seeing continued to drive our financial outperformance.","I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you very much for your attention.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar","Mark, very helpful overview on Latin America. If I look at your Latin American market share. It's all less than 10%. So, that seems like a big opportunity in the future. How do these market shares compared to other mature markets and what - how would you characterize the opportunity there?","Mark Douglas","Yes, P.J., I think you're right, when we look at Latin America, we do see continued opportunity to grow and take market share. I think obviously was strong in Brazil in certain segments, as I highlighted, but frankly as we've introduced our pipeline across the region, we see growth opportunities outside of Brazil that will raise our market share, in particular, places like Argentina where frankly, we didn't have great market access. But now we have and we're seeing that accelerated growth, not only on the big soy business, as I talked about, but on some of the more specialty crops as well.","I think those margins - sorry those market shares in some of the other regions outside of Brazil are lower than some of our more established markets to be expected, given our market access. So, yes, I mean, I said it in the script that Latin America will be a major driver of our growth going over this five-year plan and beyond.","We see no reason that that won't continue to accelerate given where we think portfolio fits. And more importantly, the market access that we continue to build across the region.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Chris Parkinson","You highlight a few implied 4Q cash flow drivers on Slide 11 of your presentation, in fact, strong collections presumably in LatAm as well as some inventory discipline. Just can you highlight on what degree of confidence or general line of sight do you already have into these improvements. And how we as investors should be thinking about these better conversion into next year as well as into 2021, just the key puts and takes. Thank you.","Andrew Sandifer","This is Andrew, let me just give you some quick comments on the cash flow for Q4. Certainly collections are expected to be robust in Q4. They'll actually be driven more out of Europe and Asia in terms of the seasonal build receivables - we see build a receivables in LatAm in Q4 with the entry into the new season. So, yes, in terms of line of sight there, we feel very confident in the collection forecast for Europe and Asia.","In North America, there is some collections, there's also prepays and rebates systems and puts and takes in the quarter there. I think when we look at inventories, we've been very, very focused on managing our inventories this year. It is a place where we have opportunity as we get better systems and better visibility with our new SAP system to drive further efficiencies. But we feel confident in our inventory forecast for the full year.","I think the payable situation, we mentioned in the prepared comments, just some short-term impacts from having to use alternate suppliers with shorter payment terms during the middle of the year, that will reverse as we go into the end of the year. We can see that as we're building payables with our more traditional suppliers in longer term. So all in all, I think, yes, it is a large release of working capital in Q4, but we think we have very good visibility there.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly","I think the biggest question that we're getting from investors now is on the legacy and transformation costs, which were such a huge drag on free cash. Can you help us understand how those begin to roll off across 2020 and 2021?","Andrew Sandifer","Hi, it's Andrew again Mark. Certainly understand the questions there, and I think it's a key part of our long-term cash conversion improvement story is managing these legacy and transformation costs. For this year, we've guided legacy and transformation costs of $200 million to $250 million of that, about $100 million of it is true legacy costs, which are some of these environmental and other liabilities that are part of our long heritage is a previously very diversified conglomerate. Those are a very - those are pretty stable, pretty predictable, but they're not going away.","Next $150 million which is really the transformation spending, its a combination of finishing the integration of the DuPont acquisition and the work we're doing around the Company to implement the SAP S4 HANA system. Yeah, that's the additional $100 million to $150 million that you see this year. That spending should step down materially in 2020 but will not go away. And then in 2021. I would expect that spending to go to a very low level. As we move to a different phase of more steady-state operation.","So when you think about our cash conversion in the way we've spoken about it as a - as a percentage of our adjusted earnings and net income that $150 million in transformation spending relative to the roughly 770 and net income we're forecasting for this year that alone would be a 15% increase in cash conversion for the Company.","So, you will see some benefit in 2020, but the most substantial benefit you'll see in 2021. We'll also continue working on working capital improvements and just the growth of the underlying operating cash flow to drive up that cash generation.","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color just on cost trends as we go into 4Q and kind of what that implies into 2020? How raw material costs have been tracking, kind of, some of the impacts of the supply disruptions in China and potentially moving past that and kind of where cost inflation is just an aggregate level is for 4Q and into the first half of the year?","Pierre Brondeau","Yes, certainly. I think the dual comment I would make around cost is it has been continuing into the second half of the year maybe beyond what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. As you see on our guidance for EBITDA, it will have adverse costs in the fourth quarter of $40 million with - about the same number for the Q3 EBITDA $39 million. So, all in all, the two together, close to $80 million where we had about $100 million in the first half. So we had a continuation of the cost, mostly due to the channel disruption and some of the toolers shutdown.","As we said in our prepared remarks, we expect our last the strategic tooler to be back on stream in a couple of weeks. So, most of the major partners and suppliers will be back on track. So if I think those comments now and extrapolate 2020 and maybe - I'll use that to give you carryovers on 2020. 2020 we believe will be a year of directionally at the global level, a bit equivalent to 2019 but with some differences. I think in 2019 we had Latin America growing very fast in the high single digits.","So difficult to expect another year at this level, so we could see Latin America slightly in lower in growth than in 2019. On the other hand, we could see North America seeing better condition and we have a negative mid-single digit for 2019. So we could expect 2020 to be stronger. So all in all, may be slightly slower in Latin America, faster in North America balancing out and they're actually same thing for Europe and Asia.","If you look at what we talked about cost. Cost in 2020 will be a tailwind. They will be favorable more versus 2019. That being said they will not be favorable to the extent we're thinking at the beginning of the year because we saw a continuation of those cost into the year - into the second half of 2019 and that will impact the cost of a product into 2020.","FX, a bit too early for us to look at where it's going to go next year. If I put all of them together a five-year plan, revenue growth in the 5% to 7%, EBITDA growth in the 7% to 9% and EPS growth over 10% seems to be quite achievable and - for 2020 year.","Operator","Your next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","The comments on the Asian market decelerating versus expectation due to foreign exchange. Is that a function of actual decline in takeaway at the end-user or grower level or is that just sort of management of working capital by the intermediaries in the supply chain?","Mark Douglas","Yes, Vincent, it's Mark. Bit of both actually. Asia is such a big part of the world that you have different conditions around Asia, I'll give you a quick run around us, as I see it today. Australia, very, very difficult market extremely dry not in good shape at all. Indonesia in much better position somewhat elevated channel inventories, but not everywhere.","Monsoons were pretty good in India, we had - we have a very good business in India. Channel inventories at normal levels. China, difficult market in China, a lot going on, a lot of movement going on in terms of companies repositioning themselves. Channel inventory is okay, some areas slightly high. Rest of Southeast Asia very good. Pakistan, very good for us, very good season.","So, I think that declined generally as a part of what Pierre said is the currency impacts that we've seen over the last few months, but part, is some of the - some of the actions in some countries to make sure that everybody is on top of their business.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Laurent Favre with Exane. Please go ahead.","Laurent Favre","Yes, good morning, bit of a mid-term question from me, please on insecticides. We're hearing a bit more on phase out for use of the organophosphates. And I'm just wondering for you guys, do you see it as an opportunity to grow share in diamides? Or do you think that - those phase-outs are more likely to switch over to Japan than diamides. Thank you.","Mark Douglas","Yes, Laurent, some of the product you're talking about, the diamides actually particularly, the Cyazypyr would have a fit in that market, but it is a more of a low value market than where the diamides traditionally would fit. So, yes, there could be an upside, but whether we would want to take it and I don't know at this point.","We do have other chemistries though in our portfolio where we're very strong such as the pyrethroids which fit very well. So we do see those organophosphate that are going away, the marketing and commercial teams do see it as a potential upside for us in the coming years.","Operator","Your next question is from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","I was intrigued by the comment that the access - the market access to Argentina has been improved. Can you talk about how specifically and what are the implications for 2020 growth and beyond?","Pierre Brondeau","Yes, thanks Franck, I'll let Mark any addition, but it's quite a simple situation from a market access for us. We use - couple of years ago we used to hit through a - an exclusive arrangements with a distribution company in which we had an equity participation. So we were not fully running market access and we were very dependent upon a distributor. We broke that relationship and do you have an organization today, which is in direct relation with the - the market in Argentina.","So we've changed our structure to a structure, which is much more similar to what we have in other parts of Latin America and Brazil or other countries in the world, which is a direct FMC market access with the larger and maybe more traditional organization.","Mark if you want to add anything on this?","Mark Douglas","Yes. In addition to what Pierre said Frank, we had that traditional relationship than we bought Cheminova which gave us some market access as well. And then the DuPont assets came along and we had further market access. So we had a very complex situation where we essentially had three organizations that we had to bring together. We've got through all of that now.","And in fact, Pierre and I were down in Argentina about three weeks ago and I have to say the growth we're seeing today frankly, I think it will continue to accelerate as we go over the next three-year to five-year period. The team is really uncovering a lot of growth opportunities. And the portfolio fits very well in Argentina. So it's a highlight for us. It's a country that we're focused on. We're investing in more resources, so expect to hear more about it from us.","Pierre Brondeau","I think when you think about the question from PJ at the beginning around market share. Clearly, Argentina for us, when you look at the blend of changing market access together with portfolio that is going to be a place where we do have great opportunities in the future.","Operator","Your next question is from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson","Maybe give a little more color on some of the - where you've got progress right now on possibly expanding diamide production over the next little while. And also, do you have any progress on possibly locking in some customers or competitors on some longer term agreements to produce Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr for them. Thanks.","Mark Douglas","So, Joel, just you cut out a little bit. Did you say the diamide capacity?","Pierre Brondeau","We received the beginning of your question, we missed the end.","Joel Jackson","Yes, just, sorry so, diamide production you talked about possibly expanding more, you have to get a little bit of color on this - maybe give a little bit more into what will decide the timing? And then longer term, have you guys made any progress on locking in some arrangements or some terms that you may lock into for producing Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr for customers and competitors. Thanks.","Mark Douglas","Yes, diamides, well we spent the last two years basically, debottlenecking what we - what we acquired. And I have to say the supply chain group of manufacturing have done an excellent job in feeding us more diamides and allowing us to continue that growth trajectory over the last couple of years.","We are looking now at what excess capacity do we need to build for our next phase of growth. So, that is not something that's hitting right now, but it is certainly something as we alluded to on the capital front that we're looking at.","I think the other - the other aspect of this is what you were alluding to where we talked last time about the relationships that we're building. We are progressing those relationships and I obviously can't - I can't speak to them in detail, given the confidentiality nature. But suffice to say that they are moving forward and we're very pleased with where we are with the breadth of those diamide potential relationships and actual relationships.","One thing I would like to add around the growth of the diamides, some of you will remember back in 2018. I talked about, part of the aspect of the growth that we were seeing was the fact that we had about 200 registrations and label expansions that we were looking at that would allow us to increase our market space and allow the growth to continue.","Where we are today? Out of that 200, about 100 of those registrations and label expansions are now in place. So, hence you see when we talk about places like Vietnam, like Malaysia, like say Cyazypyr in the Philippines. We now have registrations that we didn't have before, so that naturally opens up new markets for us and accelerates the growth.","Something that we've put in place over the last 18 months is not only the fact that we originally had 200 and 100 of those are now real. We now have another 240 registration and label expansions on top of what we had at the beginning of 2018.","So, if you think about it in terms of how we see our market expansion different crops, different pests, different geographies that growth will continue to go for the next 5, 10 plus years easily given what we see from a registration and label expansion.","Pierre Brondeau","And that's a comment made by Mark relates very well to the comment in the prepared remarks around Cyazypyr being now the fourth largest molecule, really the fastest growing molecule and close with $300 million, great growth potential here.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Steve Byrne","Yes. The two big seed companies have recently rolled out some bundles in the US market where there - they're bundling their seed position with farmers to also drive crop chemical sales and I just wondered if you're seeing any evidence of that the distributor or retail level where there could be a shift over to those chemistries. You mentioned lower pre-emergent herbicide sales in the US in our third quarter. I would assume that's not demand for pounds on the ground product, but channel refilling and whether there is anything going on there with respect to dynamics in the market?","Mark Douglas","Yes Steve, it's a good question. First of all, there are programs being rolled out, but nobody knows all the details of them yet. So, it's a bit of a premature - it's a bit of a premature question to say how will it impact. And there are some high level views of what those programs look like.","Let's be clear, I mean, we have very, very strong relationships with major distributors in the US. Those major distributors continue to show very strong partnerships with us, given the growth rates that we have, especially around our new technologies. We also have very strong programs in place, the FMC Freedom Pass program in the US has many different aspects to it that allow us to reward both retailers and growers for using our products on various different acres and crops.","The advantage that we have, we're not tied to anybody's seeds. You can use whoever seeds you want and we will provide the best chemistry. So, certainly we have seen no impact on those programs this year. And I can tell you, given where the commercial groups are next year with regards to growth of new products and especially on the specialty crops, we don't think that's going to have an impact at all in our business in the US.","Pierre Brondeau","I just would like to reinforce what Mark said. Mark and I, we spend a large amount of time with our customers in the US and the big retailers. I can tell you with no doubt the retail world in the US welcome a crop chemical company, which is focused on those product biologicals and chemicals with no seed and which is agnostic to the seed and doesn't bundled product. It's been repeated to us over and over. If anything today, I would say it's one of the strength. The fact that we do not have seeds and one of the driver of growth.","Steve Byrne","And any comments on the pre-emergent herbicide sales in the third quarter.","Mark Douglas","No, it's pretty much what we expected actually. We knew we had channel inventory there. It's still too early to say how the next season will go. We're not even in discussions yet around what will happen in Q4 and Q1 for that business.","I think you know we have class-leading chemistry with our Authority brands and what's more important out of those Authority brands, the very high end of those brands, the ones that have the highest technology they're the ones that are the fastest growing. So, not all pre-emergents are made equal and we do participate across the whole spectrum, but have a lot of products at the very high end.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Just wanted to ask about the price mix and the cost bridge. So in 2019, it looks like you got like $156 million on price mix that's your expectation for the full year and negative $185 million on cost. Maybe you can just help us and provide a little bit more detail next year, you see some of the $150 million from TSA and SAP would roll off.","I'm curious on the raw side how much of that you would get potentially get back, I know you said it would be less. But how much of that would you get back. And then price mix if you're not getting back as much, do you expect a little bit better performance out off price mix. Thanks.","Pierre Brondeau","Appreciate your question because its an important question, but it's a bit too early for us to really state the raw material impact next year. Particularly, the adverse impact it's going to be - we believe it's going to be a tailwind compared to the number we had this year in term of the $180 million cost we were facing. But it's a bit early, we are still digging through the numbers.","Looking at the impact of our major total restarting in a couple of weeks. We will have a lots of detail in the forecast at the February call, but difficult to assess that number. We will adjust as we always do. Our pricing strategy to the currency situation and to - and to the cost, we are seeing, but we need another few weeks to be able to see those numbers.","Arun Viswanathan","Then just as a quick follow-up. Latin America now 31% of your revenue or so this year, that's kind of ebb and flow. And do you still expect kind of a 25% make up across your regions for each in the ensuing years or will Latin America continue to be your largest region? Thanks.","Mark Douglas","Yes, I think you know we often talk about that geographic balance, I think this year obviously Latin America had an accelerated year. So it's, as you said, I think it's 30%, 31%. I would expect over time, it stays in that range. It is one of the largest markets in the world. One of the fastest growing, it's one of the only places on earth where you have more land that can be turned to agriculture mainly from converting pasture land to agriculture in Brazil.","So you're obviously going to have that impact. I would say though that longer-term Asia will also continue to grow rapidly, especially for us given our excellent portfolio on fruit and vegetables and the other crops in India and Southeast Asia, especially. So I think you might see a little more balancing with Asia. North America and Europe, I expect pretty much steady as it goes in those sort of ratios.","Pierre Brondeau","At any point, any year you could have one region going - sort of taking a stronger position. I think this balances out in over the years. North America, we don't expect the year - next year to be as bad as this year. I mean we think would happen. But really was a very negative year in North America and very favorable situation, Latin America. That could reverse next year at any point.","So, all in all, it should balance. As Mark said Asia we should not underestimate the potential we have in India. India is a very large country with us. The portfolio and the new commercial structure we have in place is going to create significant growth opportunities in the future. So, all of these to say that these 25% region over the year should remain in this kind of a range.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch","You did address my question about the dynamics in North America and headed into the 2020 year, sanguine view about prospects. Just I guess, one nuance on that though is, I understand the strong relationships with the channel partners that you referenced is - is it just also just a function of your sort of de minimis relative to the broader market exposure to the row crop and addressing the horseshoe part of the North American market? And just visibility of the competitive dynamic based on channel inventories going into 2020. Any comments on that?","Mark Douglas","Yes, it's pretty much as you said, Chris, when you think about it. Soybeans, obviously important to us, but we're not on every acre of soybean where you have strong wheat resistance you're going to see our Authority products. Certainly as you said in the horseshoe California all the way around the south of the East Coast where you have specialty crops. We have a superb portfolio, to fix there and continue to grow.","So you're going to have that different type of mix from FMC, which is different to as you said, some of the other companies that have a very large row crop exposure that's advantageous to our distribution partners and retail partners. We offer them products that are very different and a different type of mix. So yes, we do consider North America to be a very, very important market for us with a lot of growth opportunities.","Chris Kapsch","And then just one follow-up on Latin America and Argentina, specifically. You had pretty bullish comments about gaining share over time there given better access. Can you just talk about the obviously this recent election that the result with signal a couple of months ago, and the peso was devalued on the preliminary results. Just any influence that has on your operations your ability to execute a growth plan in that country. Thanks.","Andrew Sandifer","It's Andrew, Chris, I think, its a good question. I think with Argentina and the market is for our products is US dollar denominated, they are some delays in collections that can create a little bit of FX exposure. But yes, while there would certainly be challenges with future - likely future devaluation Argentina. We think it's quite manageable. It is - the issues around capital controls et cetera are also quite manageable for us in terms of bringing in pretty necessary crop inputs. So it's something we watch very closely, but not something we're overly concerned about at this point.","Michael Wherley","All right. That's all the time we have for the call today.

As with the last quarter, we have published a slide presentation that accompanies our results and I will refer to these slides as I discuss our results and the outlook for the rest of the year. The third quarter of 2015 was marked by significant foreign exchange headwinds, the effect of which were most pronounced in the result for Agricultural Solutions.","However, excluding the impact for foreign currencies, the Ag Solution business performed in line with expectation, confirming the strength of FMC's portfolio and technology in a weak global ag market.

Lithium continued to see strong demand for its specialty products, including lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and high purity metals.","You will see from our comment today that despite difficult market condition, each of our businesses is performing well with a notable exception of our Brazil Ag business. As I will discuss during the call, we are executing a comprehensive program to protect the profitability of our business in Brazil in the current market environment, and position the business to deliver earnings growth and higher returns in 2016 and 2017.","Turning now to slide one, FMC reported $831 million in revenue in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 1.5% compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $95 million, a 37% decrease compared to last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.42 which was $0.42 (sic) [42%] (04:59) below the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter was higher than our earlier guidance due to lower tax rate, which Paul will discuss in more detail shortly.","The significant movement in foreign exchange rates compared to last year, especially in the real and the euro, was the main driver of the decline in FMC's earnings compared to the third quarter of 2014, as price increases in local currency were not enough to offset the impact of foreign currency devaluation on our reported results. In the third quarter alone, foreign exchange reduced FMC's reported adjusted operating profit by over $110 million. I will review the impact of FX in more detail when discussing the performance of each business.","First, Ag Solutions, on slide two. Ag Solutions delivered revenue of $578 million and segment earnings of $59 million in the quarter, a decline of 32% and 49% respectively from the pro forma results in the same period of 2014. Price increases and cost reductions only partially offset the negative impact of foreign exchange and lower sales volumes.","As noted in our October 12 press release, the rapid devaluation of the Brazilian real created significant headwinds for our business. During the third quarter of 2015 alone, the Brazilian real depreciated over 25% versus the U.S. dollar, reducing segment earnings by over $100 million compared to the third quarter of 2013. While we were successful in implementing significant price increases during the quarter in Brazil, this price increases only offset about half of the currency impact.","Following the acquisition of Cheminova, FMC initiated a program to rationalize our global product offering and increase our focus on proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products. This portfolio rationalization, which was accelerated during the third quarter, reduced revenue in Brazil by approximately $120 million compared to the third quarter of 2014. Excluding these actions, sale volumes in Brazil declined only modestly compared to the third quarter of 2014 as demand in Brazil for FMC's differentiated products remains strong. We saw continued volume growth in FMC proprietary product offerings including sales of insecticides for cotton, fungicides for soybean and herbicides for sugarcane.","In other countries in Latin America, we continue to see strong demand for FMC's product including selective herbicides in Argentina and products for non-row crop in Columbia and Mexico. Argentina remains an attractive market for FMC. However, obtaining import licenses for formulated products remain a challenge in the short term, reducing our ability to fully take advantage of strong demand for our product in the country. Outside Latin America, revenues declined mainly as a result of unfavorable currency effect, particularly the euro and lower volumes, largely as a result of weather, weak pest pressure or excess channel inventories.","Due to our focus on cost control globally, earnings outside of Latin America were essentially flat with the same period in 2014. In the face of continued difficult market conditions, FMC aggressively reduced operating cost in the quarter. The cost savings achieved to-date will continue to increase throughout Q4 as we accelerate the integration of Cheminova and execute the restructuring of our Ag Solutions operations in Brazil, which I will now discuss on slide three.","Through September, we estimate sales of crop protection chemicals in Brazil are down approximately 18% in U.S. dollar terms. For the full year, we estimate the market for crop protection chemicals in Brazil will be down mid-to-high-teens percent compared to 2014. Despite the significant decline in sales across the industry in Brazil, there is healthy demand from growers for technically differentiated higher value in use product to address specific pest and weed pressures.","The acquisition of Cheminova has allowed FMC to rationalize its products offering and refocus the combined business in Brazil on FMC's and Cheminova's proprietary technology platform. We firmly believe these actions will position FMC to deliver higher growth and higher returns in Latin America in 2016 and beyond.","Let me quantify for you the impact of these actions on our 2015 revenue. Pro forma for Cheminova, Ag Solution revenue in Brazil was approximately $1.2 billion in 2014. In 2015, FMC will eliminate some $250 million of low-margin third-party product sales. This includes action taken through the first six month of the year such as the previously announced sale of our generic subsidiary, Consagro as well as action taken in the second half of this year. Excluding this portfolio rationalization, FMC's sales volume in Brazil are expected to be down slightly compared to 2014, reflecting current market conditions.","As I discussed earlier, foreign exchange will have a significant negative impact on the reported results for the year. Assuming stability in the current U.S. dollar \/ Brazilian real exchange rate through the end of the year, we expect price increases to recover about 40% of full year impact of foreign currency.","Taking this impact into account, revenue in Brazil is expected be about $750 million in 2015. The successful execution of the ongoing portfolio rationalization will have three very important implications for FMC. First, it will enable the business to eliminate additional operating cost, which will protect the profitability of the business, during this downturn and position FMC to take advantage of a future market recovery. As I will discuss shortly, based on these actions currently underway, we expect to realize the meaningful reduction in operating cost in both 2016 and 2017.","Second, these actions will allow us to generate higher operating margins and return in Brazil. We will eliminate sales of our lowest margin product and further enhance our focus on FMC's core technical portfolio in Brazil, including higher margin sulfentrazone, clomazone and malathion proprietary formulation. We will take this opportunity to reduce the capital employed in the business, leading to higher returns on capital, lower hedging and financing costs and stronger cash generation.","Third, the step we have taken to reduce FMC's revenue base in Brazil, combined with a larger revenue base in all other region pro forma for Cheminova, will result in greater geographic balance over Ag Solutions business. As you can see in the chart on the right side of the slide, Latin America accounted for more than 50% of Ag Solution sales in 2014. In 2015, on a pro forma basis and including the actions I just described, sales in Latin America will account for just over (sic) [under] (14:55) 40% of Ag Solutions revenue. Brazil itself will account for less than 30% of Ag Solutions pro forma in 2015 compared to over 40% in 2014. Equally important, revenue distribution from North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific is much more balanced. The mix shift in a regional mix will also contribute to higher overall segment earnings moving into 2016 as our two highest margin regions, North America and Europe, will contribute over 40% of Ag Solutions revenue.","As you can see on slide four, the original cost reduction target announced as part of Cheminova synergies was $90 million. As a result of the actions we are taking in Brazil and with the reduction in certain corporate function, we expect global run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million. To be clear, this target is inclusive of $90 million in synergies related to integration of Cheminova, which we have discussed at length before today.","Headcount reductions will be the single largest contributor to the incremental cost savings. FMC is now targeting total reduction of 800 positions to 850 positions. This compares to the 500 positions to 550 positions announced previously. The majority of the additional head count reduction will be in our Brazil operations. We are moving quickly to realize this cost savings and the majority of these actions needed to deliver these savings will be implemented in the next six months.","We expect to realize approximately $35 million to $40 million in cost savings in 2015. These savings principally related to previously announced actions to integrate Cheminova into FMC. The additional benefit from the further cost reduction program will realized through 2016 and the first half of 2017 and we expect to deliver additional cost savings of between $50 million to $70 million in 2016. The success we have achieved to-date in delivering the prior synergy target and the pace at which we have commenced the most recent cost reduction program, give us a high degree of confidence that will deliver the $140 million to $160 million in run rate cost saving by the middle of 2017.","Let me now turn to Health and Nutrition on slide five. Q3 was another strong quarter for FMC Health and Nutrition. Reported revenue declined 3% compared to the third quarter of 2014 as foreign exchange headwinds offset favorable volume and improved mix in the quarter. Excluding currency, revenue increased by 2% compared to Q3 2014.","Segment earnings increased 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014 to $47 million in the quarter. The business saw continued strong volumes and realized improved mix in the quarter. The increase in sales volume was due to continued demand for growth for FMC's MCC-based products for the pharmaceutical market, especially for multinational companies in Europe and generic producers in India, and for food applications in both Asia and North America.","The operating performance of the Health and Nutrition segment continue to benefit from ongoing manufacturing excellence program. Segment operating margins in the quarter increased 250 basis points over last year to 24%. We are pleased with the performance of the business to date and believe Health and Nutrition is well positioned to deliver continued earnings growth and higher returns going forward.","Turning to Lithium, next on slide six. Reported revenue of $57 million decreased by 15% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Segment earnings of $1.8 million were $3.5 million lower than the same quarter last year. We continue to see increased demand for FMC's downstream specialty product. However, sales volume were down 13% compared to third quarter of 2014 due to lower third-party carbonate supply and the timing of a scheduled maintenance outage at our lithium hydroxide unit in Bessemer City. In 2015, we entered into a new agreement for a third-party to supply lithium carbonate to FMC. Volumes under this agreement will increase as we move through Q4 and will help feed our specialty businesses.","Operating performance continues to improve. Our facility in Argentina continues to operate at record production rate. However, continued strong operating performance was not sufficient to offset the impact of lower sales volume and foreign currency.","Last night, we published our outlook statement for the fourth quarter of 2015. I will take a few minutes now to briefly discuss the outlook for each of FMC's business segments on slide seven.","We expect most of the headwinds that impacted Q3 results for Ag Solutions to persist through the end of the year. However, as we discussed on our second quarter call, a significant portion of the 2015 cost savings associated with integration of Cheminova will be realized in the fourth quarter. These cost savings, combined with additional price increases and ongoing portfolio rationalization, will largely offset the FX headwinds we are facing in Latin America.","Outside of Latin America, we expect the business to be flat to 2014. As a result, we estimate Ag Solutions segment earnings to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million for Q4. For Health and Nutrition, fourth quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $47 million driven by continued demand for Health and Nutrition's MCC product line and lower operating costs as a result of ongoing manufacturing excellence program.","For Lithium, fourth quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $4 million to $6 million. We continue to see strong demand for our specialty products and expect sequentially higher carbonate and hydroxide volumes as well as higher selling prices. As we previously announced, price increases begin to take effect. While inflationary headwinds in Argentina are likely to continue, we expect they will be offset by lower manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter. After corporate costs, which we estimate to be around $20 million in Q4, adjusted EBIT will be between $140 and $160 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of approximately 8% from the fourth quarter 2014 at the midpoint of the range.","Before I turn the call over to Paul, let me spend a few minutes discussing the outlook for 2016. While it is premature to give full year guidance, I do want to highlight some of the factors that will impact our 2016 performance. In Ag Solutions, there are a number of factors, which are largely in our control that will favorably impact 2016 segment earnings. These include the previously described incremental cost savings, a full year of earnings contribution from Cheminova, and lower operating costs in Brazil due to the benefit of a weaker real. We have a high degree of confidence in the impact of these three items which combined are expected to contribute north of $75 million to segment earnings in 2016.","However, external factors, most notably market demand and currency, will have an impact on the reported results. We do not expect any improvement in market condition in 2016. In fact, based on what we see today, we expect global market demand for crop protection chemicals to be down next year. The extent of the decline will essentially depend on the level of channel inventory, not only in Brazil, but also in North America and Europe, assuming normal weather and pest pressures.","While foreign currency headwinds appear to have moderated so far in Q4, macroeconomic and geopolitical event impacting foreign exchange rates in each of our key geographic regions continue to evolve. Assuming stability in foreign exchange rate in Brazil, we believe there will be opportunities to continue to recover pricing in that market. However, it will be difficult to quantify the benefit of any future price increases until we are well into 2016 and the next selling season in Brazil.","We expect Health and Nutrition to deliver another year of solid earnings growth driven by higher volume and an improved cost position. In particular, we see continued strong demand for FMC's MCC and alginate product portfolio across both the pharmaceutical and nutrition market. As we have discussed throughout the year Health and Nutrition has successfully reduced its operating cost as a result of the ongoing implementation of manufacturing excellence initiatives across the business. These efforts will continue into next year and deliver incremental cost savings in 2016. Foreign currency, principally the euro, has negatively impacted reported results in the recent quarters. However, the potential impact of foreign exchange aside, we currently expect Health and Nutrition to deliver segment earnings growth of $10 million to $15 million in 2016.","In our Lithium business, we expect to realize higher selling prices and continued mix improvement from our focus on specialty product, as well as the full year benefit of lower operating costs in 2016, which we estimate could increase segment earnings by approximately $10 million. We will enter 2016 with a strong pricing environment for lithium products.","In September, our Lithium business announced price increases on all product lines. The majority of these price increases will be realized throughout 2016. Product mix will benefit from the third-party supply of lithium carbonate. The supply will supplement our own lithium carbonate production and feed our specialty businesses. In addition, we will realize the full year benefit from ongoing process improvement programs as well as the new natural gas pipeline, which began operation late in the third quarter this year.","Inflation in Argentina has been a significant drag on Lithium earnings over the past few years. While the election of a new President in Argentina may bring a change in monetary policy and an eventual devaluation of the Argentine peso such actions are difficult to predict and may take time to unfold.","Unallocated corporate costs are expected to decline by $15 million to $20 million, reflecting the benefit of the cost reduction actions discussed earlier. As you can see, there are a number of factors within our control that we believe will deliver earnings growth in each of our business in 2016. During FMC's Q4 2015 earnings call in February, we will provide more detailed guidance for the coming year.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Pierre. Before I discuss cash flow on slide nine, let me start by explaining the changes we made to the tax report in this quarter. As the schedules to our press release clearly explain, our adjusted tax rate is intended to reflect the underlying tax rate related to business operations. We have always looked to remove those items that are unrelated to the businesses in presenting our tax rate. However, one item that has been causing increased unpredictability in our reported rate is related to currency movements. For us, historically, that has meant the Argentine peso, the Norwegian krone and of course the Brazilian real. Simply put, we finance and operate our businesses in these countries in a currency that is different than the local currency, but are forced to re-measure certain financial assets and liabilities into local currencies for U.S. GAAP tax purposes. This re-measurement creates adjustments to our U.S. GAAP tax rate without any corresponding impact on our profits before tax.","Historically, these items have been small and have not had a material impact on our reported tax rate. However, movements in the euro last year and the Brazilian real this year have created larger distortions to our tax rate than we have ever seen previously. To put this into context, if we had not made this change in presentation, our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of 2015 would have been negative. Clearly, this would not have been a reflection of our true adjusted tax rate associated with our underlying business and would not have helped any of you understand our business performance any better.","Looking forward, and with expectations of larger movements in the Argentine peso and continued volatility in the Brazilian reis, we do not expect this issue to go away. Consequently, we've decided to present our tax rate, such that it excludes these discrete re-measurement items. We have recalculated our tax rate under this method for each of the last six quarters and included the revised adjusted net income in our press release schedules.","Let me now move to cash flow performance on slide nine. As you know, in the current environment, we have placed a significant focus on cash generation. We appreciate that the combined effects of the acquisition of Cheminova, the sale of Alkali and foreign currency movements make it more difficult to extract underlying cash flow performance from our financial statements this year.","So I'll now walk you through the major components. Through the first nine months of 2015, our EBITDA is almost $100 million less than the same period last year. Despite this, when you look at operating cash flow generated from continuing operations, you can see that FMC generated double the cash flow in 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. Part of this improvement can be attributed to lower cash outlays in areas such as capital expenditure and taxes, allowing us to fully offset the temporarily higher interest expense and pension payments. We will continue to be very disciplined in capital spending and look to further optimize our tax position as we take advantage of the opportunities presented to us by Cheminova's footprint.","However, the bulk of the improved operating cash flow performance has come from working capital. So far this year, total cash released from working capital across all three segments is approximately $75 million, the majority of which has been from Ag Solutions. While still well below what we're looking to achieve, it represents an improvement over the same period last year of over $300 million, a period when working capital continued to consume cash. This improvement can be largely tracked to lower levels of receivables and inventory.","Ag Solutions has generated cash from receivables in all three quarters of 2015, something it only achieved in one quarter last year. And in two of the three quarters so far this year, that has seen a reduction in inventory compared to last year, when inventory actually increased in each of the first three quarters. We continue to focus on these two largest drivers of working capital and expect to see the year-on-year improvement in performance continue into the fourth quarter. We expect Ag Solutions to generate a modest positive cash flow from working capital, as higher receivables are largely offset by reduced inventory levels.","Taken together, we forecast that our cash generated from working capital in 2015 will be almost $350 million better than 2014, which will more than offset the decline in EBITDA over the same period. This focus on cash flow is reflected in a strengthening balance sheet. Our quarter-end net debt was just under $2 billion, slightly better than our prior forecast. Our debt consists almost entirely of medium and long-term maturities with our only short-term maturities, namely our commercial paper balances, largely covered by cash on hand. Approximately 50% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate debt.","We are expecting net debt to remain broadly flat at year-end. Out net debt to EBITDA ratio currently sits at just above 3 times, largely due to the lower than expected EBITDA. As our EBITDA improves and we continue to generate cash from working capital and exercise discipline in all areas of spending, we expect this ratio to improve rapidly as we progress through 2016.","With that, I will hand the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul. As you have heard, our Ag Solutions business faces a challenging market environment, but on the positive side, the issues we face are largely in Brazil and the impact of its currency. Ag Solutions performance in the current market environment reinforce the strength of FMC proprietary portfolio and technologies. We will continue to invest in our technology pipeline and in the value we bring to growers. Our Health and Nutrition and Lithium business will deliver solid performance this year and are positioned for a strong 2016. We are taking aggressive actions to protect our 2015 financial performance and position FMC to deliver earnings growth next year, in what we expect will continue to be a challenging ag market.","We are very confident that the lower cost of operating post restructuring, our focus on the technical differentiated parts of FMC portfolio, the improved regional balance and our unique asset-light manufacturing model will position FMC Ag Solutions for a strong growth as soon as the market starts to turn.","I want to thank you for your attention. And with this, I am going to turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Could you discuss the credit terms that you extend to farmers in Brazil currently and how do they \u2013 how are they different from what you had earlier this year?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Hi, Aleksey, this is Mark. The credit terms are not fundamentally different this year to any other year. You know very well, all the people that follow the ag space, that a lot of the terms are on crop terms and we currently have the same terms this year that we've had in the past.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. And as a follow-up, can I ask a question on pricing? How do you see the opportunity in raising local prices in Brazil to offset the remaining 50%, 60% of FX headwinds? Could you do some of that in the fourth quarter or early in 2016? Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Price increase in Brazil is very much a factor of weather diary. So what we are saying is, if the real versus dollar is in a stable situation, we will, over time, recover a very large part of what we have lost in currency. Now, our ability to do it will go anywhere from six months to a year-and-a-half, two years, depending upon the market channel and the demand. What we have visibility for right now is the fourth quarter. So we believe in a stable currency environment, what we just said is, we'll recover about 40% of the currency impact in the fourth quarter. That's what we have put into the fourth quarter forecast and we believe it's highly achievable.","The question mark for us and the most interesting conversation we will have in February, when we announce our Q4 results and forecast for 2016, is, is the real showing sign of stability where it is today and what is the market demand, because that's when the opportunity comes to increase price without suffering the negative impact of currency. So right now, focused on fourth quarter, we will recover about 40% and then filling up the gap will depend upon the stability we'll see in the real.","Operator","And your next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. You've expressed some caution about the outlook for next year in crop chemicals globally because of channel inventories. Can you specifically discuss the level of channel inventories in Brazil as well as in the U.S.?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Hi. Yeah. Don, it's Mark. I'll start with Brazil first. You've seen a lot in the press recently about channel inventories predominantly around insecticides and herbicides in Brazil. Insecticides due to weather and low pest pressure, so we see elevated channel there. In North America, it really depends on the types of products. Certainly, insecticides, we see higher channel inventories both for foliar and soil insecticides. We've had basically three years of very low pest pressure and so you could imagine, the channel inventories builds up there. For us, we had a very good year in North America with our pre herbicides, the Authority brands and we see normal to slightly higher channel inventories there. And then on fungicides, fungicides are pretty normal in North America.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And as a follow-up, does the expansion of Intacta acreage this fall in Brazil have any impact on your soy insecticide business down there?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Intacta has been in the market now \u2013 this is, I think, its third year. Obviously, the acreage is growing. It does impact the number of sprays for certain types of pests, and yes, we along with others are impacted there. But we have other products that take out the secondary pests. For instance, our TALISMAN insecticide is very good on stink bugs, which is a growing pest in soy area in Brazil. So we expect to see increase in usage of those types of products. So there are always pluses and minuses when you see these new traits introduced.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So we saw a pretty solid \u2013 or you guys saw a pretty solid jump that you articulated in the cash flow for 2015. I guess, do you have \u2013 can you give us some granularity if the Ag markets play out the way that right now you're expecting them to, what can we see in terms of further cash improvements in 2016?","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's Paul. Let me try and tackle that one. Most of the opportunities I'm sure you're aware are comes through our Brazil receivables balance and as we looked into next year and obviously we're not forecasting a rapid recovery in demand in Brazil, we would expect to see the trend that we've seen in the first three quarters of this year of releasing cash out of working capital continue. We've I think been pretty consistent when we've said that to unwind the positions that we have as the market slows down will take at least a full season, which takes you into sort of second quarter and third quarter of next year before we'll start to see the benefits. As I said, we've generated from working capital across the business something in the region of about $75 million of cash out of our working capital. I would expect that we could do much better than that, if the market continues as it is, because we will start to see an acceleration of the release in the Brazilian receivables balances.","John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, with regard to the head count reductions in Brazil, I mean Brazil has been one of the crown jewels and obviously it's a tough market right now, but it may not always be. I guess, how do you gauge or how do you set up a system where you don't end up kind of tarnishing permanently the crown jewel by cutting too deeply into the heads?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It is a very important question. The work we did was really to preserve the ability of Brazil to grow and to grow earnings. So the way we did it, we didn't go at it by cutting costs and that's it. As you can see, our Brazil organization has evolved over the last two years into an organization which has used maybe a bit too much its position of strength with customers to increase sales in more generic product.","Now, in normal times, with the real at that time pretty strong, it made more sense. We were making some profit out of it, but I can tell you, in a situation like the one we have today, the terms which are given to farmers, the weakness in the real do not allow us to have those kind of sales because they do not bring any profit to the company once all of the costs are removed, including the cost of hedging.","So what we did? The first step we did was to remove sales, and we say, this year it's going to be about $250 million, to remove sales we had which were not profitable. Once you adjust to a size, where you pretty much have a country reaching sales about 60% of what it was before, then you can adjust your technical sales and, most importantly, support functions to serve a business, which is smaller but having the same type of profit and much higher margin. So that's the way we did it. We believe, we protected through this process our technology group, our research group, our technical sales but really eliminated all of the non-profitable sales and used that to reduce organization. We believe that we will be at least as capable of organization to benefit from growth in Brazil than we were before, if not better.","Operator","Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. Hey, Paul, I really appreciated the discussion on working capital savings and noticed that inventory is down $100 million sequentially to a level of $900 million. A couple of questions. Where can you get that to? And then also on the discussion on the cost reductions, the increase to $140 million to $160 million. What is the expense associated and the pace of those expenses necessary to achieve those cost reduction targets?","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me pass over to Mark first to talk about inventory, because most of the opportunities in inventory are going to be in the Ag business.","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah. As you could see, we have reduced inventories. And what we are doing is we're taking advantage of the Cheminova acquisition to look at the combined businesses and understand the flow of materials. We are essentially reducing the channel inventories within our own supply chain. So we're not putting customer supply at risk and we're tending to shift products away from formulating ahead of the season to formulating at the latest possible time. So we're carrying less formulated inventory, but we're carrying active ingredient inventory, which allows us to reduce the total amount but still have flexibility at the customer level. So it's been successful so far. We have more programs in place. I can't actually, Frank, give you a number for the reduction, but you will see it go down as we head into 2016 and probably through the first half of the year.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Frank, let me take your question on the cost to realize the synergy. The cost to realize the total $140 million to $160 million of synergy, which of course, includes all of the costs for the integration of Cheminova consulting costs. So it's not the cost which is only associated to the incremental part. The total costs for the $140 million to $160 million will be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We have, of that cost, about $65 million were spent so far in the process. And most of the rest of the spending will take place in 2016 and a very large part in the first half of 2016.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Terrific. And coming back, Mark, on the Ag side, Pierre mentioned that there was a holdup in Argentina to receive some approvals. And I was wondering if you guys could give a little more color on that and what the order of magnitude opportunity that could present for you if and when you do get those approvals?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah. We have \u2013 Frank, we have ongoing business in Argentina and essentially what we do is, we currently import fully formulated materials into the country. The Argentine government has changed some of the rules where it's a little more difficult to get fully formulated products in. So we are looking at a strategy in Argentina where we will import the active ingredients and then formulate in Argentina itself. That should allow us more flexibility in terms of taking advantage of the market down there.","For us, that market is pre herbicides for soy, a big market for us. We use our Authority brands based upon sulfentrazone. Currently, today, we are in the $80 million to $100 million of revenue range. We see that growing despite a difficult market. So it's significant for us. Getting the import licenses has been frankly a bit of a pain over the last year or so, but eventually, that will free up because the growers down there do need the technology to get the highest yields for especially the raw crops of soybeans.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. So two questions. One, as you look at the corporate cost reduction, what happens once you resume, you get back on a growth trajectory in 2017, 2018? Do you see that being a flat run rate or should it start growing in line with sales?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So the change we are making really is a very sustainable change. So \u2013 of course, there is always inflationary cost, but those are not cost reduction, which are temporary holding back on hiring people. Those are fundamental change in our processes, the way we operate, benefiting from the synergies of Cheminova, so those are permanent change which are to remain. The spending has to remain at the same level when we go back on a top line growth.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just putting together all the factors you called out, it seems as if \u2013 just to be clear on the message \u2013 that there is a tailwind of about $150 million to $175 million for your EBITDA in 2016, but then you have your FX and the contraction in the crop section chemicals to offset, is there anything else in terms of possible tailwinds that you sort of see as a possible swing factor?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The big tailwind \u2013 as you say, we released all of the numbers we see which we control and we feel very comfortable to deliver. Then, there is the question of growth synergies with Syngenta, we are very careful with \u2013 sorry, is it Syngenta \u2013 with Cheminova. We have a difficulty to really quantify that. We know it's happening, we know it's in line with our expectation. But the problem is when you are in a down market, to requantify growth synergies is always difficult. So there is growth synergies which we have not factored here. There is growth for a specific product where we have very strong market demand.","And the last one which could be significant is price increase depending upon FX, but that's a difficult one to forecast, because if FX stays where it is today and there is a decent fourth quarter this year, which mean, even in the slightly down market, we will have opportunities to increase price in Brazil to recover the gap we have today. But if we continue to have a volatile real next year, we're going to be back in the situation which will be challenging. So, hopefully, by the time we get to the February call, we will know if we have full month or not of real stability and then we should be able to make a little bit better of a prediction around price. So it's a specific growth on the technical product, specific growth synergies with Cheminova and price would be a tailwind you could have in addition to what you see here.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And then, probably, can you give any granularity around taking the Cheminova products and relaunching them in the U.S. progress estimate or when that should become a material call-out?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah, Lawrence. This is Mark. We are obviously in negotiations now for the 2016 season in North America and this will be the first time we've had the portfolio of Cheminova to sell to the major distributors and co-ops. We are focusing on the fungicide portfolio that Cheminova brought to us. They have some excellent products there that we've not had access to. So they will be put into our programs and then there are some other herbicides that Cheminova brought that we will also be putting into the program. So early stages as we are today but as we've always said, we believe that one of the reasons for the acquisition to be strategic in North America was our access to the major co-ops and distribution. We are taking advantage of that and we will be selling those fungicides and herbicides through that channel.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Peter Butler from Glen Hill Investments.","Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investment Research","Good morning. Good morning. Pierre, if this was the third quarter 2016 conference call, obviously in late next year, what would you guys be hoping for to see in a relatively good case entering 2017? The odds on having a surprisingly good rebound in earnings in 2017?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Peter, the way we are looking at where we are today \u2013 and I have to say that it feels like we are right now at a position of stability going forward for the company. I think we have infrastructure in place, the integration is well advanced, the cost savings are coming as we are expecting. So the first step for us, beside delivering on Q4, is really to position FMC for earning growth regarding of the market demand in 2016. That's why we started to try to give a sense for the earnings driver we control, which we expect to participate in the earnings growth for the company next year.","Your question is the right one in terms of the market demand. In the third quarter or when we are talking about the third quarter results, if we see a situation which starts to unlock in Brazil and Latin America, it will be the definitive signal that the turn of the market is going to take place in 2017. If it is the case, then we are in a strong position because, by that time, integration will be finished and our cost structure will be very, very solid, will be lean. Without losing potential for growth, our portfolio technically will be strong and we have new product coming from technology in 2017, 2018, and 2019.","So \u2013 but that's when you are going to get your first signal. If we see a Q3-Q4 very challenging in Brazil and Latin America, then we'll have to understand where is the channel in other countries because then you've to have to worry that's going to be slow recovery in 2017. We are still thinking right now all the indicators are pointing toward a 2017 recovery, but you are correct that third quarter call next year will be \u2013 we should have a better indication.","Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investment Research","Okay. Thanks for the help, Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs.","Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Pierre, there's been a lot of increasing chatter about the need for consolidation in the agricultural chemical space. And one of the larger companies in that space, last week, mentioned that every company is talking to each other in this environment. Just wondered if you could comment on that, if you're kind of having any discussions with folks and I guess given your balance sheet probably not in a position to do any acquiring, but do you see yourself as a target and would you entertain anyone in those discussions?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there is no questions that there is lots of talk which are going on in the industry, which will most likely lead to some sort of consolidation. I think everybody is talking to everybody and everybody is watching what everybody else is doing. So right now it's like playing chess, everybody is making a move and waiting. Lots of discussion are taking place. How this is going to unfold? I don't think many people know it. I don't even know if anybody know, but certainly there is discussion which will lead to some consolidation.","Where FMC stands in such a situation? First of all, we believe we are a strong company which can strive no matter what is the results for the company, but we will be doing good for our shareholders. So, what is right for shareholders, what is right for employees and what is right for our customer is what we will do, but we know we have a strong responsibility to all the shareholders. All I can tell you is the only thing I can tell you for sure is we are not an active buyer of a large company. I don't think today it would be reasonable.","We made our move, we've acquired Cheminova. We believe we have a strong geographical footprint and we don't have the balance sheet to make a major acquisition. So, for us, we are in the execution phase. Now, if two companies get together and there is antitrust issues and they have to drop, sell some product or technology which are of interest to us, absolutely, we will look into buying those technologies, if they fit our portfolio, but that's about the limit of our productivity in term of being on the acquiring side.","Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Just one last one, if I could, on the \u2013 I appreciate the increased disclosure on the slides, with the Ag volumes showing them down 25% there, just wondered if you could break that out. How much of that was impacted by divestments? And then maybe if you could give some color regionally, if there are any pockets of strength within that number.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think if you look at the 20%, 25% reduction, it's a reduction about $215 million of sales for the business. There is two buckets to it \u2013 there is about \u2013 there is the third-party sales, which we walked away from in Brazil and that's about $120 million. And the rest are just volume we lost about $95 million across the world, which are much more linked to the market. If you look at the $44 million, I would say three quarters of that number is earnings loss, which are coming from the $95 million, more the market-driven losses, where maybe one fourth of the $10 million is linked to the $120 million of third-party sales we voluntarily walked away from. In general, most of the loss of sales took place in Latin America and mostly Brazil, overall, and especially because that's a place we've walked away from third-party. We also saw reduction of sales in other regions of the world.","Channel inventories are pretty high in North America and in Europe. Remember, we also had the situation where we are going to direct model in Europe, so we're going to go. We have sales which are being moved from this year into next year. So overall, it's across the board. The big difference I'd say, which is very important is the sales loss outside of Brazil and Latin America are generating very little earnings loss. We believe our earnings are essentially flat outside of Brazil around the world. And then, for some reasons, we have much more leverage around large facilities, cost control in North America, in London, or in other places in Asia. So that's the overall picture.","Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the conference call over to Ms. Alisha Bellezza, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Ms. Bellezza, you may begin.","Alisha Bellezza","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FMC Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who will review our third quarter performance and business segment results; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will present select financial results. Pierre will conclude with our 2013 outlook. Following his comments, we'll be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President, FMC Minerals; and Mike Smith, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition, to address your questions.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's conference call, are provided on our website. Our current 2013 outlook statement, which provides guidance for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2013, can also be found on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Alisha, and good morning, everyone.","Let's begin with the third quarter results.","Total company sales of $957 million increased $136 million or 16% versus the third quarter last year, led by strong performance in our Agricultural Solutions segment. Regionally, company sales were up 29% in Latin America, 11% in North America, 8% in EMEA and 6% in Asia.","Compared to the same period last year, gross margin of $307 million was up by 3%. SG&A and R&D expenses of $144 million were up 4%. Adjusted operating profit of $163 million was up 2%. Adjusted earnings of $110 million were up 3%.","Earnings per diluted share of $0.82 per share were up 7% compared to a year ago quarter.","Now let me turn to segment performance, starting with the Agricultural Solutions. Third quarter sales were $530 million, up 25% on the previous year. Segment earnings for the quarter were $114 million, 13% over the previous year, as volume growth was partially offset by regional mix, investments in growth initiatives and unfavorable currency impact.","The Latin American season began strong with a rebound in Brazil's cotton acreage and their expanded participation in soybeans. In Asia, our direct market access efforts contributed to continued sales growth, while weaker pest pressures in North America compared to last year reduced rescue insecticide demand.","We continue to outpace market growth. The combination of our market positions, technically advantaged products and strong customer relationships drove sales and earnings growth in the third quarter. M&A and strategic partnerships have played an important role in our ag solutions Vision 2015 growth strategy, and the third quarter was no exception. We announced 3 transaction during the last few month that will support near- and long-term earnings momentum. In August, we signed a licensing agreement with Belchim Crop science for access to valifenalate. This product is another addition to our expanding fungicide portfolio used on high-value crops. It is already registered and sold in several countries, and efforts are underway to continue global expansion.","As we look toward the end of the decade and beyond, we believe growers will need a combination of synthetic chemistry and biologically based products to enhance yields and prevent resistance. Earlier this quarter -- earlier this month, we completed 2 important transactions which together create the foundation for a new biological crop protection platform. The ag biological market is estimated at about $1.5 billion to $2 billion today and is expected to grow 10% to 15% per year through the rest of this decade and beyond. This is why we think now is the right time to invest in the biological space. As many of you are already aware, we apply a unique business model in the crop protection chemicals space that helps us meet the needs of grower worldwide. As we enter the biological arena, we have taken another unique approach to building our capabilities.","We have partnered with Chr. Hansen, the biosciences company with industry-leading expertise in screening, fermentation and process scale-up. Over the last several years, we've had a successful and productive relationship with Chr. Hansen on several projects. They are a first-class organization with deep expertise in biological, and this new alliance represents the natural evolution of our relationship.","We have also acquired the assets of the Center for Agricultural and Environmental Biosolutions. This organization, based in the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, has amassed an extensive library of microorganism and a pipeline of biological products in various stages of development. This acquisition also brings proprietary discoveries and screening technologies intellectual properties and a team of scientists with a strong background in biological. We are building a novel end-to-end biological crop protection platform by bringing together Chr. Hansen's biological capabilities and fermentation expertise, CAEB's extensive library of microorganisms and product pipeline; and FMC's core strength in formulation science, registration, field development and marketing. This biological discovery and development model will allow us, FMC, to exclusively introduce novel products through our global market access.","Let me now turn to our Health and Nutrition segment. For the quarter, sales of $190 million were 10% higher than last year, with segment earnings of $41 million, up 2% year-on-year. We generated volume increases in our food business, price increases across our core businesses and partial quarter contributions from Epax acquisition. These were partially offset by lower volumes in pharmaceutical markets, spending in recently acquired businesses, Manufacturing Excellence investments and increases in certain raw material costs. Last week, we announced price increases to offset these raw materials costs.","In our food business, growth was driven mainly by strong demand for functional ingredients in Asia, the majority of which was MCC. Over the last several years, the functional ingredients market in Asia has grown 12% annually. Our new MCC Thailand manufacturing facility will support this critical growing market. Construction is on-schedule and the plant is expected to be online late next year.","In the pharma market, we saw a deceleration in the quarter, the pace of which caught us a little by surprise. With first half revenue growth ahead of historical levels, we expected a slower second half of the year. However, it appears that the slowdown all arrived in a single month. Since then, we have seen demand patterns return to normal levels such that, for the full year, we expect growth of around 6% over 2012. This is still twice what we typically see for the industry as a whole.","In the third quarter, the Epax Omega-3 business operated as part of FMC for 2 month. We are pleased with the performance so far, and customer reaction to the acquisition has been very positive. As I have described before, we are focused on the safe and successful startup of our second Omega-3 plant in Seal Sands, U.K. This facility will produce ultrahigh concentration pharmaceutical- and nutraceutical-grade products using proprietary technology. Startup plans are on-track and we expect production from this facility will contribute to fourth quarter results.","Finally, you may be aware that, on October 15, a major earthquake occurred in the Philippines not far from our Health and Nutrition manufacturing facility in Cebu. Thankfully, no employees or contractors were injured. However, operation were temporarily suspended to assess potential facility damage. We are pleased to report that, as of yesterday, production at the Cebu site was safely returned to full operation and the business impact has been nominal.","Now moving on to Minerals. Third quarter revenues of $238 million increased by 6% over the previous year, and segment earnings of $28 million were down 20% compared to the same period last year. Volume gains in soda ash and Lithium were offset by lower average soda ash export pricing compared to last year.","In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $182 million was 5% higher than last year, the result of additional volume in the quarter. Current alkali market performance is consistent with our expectations. ANSAC export pricing increased sequentially in Asian market, where prices are slowly increasing. ANSAC will continue to implement the price increases announced early this year and we expect to continue to see upward movements. But on a year-over-year basis, average export pricing remained significantly below 2012 level and resulted in lower profitability for alkali compared to the third quarter of 2012.","Compounding the unfavorable pricing comparison, our longwall operations encountered unusually poor mine conditions for the quarter. The longwall panel we were mining was filled with insoluble material. These poor geological conditions are extremely rare, and the [indiscernible] materials significantly disrupted both the mine and plant operation. Given these conditions, we elected to perform additional maintenance on several mechanical and volume [ph] operations at our Green River site, resulting in onetime cost in the quarter.","In total, these one-off factors resulted in a $6 million hit to the segment earnings. The good news is that we have finished mining in that section and we are currently completing the scheduled longwall move to the next mine section.","In Lithium, revenues of $57 million were up 8% compared to last year, but earnings were flat year-on-year in both 2012 and this year. Third quarter financial results were depressed due to the operational issues that we have discussed. However, for the second consecutive quarter, plant operation in Argentina performed exactly as planned. During our second and third quarter shutdowns, we implemented process changes that fixed our operational issues. In September, we sustained production rates 25% to 30% above pre-expansion periods. These rates were confirmed through the month of October, and we are confident that our operational problems are firmly behind us.","We are now increasing our focus on the commercial side of the business to maximize profit from additional available volume and downstream product mix. Looking ahead, we expect that our lower manufacturing cost and optimized product mix will return Lithium to mid-teens EBIT margins in the fourth quarter.","In summary, Agricultural Solutions continued to outperform the market, and we invested in a new platform that will position FMC to become a market leader in biological crop protection. Health and Nutrition grew with contributions from the food and Epax businesses, and we remain on track with the construction of a new MCC Thailand plant. And in Minerals, despite lower year-on-year segment results, Lithium successfully completed operational improvements at the Argentina facilities. And soda ash pricing sequentially improved in Asia, with market indications pointing to continued price recovery.","It should be clear that this was a difficult quarter. We encountered unforeseen headwinds in currency movements and one-off costs in alkali that reduced our operating earnings by almost $20 million. And yet, we still delivered EPS that is well within our guidance range. This performance gives me even greater confidence that the targets for 2014 and 2015, which we outlined during our last earnings call, are firmly in sight.","Let me now turn the call over to Paul for a discussion of our financial position and an update for our M&A activities. Paul?","Paul W. Graves","Thanks, Pierre.","Today, I'll review some of the financial highlights of the quarter, including capital additions, M&A activities and how we're now accounting for the Peroxygens activities. And I'll also describe the impact of foreign exchange volatility on the quarter.","So let me start with the accounting treatment of Peroxygens. Now the divestiture process itself remains on-track, and we expect to announce the results of this process by the end of the year. Now all of the financial information that I'll refer to today excludes items associated with Peroxygens, which is now accounted for as a discontinued operation. This is the first quarter that we're presenting our results this way, with the reclassification also impacting our balance sheet. You'll note from our financial schedules that we have taken a charge to write down the assets of the business as required under current GAAP rules. This write-down was driven in large part by the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments or CTA which currently sit on our balance sheet. And these CTA are not strictly a Peroxygens matter, as they are related to the former FMC Foret operations.","When we restructured Foret a few years ago, a relatively large CTA balance was left behind and will now have to be written off through the income statement when we exit Peroxygens. We are required by accounting rules to include this CTA balance when we assess the recoverability of the assets held for sale. So we, therefore, reduced the value of these assets by approximately $50 million after tax. There are no cash implications of this write-down and this does not impact our adjusted earnings or adjusted EPS.","Capital additions in the third quarter were $75 million, and year-to-date, we have spent $153 million on capital projects. We now expect that, for the full year, capital spending will be approximately $300 million compared to our original expectation of $350 million. This reduction is due to 2 primary factors: First, we are now excluding the spending related to Peroxygens. And second, we are delivering many of our projects for less than originally budgeted. So basically, we are completing the planned investments at a lower aggregate cost than originally budgeted.","From an M&A perspective, we announced 2 acquisitions, the valifenalate and CAEB; and 1 strategic alliance with Chr. Hansen. We have not disclosed financial details on these transactions. And while none of them involve meaningful upfront cash outlays, they will all require additional investments largely in the form of future R&D spending.","So now let me comment on the impact of foreign currency movements during the quarter. We saw some large and rapid swings in certain currencies. Specifically, changes in the exchange rates of Brazil, India, Australia, Indonesia and Japan relative to the U.S. dollar were unfavorable to our results. In total during the quarter, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced our earnings by approximately $12 million or approximately $0.06 per diluted share, all of which was reflected in the results of our ag solutions segment. While our earnings are typically protected from major currency movements through a combination of currency hedging and pricing actions, the movements we saw in the quarter were more rapid than usual. We are confident that we will be able to adjust pricing to reflect these currency movements in the coming periods.","With that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Paul.","Let's now turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2013.","In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.90 to $1 per diluted share, a 23% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2012 at the midpoint of the range.","Agricultural Solutions earnings will be up in the mid- to high-teens percent, reflecting strong growth in Latin American markets and potentially early season demand in North America. In Health and Nutrition, core business growth, combined with Epax contributions, will increase quarterly earnings in the mid 20s% over last year. And in Minerals, we expect continued sequential improvement in Asia soda ash export pricing, as well as improved Lithium margins. However, lower average export soda ash prices will decrease segment earnings by mid-single-digit percent compared to the fourth quarter 2012.","Overall, our full year forecast remains consistent with the previous quarter's earning call. We expect adjusted earnings to be between $3.74 and $3.84 per diluted share, a 12% increase over 2012 at the midpoint of the range.","We anticipate another strong finish in Agricultural Solutions based on favorable market conditions and share gains in Latin America. Brazil's cotton planted area has rebounded, and we are gaining share in the rapidly expanding Latin American soybean market. Our newly introduced crop protection products are growing globally, and demand for our resistance management products in North America remains strong.","Taking these factors together, we anticipate segment earnings will be up mid- to high-teens percent compared to 2012.","In Health and Nutrition, we expect segment earnings to increase in the high-single-digit percent, driven by continued growth in our core market segment and partial year benefits from our Epax acquisition. This will be offset somewhat by cost associated with acquisition and Manufacturing Excellence initiatives.","Minerals segment's earnings are expected to be down in the mid 20s% due to lower average export soda ash prices and the impact from Lithium's operational challenges earlier this year. We are confident that our Lithium operational issues are behind us, and we expect Lithium operating margin to improve in the fourth quarter, a positive sign as we head into 2014.","In Alkali Chemicals, we expect the North American market will realize a low- to mid-single-digit dollar per tons increase in pricing versus the prior year, with volumes also slightly up. We anticipate Asian export market to sequentially improve, but the pace of the improvement remains difficult to predict. Finally, Manufacturing Excellence program in alkali will continue to deliver additional production volume that will offset some price weakness.","Now I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Chris Perrella, on for Kevin. Pierre, could you size, I guess, your ag biologicals business and maybe go into more detail on how the -- you bring a unique manufacturing process to that? Is that the relationship with Chr. Hansen growing the microorganisms that you have gotten from CAEB?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, in term of the manufacturing process, we intend to develop the product with our CAEB acquisition. And the fermentation process for manufacturing will be done within Chr. Hansen factory, so they will be producing the product for us, which will then be formulated and commercialized. From a size standpoint, I think, for us, we are looking at a nascent market. What is very important is, when you look at the contribution in this market, we are talking a 2017 to 2020 to really see sales taking off, but it is not of a major impact in the short term.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And just a quick follow-up. The overall crop protection market, what do you see as the growth in that market this year and with the recognition you're doing appreciably better than that?","Pierre R. Brondeau","This year, if we look at the crop protection market, the chemicals part, I would say to meet single-digit market growth globally. So 5% will be the number. And that's -- and once again, that's the market, that's not our performance. We are growing much faster than the market growth.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.","Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","The -- my first question is on the currency headwind. I'd be curious how much of the -- of your guidance range was altered by the currency. You noted $0.06 in 3Q, how about in Q4?","Pierre R. Brondeau","So in Q4, I think the thing which was surprising -- and I'll let Paul add to my comment, but what happened, it was a very abrupt movement, especially in Brazil where the currency changed and hit us by about $13 million. So $0.06 in the third quarter was the currency movement in ag, which we've heard [ph] back. And today, we -- as I say, we are about on top of our hedge. So we don't have much of an impact forward in the fourth quarter. Paul, if you want to add anything to that.","Paul W. Graves","Look, I think Pierre just sized it perfectly. It's -- there's no adjustment in the Q4 forecast to reflect expectation of further foreign currency movements. And then when we look at where the rates are today, they've been seesawing around a little bit, but we don't see today the same impact coming through in Q4 that caught us in Q3.","Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And my follow-up question is on North American ag. Last year at this time, we had an early harvest, high grain prices, and it seemed to have pulled demand in Q4 through the dealer channel to be fully stocked with the crop protection chemicals. I'd be curious how you're seeing the demand environment from the dealer perspective as we look at Q4 of this year given those factors are -- have reversed.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Mark?","Mark A. Douglas","Michael, this is Mark. Yes, you're absolutely right. From last year, it was a very positive start to the season. And actually, we're seeing very similar trends. I mean, from our perspective, you know that we're heavily involved in the resistance side of North America. So for us, the season does come early as we look at corn rootworm resistance and putting our products down. So for us, it is a little early at this point, but Q4 could be very good for North America as we roll into the early part of the season.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Sandy Klugman with Susquehanna Financial.","Sandy H. Klugman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A question for Mark on North American ag. You've obviously seen strong herbicide demand to combat glyphosate-resistant weeds. Looking forward, how do you anticipate that this demand is going to be impacted by the launch of Dicamba-tolerant and 2,4-D-tolerant traits?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, obviously, resistance has been very important for the selective herbicides that we have. We don't see that slowing down at all, even with the introduction of new traits. What we do see is the resistant acres continuing to develop, especially for glyphosate, and we will be part of that program. Obviously, resistance does tend to come rather quickly now, we all know that. After a number of years, we see resistance building across a number of the regions, so we would expect that growth to continue as we move forward over the next few years.","Sandy H. Klugman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, great. And just a similar question on capture. I mean, you have more hybrids with dual modes of action against below-ground pests. You have future commercializations, such as non-CRW III product, which is going to use RNAi technology as another mode of action against corn rootworms. Do you see any threats from these products going forward?","Mark A. Douglas","Well, Sandy, it is a competitive market out there, but we were one of the first in with a patented product for the application side, so we took significant market share. We continue to see that grow. And we're certainly not sitting on our laurels in terms of how we develop that segment and make it easier to use. If you think about how fast the planting occurred in this season given the weather conditions, our products had to go down in an easy manner so the growers could use them very easily. We're going to progress that, so yes, there will be more competition, but I'm very confident with the branding that we have in the marketplace, our ability to capture new acres and bringing new technologies to play, that we'll continue to grow our share.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question on the Health and Nutrition side with the kind of shock, it sounded like, on the pharma dip down and then, I guess, it sounds like it came back up. What drove that? What's going on in that business? And how should we think about the volatility in that going forward?","Pierre R. Brondeau","John, I think it was a fairly unusual situation. It was an order pattern. And then we actually saw a very strong first couple of quarters, which were out of norm. We were expecting a slowdown and just as people were -- in their manufacturing were stocking more product than needed looking at the growth of the industry. But usually, when this kind of situation happen, you see a -- things are being recalibrated over a longer period of time. For some reason, some of our very key customers, and large customers, had a pretty abrupt control of stock, and all of that happened during the month of August. So that was -- the biggest surprise for us was not the fact that the second half would be growing slower than the first half, which was above 10% growth rate, which is above our normal rate for the food business, but the speed at which they did their inventory correction. It was abrupt, but we are back to normal patterns. So if you look, the year is going to close very much where we're expecting it, around a 6% growth rate, but it's got to be done with a profile which is, from a quality basis, a bit unusual with a 10% growth rate, 10% or 11% in the first half and maybe a single digit in the second half.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, when I look at the balance sheet, you had a pretty big spike up in your short-term debt. And I know, I guess, you had indicated earlier in the year that if you thought Peroxygens was a lock, you'd start buying back stock pretty aggressively kind of knowing that and you'd take on the debt to do that. Is that what that debt's for? Or is there something else behind it? Because it does seem like a pretty big, big surge. And I guess, how should we think about future share repurchases if that was what it was -- what was driving it?","Paul W. Graves","Sure. Let me answer that one. So the spike in the short-term debt is as follows: First of all, and let me just touch on each of the points, we bought Epax and we did a share repurchase, as you know, in the second quarter that we announced. Both of those were funded in the short-term debt markets. And the reason for that is that we launched a new commercial paper program earlier this year, and we wanted to make sure that we got that program up and running. We had enough volume going through that CP program to establish our name in the market. It is certainly a much higher level than we will intend to keep it at. You should not assume that short-term debt level stays at that -- at those elevated levels that you see today. We have obviously proceeds to come in from the Peroxygens divestment. And we will be relooking at a mix of short- and long-term debt, as we always do, later this year and into early next year, to make sure that we don't get those balances to a place that we're not comfortable with.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Michael Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of ag, can you give us an update on how the fungicide business is doing this year, as one of the areas of growth? Maybe size it by the end of the year. And what type of run rate growth we'll see going forward?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, thank you, Mike. I'll let Mark talk about it. But it's one of the positive developments, part of our -- one of our strategic thrusts to grow our fungicide market. We've made some acquisition of key actives from there, and those are very successful. So Mark, if you want to give some color to the questions.","Mark A. Douglas","Yes. Mike, as you know, we've been putting a lot of effort behind growing the fungicide side of our business. It is where I would say our portfolio needs the largest part of growth. It's typically about 8% to 9% of our overall portfolio, and obviously, we want to get that up to a number that's more representative of where the market is. I would say we're having great success in Brazil, especially on soy, with newly introduced products. We're seeing activities in Europe as well. Overall, Asia should be a good market for us. We've got new products going in there. The products we bought from Bayer CropScience are seeing acceleration in China, especially this year. So overall, I would say we're very confident that, that market will continue to grow for us. It's becoming meaningful. It will become more so as we go through the rest of this decade, for sure.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Pierre, when you think about Health and Nutrition, you've got some capacity coming on stream heading into '14. You had some costs and unusual order patterns here in '13. And you're making investments from -- for some of your businesses. What type of growth rate do you expect that segment to return to as we head into next year or over the next couple of years?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Sure, when I look year-on-year, we believe, especially if you include the Epax acquisition, we'll be in the teens, the 10% to 15% growth rates, with the core business if you exclude the acquisition of Epax being in the high single digit. So it is a business today. It's been a business where we've made a lot of investment changes, spent a lot of money in integration and launching the new plant. I think we're going to be demonstrating a very strong performance in the fourth quarter. And we're going to get into the -- into next year, I would strongly hope, with the MCC plants and leveraging the Omega-3 acquisition, that we're going to be in the double-digit growth rates. I know there was -- there is potentially some question around the growth rates of this business for the year, which seems to be a bit lower than what was our guidance at the last quarters, but for -- I'm talking for 2013. We just acquired Epax, and a big part of the growth of the business will come from our new plant, and I think that's where we see -- have some question mark around the timing. We are hoping initially before we did the acquisition and through the due diligence that we could have the startup of the plant around the first quarter. It's looking now as an early November. Everything is going well. The plant, this technology, everything is exactly where we thought. But when you start a new plant, those kind of things happen. So that's the only thing. If you see some changes in our forecast, it's only due to a timing around our Epax plant. So for me, 2014 is the year where this business will benefit from all of the acquisition we've made, as well as investment in the core business, allowing to have the growth we can have.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Pierre, you noted the deceleration in pharmaceutical demand -- it sounds like that's just temporary. Are there any factors that you're concerned about that could be a longer-term concern there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Right now, we do not see anything which would be concerning. I think it was a pattern. We -- one of the issue you have when you're in the pharma business, like we are, we have some very big customers. And if some of those customers would have a very different pattern to order product and then correct on whatever stock they have, you could see some quarterly numbers which would be surprising. I think that the only surprise is some of them over-ordered and changed their -- and corrected their inventory situation very abruptly in a month, which they usually don't do. But I do not see anything which seems to be a general direction for the business. I have to say, and maybe I'll ask Mike to add some color to this comment, I think the order pattern we are seeing now going into the fourth quarter are back to the more normal rates we are expecting for this business.","Michael P. Smith","Yes, that's certainly correct, Pierre. As we have seen our October, sales have rebounded into the more typical growth ranges. And we anticipate that to head right through into through the fourth quarter.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And then just to continue on Health and Nutrition, what raw materials are moving? How much are they moving? And the pricing action that you announced, is that part of the course of normal price increase announcements, or was it kind of an unusual announcement for you?","Michael P. Smith","Well, I think, in general, it was a relatively normal price increase announcement. We are always seeking to ensure we are offsetting the higher input cost. The most significant raw material input cost pressure we're seeing is actually in seaweed, for both our carrageenan and alginate business. So the recent price increase announcements, while wide across our Health and Nutrition business, the largest raw material that we are seeking to offset the impact from are really the seaweed-based raw materials.","Pierre R. Brondeau","On this question, I mean, let me add some numbers. The third quarter, we faced a almost $5 million just for the Health and Nutrition business increasing raw material costs. So that was a headwind. We are used to this kind of fluctuation in this business, and we usually are capable with our technology to push this cost increase into our customers. But every time you have some abrupt change in pricing, you always have a phase where there is a timing issue. And price increase were abrupt this quarter. We announced lately a price increase, and we're going to be recovering what we lost. But it was about $5 million of headwind in the quarter for raw material.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And the last question I have is related to the Lithium process changes. When you talk about being at a run rate that's 25% to 30% above pre-expansion, did you expand your pond capacity by 25% to 30%? Or did the process changes enable higher recovery of lithium from the overall brine stream?","Pierre R. Brondeau","So the way we are operating, actually, it's almost a band of everything. We do have -- we have been expanding our ponds, but we also have some technology for to pre-concentrate the lithium in some pre-concentration ponds. So we are able to feed the columns with higher-concentration products. So it's a combination: it's a process change, a higher lithium concentration and pond expansion. And to give you the numbers just to be very specific, on daily rate, before we were talking about that pre-expansion, we were operating at rates which were around 9.5 tons per day. And we've been operating over the last 2 months, September and October, continually at 12.5 up to 13 tons per day.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","In the ag business, if you look at the share gains you've had this year, if you straight-line them into next year, how much of a tailwind are they? And in the biologicals area, is the longer-term objective to become like a vertically integrated clearing house for biologicals? Or how are you approaching that business model?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Could you repeat the end of your question in biologicals? You just broke a little bit.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Sorry. On the biological, is the longer-term goal to become like a vertically integrated in terms of driving the R&D and the production and the marketing in-house? Or are you going to eventually do an analogy to what you've done on the chemicals side and outsource through tolling agreements?","Pierre R. Brondeau","On the biologicals space, I think we are still operating almost with the kind of business model we have today where we do have -- today, we do have the active ingredients which are produced by toll processors, and then we do the formulation. You can think about a model which is about the same where our partner Chr. Hansen will be the manufacturing arm of the alliance and producing those active ingredients, instead of being chemicals, those actives will be biological, but it will be the same thing. I think the only difference versus our current business model in term of vertical integration is that, today, we do not do active ingredients research per se, where in that case, if you consider the new biological as actives, we will be doing this research. Now it makes sense with our business model because the technology to be developed -- develop active -- biological actives is not as involved, intensive and long as it is for chemicals. So your question is very appropriate. It's not a fundamental change of our vertical integration. We'll still be using a partner to produce the product, but we'll be more involved in the active ingredient research for biological than we have on the chemical front. Mark, do you want to add or ask -- answer the first part of the question, growth rates with the penetration?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, sure. Laurence, to answer your question on the first part, which was the kind of growth rates going forward, when you look at what we've put forward for Vision 2015, and we're still very much on track for that, '14 and '15 have to grow to the mid to high teens, and we still see that going forward. Our run rate for new products introduced keeps climbing year-on-year, and we have a plan by 2015 to be in the 30% to 35% range. A lot of that's through formulation science that we apply into the marketplace, further penetration into soy and other crops around the world. So we feel very good about that growth rate going forward through '14 and '15. On the biologicals front, Pierre pretty much had it nailed. We are going to be in research for biologicals. It's very important for us. We believe it's a much faster approach to bringing new actives to the market. Plus the fact that, with our formulation capabilities and market access, we believe there's a real space and a growing space, so synthetic chemistry and biologicals together. I think they're going to have a synergistic effect, which will bring new modes of action that will allow us to once again expand our market access and penetration.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Peter Butler with Glenn Hill Investments.","Peter Butler","How do you guys see the global soda ash capacity in the second half this year and next year in light of the synthetic producers have very high costs and a very high inflation rate on the costs, and you hear rumbles about shutdowns and et cetera? What does your survey show on capacity coming on here?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Peter. Let me start to answer that, and then I'll ask Ed to complete my answer. But directionally, and that is one of the reasons for which we were able to deliver higher average domestic price here in North America, and we are seeing sequentially, even if it is slower than what we're expecting sequentially increasing price in the export market, and mostly in Asia, it's because we are seeing a tightening of the supply-demand. It is a combination of synthetic plants being shut down. And the latest one were the plants from the announcement from Solvay. Some Chinese plants shut down because of environmental situation. And a demand, the market we are serving, if you look to especially in China, and the growth is being driven by China today, but especially around the glass packaging, flat glass, detergent, those market also have been growing maybe more strongly over the last few months. So we see a tightening of the supply-demand, which is creating an environment where we are able to reestablish pricing which are more in line with the -- with historical pricing. I think the soda ash market is going to grow by 5% this year -- or 3% to 5% this year mostly because of the demand on the end market. Ed, do you want to add something to this...","Edward T. Flynn","Yes. Peter, let me just add a little bit. You're correct on the synthetics, and we've begun to see some of them shut down. Pierre mentioned that Solvay announced the shutdown of their Portugal plant in Q2, Q3. They also announced a rebalancing of their Italy operation around the same time to balance supply and demand. In Australia, Penrice shut down in the third quarter. Also, the Turkish producer Eti Soda announced that their Beypazari expansion will be delayed and won't be fully running until 2016. And they also announced the further expansion of Kazan will be delayed till 2017, 2018. TATA in the U.K. recently announced that they're evaluating shutting down their Winnington, U.K., plant. They haven't made a decision, but they notified the works council. Pierre referenced the environmental issue with the Chinese Hubei plant, which is a 1 million ton plant, was shut down in the third quarter because of a fish kill. And now is running again only at about 30% capacity. You mentioned some rumors. There's a rumor that Qingdao plant in China may shut down, that's an 800,000 ton plant. We did see the Chinese export price rise in September from 1 91 [ph] in August to 1 95 [ph]. And we're seeing Chinese industrial production stop its decline in the first half of the year and is beginning to climb again back over 10 [ph]. And specifics that Pierre discussed on what we're seeing in Chinese domestic demand: Auto production's up 12%, flat glass is up 10%, container demand year-over-year is up 4% and detergent's up 13%. So we're seeing both supply restrictions or shutdowns that I don't believe have worked their way into the marketplace yet in terms of putting less soda ash on the water, and we're seeing demand increase inside of China. I hope that helps.","Peter Butler","Yes, that was very helpful. My follow-up question is -- I guess I can't write fast enough or comprehend. You mentioned that the third quarter was difficult because of unexpected costs. And you mentioned the -- that, in sum, that this cost you $20 million. And then later on, you talked about the currency headwind being something like $12 million or $13 million. Is the $12 million or $13 million currency negative part of the $20 million? Or could you just go through some of the bigger pieces of the $20 million and...","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, Peter. If you look at the headwind, when we talked about $20 million, we were referencing mostly to 2 things: One was the $12 million to $13 million currency impact, and the $6 million onetime costs we had to face in the Minerals business. That was dimensioning. I mean, I could add also we had a $5 million headwind on the raw material pricing for Health and Nutrition. We don't view that as a onetime headwind because we are used to those movements and we will recover that with price increase in the following quarters. And you know that when price will go back down, cost will go back down. We will keep the price up for a little while and get this money back. So the onetime $20 million is mostly the currency. $13 million and the one-off time would be on the Minerals business.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Congrats on getting the Lithium business up and running well in terms of supply. Was very pleased to see that. Can you talk about the demand side of the equation? How undersupplied is that market, room for more? And what your thoughts are there.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. The demand is fairly where we were expecting it. There is -- the market is -- the supply-demand is about balanced. I think we're operating at 85%, about 85% of the demand. So there is no major change in the way we are looking. We still -- I mean, the big question mark is still how big electrical vehicles will be, but it's a post-2015, really, question. The -- I'd say the commercial side is not as much a market change than it is for us to get back in this business with the right mix of product and more sales. We've been under-supplying our customers versus what they wanted for a couple of years or 1.5 years. Most of the contracts are 1-year contracts, so we are working our way back. We do have a very strong reputation around quality and are really viewed as one of the top supplier from a quality standpoint. So some of our customers are more than welcoming us as a strong supplier, but it's more of an efficiency [ph] commercial strategy than it is a supply-demand situation in the market. It's still a market which is growing today in the 6% to 8% range per year.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then obviously, you mentioned before that you're on track for Peroxygens by year end. At this point, are we pretty much -- we're set with the portfolio at FMC. You wouldn't anticipate any other major changes to what we have right now?","Pierre R. Brondeau","For now, no major changes. But as any good management team, we'll always look at our portfolio to make the right decision at the right time. But right now, we have a 3-segment stable organization.","Operator","And at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Brondeau for closing remarks.","Pierre R. Brondeau","All right, thank you very much.","In closing remarks, I would like to say that we are pleased with the performance of the Agricultural Solutions business, which continues to outpace market growth and will deliver the 10th consecutive year of record earnings. We're expanding our portfolio of chemistry and investing in a premier biological platform to ensure we continue to deliver these results. The Health and Nutrition business is well positioned to deliver greater revenue and earnings growth going forward. Our core markets continue to perform well, while our acquisitions, especially Epax, broaden our offerings and contribute to this accelerated earnings growth. Health and Nutrition is on track to deliver a ninth straight year of record earnings performance, and the fourth quarter will demonstrate the momentum in this business, which will continue in 2014.","Our Minerals business is recovering, with export prices increasing and Lithium operational improvements successfully implemented. This business should also experience strong positive momentum going into 2014.","Despite what has been a challenging 2013, we expect to deliver another solid performance, with 13% revenue growth and 12% earnings per share growth.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Alisha Bellezza, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corp. Ms. Bellezza, please begin.","Alisha Bellezza","Thank you, Zachary. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FMC Corp.'s fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who will review our fourth quarter performance and business segment results; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will present select financial results. Pierre will conclude our -- with our 2014 outlook. Following his comments, we'll be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President, FMC Minerals; and Mike Smith, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition, to address your questions.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references.

Our 2014 outlook statement, which provides guidance for the full year and the first quarter of 2014, can also be found on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Alisha, and good morning, everyone. You saw in our release last night that we closed 2013 with a strong performance and adjusted EPS finishing above our guidance range at $1.05 per diluted share. Let me begin my comments with highlights of our 2013 full year performance.","In the early part of 2013, we evaluated our business strategy and made the decision to realign our portfolio. With this decision, we highlighted 2 growth businesses: Agricultural Solutions and Health and Nutrition, and put 2 advantaged commodity businesses under common management in the Minerals segment.","With that realignment, we also began the divestment process for our Peroxygens business, and at the end of the year, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell that business. We expect to close that transaction within the first quarter of this year.","Our external growth efforts continued and resulted in multiple transaction. In particular, we created a new biological platform for ag and acquired Epax, an important platform in Omega-3. We also acquired several additional new technologies that will contribute to ag's growth in future years. Investments in our existing businesses continued in 2013. We began construction of a new MCC facility in town, which will be completed late in 2014.","We completed the restructuring of our Lithium operations, and we introduced new Manufacturing Excellence programs in Alkali, Lithium and Health and Nutrition. Along with these investments, we returned to shareholders $360 million in the form of share repurchases and another $74 million in dividends, taking a total cash return to investors, since 2010, to over $1 billion.","Full year 2013 total company sales of $3.9 billion were up 14% with adjusted earnings up 12%. Earnings per share grew 15% to $3.88 per diluted share, and return on invested capital was almost 20% for the year.","Now turning to fourth quarter performance. Total company sales increased $215 million or 24% to $1.1 billion, a record quarter for us. Regionally, company sales were up 34% in Latin America, 22% in North America, 14% in EMEA and 8% in Asia.","In total, emerging markets represented over 63% of sales in the quarter and grew by 27% year-over-year. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, gross margin of $358 million was up 11%; SG&A and R&D expenses of $167 million were up 8%; adjusted operating profit of $191 million was up 14%; adjusted earnings of $141 million were up 33%; adjusted EPS of $1.05 was up 36%, including an $0.08 benefit from lower taxes that Paul will address in his comments.","Now let me turn to segment performance, starting with Agricultural Solutions. Fourth quarter sales were $678 million, an increase of 38% over last year. Segment earnings were $137 million, up 24% over last year. These results contributed to our 10th consecutive year of record EBIT results and another year of industry-leading margins. This record performance was driven mainly by volume increases around the world. The biggest of these increases were seen in Latin America, where we benefited from increased participation in Brazilian soybean applications, new product introductions and from additional cotton acreage planted. Additionally, we saw strong demand for early-season herbicide and insecticide in North America.","In Asia, we continued to see growth from direct market access positions, while our EMEA market remained essentially flat. Our ag business continues to deliver sustainable growth at rates above the broader market. We believe that the combination of our innovation capabilities and customer relationships set us apart from competitors and will continue to drive our growth.","Now turning to Health and Nutrition. Sales and segment earnings both grew by 13% to $189 million and $40 million, respectively. During our last earnings call, we guided earnings growth to increase in the mid-20s percent range for the fourth quarter. Included in that guidance was the assumption that our Seals Sands facility would start up early in the quarter to become fully operational, and that we would market our first sales of Omega-3 in the quarter. As a reminder, this facility uses new proprietary process technology to produce ultrahigh concentration Omega-3 that will be sold into pharmaceutical markets as an active ingredient in FDA-approved products. The startup of the plant was delayed by approximately 6 weeks, but is now operating as planned. However, the delayed startup meant that commercial sales did not occur during the quarter. We see strong potential for the specific grade of Omega-3 produced at Seals Sands, and we expect that they will increasingly become the standard in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical segment.","During the quarter, we also dealt with 2 natural disasters near our Cebu facility in the Philippines and lost approximately 3 weeks of operation. Our Cebu plant is now operating normally.","In the food businesses, our close technical collaboration with customers in texture and stability applications continue to drive volume growth, while our focus on differentiated technologies ensured that we continued to gain share in natural colors.","In pharmaceutical ingredients, binder and disintegrant demand returned to levels in line with historical patterns. We continue to have the leading market position in this segment, based on our reputation for quality and reliability of supply.","Overall, taking into account the startup delay at Seals Sands and natural disaster disruption, we were pleased with the strong performance from Health and Nutrition as it delivered its ninth consecutive year of record-EBIT results.","Now let me review Minerals. The Minerals segment had strong operational performance in 2013. However, profitability was adversely impacted by factors largely outside of our control. Segment sales of $263 million increased 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2013, while segment earnings of $36 million were down 18% year-over-year.","In Alkali Chemicals, revenues of $192 million were 2% higher than last year, with pricing and volume broadly flat to a year ago. Segment earnings were negatively impacted by completing the move of our longwall operation into a new section of the mine. We continue to see the benefits of Manufacturing Excellence and we are now operating in a section of the mine with more typical geological conditions, and the result, we are now producing at record levels. Our average price per ton was approximately 1% higher than fourth quarter 2012.","Export pricing gain were strongest in Asia, with mid-teens percent increases sequentially. Prices realized by FMC in Asia are now up 20% from the start of 2013. We are encouraged by the fact that the fourth quarter was the first period in 2013 in which our average export prices were higher on a year-over-year basis. Although the data is not directly comparable, Chinese government export data also revealed the same trend, with Chinese export prices increasing approximately 10%. We remain optimistic that export prices will continue to increase, but the pace and magnitude remains uncertain.","In Lithium, revenues of $71 million increased by 5% over the fourth quarter of 2012. Production rates were consistent with the rates achieved in the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter 2012, the benefits of higher operating rates were partially offset by changes in product mix. The fourth quarter was by far the strongest quarter in 2013, and we expect sales and profitability to continue to improve in each successive quarter in 2014.","While Paul will address foreign exchange implication in more detail lately -- later, let me briefly comment on the potential impact of the more rapid devaluation of the Argentine peso that we have seen recently. There is no doubt that a faster pace of devaluation should help offset the cost inflation we have seen over the past several years. In general, we believe this devaluation will have a positive impact on the profitability of our Lithium business.","In summary, in 2013, Agricultural Solutions and Health and Nutrition delivered strong performance and growth. Our new product introductions and deep customer relationships in ag helped us gain share and take advantage of the market condition.","In Health and Nutrition, strong demand drove increased volume for food and pharmaceutical ingredients, and we added an Omega-3 platform with our Epax acquisition. In Minerals, we resolved operational issues and achieved our target expansion in Lithium. We saw the first signs of improved export pricing and delivered increased production volume in soda ash.","As we look at where we finished 2013, we believe that we are still aligned with our Vision 2015 objective. Return on capital at almost 20% remains above our mid-teens target. We have already returned over the target of $1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. Ag has performed incredibly well and is now ahead of the original Vision 2015 plan. Health and Nutrition has demonstrated strong traction and is right on top of its Vision 2015 target. Lithium is turning the corner, and we expect it to more than double earnings in 2014. Alkali plant operations and volume are very strong. Domestic pricing is solid, so export pricing in soda ash is the only outstanding variable.","Overall, we are on track with the Vision 2015 plan. I will come back to this in more detail after Paul has discussed the financial highlights. Paul, over to you.","Paul W. Graves","Thanks, Pierre. Today, I'll review some of the financial highlights and will discuss some of our expectations for 2014. I will cover cash flow, the corporate tax rate and the difference between our GAAP and adjusted earnings, and I'll also cover the impact of foreign currency movements on our recent and future earnings. And finally, I'll review our capital deployment and recent financing activity.","First of all, let me highlight the key cash flow numbers. Excluding nonoperating expenses, primarily tax and interest, our operating cash flow was approximately $580 million, an increase of $53 million over 2012. Our cash provided by operating activities was $379 million, a decrease of $43 million. This reduction was solely due to increased cash taxes. We utilized the last of our tax losses and tax credit carryforward in the U.S. in 2012 and, therefore, saw an increase in the total cash taxes we have to pay. For comparison, our cash taxes in 2012 were at an effective rate of 8.8% of pretax earnings, compared to 21.5% in 2013.","In addition, we were adversely impacted by the timing of certain payments, which will reverse in 2014. We expect that cash tax rates in 2014 will remain at approximately 20% of reported pretax profit.","And, clearly, we are not happy with the operating cash flow performance in 2013. Although there's little we can do about taxes in the short term, we believe there is much more that we can do to reduce our working capital. We have programs in place to do precisely that, building on the progress we made this year in managing inventory. After accounting for these actions, we expect our cash provided by operating activities to be closer to $600 million in 2014.","To finish taxes, in the fourth quarter our adjusted EPS benefited by $0.08 due to a lower full year adjusted tax rate. This tax benefit arose from complex accounting rules related to the treatment of certain balance sheet items, and we do not expect them to reoccur in 2014. We continue to believe our underlying adjusted tax rate will be between 25% and 26%.","One unusual element of our fourth quarter earnings is the larger-than-normal difference between our GAAP net income of $27 million and our adjusted earnings of $141 million. The difference between these is largely a result of the write-down of Peroxygens assets to the final sale value. After tax, this adjustment was $71 million.","I'll now take a few minutes to discuss the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on our earnings. FMC operates in multiple geographies and, therefore, is exposed to a large number of foreign currencies, in particular, to the euro, the Brazilian real and the Chinese renminbi. We are largely protected from currency movements because of 2 structural benefits: first, our costs and revenues are largely matched in the same currency wherever possible; and second, much of our revenue and our cost base is U.S. dollar denominated, regardless of where we actually transact business. It is our policy to hedge our remaining exposures as much as possible, although no hedging policy can completely insulate earnings from sudden or extreme movements.","Large movements in exchange rates were a feature of the fourth quarter, with currencies as diverse as the Brazilian real, the Indian rupee, the Australian dollar and the Indonesian rupia all seeing large swings. The 2013 unhedged currency movements reduced our after-tax earnings by approximately $13 million or $0.09 per diluted share, the majority of which related to the Brazilian real. Relative to the size of our business in Brazil, our net real exposure remains relatively small. We will continue to protect our exposures with appropriate hedges wherever practical.","Excluded from this currency impact is a further $4 million to $5 million negative impact in 2013 from the slow rate of depreciation of the Argentine peso relative to the rate of inflation in that country. This is a currency that we are unable to hedge in the financial markets. As Pierre mentioned, in January, we saw a significant increase in the pace of the devaluation of the Argentine peso. With a largely U.S. dollar revenue stream and a peso cost base, such devaluation helps to offset local inflation and is therefore a potential benefit to our reported earnings in Lithium. However, there will be some offsetting impact of the resulting revaluation of certain peso-denominated receivables.","Our Agricultural Solutions business in Argentina is largely U.S. dollar denominated in terms of both revenues and cost, and a direct exposure to devaluation is only on the revaluation of peso-denominated receivables, which are relatively small. However, this currency adjustment should also benefit Argentine farmers whose crops are priced in U.S. dollars but whose cost structures are mostly peso-denominated. Therefore, at the margin, we would expect a faster pace of devaluation to be helpful to our ag business there.","As a caveat to all of these comments, I would reiterate that Argentina remains a complex business environment and the economic situation there is fluid. We therefore remain very cautious about projecting any additional benefits from peso movements within our full-year guidance.","Now let me review capital deployed in 2013. Total capital additions, including spend in our toll network included in our other investing activities line, was approximately $272 million. This compares to a total of $228 million in 2012. We continue to see opportunities to reinvest in our businesses and expect that our total spending in 2014 will increase to approximately $320 million.","For the full year, we invested a total of $450 million in external growth transactions, the majority of which was the $340 million acquisition of Epax and the $80 million purchase of the minority stake in FMC Wyoming from Nippon Sheet Glass. We announced in December that we entered into an agreement with one equity partner to sell our Peroxygens business. We expect to close this transaction in the first quarter with limited tax leakage from the sale. We intend to use the proceeds to pay down short-term borrowings.","On the financing front, we issued a $400 million 10-year note in November, the proceeds of which were used to pay down short-term borrowings. In 2014, we expect dividends to increase in line with earnings growth.","With that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Paul. Now let me describe our outlook for 2014. For the full year, we expect adjusted earnings to be between $4.35 and $4.55 per diluted share, a 15% increase over 2013 at the midpoint of the range.","Let me describe some of the assumptions we have included in our outlook. Beginning with Agricultural Solutions. We expect new product introductions and our deep customer relationship to continue to drive global volume growth.","In Latin America, we expect further acreage additions, market access expansion, continued market share gains, particularly in soybean, and continued strength in other key crops to deliver sales growth in the region. In North America, rising demand for resistance management product and favorable market conditions will again be a large contributor to earnings growth. We expect EMEA to remain stable with limited growth and Asian sales to increase as we launch new FMC products into that region this year. Altogether, we are projecting another year of strong revenues and segment earnings growth, both increasing mid-teens percent compared to 2013.","In Health and Nutrition, we expect growth in 2014 from food and pharmaceutical ingredients, driven by our texturant, binders and natural colors product line, principally in emerging markets. We continue to see increasing demands for healthy convenient food that require our products in order to achieve specific texture and stability, and we continue to make progress in natural colors.","In pharmaceutical ingredients, we expect increased demand for naturally derived binders and encapsulation solutions. And, of course, we are confident that our Omega-3 product line will add momentum to the segment's growth, with strong sales into the pharmaceutical sector and with steadily increasing penetration into the nutraceutical market. As a result, we forecast Health and Nutrition segment revenues to increase mid- to high-teens percent and segment earnings to be up mid-teens percent over 2013.","Moving now on to Minerals. We expect segment revenues to increase mid to high single-digit percent and earnings to increase high-teens percent in 2014. We expect Alkali Chemicals to operate at record-product level in 2014 aided by better geological conditions and supported by Manufacturing Excellence program already underway.","We remain optimistic that the soda ash pricing environment is improving, but our 2014 outlook only includes price increases that are currently specified in existing short- and long-term contracts. We continue to be supportive of ANSAC's efforts to realize additional price gains in export markets.","For domestic markets, we expect a low single-digit dollar per ton increase for 2014. In export markets, we believe that market conditions point toward upward momentum in prices this year. However, our outlook does not attempt to quantify the timing or magnitude of this future movement. Again, we believe ANSAC will continue to push for additional price increases throughout the year. We remain confident that our Lithium business is poised to return to mid-teens profitability in 2014. We expect that stable pricing, consistent plant operations and increased volumes will enhance profitability.","Let me now shift to our first quarter expectations. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.30 per diluted share, a 16% increase versus the first quarter of 2013 at the midpoint of the range. Agricultural Solutions earning will be up in the low-teens percent, reflecting a solid finish in Latin American markets and strong demand in North America.","In Health and Nutrition, we expect Omega-3 sales, including the initial sale from our Seals Sands facility, will complement food and pharmaceutical ingredient growth and lead to mid-teens percent increase in quarterly earnings over last year.","In Minerals, our outlook includes improvement in Lithium margin and contractual price increase in soda ash. This combination, along with incremental volume in both businesses, is expected to increase segment earning by low- to mid-teens percent compared to the first quarter 2013.","In summary, as we look at 2014, we are confident in our ability to deliver growth in Agricultural Solutions and Health and Nutrition. We are very pleased with Lithium performance, and we anticipate considerable improvement in its profitability. We remain optimistic that the export soda ash markets are firming up, but we are not including any pricing improvement that move current contract condition in our outlook. Our Manufacturing Excellence efforts across the company continue to yield additional volume contribution and cost saving.","Let me now finish with an update on Vision 2015. As a reminder, Vision 2015 consists of multiple targets. 3 of our 5 targets relate to the income statement, which I will come back to in a moment. The other 2 relate to financial discipline, in particular, return on invested capital and commitments to return cash to shareholders. In addition, we have non-financial objectives such as our commitment to manage our portfolio to increase predictability.","So far, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders, meeting this objective 2 years ahead of schedule, but we do not intend to stop. We have made commitments to you regarding annual dividend increases and share repurchases, which we intend to meet.","Return on invested capital of almost 20% in 2013 is ahead of our minimum target, despite the cyclical trough in our Alkali business. But there is more we can do. We have made significant progress in managing our inventory even as our ag and Health and Nutrition businesses grew revenue by double-digit each year. In 2014, we will aggressively address other key elements of working capital in order to enhance our cash generation and reduce our capital invested in the businesses.","We have divested Peroxygens and exceeded phosphates per carbonate and silicates businesses. We have made multiple acquisition in Health and Nutrition. Technology investments have continued to be our focus in ag. With these actions, we are delivering on our commitment to increase earnings predictability.","Finally, let me turn to the income statement. Our initial commitments were $5 billion in revenues, $1.2 billion in EBIT and $5.75 to $6.25 of EPS. In that context, ag is ahead of its target. Health and Nutrition is exactly where we're expected to be. And Lithium is returning to the performance that we expected. Our Alkali operations are projected in 2014 to produce record volumes. The revenue and EBIT we have divested will be replaced over time with the benefit of acquisitions and investments we have made to date.","Many of you highly focused on our EPS commitments as we do. Six months ago, we've provided you with a high-level bridge as to how we will get to that target in 2015. Let me update that bridge for you. In 2015, we expect our ag, Health and Nutrition and Lithium businesses to increase their earnings by 15% to 20% over 2014. We expect domestic pricing trend in Alkali in 2015 to be similar to those in 2014. Once again, Alkali export pricing remains the most difficult variable to forecast. However, if we assume that export pricing increases between $20 and $40 per ton, bringing it back in line with historical ranges, and we execute on our commitment regarding share repurchases, we would expect our 2015 EPS to be 575 -- sorry, $5.75 to $6 per share. We remain confident that we will deliver on each of these key elements of the Vision 2015 plan. This confidence extends to our belief that an increase in soda ash export prices back to historical level will take place. We continue to see strong indication that the export pricing environment is firming up. However, our currently forecasting the timing of the increase in the next 8 quarters is limited.","To conclude, our confidence in achieving these targets set out in the Vision 2015 remains strong. Now I will turn over the call to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on the ag business. I mean, you certainly saw a huge amount of strength in the fourth quarter. And yet your first quarter outlook seems -- especially relative to your full year outlook, seems a little bit light. So was there much of a pull forward into 4Q? How should we be thinking about that? And maybe if you can give a little bit of detail as to some of the drivers in terms of where you're thinking -- what's going to drive the 2014 strength going forward.","Pierre R. Brondeau","The way we always look at quarterly sales -- and there was no special tool. I think we've been taking sales as they were coming. We don't believe our customers were pulling early in the season. It is always when you get into this first quarter, you're in a transition from back end of Latin America to early season in North America, and how sales will breakdown between Q1 and Q2 is always highly hypothetical. So, overall, I think we like to focus over the annual number for the agricultural sales, but there is nothing specific in what we look at. Mark, do you want to add something to give more color?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes. The -- what I would add to that, Pierre, is -- and John, Latin America was very, very strong for us, Brazil, in particular. Although I have to say Argentina was growing nicely, so was Mexico and another parts of the Andean Region. But overall, we had greater market penetration in Brazil than we expected in soy, both with insecticides and fungicides. And also, our market access through co-ops and distribution is starting to climb as we've invested more in that area. So yes, Q4 was exceptionally strong growth at 38%, but most of it was driven by Latin America.","Pierre R. Brondeau","And one last little comment, when you look at year-on-year comparison, John, Q1-to-Q1, remember, last year Q1 was especially strong quarter in North America. So we are comparing it to tough year-over-year comparison.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on the -- with regard to your LatAm exposure. In terms of what you're actually -- or your guidance and how that kind of -- or, I guess, what on the FX side is incorporated there? Are you just marking it right now to the current market? Or are you assuming something different than that?","Paul W. Graves","No, we're marking it to the current market. We don't speculate on what rates are. We very much use market rates for forward curves when we set out our forecasts.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Chris Perrella on for Kevin. Could you clarify some of your guidance around your soda ash price outlook? So if I just sort of annualize where soda ash prices in Asia are now, and that's a pretty hefty year-over-year climb in the first half of the year considering a weak market. And what portion, I guess, is your volumes are not under contract at this point?","Pierre R. Brondeau","So if you look at our pricing, let me give you the pricing as we look at it for 2014 in term of domestic and in term of export pricing. That will give you a better color. So we are looking, today, average pricing '14 versus '13, we believe the price is going to be modestly up by a couple dollars per ton for the domestic pricing. Today, what we have in current contract for export pricing is in the mid-single-digit dollars, average price 2013 to average price 2014. So if you bring those 2 together, we are looking at pricing, we're expecting pricing, to go up only by a few dollars per ton, which is what we have in the contract. Now contracts are usually short term in Asia, 3 months contract; midterm to a year in Latin America, 6 months to a year; and 1 year in North America. So we are very conservative. Let me give you another element in term of pricing, to get a sense for the way we are looking at it in the guidance. And our biggest question, as we say and repeating ourselves, we believe pricing will strengthen in the next 8 quarters. We've been disappointed over the last 2 quarters, in Q3 and Q4, by the speed at which it was happening. So the magnitude is less a question than the speed. So what we are saying is we are just saying that, essentially, pricing will barely move right now from Q1 to Q4. But if you look at last year, when -- which was a year without very rapid growth, the price was evolving. In 2013, price was up almost 20% between the realized price in Q1 and the realized price in Q4. We are not forecasting that just because we don't have enough visibility, but I'll give you an example of what happened last year and the way we are -- the numbers we are putting in the outlook right now.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And a quick question on CapEx. With next year's guidance of about $320 million, is that a good number to think about for '15 and '16 as well? I think $350 million is the number I've recalled from the past for run rate CapEx for the next few years.","Pierre R. Brondeau","That is correct. We would believe $300 million to $350 million is what we can see for the next few years.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. Just curious on your ag guidance for 2014, is there any potential negative impact built in from weather, specifically potential for later plantings and reduced insect pressure?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No. Usually, we always look ag as normal season. And as always, ag, you could be up or down because of weather. But usually, what is happening is there is not great weather all over the world or bad weather all over the world. And because we are very global, it usually balances out. So we are not taking any safety by planning bad weather nor have we included specifically good weather for -- pretty much a normal year. And as you've seen the forecasting we have of the mid-teens EBIT increases is a pretty normal number for us. We've been operating at, say, between 13% and 20% earnings growth year-on-year for the last 5 to 10 years.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And just the emerging market trends, have you seen any impact from the FX volatility on either farmer order patterns or demand trends for biopolymers?","Michael P. Smith","No. We haven't seen any impact on that. Our volume and demand growth continues to be fairly typical of what we've experienced the last few years. And we project that to continue into next year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just talk about kind of the one-time type of impacts that you had in 2013 with respect to the longwall moves and the natural disasters impact in Q4. How would you size those? And are you anticipating some longwall moves in 2014?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. Usually, we move the longwall every 14 months -- 13, 14 months. So most of the time, it falls in the same quarter and sometimes it goes in the following quarter, which was the case this year. The cost of a longwall move is usually a negative, around $4 million. That's what it cost. In the quarter, the cost is in the quarter when we make the move -- we do the move, Frank.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And the natural disasters in the Philippines impact?","Pierre R. Brondeau","We've not gone into the detail and it's sometimes been pretty hard to quantify. I mean, you can look at the added costs at the plant itself, which is sub-$1 million, but then there is the implication to the fact that this plant is feeding products into other plants we have elsewhere where we're making blends. So that's where the ramification -- disruption of the supply chain was bigger for us.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. And you did talk about replacing some of the lost revenues and earnings in the divestitures with some M&A. I would imagine that on the sale of Peroxygens, it seemed to be more of a buyer\u2019s market on that particular sale. How are you looking at the current environment in M&A and the likelihood that we get something done here in 2014?","Pierre R. Brondeau","That's a good question, Frank. Actually, it's going to help me clarify some of the statement I've made before around Vision 2015. I think -- a couple of things. Six months ago, when we gave the $5.25 to $6.25 number for Vision 2015, we had growth rates which were a little bit more aggressive on pricing and faster mostly on pricing for Alkali. And we were expecting maybe a bit more M&A than what we have today in the forecast. It is one of the critical reasons for which we are in the 6 to -- in the $5.75 to $6, as I said before. Three business growing at 15% plus some assumption around alkali pricing from $20 to $40 plus share repurchase get us to this $5.75 to $6. At this stage, we do not believe we want to go too much beyond where we are for the next 12, 18 months around M&A for different reasons. I think we want to be very sure of the quality of the product, and there is some properties which will come for sale. We know it. Some could be pretty large, but not in the near future. So most of all, we want to digest everything we have done so for. I think we are very highly focused on completing integration and growth of the natural colors, and we have a lot of capital investment to be made there. And frankly, we don't believe the business has not earned the right to do another acquisition in Health and Nutrition until they have proven to being able to fully deliver on impact. So I would say -- I would be on merger and acquisition very prudent for the next 12 months to 18 months. And that's why you see the high end of our 2015 number a bit shorter than it was 6 months ago. In ag, we are very active. That's a different story. We are buying new molecule and new product just to keep on feeding our growth and our innovation engine. I don't know -- Mark, give me a number of either negotiation or discussion we have today, roughly, for new product or -- mid-single-digit, 5, 6, 7?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, probably a little bit more than that. There is a number of discussions going on. Plus, I would add the fact that we -- with Christian Hansen and our alliance partner for biologicals, we have a lot of investment there that doesn't show up as M&A but is bringing new technology to market.","Pierre R. Brondeau","So to summarize the answer to your question is we're going to take a break on M&A for the next 12 months until Mike and his team have demonstrated there what they can do with the acquisition of natural colors and finish the integration of Epax. And we're going to remain very active on the ag front but with acquisition which will impact beyond 2016, '17, much more than the 2015 numbers.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of ag, could you help us maybe aggregate some of the growth drivers that you talked about, new products, how much of that is baked in? And then acreage growth in Latin America has been a great big driver. How much of the growth that you see in '14 is, for what it's worth, somewhat within your control?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I'm going to let the world ag expert answer that question.","Mark A. Douglas","Thanks, Pierre. Mike, most of the growth, as you know, comes from what we call organic growth, which is moving into the new crops or expanding into crops. We focused in Latin America or in Brazil, and we talked about the soy area where we're expanding our fungicide activities, as well as insecticide. We're seeing growth in soy with herbicides in Argentina. In North America, our full suite of resistance products, whether they be post-emergent selective herbicides or products for corn rootworm, they're all growing nicely. In Asia, it's more geographic growth as we expand Indonesia, India, Thailand, China. So it's a large agglomeration of market growth and geographic growth. And then on top of that, we're bringing the new products to market. We've said in the past that we have a 2015 target of something like 30-plus percent of our revenue will be from products introduced over the last 5 years. We're currently in the 25% to 27% range for 2014, so that pipeline continues to deliver the short-term growth that we need. But as Pierre was just alluding to, we've got a lot in the pipeline that comes towards the end of the decade. And over this year, I'll be opening up a little bit more about what's in that pipeline so we can give you a flavor for how that longer-term innovation is paying off.","Pierre R. Brondeau","And one thing we're going to do -- I just want to build on what Mark just finished. I think we've been demonstrating, and I think you guys would agree because we are challenged less and less on that, and we have a very viable business model which is scalable. What is going to be our intent this year is to have much more of a focus on the technology driver for our growth. I can tell you that I am personally extremely excited by the portfolio short, mid and long term, which has been built for chemicals and, hopefully, very soon, for biologicals. So we're going to start to think about how to bring clarity to the quality of our innovation because it's been driving our performance in addition to our customer relation. And if anything, I think we're going to get stronger in the next 7, 8 years.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just out of curiosity, Pierre. Back in December, it seems like you guys are more optimistic in there in terms of the EPS growth potential, you sort of talk about a dollar's worth of improvement in '14 versus '13. You've talked about some headwinds here. Are you just being a little bit more conservative here? Or is there anything else that sort of caused you to be a little bit more conservative with the outlook as you started the year versus where you were just in December?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I think I'm more optimistic than ever on Health and Nutrition, on Ag and Lithium. Lithium is going to have a big year. So I'm very comfortable. I'm quite, quite -- very comfortable, actually, on our operations for soda ash and our domestic pricing. I have to say that I was expecting to see in the fourth quarter, maybe at the end of the third quarter also, a more aggressive ramp-up of pricing. The supply\/demand is balancing. You can see price increase in China. There is multiple signals, which are pointing toward price increase. The realization of those price increase is slower than what we are expecting. So I have to say we're a little bit surprised by the speed and that's why what we're saying is we are cautious around export pricing. That's the only place where I'm more cautious than I was in December. So what we decided to do, rather than betting on something without a strong logic, which we thought we had before and we've been proven to be wrong, is to tell you guys we are only putting in the numbers for 2014 what we have currently in the contract. Any further price increase will come as an upside, and we will be updating you very closely on how the pricing is evolving in the quarters to come. We keep on pushing pricing. There is some proof of success, but we're going to more report how we do rather than speculate on where it's going. So that's the only places, when we talked last, Mike, in December, where I'm being a bit more cautious. The rest, I'm even more bullish than I was a couple of months ago.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Mike Harrison from First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Can you give us any sense as to how much of the ag growth that we saw this quarter is being driven by products that you've acquired or licensed in the last year? Obviously, it's not really acquisition versus organic growth because I know you [ph] leverage new products organically. But can you give us any sense of how much contribution there is from new products of the strong growth you saw this quarter?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Mike. It is difficult to sort of segment where the growth is coming from in terms of acquired versus organic. But just to give you a flavor for it, our fungicide business is growing rapidly and most of that business comes from the products we've acquired over the last few years. So when I look at the overall portfolio, we've stated a number of times that we want to grow our fungicide activities. We're indeed doing that. The growth rates are high, the base is low but it's all coming from the acquired products that we've taken over the last few years. You'll see that change as we look at herbicides in more detail and we look at insecticides in more detail. Over the next 5 to 10 years, I would expect products that we're acquiring today that come to market to be the vanguard of where our growth comes from. But right now, it's primarily focused in the fungicide area.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then, Mark, can you remind us of the timing of reintroducing bifenthrin in Europe and how much potential benefit that could be over time?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Mike. We've not actually disclosed the benefit totally. It's impactful to our European business, but we would expect to see our first sales of bifenthrin back into the European market in the 2015 season.","Pierre R. Brondeau","I'll remind you a number we've said in the past because, as Mark said, we do not disclose that. All we've said it's double-digit million dollars, and that's the number we've been saying, knowing that it's the -- it's on the low end of that scale.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Right. And if I can just sneak one more in. You mentioned that soda ash production is running at record levels now. How much higher is that, roughly, versus kind of the prior level before you had the expansion?","Unknown Executive","Mike, we -- I think we said publicly that we'd have a 5% to 10% increase in output in the 2013 to 2015 timeframe. When you look back at 2013 versus 2012, we increased output by 3%, and what we're projecting in 2014 versus 2013 is another 3%. So we've gotten 6% sequentially, so far, so we're right in the range.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments.","Peter Butler","Pierre, it sounds like FMC has been substantially benefiting from better manufacturing practices. Who's responsible for this new effort? And how much progress are you making and how much potential remains?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Good question, Peter. The guy who is behind that is Barry Crawford, our VP of Operations, who is bringing a program of manufacturing excellence across the company. I think a very high focus has been made on our Lithium and our Alkali business. I do believe that Barry, together with Mike Smith, are starting to bring a great attention to our Health and Nutrition plan. So if I would expect further increase in capacity and reliability and lower cost today would be in -- the next wave of work will be toward the Health and Nutrition business, which -- it should show in the results.","Peter Butler","Okay. Could you summarize the arguments of the more optimistic people in FMC on soda ash pricing? I recognize that you've been very -- you're being conservative and as you should. But what arguments are the optimists giving you that -- on pricing in the next 2 years?","Pierre R. Brondeau","See, I think the optimists in the organization -- but I don't think there is optimists and pessimists in the organization, we try to be factual. So what we are saying and thinking is today you take a price, an average export pricing, in the $110, $120 per ton, that's your average export pricing. And you take a domestic pricing, which is in the $150 to $160 per ton. As soon as there is balance of supply\/demand, there is no reason in the global market, and especially with the high cost of the synthetic process in Europe and Asia, to have such a differential in pricing between the different regions. So the simple math -- and if you look back at 2012, those 2 curves in pricing were exactly on top of each other. So if you look at the differential and if you assume, looking at the tight supply\/demand situation, that the only way those prices are going to merge together is by seeing the export price coming on top of the domestic price, you have a $40-plus per ton of upside. For us, it's close to $80 million in EBIT. The question is how fast will that happen? It's something we have a hard time answering.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Following up on Peter's question regarding prices -- pricing for soda ash, is there any particular reason, Pierre, why domestic prices would decline? What would cause that to happen?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No, no. Today, we are in a situation where the way the business is supplying into North America where we have a very balanced supply\/demand and the pricing is very much in line with our customers' expectation. Prices are very stable in North America. Customers like stability. We like stability. So you don't have the ups and downs you could see and the risks going forward. So it's a very stable environment with a couple dollars-per-ton increase year after year. And I think everybody is quite happy with this stable situation's predictability. So there is not a significant pressure on those prices.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay. And if I could ask a question on Lithium. What have you seen the industry growth for Lithium in 2013, still in the 10% or so? And what are you expecting in '14 and '15?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think we are still of the school of saying high single digit for the industries currently and maybe until 2015, when you would really start to see electric vehicles taking off. And that's when you can expect the growth to go more into 12%. But until you see a significant growth in the automotive industry for electric vehicles, you will stay in the high single digits.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","And the potential for price increases in this environment in 2014 and '15?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Not a lot. I think it's also a fairly stable price. We don't have a lot of downward pressure, but we don't have a lot of room for price increase. I think the price is more driven by the type of application, the purity of the product, than it is by the supply\/demand situation. So we see the situation supply\/demand balance at a level where we should have pricing stability.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.","Amanda Durow - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is Amanda Durow on for Michael Cox. Could you provide some thoughts on South America growth in the second half of 2014? Should we see lower soy prices result in slower acreage growth or flat acreage?","Mark A. Douglas","This is Mark. No, I don't think you are going to see that. Our expectation is that we'd continue to see an expansion in the soy acreage down in Latin America, especially Brazil. But also, you'll probably see the same thing out of Argentina. So you've got to remember that -- I know prices have come off their peaks, but they're still well above historical averages. So growers down in Latin America are more than prepared to plant extra acres of soybean, and they're extremely competitive on the world market.","Amanda Durow - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And can you address the pricing power for crop chemicals in today's current environment? You kind of alluded to it somewhat. And then what is the current state of the distribution channel from an inventory and prepaid discount standpoint in North America?","Mark A. Douglas","Well, let me take the pricing piece first. Most of our growth, the vast majority of it, comes from volume. Pricing, we tend to move prices when we have raw material pressure in certain segments, but it's not a feature of our overall growth in any of our markets, although it's there every year in the low-single digits percent. In terms of the markets in North America for us, we see a lot of demand for our selective herbicide and corn rootworm resistants. We expect demand in the first quarter to be strong in that area, and we have been producing materials to meet that demand. So for us, the chain is adequately stocked. We expect to continue to take share and to grow into acres that we've not been in before. So rather positive in those areas for us.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just a couple of things, if I could -- if I may. Can you talk a little bit about the sort of a little bit more detail on the impact of Epax in the quarter, both on top line and, more importantly, on profits in nutritional health business?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Sure. If you look at our Health and Nutrition segment, we are looking today at a mid-teens percent increase for the first quarter.","Mark A. Douglas","So, Dmitry, is your question in Q4 or looking forward?","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","My question was in Q4, so I can have something that I can start.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Oh, in Q4. I'm sorry, in Q4 -- I thought you were talking our forecast for Q1.","Mark A. Douglas","It was de minimis, Dmitry. I mean...","Pierre R. Brondeau","In Q4, there was nothing. Basically, with the delay of the Seals Sands plant, there was no Epax contribution, maybe slightly negative, but it was a non-event. That's mostly the differential between the 13% EBIT growth and the -- versus the forecast of 25% we had.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then when you talk about the -- in the Health and Nutrition again, Mark, it's in the excipients and pharmaceuticals sort of getting back to normal, can you -- well, first of all, can you let us or remind us what went off the rail when they got away from being normal and sort of what had got it back to normal? And what could we look for as an impact on the top line as these markets start to get back [ph] to what they used to.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, if you -- the normal and abnormal is if you look at last year, quarter-after-quarter, on the pharmaceutical, we started the first quarter with an enormous double-digit growth, much above the expectation, a pretty solid second quarter, quite an abrupt slowdown in the third quarter, I guess, because inventory must have been pretty full. And then getting back to normal, and I think Mike had a pretty solid month of December, so back end of the quarter was pretty strong. For us, the pharmaceutical market in the segment where we are playing, what would be, Mike, the average growth rate you would expect averaged over a year?","Michael P. Smith","It's typically in the 4% to 5% range over the course of the year. And as Pierre indicated, it was a bit higher than that in the beginning of the year. The third quarter was a bit of an aberration. And in the fourth quarter, we were pretty much right on that typical growth pattern. And as we look at the first quarter of 2014, we seem to be pretty much right back on that track.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got you. So this was a short-term inventory dislocation that seems to have worked itself out?","Pierre R. Brondeau","It looks like it.","Michael P. Smith","That's correct.","Alisha Bellezza","All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That's all the time that we have for the call. I'll be available after the call for additional questions that you may have.

Mr. Angeli, you may begin.","Brian P. Angeli - FMC Corp.","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's third quarter performance and discuss the outlook for Q4 and full year 2016. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2016 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call.","As with our prior calls, Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, President, FMC Health and Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will join to address questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references, and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Q3 2016 was another strong quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy. FMC reported revenue of $808 million, adjusted operating profit of $134 million and adjusted EPS of $0.67. Adjusted EPS increased approximately 60% compared to the third quarter of 2015, exiting the top-end of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.63.","Our performance in the quarter was driven largely by the results of Ag Solutions and Lithium, both of which reported a significant year-over-year increase in segment earnings. In Ag Solutions, compared to last year, we saw an improved start of the season in Latin America especially in Brazil, a stronger performance in both Asia and North America.","Lithium continued to benefit from higher prices, improved mix and lower operating costs. Third quarter segment earnings in Health and Nutrition were slightly below 2015 but in-line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter contributed approximately $0.03 to adjusted EPS. As noted in our outlook statement and as Paul will discuss later in the call, we expect to continue to report a lower tax rate for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Based on our performance in the third quarter and on our outlook for Q4, we are revising the range of our full-range adjusted EPS guidance to $2.76 to $2.86 per share. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of $0.06 per share compared to the prior guidance, and an increase of $0.14 compared to adjusted EPS for 2015.","I will provide more detail on the outlook for Q4 shortly but first, I will discuss third quarter results for each of our three segments starting with Ag Solutions on slide two. For the third quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $559 million and segment earnings at the top of our guidance range of $90 million. Compared to the third quarter 2015, revenue declined 3% as lower sales volume in Brazil more than offset the benefit of higher prices in that country and volume growth in other regions. Year-over-year price increases were largest in Brazil, where we continue to recover pricing in U.S. dollar terms.","Segment earnings increased over 50% and margin improved 600 basis points as higher realized prices, improved mix and favorable foreign exchange more than offset the impact of lower volumes and slightly higher costs in the quarter. Costs were higher principally as the result of the timing between quarters of certain expenses. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our integration cost savings target.","Turning to slide 3, I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance and discuss the outlook for Q4, starting with Latin America. Revenue in the region declined 18% in the quarter, driven largely by lower sales volumes in Brazil, general market weakness, ongoing product rationalization effort, and our decision to allow channel inventory levels to reduce. Each contributed to the decline in sales volume in Brazil. The elimination of low-margin third-party products accounted for over 50% of the volume decline in the quarter. Revenue in the rest of Latin America was roughly flat compared to 2015.","In Argentina, we continued to see increasing demands for FMC's Authority herbicides. (7:15) In Mexico, our focus on high-value crops is helping to offset the impact of a broader market decline. The actions we have taken throughout the past year in Brazil enabled us to realize significant increases in U.S. dollar-based pricing, improve operating margin and drive collections in the quarter. Price actions increased operating earnings in Brazil by about 30% year-over-year, which, combined with lower operating cost, returned operating margins to 2014 levels. Our actions in Brazil also enabled the business to reduce accounts receivables in the country and generate cash collections of over $200 million, a significant improvement over our performance in the same quarter last year.","Moving on to Asia, revenue in the region grew by 9% in the quarter compared to 2015, driven mainly by increased sales volume throughout the regions. Improving weather conditions in Australia created strong demand for our L-grade (08:48) herbicide and for fungicide's portfolio. A return to a more normal monsoon season in India and Southeast Asia supported increased demand for insecticide and fungicide, with strong growth in Indonesia for rice applications.","In Europe, revenue increased 6% in the quarter. Increased sales synergies and higher volume in Eastern Europe as we expand our direct market access, coupled with strong herbicide sales in the UK more than offset challenging conditions in Northwest Europe.","In North America, revenue in the quarter increased 46% to 2015's. We saw higher sales volumes related to new product introduction for winter and spring wheat and increased demand for herbicide. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect market conditions to remain largely unchanged. We are cautiously optimistic regarding Q4 in Latin America, given the start of the selling seasons in Brazil and strong demand for FMC product elsewhere in the region. However, we are more cautious on market conditions in North America, where we expect weak market conditions into 2016-2017 crop season.","For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings to be between $117 million and $137 million. At the midpoint, this implies segment earnings growth of approximately 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Improved U.S. dollar pricing in Brazil and lower cost year-over-year are expected to drive a meaningful increase in segment earnings margins in the quarter from 15% in 2015 to closer to 20%.","We are pleased with the progress made in Ag Solutions to drive margin improvement in the business. Prior to the acquisition of Cheminova, Ag Solutions consistently delivered consolidated operating margins between 20% and 25%. And we are well on our way to returning margins to that level. We are tightening our full year segment earnings guidance to $390 million to $410 million with the midpoint of our range unchanged and continue to forecast full year revenue of about $2.3 billion at the midpoint.","Turning next to Health and Nutrition on slide 4, for the third quarter, Health and Nutrition reported revenue of $179 million and segment earnings of $45 million. Revenue declined 9% year-over-year largely as a result of lower volume, timing of sales to certain pharma customers in Asia and Europe, and headwinds from Omega-3; each contributed to the volume decline. Segment earnings of $45 million declined 4% compared to 2015. However, operating margins improved 120 basis points, to over 25% in the quarter. The negative impact of lower volumes and product mix was largely offset by lower operating costs as a result of ongoing operating excellence programs.","For the fourth quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $53 million and $57 million, and for the full-year, forecast segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $194 million. At the midpoint, Q4 segment earnings are expected to increase almost 20% compared to Q4 2015. The bulk of the increase in segment earnings is due to the timing of certain favorable cost variances from prior period which will drive segment earnings margins to between 29% and 30% in the quarter. For the full year, we expect margin of about 25% to 26%.","Moving on to Lithium on slide 5. Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 22% to $70 million on the back of increased price and more favorable mix. Segment earnings rose to $18 million from just $2 million last year. Market conditions remain favorable with demand increasing ahead of supply.","As a result, prices across the portfolio were higher compared to the last year. These price increases, combined with the most favorable sales mix, lower cost and a benefit from foreign currencies, drove the improvement in segment earnings and margin in the quarter.","We expect the positive momentum in Lithium to continue with fourth quarter segment earnings between $16 million and $20 million, approximately 60% higher year-over-year, at the midpoint of the range. Based on Lithium's performance to-date and their expectation for Q4, we are increasing full year guidance for segment earnings by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $65 million to $69 million. Full year segment earnings margin should be about 25% compared to 10% in 2015.","Before turning the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 on slide 6. We are tightening full year segment earnings guidance for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition and increasing guidance for Lithium. Based on these segment guidance and the lower tax rate which Paul will discuss in a moment, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.92 and full year adjusted EPS in the range of $2.76 to $2.86.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Pierre. I'll start with the tax rate and the non-controlling interest on the income statement, before I move on to the impact of currency cash flow and the balance sheet. So, first tax. Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate is around 23.5%, which is slightly lower than we initially expected. This is driven by an increase in the contribution of earnings from our foreign entities compared to prior years.","And while this trend is most apparent in Ag Solutions, we're actually seeing it in all of our businesses. We expect the adjusted effective rates to be in the 23% to 24% range for the fourth quarter. And looking into 2017, we expect that rate may fall by as much as 3 percentage points resulting in a full year adjusted effective tax rate closer to 21%.","This further reduction is mainly the result of the operational integration of Cheminova, which will impact our supply chain and our earnings mix globally. Our noncontrolling interest line continues to shrink as part of the integration of Cheminova and taking advantage of opportunities to simplify the ownership structure of some of our international entities and are taking or have taken steps to consolidate ownership in places such as Argentina, China and Eastern Europe. Largely as a result of these steps, we expect the noncontrolling interest line to fall to approximately $5 million this year and remain near this level next year.","Touching on currency, this quarter saw none of the rapid movements in major currencies that we saw last year. And, as a result, FX had a far smaller impact on our results. Across all businesses and regions, currency was a tailwind to earnings with a large favorable movement in Brazil, the biggest factor. The other major currencies for which FMC is exposed, namely the euro and the RMB, had no meaningful impact on our earnings in the quarter. For the year-to-date, the currency has been broadly neutral to earnings.","Moving on to cash flow and slide 7. The first thing I want to point out is our increase in cash flow guidance for full year from a range of $450 million to $550 million to a range of $550 million to $600 million. The midpoint of this revised guidance reflects an increasing cash generation of almost 60% compared to 2015. Higher earnings, stronger working capital performance and tightened spending discipline will all contribute to the year-over-year increase and give us confidence that the higher level of cash generation we've seen through the first three quarters will continue through Q4.","Underpinning our confidence in cash generation is our success in reducing our Brazil exposure. Through September, we collected over $500 million of receivables in Brazil, reducing the outstanding receivable balance by over $200 million. By the end of 2016, we expect to have collected over $700 million of outstanding receivables in Brazil alone.","Equally importantly, a significant proportion of the collections are coming from those accounts that were past due at the start of the year, improving the quality of the remaining receivables balance. Our receivables balance in Brazil, however, remains higher than we believe it should be, and we expect to continue to reduce it over the coming seasons. Based on our current visibility, we believe that we have the ability to reduce the current balance by approximately $400 million. We will deliver this reduction over the next 18 months to 24 months.","Our strong cash generation has helped us reduce our net debt by over $200 million so far this year, and we expect this to fall further by year-end. Combined with higher trailing EBITDA, our adjusted net debt-to-LTM EBITDA ratio will fall into the 2.5 times to 3 times range as we enter 2017. We will continue to manage our debt to a level consistent with our current credit rating. And looking into 2017, we expect that capital expenditure to remain similar to 2016 at or just ahead of depreciation, even allowing for our planned expansions in Lithium Hydroxide.","We will continue to seek out opportunities to invest in technologies and products for our Ag Solutions business. And at an appropriate time, in 2017, we would expect to revisit our ability to engage in share repurchases while maintaining our other net debt, credit rating and investment objectives.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Before closing, I would like to share a few initial thoughts regarding 2017 on slide 8. Based on what we see today, we expect the global crop protection chemical market to be about flat in 2017, creating a more stable operating environment for FMC Ag Solutions. Market demand in Europe and Asia continues to grow and more normal weather conditions should lead to an improved demand environment in those regions next year. While it remains very early to predict the market crop protection chemicals in Latin America, we are pretty confident that we will enter 2017 with better market fundamentals than either of the previous two seasons.","In contrast, we expect market conditions in North America to remain challenging as we do not believe that the market-wide de-stocking process has run its course and that elevated levels of channel inventory combined with low-commodity prices will dampen grower demand across the region.","In a flat market and assuming stable currencies, we believe Ag Solutions is well-positioned to deliver another year of growth in segment earnings. Revenue synergy opportunities in Europe and North America, planned new product introductions and continued cost savings will more than offset cost inflation. Our primary view is that Ag Solutions' segment earnings will grow by high single-digit percent in 2017.","In Health and Nutrition, next year, we expect growth rate for revenue and segment earnings to return to historical levels both low- to mid-single digit percent. In Lithium, the combination of higher prices, increased lithium hydroxide volume and continued cost discipline should increase segment earnings by about 40% in 2017. We expect to realize higher prices in all major downstream products next year, with the most significant increase in lithium hydroxide. The multi-year lithium (24:00) hydroxide contracts are negotiated in the fourth quarter. And based on the status of customer negotiations to-date, we expect the average realized price to be significantly higher in 2017.","We also expect to see a meaningful increase in the production of lithium hydroxide next year as a result of our previously announced capacity expansion. Construction of our hydroxide unit is ahead of schedule. Based on the current construction timeline, we expect production of lithium hydroxide to increase by 4,000 metric tons in 2017, with total production capacity increasing to 18,000 metric tons per year by the middle of next year.","Feeding the growth in demand for FMC's downstream lithium product requires access to increasing volume of lithium carbonate. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Nemaska Lithium to source 8,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate per year, beginning in mid-2018. These agreements represent only one element of our sourcing strategy and we are actually pursuing multiple paths to diversify our carbonate source.","In the near term, we will increase capacity at our Argentina operations by approximately 20% to low capital cost action. We continue to evaluate long-term supply agreements and partnerships with other producers of lithium carbonate, and we retain the option of expanding our carbonate production operation in Argentina in order to ensure we have a secure, reliable and cost-competitive supply of lithium carbonate.","At the corporate level, we expect costs to remain roughly flat and to continue to reduce debt. Combined with a lower tax rate for 2017, as Paul mentioned earlier, we expect to grow EPS at a faster rate than we grow operating earnings.","Consistent with prior years, we will provide more details and specific guidance for 2017 in February when we report our Q4 and full year 2016 results as we first need to see how the year ends and assess business and market conditions at that time.","To conclude, I am very pleased with the performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In volatile markets, FMC has continued to execute its strategy and deliver substantial growth in earnings. I believe we are positioned to continue this in Q4 and beyond. We continue to invest in our technology pipeline in Ag Solutions and are launching new products that bring greater value to the grower.","Last month, we announced that FMC has begun the registration process in North America over Bixafen fungicide, (27:42) one of the nine active ingredients in our R&D pipeline. With our unique high return R&D model for active ingredients innovation and strong regional formulation capabilities, FMC is well-positioned to deliver the technology and service that growers demand. We will provide additional information regarding our technology pipeline in the coming months.","Health and Nutrition continues to generate high margins and strong cash flow, and demand across our core nutrition and health market continues to grow. We are in the process of commissioning our new MCC production facility in Thailand, which will serve the growing nutrition markets in Asia. Demand for our downstream retail products continues to increase. FMC is well-positioned to maintain its leading position in lithium hydroxide, butyl-lithium and lithium metals, and we continue to pursue multiple paths to diversify our resources of lithium carbonate to feed the expected growth in the business. Our agreement with Nemaska is just the first step and we look forward to announcing more actions in 2017.","In closing, the actions we are taking will continue to drive performance across our businesses and position FMC to deliver increasing value to our shareholders into 2017 and beyond. I thank you for your attention this morning.","With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Your results far exceeded what your peers have been indicating for European crop protection growth, especially in 3Q. And you mentioned some things in your presentation such as direct market access across Eastern Europe and strong herbicide sales in the UK.","But can you just talk a little bit more about the longer-term key drivers in the market, let's say, over the next two years? Are we in the early innings of the Eastern European theme and what's the latest update on new registrations? Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Hey, Chris. This is Mark. You highlighted the points that we put out in the release regarding how we grew in Europe. I think, for us, going forward in the next few years, it's very much what we've just said in terms of direct market access. We're very pleased with what we see in Eastern Europe, but we're working off a pretty small base.","And we have the JV that we had in Czechoslovakia, Poland. It's important for us to expand in that area, but we shouldn't forget that France, Germany, the UK, Spain, Italy, they're all important markets where we intend to put new products into the pipeline. We do have new products coming next year and the year after, that are based upon our Clomazone franchise for herbicides. So, we expect to see significant growth in herbicides as we move forward.","And, in addition, with the acquisition of Cheminova, we've also, as we've said, expanded our fungicide portfolio. So you'll see us grow our European fungicide business substantially over the next three to five years. That's mainly the growth for us.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","And, Chris, remember that many of the products FMC was selling in Europe are registered today in places like France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Southern Europe, UK. We were just not benefiting from a very strong sales organization as we were working with a distribution network, which was mostly focused on Northern Europe. So, even without adding many registration, which we will, and we have new product coming, we just have to start to increase our face-to-face presence with the market is going to dramatically increase our immediate growth.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. And just a quick follow-up, can you just also quickly comment on where you think the insecticide inventory issue is in Brazil and how that may or may not affect the market heading into 2017? And also, you've seen some recent spikes in sugar and cotton prices, could you just quickly comment on the conversations you're having with those customers, as I imagine they've been better than they have been over the last couple of years. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. I think we are always very careful when we talk about level of product inventory in the channel overall at the market level. But the situation in Brazil, including for insecticide, is right now feeling, I would say, more stable. As you can see, year-on-year numbers show a decrease in sales, in addition to the product rationalization. So we believe there is actions which are being taken for insecticides and other product to decrease the level of inventory in the channel. The discussions with growers are better. They are easier on pricing, they are easier on term and our volume are more predictable. So, we do believe it is decreasing. We don't believe it's decreasing fast enough to create a very robust 2017 number, but I would say we want to be entering 2017 in a more stable situation and more flattish market than we did in the previous two years.","Mark, do you want to comment on the sugarcane?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah, sure. Chris, well, you mentioned cotton and sugarcane, obviously important crops for FMC down in Brazil. I'm more confident in sugarcane than I am in cotton. As we've talked about, and Paul alluded to, in terms of collections, we've been very prudent in our exposure to certain areas of Brazil and certain, and crops. I would say the cotton growers have faced a very tough time in the north due to the drought. So, liquidity is important for them and we're watching that situation very carefully. Acres are expected to be flat to slightly down in Brazil as we go forward into the next season.","Switching to sugarcane, you're right, sugar prices are at least double where they were last year. Ethanol prices are up in Brazil. So, the fundamentals for the business is good. The one thing they're lacking right now is liquidity, given all the debts they've incurred over the last few years. We're ideally positioned. We have strong market shares in insecticides and herbicides. Planting is down right now, probably about 30% due to that liquidity. But I think as the business unwinds next year, I'm very confident that our sugarcane business will grow next year and be a good buffer for some of the other downsides we might see in cotton.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Helpful.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Just to repeat, Chris, I want to use your question to make sure that we are clear. But we are continuing with a \u2013 it's a different strategy but, really, we are not focused on volume at all today. I mean, what is very important for us today is pricing our technology where it should be priced, decreasing the level of our product in the channel, getting terms which are right and collecting. We believe the market is such that this is the right strategy which will make us much stronger when we get into a situation where the market turns around.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful color. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citi. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, everyone. Maybe I can just follow up on Chris' question in a different way. I think you said that low-margin product in Brazil which you're exiting, it should relate to (36:20) 60% of the volume decline in the quarter. So, maybe can we just talk about what's driving the 40% of the rest of the volume decline?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","There is two things which are driving the remaining 40%. First of all, we believe, and we'll confirm that at the end of the fourth quarter, but we are believing that \u2013 we believe that we are in a situation in Brazil where the market will still be down in the 10% range year-on-year for the full year, so there is a market driver.","There is also the fact that we are moving away from sales, not because of rationalization, but because of credit risks or term. We are very cautious in not selling for the sake of selling. We are selling when we know we can get no more terms for the region and we will be able to collect. So, as I said before, volume is not the priority. So, those are the three reasons. Sales, which are safe, with good terms, market which will decline and product rationalization, those are the three drivers.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I think you also commented that operating margins in Brazil are sort of approaching where you were in 2014, but I think for the Ag segment as a whole, margins are still below 2014 levels. So, can you comment on the other regions and where you see margins stay and how maybe they can improve into 2017? Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think that if you look at when we made the acquisition of Cheminova, acquiring Cheminova would bring to us many benefit in term of creating more global business, a broader fungicide portfolio, a direct access to market in Europe and other benefits, more solid performance in \u2013 more solid market presence in India and Australia.","But we also realized that the margins Cheminova was realizing were not at the level of what we're expecting, and we had a plan to bring those margins through cost saving, pricing and new product introductions to the historical level of FMC. And that's the road we are on.","I have to say that despite the market condition, the year-end has \u2013 after closing on the Cheminova acquisition, we have brought back those margin to 20%, which is well in, for the fourth quarter, which is well in-line, even ahead of our schedule. We still have work to do. We still have \u2013 remember, we still have additional costs to extract from the business, from the acquisition in the next six months to nine months. So, we see that work. But we are well on our way to margin north of 20%. It is just integration of Cheminova, the pricing of the technology and the new product introduction but we are well on our roadway right now.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good morning.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Eric, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cost structure and some of the key margin drivers that you saw in Health and Nutrition this quarter? Did we see any of the variance impacts during this quarter that you mentioned you're going to be seeing in the fourth quarter?","Eric W. Norris - FMC Corp.","Hey, Mike. Eric here. So, it's a complicated question because the costs that flow through at any one quarter are related to a variety of factors, where a lot of it is stemming from manufacturing, excellence programs. So, that's a sustainable component. However, as we talked about and the guidance Pierre gave for the fourth quarter, we'll see benefits stem from things such as seasonality and how we harvest seaweed, right? There are times of the year, particularly off the coast of Norway where we get a higher quality seaweed, we have more access to the waters because of the favorable weather, what-have-you, that drive one-off opportunities in costs. And the way our variances work, that flows through and it's part of the benefit we see in the fourth quarter.","I want to make sure, does that answer the question you're after?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Mike, maybe to answer a little bit more your question, if you look at previous years, it is not an abnormal situation to see \u2013 you could see it maybe not to the same extent, but you can see it through the 2015 results, where you would see higher margin in Q4 than you would see in Q3.","So, we realize over the year a 25% margin for the business, but we recognized that there is some seasonality to a margin in this business. So, there is not always a connection between a margin improvement you will see in Q4 and what you could realize in Q3.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. I guess the question that I had, Eric, also had to do with the weakness in volumes during the third quarter, yet you were able to show pretty nice margin improvement. And I was wondering if there was some variability around the costs or if this was structural cost take-out that was really driving the margin improvement?","Eric W. Norris - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I would say it's more of the latter. The structural improvements we've made, there's nothing unique about what's happened sequentially from one quarter to the next. Volumes were lower for the reasons Pierre referenced, Omega-3, as well as some timing in our Health business.","But the cost side of that is pretty consistent. There's a structural component that gets us to a sustainable margin that's in the mid-20%s, notwithstanding the occasional and what we've seen in prior quarters benefit we may get in certain quarters like the fourth quarter that are not benefits you roll forward into the first quarter or second quarters of the following year.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Then, I had a question on the Lithium business. Can you comment on what you were seeing in price activity sequentially across different products?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think I'll have Tom commenting more on the pricing. But right now, if you look, we have a lot of benefit from pricing on lithium carbonate up to now and maybe less of a pricing benefit of lithium hydroxide. We are now getting into the period of new contract negotiation of lithium hydroxide, which will impact mostly 2017. So, directionally, what we do expect is we do expect to start to see a very significant ramp up in lithium hydroxide pricing, which is very much in line with the negotiation we are having while we will see, maybe, a more stable pricing in lithium carbonate, potentially lowering into 2017.","Tom, you want to add some more color to that?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yes. Just to give a little more color to that, on the hydroxide, the contract negotiations are proceeding well and over the coming month, they should be all solid. We're progressing well through those. And on the carbonate, as most folks saw in the market, there was a little bit of softening in Q3 particularly in China. What we'll see going into next year is the smaller volume of carbonate that was locked in at lower prices, similar to the hydroxide, will come up, and we expect some softening on the top-end, so net-net we'll go into next year on those more opportunistic product lines kind of flat to slightly down.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","And the big story once again for us, I mean, because of the strategic focus, because of the timing of where we are in contract negotiation and increasing capacity coming up next year, the big focus for us and where you're going to see the other contributor to earnings growth is lithium hydroxide.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","This is Ben Richardson sitting in for Don. Just sticking on, with the topic about lithium, you say you're ahead of schedule with the ramps there. Can you just maybe speak to the timing of additional tonnage?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. What we \u2013 we're expecting the mechanical completion of the plant. I had the pleasure actually to be there two weeks ago and see the plant's looking really good. We expect the mechanical completion of the plant in the fourth quarter this year. We're going to be able to start to have product coming out of the plant in the first quarter, and then we're going to start to answer the customer qualification of the product.","So, we believe with the commercial situation where the products are produced by the plant by the expansion and qualified to the customer by the middle of the year. So, the 8,000-metric-ton capacity we have for next year should give to us a 4,000 additional tons of products into 2017 and the full 8,000 when we get into 2018.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And, I guess, flipping back to Ag and specifically potential divestitures in your space and how you see that development?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","We are in contact with any of the companies which are currently consolidating, and we are standing ready to participating in the purchase of any molecule \u2013 any of those company would be divesting if they meet our portfolio. I have to say that so far, we haven't seen anything which would be critical to our portfolio or any significant technology put on the market. But I think those companies are still in an early stage of the antitrust reviews. So, we are standing ready but haven't seen anything right now which has been attractive to us.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Joel Jackson representing BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Milan Shah - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. This is Milan on for Joel. Just following up there on the acquisitions. I mean, if you are to pursue something, can you maybe give us, put some numbers around magnitude and what would be the funding? I mean, what sort of leverage would you be comfortable going back up to potentially?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I will talk to the leverage. The size, I mean, really, I would not like to speculate here on the result of any antitrust reviews, and what could be the consequences in term of what product would be for sale and what will be the price. Now, of course, we do our own work to be ready and try to anticipate but that's only speculation on our part to stand ready but it's very hard to tell until the antitrust process in each of the region is taking place and having the companies, making decisions around their portfolio.","Paul, do you want to talk about the leverage?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Sure. Again, to Pierre's point, it's difficult to be particularly satisfying to you with the answer without any real specifics. But I think it's fair to say, I think you've seen from our cash flow performance, we are generating a fair degree of cash right now. We're deleveraging quickly. Because we've bought products like this frequently in the past, one of the key characteristics is that they are typically very cash-generative from day one. And so, they can stand a pretty decent amount of leverage from day one.","We also are very disciplined on price. Based on everything we see, we don't see any risk to our credit rating from a cash acquisition of any of the available interesting assets that are out there right now. Again, that could change depending on what assets come available. But we don't see any particular challenge to add our balance sheet based on the opportunities that are available that we see today.","Milan Shah - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thanks. Maybe just switching to Omega-3, you talk about some abating headwinds going into next year. I mean, is the environment more competitive, equally competitive, less competitive than you were perhaps seeing last quarter and going into 2017?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Omega-3 is, I would say, it is not getting worse, but it is not getting better. I think it's a challenging environment. Right now, we are focusing on actions for us to leverage some of our manufacturing capability and quality of product and especially the fact that we have, know we have made product which have very high quality and command a premium to try to improve our situation.","But, frankly, at that stage, with the oversupply there is in this market and the number of players, the improvement you will see on Omega-3 will be driven by the work we do commercially and cost-wise more than us benefiting from the market. When we've announced the numbers for expected growth for the Health penetration (51:05) business next year, we are very, I would say, prudent around putting into those numbers any significant improvement in the Omega-3 market, which we do not see. So, it is a challenge. We are addressing it. I would say, right now, I have to admit we are more in damage control than expecting growth but that's the situation for Omega-3.","Milan Shah - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with B&A (sic) [BofA] (51:40). Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. This is Ian sitting in for Steve (51:41). Cash flow generation has been very, very good this year and I appreciate the comments about some of the collections in Brazil and looking forward to 2017, provided some preliminary guidance about expecting earnings growth. Should cash from operations grow at the same level of earnings or higher or lower?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I think you heard in my comments we talked probably still about $400 million of excess receivables sat on our balance sheet related to Brazil. And, we'd certainly expected to start to collect a significant proportion of those next year. So, given that, we would expect cash flow to continue to grow really similarly, like how it did this year. We'll generate higher EBITDA. We do not expect to have any meaningful cash outflows for CapEx over and above what we have today, and we expect to continue to decapitalize our balance sheet in Brazil. So, yes, I would expect cash flow to continue to grow next year just as strong as it's been this year.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. And as a follow-up, just kind of on the broader market. For Ag, specifically in Latin America, what things would you be looking for to potentially become more optimistic about a rebound in that region? I think sales are still far below prior levels of peak. What does the industry need to see?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Well, I think, for me, there's a couple of things. First of all, on the macro level, obviously, if commodity prices start to come back, we're going to see expanded acres down in Brazil for a lot of the row crops. That's one factor. And, then the second factor is just the internal health of that business in the sense of where channel inventories are, pest pressures, the normal seasonal-to-seasonal activity in Ag. I think if you can get those things coming together, you're going to see somewhat of a rebound in the marketplace. But pest pressure is obviously, nobody knows where the pest pressures are going to lie. Commodity prices are going to take some change in overall yields in North America and Latin America. So, we've said what we feel the market will be next year. Those will be the two items in Brazil in particular and potentially Argentina that would change that picture.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","The one thing I'd just add to that I think having a stable macro-political environment and improved access to credit for the growers will be a positive if we see that start to happen as well.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Pierre, last quarter, you talked about some optimism in your outlook comments for Health and Nutrition, but not about seasonality in Q3 and Q4. What I'm wondering is do you think you have the right mix of products for what customers are looking to do with their products over the next couple of years or do you need to tweak your portfolio, leaving Omega-3 aside?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","That's a very good question and I'll tell you, it's a difficult one to answer. I believe that we have very solid positions in MCC, alginate and carrageenan. I do believe that we have the right formulation technology allowing us to meet the changing need of the market and the customers.","And that's the business today, if you put Omega-3 aside, we have strong market share and we are the leading supplier and the place where customers go today when they have need for new product or new technology. So, I believe this is a business which will, for the next two, three years, continue to grow in the mid-single digit, as we said in the guidance, with very strong margin, 25%, and good cash generation.","So, to answer your question, I'm quite confident around that business for the next two to three years. We do have interesting new ideas based on the current product we have for new technology for some of the changing market needs around health and other applications.","The question for me is more three years and beyond. Really, where do we want to take that franchise? We have great product today. We have great margin and good cash generation. The first attempt to do that was Omega-3. I think we didn't do a good job there.","The question is what we want that business to be, not in the next two, three years, but beyond that. So, to answer your question, yes, for the next two, three years. Beyond that, we need to do a lot of work to define the mid-term strategy for Health and Nutrition.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's super helpful. And if I could just come back, I hate to beat on the working capital issue, but just a clarification. Of the additional $400 million and everything else you're doing down there, are your credit practices in Brazil going to be materially different than legacy FMC or is this just a matter of we've got the Cheminova clean-up and better execution, well, and customers in better shape?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","So, the first thing I would say though is when we look back at the position that find ourselves in, in Brazil, much of it is driven by some of the comments that Pierre talked about, about changing the way we approach the business. And instead of focusing on volume and volume growth and share growth focusing on getting the maximum value. An important part of that is assessing the quality of the customer and the quality of the products that we sell. We do not expect to be in a meaningfully different place in terms of terms, in terms of structure, in terms of credit that we extend to customers to either history or the rest of the market. But we will be much more and we are being much more disciplined about where we're willing to take exposure. It's really a function of multiple factors. It's a function of the movement in commodity prices, it's a function of the weaker access to credit for the growers down there in the market, and it is to an extent, a function of our ability to integrate the Cheminova portfolio and have a higher margin more technical portfolio really across all regions and all crops. So, it's more than one factor that's driving this move towards a stronger credit position with our customers down there.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think, generally speaking, the crop chemical industries, as a whole, for us and all of our peer company is an industry which is in Latin America and Brazil which has been historically focused on growth and maybe a bit more open to taking risk to gain market share. And we were there with all of our competitors. I do think, today, we might have a strategy without fundamentally changing what we've done to be more careful for the foreseeable future. I think it's important, it's working for us and it's allowing to collect, to price our customers who want our product. So, we're going to be maybe on the lower end of the risk taking without fundamentally changing the way we look at our receivables.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you both.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of follow-ups if I may. First of all, with regards to your announced deal for 8,000 tons of carbonate that you're going to be getting from your new partner. Is that pretty much all of their capacity or, and do you have the right to all of that capacity or is there more behind that?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","The 8,000 ton is, when you say their capacity, it's not their \u2013 it's our capacity. I mean, this plant. If you talk about the expansion in China of this plant...","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Nemaska.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Oh, in Nemaska. Okay. I was talking about the...","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","I'm talking about the 8,000...yep...","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yes. Dmitry, this is Tom. I can take that. Nemaska's installed capacity will be 28,000 tons. So, it will be a meaningful part of their capacity but it will not by any means be all of their capacity.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And I'm assuming you have some way of getting more if you need more either from these guys or from other sources as you move past 2018, 2019?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Well, with respect to that, as Pierre outlined in his comments, we've got a multi-prong strategy where we're continually evaluating, one, how do we diversify, have security of supply, low cost supply. So, we're not quite ready to announce the other pieces coming but there'll will be multiple components to that including our own investments in our facilities as well as working with others.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Fair enough...","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think it's important in all of the discussions we have \u2013 we have this Nemaska agreement. We are in current discussions with some other suppliers of carbonate for partnership. But let's not forget that there is one aspect for which we have 100% of the decision. It is expanding in Argentina. We can expand in Argentina. We do have the mines. We do have the capability. We have the infrastructure.","So, it is a decision we can make. I have to admit that I'm not in a rush to make that decision because with all of the companies today investing in lithium carbonate, I believe there will be plenty of lithium carbonate for the next two years, three years, four years. But this is a decision we can make at any time.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, you actually kind of led into my next question, Pierre. There's a 20% debottlenecking expansion that you're undertaking in Argentina. What's the timing for that to come online? Is that a back-end of 2017 as well?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. This is going to start right now. I mean, we're going to see this capacity of carbonate coming in at some point during 2017, 2018. So, this is undertaken right now.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Right.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","It is low capital and no more debottlenecking. The team has been working and we have, I think, three work streams which are allowing us to get to this kind of numbers, but it's more routine-capital expansion. I mean...","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got you.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","And, Dmitry, just to give you a little more color on that, there's multiple components of that. So, there's some operational efficiency changes. There's some low-capital projects. There's a number of small projects that, over the course of 2017 and 2018, we'll add that.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So, it sounds like you're \u2013 if I do my math right here, your Argentina production will go up to about 21,000 tons, is that about right?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. That's correct","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","And then final question on the crop protection business and sort of your margins have been, in the past, very differentiated between sort of 25% level in the first half of the year and kind of 20% level in the second half of the year, given where the regions that you get your sales from. This year, obviously, has been distorted by everything that's going on. So, it's going to be more like first half and second half to be more or less even in terms of margin. As the business gets back to sort of normal execution, how do we think about 2017 margin cadence? Should we expect sort of 3-point to 4-point margin difference between the first half and the second half of the year or is it going to be more like this year where margins are a little bit more even between the quarters?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. We're going to get into next year and then once again, it's a bit early for us to break down by quarter. We've given a directional number. But yes, the profile of the margins and the business is going to change versus historical FMC just because we have a very different regional profile. I mean, remember, we're very small in Europe. We going to be much bigger in Europe where there is good margin in our business. So, I would say that directionally, we should have less variation in our quarterly margins that we had in the past.","Now, there is two things happening today, if, there is the market situation, there is a different approach we are taking to the Latin America market and there is the cost synergies, which are growing quarter after quarter. So, that is taking us to improve margin and taking us to the 20% range. But I would say in the future, you'll have more stable margin quarter-over-quarter.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question today. And that will come from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Thanks for taking my questions. In Lithium specifically, pretty, 40% of earnings growth assumption for 2017, I think you mentioned earlier kind of a low \u2013 flat to down expectations for pricing in carbonate. Can you kind of give the other expectations that are driving that assumption for 2017?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I would say, well, first, if you look at our business in 2017, we're expecting to be \u2013 and, Tom, correct me if I'm a bit off here, but I would say, almost 90% of our business revenues being on the specialty side, the downstream, and only 10% on the upstream, which is carbonate and fluoride. So, we're going to be even more dependent upon the downstream business. We are expecting, I would say, little benefit from carbonate, chloride pricing, knowing that it's only a small percentage of our business, and we believe this pricing is going to level off in 2017.","So, you would consider the 40% improvement is going to mostly come from two things, pricing in lithium hydroxide and volume in lithium hydroxide. You will understand that I'm going to be a bit careful on what I'm expecting in term of lithium hydroxide price increase because we are in the middle of a bunch of contract negotiations. So, we will give you more detail around pricing when we get to the February earnings call because those negotiations will be behind us.","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","To add a little bit more color to that, you have to realize that most of our specialty business is contracted in the prior year. But, when we contracted a lot of that, it was before we saw how strong the pricing had moved across the market overall. So, there's a little bit of a catch up that's happening across all of the specialty products.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And just on the supply agreement to speed your hydroxide ramp, should we expect the additional volumes to comes from new entrants like Nemaska or do you expect from existing (01:07:21) or hard rock producers?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. So, of course, when you look at a supply of carbonate to seed growth, you want to be certain that you have the appropriate mix of new entrants and established players. So, we will not, having a strategy to supply carbonate into our business based only or mostly on new entrants in this market. Nemaska, we believe is one of the most solid today, with one of the best source of lithium, so we believe it's a fairly certain supply we're going to get from them but we will do two things. One is supply from existing suppliers and not to forget that some of them already supplying to us carbonate. And second of all, to repeat, we can also increase our own capacity of carbonate which is something, if we decide to do it, there will be a sure supply.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Brian P. Angeli - FMC Corp.","So, we appreciate your time. That's all the time we have for the call today. As always, I'll be available following the call for any additional questions you may have.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Alisha Bellezza, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Ms. Bellezza, you may begin.","Alisha Bellezza","Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FMC Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who will review our quarter performance, business segment results and provide an update on our 2014 outlook; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will present select financial results. Following his comments, Pierre will then be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President, FMC Minerals; and Mike Smith, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition, to address your questions.","Today's discussions will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's call, are provided on our website. Our 2014 outlook statement, which provides guidance for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2014, can also be found on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Alisha, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me start by providing some comments on the market dynamics that are affecting our businesses today.","Starting with Ag Solutions. 2014 has been an unusual year, with weather having a particular impact on our results. As you recall, the prolonged cold winter in North America impacted planting decisions and ultimately, sales at -- of our plant insecticides in the first half.","Additionally, the first half of the year was characterized by dry conditions in Brazil. This also negatively impacted our sales to sugarcane growers. Unfortunately, Brazil is still experiencing drought conditions. Not only has the dry weather in S\u00e3o Paulo state reduced demand in sugarcane, we have also seen it in the Mato Grosso region. There, it has led some growers to delay soybean planting into October as they wait for more favorable weather.","Europe has had a good season with favorable growing conditions for the major crops, such as wheat and oilseed rape, and good demand for certain crop protection product, especially fungicides.","Asia is a more complex region with multiple markets and crops, each with its own dynamics. For example, India is currently experiencing drought conditions. And in Thailand, the removal of rice subsidies is affecting a major rice-growing region. China is itself a fragmented market, but it is expected to continue to increase the use of crop protection products in the near term. Overall, we expect Asia to continue to demonstrate growth for industry in the next few years.","North America quickly shifted from extreme cold to very favorable growing conditions, with lower-than-normal pest pressures in the growing areas creating fewer opportunities for full year applications. Today, these favorable conditions are leading to potential record yields in both soybean and corn, creating downward pressure on commodity prices.","We see some consequences of these lower prices in the near term. First, in Brazil, we expect more soybean acres to be planted, given the more attractive economics relative to other crops. Planted acreage in cotton is likely to be stable, given the government programs to reimburse growers for low prices. However, it is clear that growers are making their final planting decisions and the related crop-protection buying selections later than usual this year.","In North America, the pattern of increased purchasing at the end of the year, which growers typically do in anticipation of their next season needs, may be more muted in the second half of 2014.","As growers plan for the 2015 planting season, corn and cotton acreage are both likely to be reduced in favor of soybeans, although final planting decisions will likely be taken later than usual.","In Health and Nutrition, our diverse business and its end markets are showing similar growth patterns as in previous years. The pharmaceutical end markets remain robust, with our Avicel product line continuing to maintain its leading position. Demand for our texturant products serving nutrition markets is also strong, with the exception of certain beverage applications in China.","We have started to see the slowdown in overall economic growth in China impact consumer behavior, which when combined with tighter inventory management by certain customers, is leading to lower demand for some of our product.","We expect demand in these applications to remain relatively weak for the remainder of 2014. However, we are seeing stronger demand for food ingredients in North America, which is providing a favorable product mix.","In omega-3 markets, the number of FDA approvals for omega-3-based product reinforces our confidence in increased omega-3 pharmaceutical-grade demand in the coming years. The lithium market has been following a consistent growth trend in the recent years.","Demand in industrial polymer and pharmaceutical end markets is growing steadily, while demand in energy applications is growing more quickly, led by increased electric vehicle penetration.","For our business, Argentina remains the biggest challenge to operations. The challenges of operating in a high-inflationary environment are not new, but we are now starting to see the impact of import restrictions on their operations.","For example, it was difficult to import certain critical engineering components into Argentina. This resulted in increased operational costs in the third quarter. Despite these challenges and market dynamics, FMC had a record third quarter in 2014. We generated $1 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $184 million, a 13% increase compared to last year. And adjusted EPS was $0.95, an increase of 16% over last year, despite volatile conditions in the quarter.","Let me now turn to segment results. Third quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $549 million, a 4% increase over the third quarter of 2013. Segment earnings were $117 million, up 2% over last year. Within Agricultural Solutions, the year-over-year growth in revenue was driven by Latin American business. The 9% growth in that region demonstrates the strength of our business model within a highly competitive marketplace and with challenging external conditions.","Increased weed resistance in Argentina resulted in higher sales of our Authority herbicides. And in Mexico, a focus in fruits and vegetables resulted in sales increase for our recently introduced Marceda [ph] insecticide and Rovral fungicide products. We expect demand in both of these countries to continue to be strong into the fourth quarter.","In Brazil, as I mentioned earlier, the drought conditions reduced demand for our sugarcane product, as growers cut back on all inputs and continued to replant at a lower rate than typical. Offsetting this, we saw solid demand for our cotton and soybean products.","Margins in Latin America improved versus the second quarter and versus last year, as we benefited from a mix of higher-value product. This benefit was partially offset by increased spending on logistics, currency hedging, and research and development costs in the region.","In North America, additional demand for cotton products was offset by weaker-than-normal pest pressures in the Midwest that reduced demand for the full year insecticide versus the previous year.","As we look toward the fourth quarter, Latin America will be the largest contributor to our results. We expect to continue gaining market share in Brazilian soybean as we expand our market presence with a broadening portfolio. We also expect to benefit from the strength in cotton as the planting season gets underway in November.","We expect growing demand for our soybean pre-emergent herbicide in North America, following an increase in market share in the 2014 season and supported by expectations of increased soybean acres and expansion of weed resistance in 2015.","We expect these factors to offset an otherwise weak overall market and lead to fourth quarter segment earnings to be flat to up single-digits percent over the previous year, which was particularly strong for us.","Now turning to Health and Nutrition. Segment revenues of $203 million increased 7%, and operating profit of $44 million was 6% higher than last year. In the quarter, demand in the pharmaceutical end markets that we serve was solid. There was particularly strong demand for our tablet excipients in Asia and Europe, especially for the global pharma customers who produce generic prescription products. We also saw increased demand for alginates used in pharmaceutical applications.","Overall, Nutrition profitability benefited from changes to the mix of food ingredients sold. In North America, higher volume of texture and stability solution offset weaker-than-expected demand for similar products in China.","For the remainder of the year, increased demand in health markets, particularly in Europe and Asia, along with higher demand for nutritional markets in North America, is expected to offset continued weakness in demand for beverage applications in China. We expect omega-3 sales to be lower as certain customers shift orders into the first half of 2015. As a result, we expect fourth quarter segment earnings to be flat to the previous year.","Let me now review Minerals. Revenue of $264 million increased 11%, and operating profit of $39 million increased 42% versus the same period last year. Both Minerals businesses performed as expected, as our Manufacturing Excellence initiatives continue to deliver volume and efficiency gains.","Higher soda ash pricing and improved operations in both Alkali and Lithium resulted in a significant increase in profitability over the third quarter of 2013. In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $197 million increased by 9% over the previous year quarter. Higher realized pricing and additional manufacturing volumes generated higher sales and profitability and offset the headwinds of higher energy costs.","With regard to manufacturing operations. We are now operating at or above record production levels despite encountering higher-than-average level of insolubles materials. We will move the longwall in the fourth quarter again this year, but we expect the higher year-over-year pricing and improved production will contribute to stronger Alkali profitability versus the fourth quarter of 2013.","In Lithium, sales of $67 million were 19% higher than the previous year. Improved operations produced additional volumes and allowed for higher sales in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, conditions in Argentina remained a headwind to profitability and had a negative impact on our cost structure. This headwind is expected to remain in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we still expect that improved operations in Lithium will deliver low-teens profitability for the full year.","In Minerals, our Lithium operations will achieve 12 consecutive months of improved operation in Argentina in the fourth quarter, and we expect near-record production in Alkali operation. This strong performance is expected to be partially offset by the current challenges of operating in Argentina. Segment earnings are expected to grow mid-single-digits percent year-over-year.","I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights.","Paul W. Graves","Thanks, Pierre. Let me start with cash flow. For the year-to-date, net cash provided by operating activities was $235 million compared to $381 million at the same point last year. The biggest factor driving this lower performance is the Agricultural Solutions business, where we've seen different quarterly patterns of sales and collections all year. This was especially the case in the third quarter this year, where growers in Brazil elected to retain possession of their harvested crops rather than sell at the lower prices. And they were aggressively managing the payments to their own suppliers accordingly.","We expect to generate approximately $350 million of cash from operations for the full year, slightly below last year, again, due to different patterns of business in Agricultural Solutions. The outcome of the full year will largely be driven by our receivables collection performance in Brazil, as well as the pattern of ordering, including prepayments we receive and rebates we pay in North America.","We are in very close and frequent dialogue with all of our customers, and we manage our exposure to each one very carefully. Despite the increased accounts receivable balance, we do not believe that there's been any meaningful deterioration of credit quality of our customer base.","Currency movements had very little impact on our revenue or earnings in the quarter. Although we continue to see some swings in exchange rates, movements in individual currencies largely offset each other or our exposures were hedged.","However, we did see currency movements impact our tax rate in the quarter. Our underlying tax rate remains in the 25% to 26% range. However, the revaluation of certain monetary assets in Brazil and Norway created a buck [ph] credit of $5 million to our tax charge, leading to a reported rate closer to 22.5%. This did not impact our cash tax liability.","We continue to expect that our underlying tax rate will remain in the 25% to 26% range for adjusted earnings for the full year, excluding the impact from these discrete items. Starting in this quarter, we will provide additional disclosures to our adjusted tax rate in our 10-Q, showing these discrete items separately.","We funded approximately $53 million in capital additions during the quarter, which was primarily associated with the ongoing construction of the Thailand MCC facility and the gas pipeline in Argentina. We anticipate full year capital additions will be between $240 million and $270 million. This is lower than we previously forecast due to a combination of timing, with some projects being deferred until 2015 or later, and increased discipline around our capital spending in the current environment.","In the quarter, we incurred approximately $15 million of legal and professional fees associated with the acquisition of Cheminova and the divestiture of Alkali. We also took out a series of forward currency contracts to hedge our exposure to Danish kroner as a result of the Cheminova acquisition.","Finally, let me note that just after the quarter closed, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 6.25% interest in FMC Wyoming. We made total payments of approximately $95 million to acquire this interest. Also after the quarter closed, in connection with the acquisition of Cheminova, we entered into a commitment for a term loan up to $2 billion and extended our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility out to October 2019.","With that, I will now turn the call back to Pierre to summarize and to give an update on both the Cheminova acquisition and the Alkali Chemicals sale process.","Pierre R. Brondeau","For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share. For the full year, we expect adjusted earnings to be between $3.85 and $3.95 per diluted share.","The challenging environment in the agricultural markets we are seeing today does not diminish our excitement about the mid- and long-term prospects for our business. Agricultural Solutions, with its focus on innovation and technology and its ongoing investment in market access initiative, continues to outperform the crop protection industry.","The acquisition of Cheminova further strengthened our business, providing greater balance to our portfolio, a broader geographic reach and increased scale in areas such as research and development. We remain on track to close the acquisition in the early part of 2015.","As we previously said, we are targeting delivering synergies of approximately $100 million to $130 million by the third year, and we expect that the majority of the actions needed to deliver these synergies will be completed in the first 2 years.","With regard to Alkali Chemicals, as you can see, the business continues to perform well. We are on track to launch the sale process in the coming days, and based upon feedback so far, we expect a lot of interest. It remains our intention to announce the results of the sale process in the first half of 2015.","Now I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Pierre, when you think about 2015 for the Ag Solution -- your base Ag Solution business, given the puts and takes with where commodity prices are, can you maybe give us some help on what type of profitability you think this business can produce in this type of an environment?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. Let me maybe take that opportunity to give you at least the FMC view of the market going into 2015 and what we are seeing, then I will tell you the -- what kind of growth rate we could expect when we talk about profitability. So first, let me talk with our biggest region, Latin America, and mostly Brazil. If we look at Brazil from an overall acreage and crop protection chemicals, I would say, for us, it's a market which will be overall flat to flat to slightly up. We see soybean flat to slightly up, the same for corn and the same for sugarcane, and maybe the place where we see the biggest challenge could be cotton getting into next year. So overall, that would be for us the region which will be the fastest growing, even if it's a bit sluggish compared to some other year. North America, as an overall region, whether it's acreage or crop protection chemical, we see a market overall which is down single digit. We see soybean being quite good with the shift from corn into soybean. And soybean acreage and crop protection chemicals being up in the low- to mid-single-digit percent. Corn being down in acreage and down to flattish for the crop chemical market. Cotton, as in Brazil, we see cotton being a down market next year. So overall, a slightly down single-digit market for North America. Europe, we also see a flattish type of a market, maybe oilseed rape will be flat to up. It's a very important -- to start the year. It's a very important crop over there, but overall, a flattish market. Where we see Asia, up in the single digit. It's a fragmented region. It's always a more difficult region to forecast. But we could see Asia providing growth. So if you look at the overall market, acreage and crop protection chemicals, following the acreage, 2 regions will bring a flat to low single-digit growth, that would be Brazil, Latin America and Asia; and 2 regions will be flat to down single digit, that would be North America and Europe. That results in -- would be in 2015 being a flattish market for -- flattish market, very low single digit overall worldwide. Now if I look at FMC and how can we perform in a market like this, I strongly believe that we will continue to outperform like we've done in previous years. And I would say, like we have done this year, I think if you look quarter-to-quarter, the performance of our business is still very far from our expectation. But if you forget about our expectation and put the performance of our business against other crop chemical competitors, we are doing quite well. So if I look into next year, 2015, what kind of growth could we expect? I think there is 4 very significant drivers for us of growth above market. First, we still believe that our business model, speed of product development, formulation technology, decentralized model and very flexible model, will allow us to keep on growing above the market like we've done in the previous year. We're also going to see the start of the revenue synergies with the Cheminova acquisition, I would say most likely in the second half of the year, and Latin America, Brazil will be the first place where we will see those synergies. I believe our new product, new technology and low market share, we will continue, as we have done this year, to gain market share in soybean and -- soybeans and corn. And last, very importantly, even if it is not at the level of what we've seen in the past, we still believe that Brazil and Latin America will be the fastest-growing region. And remember, this is where we have more than half of our business. So you put those 4 factors together in an overall market worldwide, which will be flat to up low single digit, I think we could outperform the market somewhere between 300 basis points to 500 basis points. That would be the forecast that we'll do. From a margin, I think this year, we've seen a dilution of margin, mostly due to the first half of the year, where you remember we had sales of a third-party product beyond what we were expecting. But today, we are looking at margin for the fourth quarter, which will be very much in line with what we had in previous quarter. For the third quarter, we are very slightly under last year performance, but it's mostly a balance, North America and Brazil, which is not the same as we had in previous year. Remember, North America is our highest-margin region. So nothing here which is fundamental problem with the business. So we should be able to see the margin growing at the same speed as our top line, plus cost synergies we will be generating from the acquisition of Cheminova.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one quick one on Cheminova. You've talked about improving that business from high single digits to high teens with the synergies over the next several years. How do you feel about the starting point, the high single digits, given that we're -- given the environment? Is that really the place to start? Or have you rethought of the starting base for Cheminova as you enter '15 and '16?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No, I mean, as -- all of the information we have at this stage -- and remember, it's not closed, so we are still competing with Cheminova. But all of the information we have from the due diligence process, everything is telling us that the expectation to start in the high single digit is here. They have been maintaining and they are very highly focused on protecting their margin. And then we do have, as I've outlined before, multiple actions we are expecting to take place to bring their margin to the high single digits. Just to repeat myself, I think the first situation, the first opportunity we have are on cost synergies. Just on cost, not talking about revenue synergies, we're going to able to see the margin growing from the high single digit to the mid-double digit, around the 15%, and that is just by acting on the cost synergies. Then there is pricing for right technology. I think they do have some very interesting technology, which blended with ours, is going to allow us to put on the market some very interesting product, which will allow us to have new technology. And the mix is always favorable to us, and then revenue synergies in the right applications. So we've got all of those numbers outlined. And I believe we're going to get, in the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to bring the high single digit to the 17%, 18%, 19% range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","But switching the gears a little bit to Health and Nutrition. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on with the omega-3 FDA approvals and sort of why the change in timing? Also, can you provide a little bit more detail on the Chinese beverage market that seems to be causing you a little bit of a headwind, both on top line and margin? And just talk about sort of the outlook for the business for the fourth quarter in terms of fundamentals, probably more so than any specific guidance, which you already provided.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Let me give you an overview, and then I'll ask Mike to give some more color. First, omega-3, it is not completely surprising what we are facing. As you know, we bought a new business, a new technology, and we're going to have to grow that business. So we know and we knew from the beginning that we're going to have a dependence at the beginning on some large pharmaceutical customers who are placing orders, which are the bulk part of our -- the biggest parts of our business. Those customers are themselves new players or companies growing in omega-3. So we have a new product we are selling to customers. We are pushing in the market a new product. All of this is working well. But we know until we have more pharmaceutical customers and we have developed the right nutraceutical product, which will give a broader base to our business, it is going to be lumpy. We -- right now, we rely on too few customers, which are very large, to have a regular demand. So we had a couple of them. The biggest one, which are -- their market penetration is a bit slower than what they were expecting. They are bringing new product to the market. So they have asked us to take the order in the first quarter, if we wouldn't mind. It was in the fourth quarter. And of course, being a partner as we are, we agreed to move those orders to the first quarter. So this one is -- I have to say, this one around omega-3 is not a surprise, is not concerning. It's going to take a good year for us to have the new nutraceutical product, have our customers establish their market. We knew it from day 1. It's always the uncertainty when you penetrate a new market with a new technology. I think the one where we are having a closer eye is the situation -- the MCC situation in China. The second quarter was slower than expected. The third quarter was slower than expected. I think there is some impact of the economy and the growth of the economy in China, which is maybe seeing less penetration in term of growth rate of those high-end beverage in China than we were expecting, which has led some of the very large suppliers to control their stock and their inventory. Now if it is -- if the slowdown versus what we're expecting is mostly the result of our customers controlling their inventory better because the growth rate is in the, call it, high single digit, low double digit instead of the 20%, then it's not a big problem. If it is because there is a more intrinsic slowdown of the penetration of those products in the beverage industry, then it is a more serious question. And that's what we are trying to sort through. It's 2 quarters of slower growth. And even this quarter, I think, Mike, there was no growth for the MCC business. So we have to understand what are the very key drivers behind that performance. As I say one -- in one case, inventory correction, I'm less worried. More fundamental demand, then I would be a bit more concerned around what we need to do next to still continue to grow in this market. Mike, do you want to give some more colors?","Michael P. Smith","I think the one thing that I would add to Pierre's comments is that starting the end of last year and into the beginning of this year, there have been some significant increases in dairy protein, and that has also reduced some of the demand for dairy protein beverages. So that, combined with some of the lower growth in consumer demand in China for dairy protein beverages, and also a significant slowdown in peanuts-based beverages, has really caused a reduction in the demand. And also, as Pierre mentioned, as those significant customers had continued to grow last year and produced a lot of product into the beginning of this year, we have seen a few of our very large customers start to reduce their inventory throughout a very extensive retail system throughout China during the last few quarters, and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. And of course, as Pierre mentioned, really, we're really focusing on the underlying demand for some of these important segments and trying to determine more specifically when, and to the extent that demand in China will regain its growth pattern.","Pierre R. Brondeau","So in summary, omega, not a big problem, expected, new market, new technology. MCC, we really want to stay very close to the action to understand the fundamental reasons for the slowdown.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, can I ask a quick question about the Minerals business and the guidance for 2014 -- 2015 fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, 2014 fourth quarter? The flattish guidance on the EBIT line, is that largely the function of the Argentinian issues with Lithium? Or -- because I mean, the longwall move falls basically in the same quarter, so that shouldn't be incrementally different unless you expect to experience higher costs in moving the longwall versus last year. So is this -- is the Lithium problems, in terms of Argentinian extra costs, severe enough to kind of offset the growth that you would expect with Alkali, which you had a pretty good 9 months year-to-date?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. So let me give to you a little bit the dynamic, and, Ed, please jump in. But I think if you look at overall Minerals, it is going to be a quarter which will be flat year-on-year. And if you exclude the shutdown of the plant we have, it will be about the same profitability sequentially from the third quarter. So we believe, year-on-year, we're going to be up mid-single digits versus a year ago, and we are very strong here in the second quarter. But the second quarter, I must say, was -- the business has been operating very, very well. It was almost flawless operation, pricing was good. Plant operation was good in both businesses. But it was a fairly easy comp, if you look from a year ago when we had multiple issues. So the 30-plus-percent growth in earnings for the business in Q3 is not completely representative of what we're expecting as being a regular growth in earnings for that business. I think the business continues to operate well. We believe it's going to be operating the same way in the fourth quarter as it did in the third quarter, but I think we're going to be against a much stronger quarter last year. But there is no fundamental change around pricing, operation of the plant. We have the turnaround in the middle, but there is no fundamental changes going into Q4 from Q3, it's about the same performance. The comp was easier in Q3 than it is in Q4. And if you look at our numbers last year, Q3 was by far the weakest quarter we had in Minerals.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Paul, I wanted to ask you a little -- to dive a little bit deeper on the cash conversion. If I look at kind of where this year is probably going to shake out, it looks like you're guiding to 8% or 9% cash from operations as a percent of sales. If I look at where your EBITDA margin is going to shake out, probably 21% or 22%. Does the receivables issue and maybe other working capital stuff explain that gap fully? Or can you maybe walk us through why there's such a big gap between the cash conversion and the EBITDA margin?","Paul W. Graves","The biggest factor is, by a distance, working capital, and it's largely driven by -- if you look back historically, we've grown our receivables in the major market in Brazil, double digit each year, in line with how the sales in some -- in that market has grown. And what we've seen this year, that's being compounded a little by slower collection rates. You can take a glance at that balance sheet and see how the accounts receivables have expanded, certainly, in advance and greater than the revenue has. So that, by far, is the single biggest factor that drives that delta between the EBITDA number and the cash conversion number.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Great. And then on the Ag side, you noted in North America that pest pressure was lower than expected. And I was just hoping to understand whether that means there's a lot of inventory built up in the channel, either at farms or maybe at distributors' warehouses, that could negatively impact next year's sales. Is that how it works? Or do you guys end up buying the products back when they go unused, so you have a better sense of where the inventory levels are? And then maybe address the same issue, whether that's taking place in South America.","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Mike, it's Mark here. I'll take that one. From a North America perspective, I would say it's a mixed bag in terms of what we see for channel inventories. Given the conditions we saw earlier in the year, given the extreme cold and what happened with soil insecticides for the corn space, I would say we're going into next year with elevated channel inventories in that space. So that's something that we're watching very carefully. I would say on the opposite end of the spectrum, we had a very good year with our pre-herbicides on soy, our Authority brands. I would say we're going into next year with normal or even low inventories in certain parts of the country in the channel, so that bodes well for 2015 on our soy herbicides business. Looking down in Brazil, clearly, what we saw going through the third quarter was grower intentions changing in terms of timing, given what they saw with commodity prices and certainly, the weather aspects in Mato Grosso and in S\u00e3o Paulo state. I would say, going into the season now, channel inventories are high. Obviously, we're waiting for the rains to come. They're supposed to come in the next week or so. Once that happens, things will start to free up, but it's definitely delayed. And I would say, yes, channel inventories are elevated in Brazil. Not necessarily so in Argentina, by the way, probably the opposite there, where we're seeing good need for our pre-herbicides once again. Problem is -- there is getting the import materials through the borders.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess a two-part question on soda ash. First, I think you indicated you paid $95 million for the 6.25% interest in your Wyoming operations that you didn't already own. I was wondering how you arrived at that value. And then the second part, since the last earnings call, I think you quantified the expected dilution from the future divestiture of the business at $0.55. And if I look at the new EPS range for 2014, it's roughly 14% of that range, a fairly large number there. And so I'm wondering how committed you are to divesting the business and whether the changing market conditions are something that you're watching in that context.","Paul W. Graves","Let me take a stab at those questions. I think, first of all, in terms of the purchase of the FMC Wyoming stake, we had a long-term relationship with the holder of that stake, Sumitomo, and various contractual rights and commitments on both parties' side, which shaped, in some regard, the way we structured the buyout and the valuation of that buyout. It was a negotiated deal, as you can imagine. Removing a 6.25% minority holder so that we could actually have full control and pursue what we needed to with regard to ownership of that asset was valuable to us. There was a bunch of, without getting into the details, payments that were historical dividend catch-up, and there were some payments that were to take them out. But it was a base valuation that we negotiated with the other side rather than anything mechanical I can necessarily share with you. In terms of 2015 and the dilution impact we've talked about, our assumption and our method has always been to assume -- to forecast 2015 as broadly being in line with 2014. We don't have anything particularly large and major that we can point to today that would suggest 2015 is going to be significantly different based on contracted prices or anything else. And so it remains our best estimate as to the likely performance for 2015. And I think we remain committed to a sale of that business. We think it's going to be a very attractive business to a number of buyers. We think it's a business that certainly doesn't form a long-term part of FMC into the future as we close on Cheminova. And we think it's the prudent thing to do with regard to our balance sheet. We've talked many times about the importance of having a strong and flexible balance sheet as we operate in the Ag business. As Pierre pointed out, over half of our Ag business is in Latin America, and they have very different working capital terms down there. We think a strong balance sheet is really important to our business, and so we remain very committed to selling it.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's clear enough. The second question, if I may, on the Ag business. What percentage of your herbicide sales would you say are sold to address glyphosate-resistant weeds?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, good question, Kevin. I would say, with the pre-herbicides for us, Sulfentrazone is our big molecule both in Argentina, growing in Brazil and in North America. It's probably in the 65% to 70% range in terms of selective herbicides. So it's a big market for us, a big molecule, continue to see that weed resistance grow in North America. As I said, we're starting to see it in Brazil now. We're ideally placed to see that suite of products grow. And we're adding to both the pre- and the post-herbicides as we continue our innovation development.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to be clear, Mark, if I look at that 65% to 70% that is selective herbicides, would all of those address glyphosate-resistant weeds or just a subset? What would the next cut on it be?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes. I'd have to get -- I'll get with Alisha and come back to you on that exact cut, Kevin. It is the majority, but the exact percentage, I don't have right now in front of me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of clarifications here. In terms of -- Paul, you mentioned that the expectation on soda ash 2015 was essentially flat with '14. I know we're coming up on contract time for the 2015 contract in a month or so here. So is the general thinking that soda ash pricing 2015 might be flat then?","Pierre R. Brondeau","We are looking -- it's still very early in the process. We close those contracts throughout November, December. But I would say, today, there is not, looking at the growth, a lot of room. So it is a low single-digit potential increase in pricing.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, terrific. And then, Pierre, on the movement of the longwall, that's about a $4 million impact, is that correct?","Pierre R. Brondeau","That's correct.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. And then I was struck by the comment talking about Ag, and thank you so much for the detailed look at 2015, that you're expecting sugarcane in Brazil to essentially be flat in 2015. And obviously, you suffered through the drought here in 2014. I know commodity pricing is running against you. But why would do think that, that would just be flat for you guys and not potentially higher?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Frank, it's Mark. You're right, we've suffered through a couple of years of pretty major declines in terms of that industry's profitability and then hence, the inputs. I think we're just taking a prudent course of action here. We've been hit not only by commodity prices in terms of the world sugar price, but also ethanol caps in Brazil, they've impacted the industry. And not to forget that perhaps even bigger than that is the weather impacts, and predicting weather, as you know, is not easy. So I think we're just taking a cautious approach to sugarcane. We've had 2 years of very, very difficult conditions, and we're forecasting that to roll into early part of next year. Of course, that could change, but I think this is just the best course of action.","Pierre R. Brondeau","And one additional thing, Frank. You are correct, I mean, the sugarcane situation in Brazil is complicated because on one side, there is low production, which is due to the drought situation, but there is also because of the cap on oil pricing and -- which creates a limitation on the ethanol pricing. There is, actually despite the low production, it's one of the product -- we are following very closely what is called the stock-to-use, which is a very important ratio in terms of understanding how much inventory is building up. And today, if you look in Brazil, sugarcane is one of the place where there is the highest stock-to-use ratio. So despite the low production, because of the issue on the ethanol side, there is a very high stock-to-use. Now as Mark said, so we are taking the approach that in the short term, because there was not a change in regime, the government is the same, same president, same government, we are not forecasting a change in term of freeing the pricing at the pump. If such an action would take, it could definitely change that picture, but we cannot anticipate that. So assuming price of ethanol keep the same limitation, because of the size of the stock-to-use, right now, we are forecasting a flattish market in Brazil.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So a two-part question on Ag. Soy has obviously become a bigger part of your portfolio. This should position you well in the acreage outlook going forward. But I was hoping you could comment on how the margins for soy sales compare to other key end markets, such as fruits and vegetables, cotton and sugarcane. And then the other question is, just in North America, we're getting closer to the commercialization of dicamba-tolerant and 2,4-D-tolerant traits. How do you expect this to impact demand for your Authority product line going forward?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Sandy, let me take the first one. On the soy complex for us, free herbicides are very important, but we also have a mix of both fungicides down in Brazil, as well as insecticides. I would say, when you look at our overall EBIT margins, soy is right at the average of all of our product range. So it doesn't skew it up or down. It puts us basically in our 20% range. So it's a key contributor to the portfolio, but it's not just any one product, there is a whole suite there. To answer your second question on the new traits that are coming through, yes, obviously, we're watching this very closely in terms of the EPA authorization and what a lot of people are looking at in terms of how that will impact the soy market. Like a lot of genetics, when they come in, you do see a decrease in terms of chemistry. But then depending on how resistance builds, the chemistry comes back. So yes, I think there will be an impact. But I think one thing that's very important for people to remember is, we still have market share to gain in many parts of the world. So for us, the soy complex is something we're still focused on with new technology we're bringing to market. So despite genetics coming in with different traits, we believe it's still a very attractive space to us as we develop new alternatives.","Pierre R. Brondeau","All right. So just to conclude, let me give a few words to conclude the call. We understand that the performance of the company is not at the level of our expectation because we're operating under difficult market conditions in our core segment. Nevertheless, within the context of the market we have today, we believe we continue, especially in our Ag business, and to some extent, in our Health and Nutrition business, to perform above competition.","From a transformation standpoint, we feel now we are at the right place. The Alkali business is generating a lot of interest, so we should have a pretty smooth and competitive process.","Cheminova, we have no concern. We are still feeling very strong that it was the appropriate move for us in our journey to building a very strong Ag, Health and Nutrition company.","The company next year will be larger, simpler, more focused. We do expect to continue to deliver strong results with a highly predictable Health and Nutrition business. And definitely, as I said before, we are definitely expecting, for all the reasons I've been stating, to outperform the Ag market. So we are in the process of a transformation. We know that first quarter, we'll see a lot of movement. We do expect to have much more clarity as soon as the acquisition is closed and the sale of the Alkali business is done. And that should lead us to a very solid year for 2015, within the context, once again, of the markets we're operating in. But I certainly expect a strong year, above market condition for our company.","As soon as we have clarity, which mean we have signed on Alkali and we have closed on Cheminova, we will bring investors and analysts together with us and give you a full picture. We will go through our regular Vision 2020 exercise. We will do it a bit differently this year, I think, because of all the moving parts. We'll give you a much more granular view on '15, '16 and '17, and then a strategic direction for 2020. But I think it will be important for us to state the shorter term, '15, '16 and '17 in a much more precise way because of all the moving parts.","So thank you very much for your attention, and we'll be in touch. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Sandifer, Vice President, Strategic Development and Investor Relations for FMC Corp. Mr. Sandifer, please go ahead.","Andrew D. Sandifer","Great. Thank you, John. Good morning. Welcome, everyone, to FMC's Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call and Webcast. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda this morning is as follows: Pierre will begin the call with a review of our fourth quarter and full year performance. Paul will provide an update on the company's financial position. Pierre will then provide our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2013. We will then complete the call by taking your questions.","Joining Pierre and Paul for the Q&A session will be Mark Douglas, President, Agricultural Products Group; Michael Wilson, President, Specialty Chemicals Group; and Ed Flynn, President, Industrial Chemicals Group.","Let me remind everyone that our discussion today will include certain statements that are forward-looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors that are summarized in FMC's 2011 Form 10-K, our most recent Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. This information represents our best judgment based upon today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Our discussion today will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. Under the heading entitled Glossary of Financial Terms on our website that's available at fmc.com, you will find the definition of adjusted earnings and certain other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's conference call.","Also on our website, we've posted our current 2013 outlook statement, which provides our guidance for the full year and first quarter 2013, reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP figures we will use today, as well as an additional exhibit describing changes we're making for 2013 to the way we present segment results in our financial statements. And finally, share and per share financial data discussed today reflect the 2 for 1 split of FMC's common stock completed on May 24, 2012. With that, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Pierre Brondeau. Pierre?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night, FMC continues to deliver strong operating performance and closed a successful 2012 with fourth quarter adjusted operating profit up 19% versus the prior year period. With this performance, we are fully on track to meet or exceed all of our Vision 2015 goals.","Let me begin with some highlights for the full year. Full year 2012 sales of $3.7 billion were up 11%, with adjusted operating profit up 16%. Earnings per share grew 16% to $3.48 per diluted share. Return on invested capital continued to be pretty high at 22.9% for the year. Underlying this performance was Agricultural Products' ninth consecutive year of record earnings, supported by solid earnings growth in Industrial Chemicals but offset, in part, by disappointing performance in Specialty Chemicals.","Increased exposure to rapidly developing economies continue to be a key driver, with 49% growth in 2012 sales to this faster-growing parts of the world as compared to 46% in 2011. Across the company, we completed 7 external growth transactions: 2 company acquisitions, 1 joint venture, 1 global licensing and IP agreement, and 3 joint developments and commercialization agreements, all of which complement and reinforce our organic growth efforts with technology, products and market access. We rewarded shareholders as well, returning $193 million through share repurchases and dividends.","2012 was truly a strong year for FMC.","Let me now move to results in the fourth quarter. Total company sales of $1 billion increased $91 million or 10% versus last year. It was led by continued growth performance in Agricultural Products segment. Regionally, sales grew more rapidly in Asia, up 23%, followed by Latin America, up 10%, and North America, up 9%. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa were flat, reflecting the continued weak economic conditions there.","Gross margin of $341 million increased by $47 million or 16% versus last year, with higher volumes and selling prices partially offset by increased operating costs.","Gross margin percent improved by 171 basis points over last year to 34%.","SG&A and R&D of $165 million increased $20 million or 14%, largely due to increased spending on targeted growth initiatives.","Adjusted operating profit of $172 million increased $10 million or 19% compared to last year.","We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.81 per diluted share, an increase of 2% versus the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share growth in the quarter was dampened by a higher-than-expected tax rate of 30.5%, especially as compared to the prior year period, a typically low rate of 17.3%.","Let's now take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter. First, in Agricultural Products. Fourth quarter sales of $492 million increased 20% versus the prior year quarter, with growth in all regions, but driven by continued strength in Latin America and such as 4 new product introductions around the world.","In Latin America, our higher sales reflect strong market conditions such as 4 new product introductions and increased plant [indiscernible] for soybeans in Brazil, augmented by increased sales via our market access joint venture in Argentina. Sales growth was partially offset by lower sales in cotton due to the reduction in acres planted.","North America saw strong early season demand, particularly for product directed at resistance management in soybeans and corn.","Sales in Asia were up strongly, driven by growth of the 2 fungicides acquired from Bayer in December 2011, as well as strong market growth in China, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.","In EMEA, sales were up with growth in insecticide volumes in Africa and higher herbicide sales in the EU.","Segment earnings for Agricultural Products of $110 million increased 51% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by strong volume growth, favorable mix and targeted price increases.","Additionally, we recently announced several new external growth transactions. In November, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Certis USA [ph] for access in the United States to a new biological fungicide bactericide. Under this agreement, our North America team will develop and sell this product in major field crops in the United States.","In December, we signed a global licensing agreement, along with development and distribution agreements, with GAT Microencapsulation AG, covering a range of advanced crop protection products and proprietary information technologies. FMC will be the main distributor of GAT's current product portfolio in virtually all global market and will partner with GAT to develop new products that FMC will commercialize exclusively in the future.","And in January, we entered into a research and development collaboration agreement for several proprietary biological pesticides from Quimica Agronomica de Mexico. We will co-develop the new fungicides and insecticides for use globally.","These transactions underscore how our disciplined external growth approach continues to add value-creating technology and products for Agricultural Products business.","Moving now on to Specialty Chemicals. Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $236 million, up 6% versus the year-ago quarter, as higher selling prices and volumes across all businesses were partially offset by unfavorable exchange rate impact of the weaker euro on the BioPolymer business.","BioPolymer continued its steady performance, with sales growing in the mid-single digits despite the translation impact of the weaker euro.","Food ingredients sales benefited somewhat from recent acquisition, while prices were up across all applications.","Lithium sales were up in the high-single digits, with continued pricing gain and modest volume increases versus the prior year quarter. Segment earnings were down 5% to $49 million primarily due to higher operating costs in Lithium, which despite posting its best quarterly performance of the year, was still substantially below prior year profitability.","Before moving on, let me address the Lithium business in more detail. Our Lithium business faced significant challenge in 2012, with manufacturing process issues related to the recent expansion project, as well as higher costs overall in our Argentina operations. Our Lithium team continues to work diligently to optimize our recently expanded Lithium extraction operation in Argentina. While we still have not reached the production rate targeted for this project, we are making good progress and expect continued improvement over the next several quarters. In addition, we're implementing a restructuring program in our Lithium business that will better align our costs to macroeconomic and market realities. This restructuring will principally impact our Bessemer City, North Carolina plant, Charlotte, North Carolina office and production facilities in Salta and [indiscernible] provinces Argentina. As a result, we expect to incur charges between $10 million and $15 million, primarily in the first quarter of 2013.","We also decided this quarter to write down a substantial portion of our investment to develop potash extraction capability in Argentina. Given the changes in market condition, this project is no longer economically attractive. As such, we are discontinuing all work on potash in Argentina and we'll repurpose the assets developed for this project as much as possible to future use in producing lithium.","Moving now to Industrial Chemicals. Revenue in Industrial Chemicals decreased 2% to $272 million, with slightly higher volumes offset by lower prices, the translation impact of a weaker euro, the reduced sales of the zeolites product line, which we announced we were exiting in the third quarter. Segment earnings of $38 million were down 10% from the prior year period, with slightly higher volume more than offset by higher operating costs and lower prices.","In Alkali chemicals, volumes were stronger than both Q3 and Q3 year-to-date average. Domestic soda ash demand showed improvement in the fourth quarter, offsetting some of the decline in prior period. Despite this, full year domestic soda ash demand was down versus the prior year. We increased exports by roughly the same amount that U.S. demand was down to keep our production assets fully utilized.","Our overall average soda ash price was down in the low-single-digit dollars per ton in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. Soda ash prices in all markets were up in the quarter except for Asia. Domestic soda ash prices were up in the quarter, consistent with full year 2012 gains. Export soda ash prices to all markets except Asia were also up, while overall export prices were down.","In Asia specifically, soda ash prices for the quarter were down sequentially and year-on-year, reflecting continuing excess capacity and soft demand in China. Soda ash prices within China and Chinese export prices are now, by our estimate, meaningfully below Chinese producers' cash cost. From both media reports and the financial reports of publicly traded Chinese soda ash companies, it is clear that Chinese producers are losing money. This is not a sustainable situation. The silver lining is that the Chinese economy seems to be improving from 2012 level, which should bode well for the Chinese soda ash demand. That said, we also believe Chinese [indiscernible] soda ash producers will see their costs continue to escalate as the economy recovers due to inflation, appreciation of the Chinese currency, energy costs, increasing emphasis on environmental regulation and the possible removal of the VAT export rebate, which was reinstated during the 2009 financial crisis.","We now anticipate that soda ash prices in Asia will continue to soften in the first quarter of 2013 and then begin to rebound such that full year 2013 pricing in Asia will be flat to slightly down.","In Peroxygens, higher volume were more than offset by unfavorable exchange rate impacts, principally from the weaker euro and lower prices resulting in slight reduction in sales versus the prior year. Peroxygens results also continue to be hurt by the zeolite production line, which we have now exited. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul Graves to cover our financial position. Paul?","Paul W. Graves","Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll report on our free cash flow and return of cash to shareholders, capital additions and on our tax rate for 2012. I'll then provide some comments on our expectations for [indiscernible] 2013.","So for full year 2012, starting with free cash flow. The free cash flow, defined as after all uses except acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, was $119 million, below our most recent guidance due almost exclusively to investment in additional inventory in our Agricultural Products Group in anticipation of stronger early season demand in North America in the first quarter. We returned $193 million to shareholders, $145 million through share repurchases and $48 million in dividends. We made no additional share repurchases in the fourth quarter, but made dividend payments of $12.4 million.","Capital additions in 2012 totaled $225 million, with an additional $32 million invested through the other investing activities line, which is mainly investment into our Agricultural Products total network. For 2012, approximately 50% of this cash deployed to organic reinvestment was directed towards growth investments across the businesses.","Capital additions in the fourth quarter were $97 million. Key components of this higher investment level were the first phases of the BioPolymer Asia MCC plant announced last quarter and the completion of the Newark, Delaware MCC expansion. We also continued multiple other small projects across all of the businesses.","As Pierre mentioned earlier, our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 was substantially higher than the prior year period, which itself was an unusually low 17.3%. As you may recall, we benefited from certain favorable one-off tax adjustments last year, which did not repeat in 2012.","The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 30.5%, an increase over prior quarters attributable primarily to the impact of meeting higher demand in the Agricultural Products segment in Brazil and North America. As a result of these fourth quarter factors, our tax rate for the full year was 28.2% compared to 26.3% in 2011 and a long-term tax rate which we expect to be approximately 27.5%.","Looking ahead to the full year 2013. Consistent with the way we discussed cash flow at our December 2012 Investor Day, we are shifting our focus to cash from operations as our key metric of cash generation. By doing so, we are separating the metric for cash generation from the choices we make on how we deploy that cash, such as to organic reinvestment, external growth or returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases, consistent with how we look at cash flow ourselves. On this basis, we anticipate generating cash from operations of approximately $650 million in 2013, and we anticipate deploying $350 million in cash to fund capital asset additions and investments in our Agricultural Products total manufacturing network.","We also expect to continue to invest in external growth, especially in Agricultural Products, BioPolymer and environmental solutions. We will, of course, maintain the discipline of regular return of cash to shareholders. With the 50% dividend increase announced in December, dividends will increase somewhat as a use of cash to approximately $75 million in 2013. We have $245 million of repurchase capacity remaining under the existing board authorization, and as described at our December Investor Day, expect to deploy up to $150 million each year to share repurchases.","Before I hand the call back to Pierre to provide our outlook for 2013, let me make clear a change in segment presentation that you'll see beginning in the first quarter of 2013. Effective with fiscal year 2013, our segment earnings presentation will be updated to reflect how we currently make financial decisions and allocate resources. We also believe the changes provide a better understanding of the underlying profitability of each individual business segment. The changes are the following: Allocation of certain long-term incentive costs, primarily stock-based compensation, from the category other income expense net to each business segment. Allocation of the depreciation on capitalized interest associated with the completed construction projects from the category other income expense net to each business segment. The presentation of the impact of noncontrolling interest, which was previously netted within each individual segment as its own line item. This principally impacts the results of our Industrial Chemicals segment, which has the majority of our noncontrolling interests. We will combine the 2 previous line items, other income expense net and corporate expense, into their own line item renamed corporate and other. And all forward-looking comparisons you'll hear today will reflect this change in segment presentation. We have posted a supplemental exhibit on our website that provides details for 2010 through 2012 by segment under this new segment presentation. With that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Paul. Let me now share with you our outlook for the full year 2013. We expect to deliver full year adjusted earnings of $3.81 to $4.01 per diluted share, a 12% increase at the midpoint of this range.","Our Agricultural Products segment is expected to achieve its 10th consecutive year of record earnings in 2013, with segment earnings to increase in the mid-teens percent. Increased volumes in all regions due to strong market conditions, growth in new and recently introduced products, a direct market access initiative in Asia and Latin America, and sales from new fungicide products will be partially offset by the continued investment in targeted growth initiative. Agricultural Products' results are expected to show pronounced strength in the early and latter part of the year due to a large participation in Latin America.","In Specialty Chemicals, segment earnings are expected to increase in the high-single-digit percent. Our BioPolymer business will benefit from capacity increases, while we will continue to focus on improving operating performance in Lithium.","In Industrial Chemicals, we anticipate flat segment earnings for the full year. Domestic soda ash prices will increase in the low- to mid-single-digit-dollar [indiscernible] versus the prior year. Soda ash prices in Asia are expected to continue to soften into the first quarter and then begin sequential improvement through the remainder of the year. The net result of domestic and export pricing actions for soda ash should be a flat to slightly down global average price year-over-year.","We also expect to begin seeing the benefits of our manufacturing actions initiative during 2013. Overall, the expected recovery in soda ash pricing and the seasonality of the Agricultural Products business will drive the quarterly performance of the company with strong year-on-year growth in the third and fourth quarter, and a weaker second quarter.","For the first quarter of 2013, we expect adjusted earnings of $1.02 to $1.12 per diluted share, a 10% increase versus the prior year at midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect segment earnings to be up approximately 20%, reflecting anticipated strong early season demand in North America and a strong finish to the Latin America season.","Specialty Chemicals segment earnings are projected to be up in the high-single digit on a percentage basis. BioPolymer is expected to continue its steady solid performance. Lithium is expected to show little improvement versus the prior year as we continue to improve operations in Argentina and reduce our purchases of third-party sourced intermediate materials.","And in our Industrial Chemicals, we expect first quarter segment earnings to be down in excess of 20%, principally due to lower soda ash export pricing.","Before taking your questions, I would like to include in this report my latest thoughts in light of the reports which were issued post-earnings release, from some questions which were asked. First, let me reaffirm a few things. We are not retracting from any of the statements we made in early December at FMC Investor Day. The company has never been as strong and is getting stronger. Ag is firing on all cylinders and even getting stronger, with new product lines which continue to amaze me. In BioPolymer, as we invest in new product lines through acquisition, new technology and new MCC capacity, this business is going to take advantage of these to demonstrate growth throughout the year, while still investing in capacity for future growth in Asia. Demand for new product is strong. Environmental solutions is on a solid growth track, even if the impact on earnings is still small. Peroxygens is now stable following the restructuring of the zeolite business. The only 2 elements which have changed since our Investor Day are timing issues. We were expecting soda ash export pricing to strengthen in the first quarter. All the data we have in our hands indicate that export pricing will turn around. But we now believe that it will be later in the second quarter.","We finally understand the Lithium production issue. The process was clearly damaged during the expansion and prevented us to even operate at pre-expansion levels. We believe that we have a process fix, which will be implemented in 2 steps. Step 1 happened last week. The difference between an EPS guidance centered around 4 and the current one at 3.91 is only timing, no other fundamental change in the businesses.","2013 is a key year on the way to delivering our Vision 2015 target, as we're expecting, following the strong first quarter, to see every single business operating at its full potential at some point in the second half of the year and see FMC deliver the fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. With that, I thank you for your time and attention, and we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first go to the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. So on the Lithium guidance, in particular for the first quarter, it seems even lighter than I would've expected for the business to be flat year-over-year, considering all the weather issues you had last year. So I guess 2 questions around that. First, does it include the charge that you talked about or is that x charge? And if it's x charge, then what's happening? Because it does seem like your volumes, at least in the commodity side, were really almost nonexistent last year, and so the idea that they're going to be flat with that this quarter seems a little bit low.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, John, first, the numbers we are talking about are x charge. And just I want to refer back to my last point. Where we are in Lithium today, and you know it's been a struggle, yes, we had the weather issue at the beginning of the year. But I think most importantly, we now realize that the process, the manufacturing process itself was clearly damaged during the expansion. And the damage was significant to the point that we do have to redefine the manufacturing process. We are implementing those changes, which are requiring changing equipment process and stop of the plant at multiple times. So we are going to have a poor quarter from a manufacturing standpoint in Argentina, which is the beginning of a process because from the brine is what we are doing, producing the chloride and carbonate and then the other derivatives. So that's where we are. Second quarter will see real improvements, real challenging. And I think it's in the second half of the year with the process change we do have in place right now. I mean we have remedies. We have engineering firms and our own engineering staff working on it. It's going to take into the third quarter to see the full production rate.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the North Carolina changes, the restructuring around that, I thought your North Carolina plant was largely an upgrading facility where you start -- where you were producing some pretty high-end products. So I guess what changes are happening there? And are you changing your product mix at all, or is it just kind of a streamlining of the process in North Carolina?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Couple of things we are doing. We had a plant and you know we have been, in the past, highly focused on pushing product out of the door. We believe that we have significant ways there to improve our process, to improve our control and streamline the plant. So what we are doing is without losing in terms of capacity, we are implementing changes, which are fairly significant in the plant, which will allow us to reduce staffing and cost.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just on the soda ash side and your confidence that the pricing starts to come back in the export markets, particularly in Asia or tied to Asia in the second quarter, have you started to see some of the Chinese producers dial back their capacity or shut the facilities down temporarily? Or is that something that you're just hoping for or expecting on to come?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I will ask Ed to answer the question.","Edward T. Flynn","John, there have been some -- which always happens at this time of the year, closures going to -- because of the Chinese New Year. And then what happens is some of those plants don't come back up after the Chinese New Year. The other sign that we're seeing is that it is being reported that the Chinese will not quote quarterly pricing, which is, as you would know that if they're not going to quote quarterly pricing, that's because they think pricing is at the bottom and they expect it to come back up. So we're kind of looking at what their competitor behavior is.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with Longbow Research.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","Couple of questions, first on the Ag segment. Your first quarter expectations very strong despite difficult year-over-year comp in the segment. I'm just wondering if the results are going to be, or operating profit is going to be driven by volume growth there or margin expansion mostly.","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think, Eugene, and I'll ask Mark to make additional comment, but if you look in the fourth quarter, the very strong performance is first due to a very positive mix. First, we had a very strong pre-season demand in North America. We also had a very strong demand for product which are addressing the glyphosate and corn rootworm trait resistance. Those products have been developing very quickly and have very new technology. And also, we've seen strong sales of bifenthrin. So you put those together -- volume, of course, were higher, but -- we had a 20% increase in sales. But really, we had a very positive mix. Mark, do you want to add anything?","Mark A. Douglas","I wouldn't add anything more on the fourth quarter. Was the question related to the first quarter or fourth quarter?","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","First quarter.","Mark A. Douglas","First quarter. Eugene, when you look at what we've got going forward, we've indicated a 20% growth. That is all predicated on volume. We have early season demand in North America that we believe is going to be strong and we're looking for a strong finish to the Latin American season. So it's predominantly volume-driven.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","Right. And also just a follow-up on the Ag, last year, I know that we had some rainy conditions in Europe and drought in the U.S. here. What was the negative impact, I guess, from those conditions? And do you expect normal seasonal this year? And what would be the positive or easier comp year-over-year if we see a normal season in North America and Latin America this year?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, we did in North America, because a lot of our products are sold early-season and there was significant insect pressure in the third quarter, we had a very good year in North America. Predicting the weather is, as you know, very difficult. But if we have a normal season, we should be looking at, in North America, high-single-digits growth in terms of our participation in the market. In Europe, acreage will be pretty flat. I would expect the market to be much flatter in Asia with much lower growth.","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think one of the situation we very often experience with the strength of the Latin America business is first, as Mark said, we were not very much impacted directly in North America. But in addition, drought conditions at time would keep competitive price high, creating increase in planting acreage in other regions of the world like Latin America. And it was the case, as you saw, the increase in soybean planting. So it also created a very positive performance for us in Latin America. So all in all, by the nature of our product and the strength in Latin America, we were not impacted negatively by the weather condition in the world.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","Switching gears, I wanted to follow up on discussion -- on Lithium discussion. Pierre, you mentioned that you expect Lithium business to be back operating in a full capacity in the third quarter. Just wanted to follow up on that. Is that going to be including the expansion you had, the 30% expansion in capacity, or is that going to be just pre-expansion...","Pierre R. Brondeau","You were breaking, I'm sorry. The question was the recovery of the Lithium business, when you said second half of the year?","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","I believe you mentioned that you expect the business to return to full operating capacity in the third quarter. Do you mean full operating capacity, including the 30% expansion that you had, or that's going to be excluding that expansion?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, we are still, right now, changing the process conditions we have. We believe we will get -- we are going to keep on ramping up. So a lot of fixing of the process according to a protocol we have defined is going to take place in the first 2 quarters of the year. We believe we will be successful, and that's when we will see significant ramp-up of manufacturing. So we believe we will get past pre-expansion capacity to go toward a capacity closer to what was expected post-expansion. But it's going to be happening, ramping up during the second half of the year. Will we get to that point in the third quarter or beginning of the fourth, we don't know yet. We have to wait another, I would say, 60 days to see how the 2-step process improvement we are putting is progressing. But our objective is and remains to reach capacity which are post-expansion capacity.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Paul, I was wondering if you could comment on the recent trends in working capital. As best I can tell, the trade working capital was up more than $400 million in 2012, and it seems about half of that was attributable to inventory. I think you had commented you intentionally built some inventory to fuel the growth in Agriculture. It looks like the rate is perhaps running about double or higher, so perhaps you could comment a little bit on how much was organic versus acquisitions and finished goods, product lines and so forth to help us better understand what's going on in inventory.","Paul W. Graves","Sure. I think it's pretty straightforward. It's the Agricultural Products segment, at the end of the year, building inventory really across both Latin America and North America. I'm not quite sure it's quite double, as you describe. It is certainly ahead of what we expected when we gave guidance earlier, but it is all material to be sold into the markets that we see today. This is not speculative inventory building. This is, given our supply chain in that business, building inventory to meet demand.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Yes, sorry to be unclear about double -- it looked like it was up 44% year-over-year versus your Ag sales growth guidance in the high teens. And so I was wondering if it's elevated in other areas of the company as well, or just exclusively an intentional Ag build?","Paul W. Graves","It really is almost entirely an Ag build and it is intentional, so which is again, [indiscernible] this is not -- you shouldn't read into this that this is anything other than what we think is the right decision for the Ag business.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. And then also related to cash flow, Paul, would you comment on pension contributions in 2012 and what the outlook might be for 2013 in that regard?","Paul W. Graves","Sure. Like I said, the pension contributions, the environment, as you know, is a tough one for pension contributions, and we continue to assess what is the right place to be. We would expect the pressures on pensions, given where interest rates are and given some of the rules around pension contributions, to continue in 2013 and hopefully ease beyond that. But we would expect similar sort of expectations as to what we're going to need to fund into the pension contributions sitting here today with operating markets and interest rates to be pretty similar in '13 as they were in '12.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then final question, if I may, for Ed on soda ash. Would you comment on what ANSAC is seeing with regard to soda ash export prices outside of Asia, specifically Latin America, and how you would expect those to trend in the first half of 2013?","Edward T. Flynn","Yes, Kevin. As prices dropped in Asia, we saw a little bit of pressure in Latin America in '12. And as you know, most of what we do down at Latin America is contracted. So we saw a little price pressure, but we should not see a lot of movement for the rest of 2013.","Operator","Your next question is from Sabina Chatterjee with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Frank Mitsch sitting in for Sabina. Ed, you commented that demand in soda ash in the U.S. was down in 2012. Can you talk about the areas specifically that it was down, and what your expectations are for 2013 there?","Edward T. Flynn","Sure, Frank. If you recall, in the beginning of '12, there were a lot of solar glass plant closures. I believe Nippon Sheet Glass closed a plant and I believe Asahi might have closed one as well. So domestic demand, when you look at the USGS stats for the first half of 2012, was down somewhere in the neighborhood of about 8%. In the second half, we saw some increase in demand, but it was not enough to overtake the poor demand in the first half of the year. Now where the increase is coming, and we see them continuing in 2013, but auto glass is up and you see, when you look at the statistics, autos are up year-over-year. Housing is up, and we're also looking at the Architectural Billings Index has given us a positive sign that we do think we'll see some flat glass growth. And in addition, we're seeing -- we just saw that Asahi announced that they are going to restart a float line that they had idled in Tennessee. So the signs are positive for domestic growth.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. So low-single-digit increase in '12 -- I'm sorry in '13 versus '12?","Edward T. Flynn","That's correct.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. And you guys have commented that you're expecting CapEx to be $350 million in 2013, which is materially above the $225 million last year. Can you remind us about the specific projects and timing of those projects, when we might see some of the new capacity start up, et cetera?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I think, Frank, I would say the 2 biggest category for us in terms of capital investments, first is the MCC plant which we are building in Thailand. This plant will be starting up in 2014. So we will start to see sales from that plant in 2014. And the other big demand for growth capital is in the Ag business. That is capital money, which will be used to increase our capacity in place like Latin America, but also capital money used to increase capacity at all of our total manufacturing in Asia. So those 2 are a very big chunk of the growth capacity. And we usually have a maintenance capacity, which is around depreciation, which is about $130 million.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. And the benefits of that expansion in Latin America in Ag should be later this year?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Later this year, yes.","Operator","Your next question is from Peter Butler from Glen Hill Investments.","Peter Butler","In the past, you've -- and in your press release, you talk about Manufacturing Excellence. And I think it was one of the previous conference calls where I think it was Mark Douglas was talking a $60 million program to reduce costs. That was several quarters ago, and subsequent to that, you've brought in a number of people to help you on manufacturing and supply chain expertise. And I'm wondering whether that $60 million number is a low number now with the new concepts and expertise or -- what is your assessment?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Okay. Thank you, Peter. I mean, let me divide that in 2 categories. First, there is the work which was done initially by Mark when he joined the company, which was mostly focused around procurement. That work is well on its way. We are passing the $60 million saving. We have an $80 million saving target for 2015, and today, we are looking at over $100 million saving from procurement. So this program is well in place, and we have restated the target will be above the $60 million this year and we're on our way to $100 million in a couple of years. The Manufacturing Excellence program is really following the pilot plant taking off this year. We are targeting 2 places initially. One is -- I remember for Manufacturing Excellence, we talked about 10% capacity increase and 5% manufacturing cost decrease. The first 2 area we are targeting, our soda ash plant in Wyoming and our manufacturing site in North Carolina for lithium. When I talked about staffing reduction without losing manufacturing capacity, that's what we're implementing and for which we are taking the charge. And if you look at the performance of our soda ash and Industrial Chemicals business, despite the pricing situation, we're going to have a strong year this year. So it is because we're capable of moving more volumes through manufacturing soon at lower cost versus what we did before. So the program is well in place and it's going to be a process by which we're going to be rotating. So focus on Lithium and our Alkali business this year, and we'll decide what is the next series of plant which will be seeing Manufacturing Excellence program.","Peter Butler","Okay. Pierre, you were -- in your press release, you were talking about having a careful, prudent approach, and you mentioned 3 major variables, the soda ash, the Lithium operations and what Ag might actually do in the second half. I'm wondering -- normally, I think of FMC with very, very conservative estimates and assumptions. And I'm wondering with the problems that you've had more recently, I'm wondering if those assumptions have gotten even more conservative, then how much room do you have for significantly doing better on those variables?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Well, Peter, I think we are prudent and we are prudent because there is things we truly don't know yet. Clearly, if the soda ash pricing ramps up faster than what we are seeing today, and it's not impossible the Chinese industry is strengthening, we are very convinced that we're going to see a turnaround of pricing. Now it is very hard to know. If you ask me if I feel very good about soda ash pricing in the next 4 or 5 quarters, I would say yes. How it is going to unfold in the next 2 quarters is more of a question, because plus or minus a quarter, as you know, will make a difference on the year. So this one, we do not know. Could it be stronger? Absolutely, it could be stronger. Lithium, we finally believe we do have some fix for the issues and we finally understood exactly what was the problem. We had to put lots of resource, including external resource. Could we see a better result in terms of production from our step 1 and then step 2 changes? We could. This one, I would be careful because it's really a process technology, and we want to do that not to make the same mistake we made last year to try to rush the plant back to production. Ag is an incredible business. I'm starting to get used to those numbers, but it still amazes me how fast we can grow and how many surprise we have. And it's not by luck. We have an incredible, incredible product line coming up. And when you look at how much we are growing in places where there is resistance to other product, it is not by luck. It's been studied, it's been developed and the pipeline is rich. So if you have a season in Latin America, which grew a little bit our way from a weather standpoint, with the product we have and the structure we have, could be it stronger than we have in the fourth quarter? Absolutely. We don't know. It's hard for us to predict that. So when I look, the only place where I want to be careful because this time, we're going to go step-by-step, is in Lithium. We want this plant to be viable for the long run. We are not going to make the same mistake we made last year, to rush through the year, the turnaround. The other 2, could we have a positive surprise in Ag and could we have a positive surprise in soda ash? Absolutely. Do we know it if it's the case? I cannot say today. We know we hope at the next call, it will be much closer to tell you what will be happening, especially around soda ash.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Neal Sangani on for Brian. Just a couple of questions on Lithium. One of your competitors mentioned that they're expecting some flattening in carbonate and hydroxide prices with some of the capacity ramp-ups globally. What outlook on prices do you have for your guidance there and also on some of the more downstream Lithium products?","Pierre R. Brondeau","We cannot be blamed for the capacity increase those days, so I'm going to let Michael talk about pricing.","D. Michael Wilson","Neal, this is Michael Wilson. And I think with regard to pricing, we still can see pricing moving upward in Lithium overall. But you're probably talking about across the industry, prices moving up mid-single digits, which would be a bit slower pace than we certainly saw in 2012.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the product side, you mentioned at the Investor Day, converting more of the upstream products to more high-value downstream products. How much of that product portfolio shift is going to occur in 2013, and what's going to be the earnings impact?","D. Michael Wilson","Well, we are focused that we've talked about over the last couple of years of really strategically placing our volume into the higher-value, higher-growth segments. So for us, that's the energy markets, particularly for secondary batteries, and then also in the polymer and synthesis market, so the organolithium. So we will continue that focus. I don't know that, that focus is going to be substantially different in '13 than it was in '12, so I don't see a big shift driving a different result.","Operator","And your next question is from Andy Cash with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just to stick with the Lithium theme here. I think you guys were talking about something toward a 30% growth in lithium battery demand in the transportation market and somewhere around 10% overall. Given the restructuring talk this morning, on that space, and also, we see Dow Chemical and its slide down of Dow Kokam, its lithium battery joint venture. So there's some restructuring downstream. I'm just curious if you have a new overall growth number for lithium in transportation and just an overall number.","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, this is Michael again. In terms of growth expectations for Lithium, again, as we look at the period between now and 2020 for the industry overall, we still see a compound annual growth rate of roughly 10%, slightly lower in the period between now and 2015, and then accelerating after that. We had reevaluated our growth expectations for the transportation industry in 2012, and had talked about roughly a 4% penetration of EV vehicles really of all types, EVs, HEVs, PHEVs in the transportation sector by 2020. We still believe that, that number is roughly the case. That makes us probably a bit more conservative than a lot of other folks. But overall, even at that rate, the transportation segment then would be projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of about 33% between now and 2020. So the number you have is approximate to where we are.","Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a question on Ag. Could you give us a rough idea of how much new product introductions in 2012 helped your overall sales, and what are your expectations for 2013?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, we -- on new product introductions, we tend to look at it longer term given the way the products flow, but it is significant. We have roughly, today, as our portfolio of products that are introduced over the last 5 years, roughly 25% of our total new products impact that revenue. That should increase towards 30% in terms of 2015 number. So you can see we're ramping up our products as we look at Latin America, North America and Asia.","Operator","Your next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess first question. Looking out the next few years, do you expect CapEx to stay roughly at 2013's target? And I guess, is the elevated CapEx expected to accelerate your top line growth from current levels, or is it necessary to sustain the current growth rates you're seeing?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, I think, we are looking at a current CapEx in the $350 million for the next 3, 4 years. And yes, we do expect -- our top line has been growing somewhere between 10% and 15% over the last 3, 4 years, and that's the kind of top line growth we are expecting to be at throughout the next 3, 4 years. The capital spending we are currently undertaking is here to sustain the type of growth we have been facing. If you look, for example, the BioPolymer business has been highly limited in its growth rate in MCC because of a lack of capacity. That's why all of the capital spending, the demand is very strong. So if we want to keep on growing that product line, which is growing in the 20% range, we need new capacity.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up on that point. Of the growth CapEx portion, roughly what do you expect the ROIC or IRR to be going forward?","Pierre R. Brondeau","If you look, overall, as a company, most of the capital spending we are looking into has a return above 18%. The company this year had a return as a whole of 22%, and we do expect to stay in this high numbers between now and the next 2, 3 years.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just on the Lithium operations, is the potash production up and running now?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No, we -- Mike, we decided to stop the potash project. We believe the current conditions for potash, where we are in our project in Argentina, and some possibilities we will have to reuse ponds and equipment for lithium facility, and the focus we want to have on our Lithium operation, it made sense for us to stop the potash project and not continue. So today, as we stand today, we are not planning any longer to develop a business in -- a potash business to complement our Lithium business.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And then looking at the other side of Specialty, as we think about the new BioPolymer capacity that's coming onstream during the year, how should we think about the pattern of revenue ramp? Is it going to be lumpy or maybe more steady? And then probably on the margin side, are there a lot of costs that could lead to some margin lumpiness as that capacity comes onstream or should margins also be fairly steady?","Pierre R. Brondeau","So what we are looking, I mean, if you look the BioPolymer business, it's a very key business for us. We've done a lot in terms of increasing capacity. Remember, we increased capacity in Europe, in the U.S., building a plant in Asia. We made multiple acquisitions, 2 in natural colors, 1 in pectin. This is going to start to really pay off and show a growth rate for this business which will be healthy. We believe it's a business which can sustain a high-single-digit top line growth, and we believe that it's a business where we will see a stable to improving margin. So right now, I believe 2013 and going forward should start to demonstrate our ability to bring even faster, this business, which has been doing well, and leveraging that in significant earnings growth.","Operator","And, Mr. Brondeau, I'll turn the call back to you for closing remarks.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you very much. And FMC delivered another solid year in 2012 with sales up 11% and operating profit up 16%. Return on invested capital remains very high at 22.9%. We generated a total shareholder return of 37% for 2012 as the market rewarded the steady earnings growth and clear strategy. For 2013, as we said before, we're taking a careful, prudent approach in reviewing the company's potential performance, recognizing that several variables could impact our results, the timing of recovery in soda ash export pricing, the speed at which we continue to improve the performance of our Lithium business and just how strong the Latin America Ag markets will be in the latter portion of the year. That said, I am very confident in our ability to deliver another record year of performance in 2013, and that we are firmly on track to meet or exceed all of our Vision 2015 targets as we described to you in detail at our December Investor Day. I would like to thank you very much for joining us. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the FMC Corp. Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call.

Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Pierre will review FMC's first quarter performance and provide the outlook for 2018 and the second quarter. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and our 2018 outlook statement, are available on our website; and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will then join to address questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors including, but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter this year, Ag Solutions benefited from higher revenue synergies and lower operating costs. Both of these factors will continue to deliver stronger earnings in the rest of 2018. The rapid progress we have made on integration is creating a very strong platform for 2018 and beyond. And the early traction we're seeing on revenue synergies will enhance 2018 performance and accelerate in the years to come. We will talk about these areas in more detail today.","In addition, while we do not believe the crop protection market outlook has changed from three months ago, we see significant pockets of opportunity that are a very good fit for FMC's portfolio. For example, the late planting season in the U.S. has the potential to lead to greater shift to soybean from corn, which could be a large benefit for FMC, given our Authority's pre-emergent herbicide.","The fear of Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybean import is leading to South American growers looking to expand soybean acreage. So again, a shift that will benefit FMC. Higher replanting of sugarcane in Brazil plus expanded acreage in cotton due to higher cotton prices, will create greater demand for FMC product in these markets, where we are particularly strong. Asian rice growing conditions are very favorable and we are seeing very rapid growth in demand for the acquired insecticides as a result.","Overall, market-driven opportunities in the next two or three quarters are perhaps the best FMC as seen in multiple years. The critical component of the growth strategy of the business is new product registration and label expansions. We have over 200 of them coming for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls over the next four years. Beyond the immediate future, FMC has a very strong technology pipeline. We launched our first new active ingredient from FMC R&D pipeline, Bixafen, in North America later this year and we'll launch new fungicides and insecticides in multiple regions in 2020 and 2021.","What you will hear today is that FMC has started the year very strong, due largely to a very successful initial integration of the acquired portfolio that FMC is operating in market conditions over the rest of the year that are very good fit with its strength, leading to above-average growth for the rest of the year. And FMC's growth potential beyond 2018 is extremely high, driven by revenue synergies, technology launches and wider and deeper market penetration of the combined portfolio.","The Lithium business also continues to perform strongly, as demand for different performance products remains very high. We are on track to release the Lithium business targeting an October 2018 IPO, which will be followed by a direct spin to FMC shareholders within six months.","Turning to slide 3. FMC reported first quarter revenue of just over $1.2 billion, which was double the revenue from Q1 2017. Adjusted EPS was $1.84 in the quarter, more than 4 times the EPS from the same period a year ago and $0.32 above the mid-point over original guidance range. Ag Solutions EBITDA was $51 million above the mid-point of our guidance range. The outperformance relative to our guidance was mainly due to strong revenue growth and lower operating costs in our Ag Solutions business. In Lithium, the strong year-over-year performance was due to more favorable customer mix and higher pricing combined with higher volumes and good operating performance.","Moving on to slide 4, and Ag Solutions. Revenue of $1.1 billion in the quarter more than doubled year-over-year on the reported basis and increased 13% on a pro forma basis. Following the close of our acquisition, we gave high priority to training the two sales organizations on all products which has allowed us to quickly capitalize on cross-selling opportunities. Our global sales force delivered an impressive performance in its first full quarter with the combined portfolio.","First quarter segment EBITDA of $356 million increased 250% year-over-year and were $51 million above the mid-point of our guidance. Segment EBITDA margin was over 32%, 270 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance. Higher revenue contributed about two-third of the earnings beat in the quarter and lower cost contributed the final third. We have been able to leverage FMC's existing sales and back-office infrastructure to limit the number of new position added. We also incurred lower operating cost as a result of savings across procurement and plant services.","On slide 5, you see we delivered double-digit Q1 revenue growth on a pro forma basis in every region. North America revenue increased 16%, Latin-America revenue grew 15%, Asia revenue increased 13% and Europe revenue grew 11%. There were several broad themes that drove revenue synergies, which led to the strength in the quarter.","Turning to slide 6. These are some examples that highlight synergy opportunities we are seeing all around the world. Extended market access is the simplest way to look at where the synergies are coming from, and this is driven by two things. Cross-selling to customers that didn't have access to the product before and leveraging the extended portfolio to address more of the available market. Brazil is a good example of this, which we show on the left side of the slide.","You can see that 975 of the customers previously served by FMC were also served by DuPont. But nearly 700 customers, over 40% of the total, only had access to either FMC or DuPont products. Let me remind you that the product portfolio that we acquired has very little overlap with their existing portfolio. So every customer that didn't have access to one or the other's product is a cross-selling opportunity for us.","The second part of expanding our addressable market is through a broader portfolio of product. This is not totally distinct from the cross-selling, but it is another way to look at it. We believe that our new portfolio of products, our addressable market in Brazil has increased from 53% to 62%. This equates to an additional $1 billion in a $10 billion market. When you look at the different channels to market in Brazil, dealers are an important piece and we believe we now have access to about two-thirds of all dealers across the country compared to 50% before the acquisition.","We now sell to nearly all the crops in the south and these crops provide significant access to growers of niche crops. We support the growth of the acquired portfolio. But Brazil is not the only country where we believe our addressable market has expanded. In China, agricultural practices and policies are changing. The entire crop protection market is evolving toward higher technology product and growers are aligning with suppliers they see as technology providers.","We have an example. We're one of the largest ag chem distributors in China, is expected to triple its purchases of FMC product in 2018 due to our expanded portfolio and pipeline of new products underway. We believe this is evidence of a customer that is perceiving FMC differently. Beyond the quality of the products, this customer truly values our service and business model. In addition, they now see us as a technology provider, one with which they want to be a closer, longer-term relationship.","In Europe, our extended commercial organization has much broader and deeper access into all parts of the region. In Italy, for example, we have doubled the total of customer base. And with more retail outlets, we have more shelf space and expanded access. The acquired business had better market access than FMC in Eastern Europe. In Romania, for example, we increased the number of distributors we sell to by 5 times and quadruple our sales of legacy FMC product in Q1. We are seeing opportunities in multiple countries in Europe, and together, we expect they will deliver significant growth in the future.","In India, our new super distributors give us a much better access to the overall market as well as the ability to sell FMC's herbicide portfolio into new segments such as sugarcane. Another opportunity for further sales synergy is in crops, where either FMC or the acquired business had a very strong market position and we can now aggressively sell a broader portfolio to the specific groups of farmers. For example, we can sell the acquired insecticide to our long-time sugarcane and cotton customers in Brazil. And we can sell FMC legacy herbicide to the super distributors in India. We're also seeing opportunities in specialty crops in Eastern Europe as well as rice, fruits and vegetables in Asia.","Moving now to Lithium on slide 7. Lithium delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 57% compared to Q1 last year and segment EBITDA of $50 million, almost double that from a year ago. The business continues to benefit from a favorable environment with demand growth continuing to outpace supply growth for key battery-grade lithium product. Prices continued to climb with realized hydroxide and carbonate prices around 30% higher than Q1 2017, n-Butyllithium prices also up 8%.","Volumes were also higher in all areas, as debottlenecking in Argentina, new hydroxide campus in China and higher demand in Butylli, all contributed to the year-over-year growth. Our EBITDA margin was 49% in the quarter, as these factors combined with a better than normal customer mix, all drove stronger financial performance. Our product mix continues to migrate towards performance products with basic carbonate and chloride accounting for only 10% of revenue in the quarter.","We continue to see very strong demand. Customers are increasingly seeking long-term supply commitments, demonstrating that they're expecting a very tight market for lithium hydroxide for several years to come. The performance of hydroxide puts FMC on a very short list of companies that can provide the necessary grade of product for high-end EV battery applications.","We took an important step in March when we announced Paul Graves will become the CEO of the new lithium company and Gilberto Antoniazzi will become its new CFO. As you know, Paul has been FMC's CFO since he joined the company in 2012, while Gilberto has been CFO for Ag Solutions segment the past four years, and has been with FMC since 1993. We would like to thank Paul and Gilberto for the exceptional work they have done for FMC.","Turning to slide 8, which summarizes our outlook for the full year and for the second quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share for full year 2018 to be between $5.90 and $6.20 per share. At the mid-point of the range, this represents an increase of 12% from our February guidance. Second quarter 2018 adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.65 and $1.75. We expect 2018 Ag Solutions revenue will be in the range of $4.05 billion and $4.25 billion, an increase of 2.5% at the mid-point compared to our February guidance.","On a pro forma basis, this equates to a 7% to 8% year-over-year increase. We also expect Ag Solutions EBITDA will be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.24 billion, up 9% or $100 million compared to the mid-point of our prior guidance. This increase is being driven by both high revenue and lower cost, with about half of the impact coming from each. Second quarter segment revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.16 billion, which represents a year-over-year increase of 6% at the mid-point on a pro forma basis. Segment EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $315 million to $345 million in Q2.","Our guidance implies nearly 60% of 2018 Ag Solutions EBITDA will appear in the first half of the year. This is a reversal of the ratio in previous years when 40% of the segment earnings were generated in the first half. The shift is driven by the acquired business, which is more heavily weighted to the first half. We are also raising estimates for Lithium business, reflecting a strong Q1 performance. We now expect full year revenue for Lithium to be in the range of $430 million to $460 million, a year-over-year increase of 28% at the mid-point.","Full year EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $193 million to $203 million, which represents an increase at the mid-point of 40% year-over-year and $8 million versus our February guidance. We expect price mix and incremental volume to each contribute approximately half of the year-over-year increasing earnings. The volume increase is largely due to the 4,000 tonnes of incremental capacity coming online from debottlenecking projects. We expect second quarter segment revenue to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million, a year-over-year increase of 55% at the mid-point. EBITDA is forecasted to be between $47 million and $51 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of 77% at the mid-point.","Moving now to slide 9, and the key drivers for Ag Solutions business in 2018 and beyond. Our expectations for the overall market remain unchanged from what we said in February 00:21:59. We continue to expect the global crop protection chemical market on a U.S. dollar basis to be flat to up low-single digits in 2018. However, we expect Ag Solutions revenue will grow 7% to 8% on a pro forma basis, which is up from the 5% growth forecast we presented in February. This includes the impact of revenue synergies which were not in prior forecast.","The growth factors, we said in our February call, still holds true, and they are driving most of the growth in 2018. It is the sales synergies from a larger addressable market that we saw in Q1 that are accelerating our growth forecast. The most important driver we mentioned three months ago was the strength of the acquired insecticide. As we said earlier, we believe Cyazypyr insect control, it's far from its peak in annual sales. Volumes are expected to grow because of expanded sales into cotton and soybean in Brazil and because of new product registration in EMEA, as well as fruits and vegetables in many Asian countries. Rynaxypyr insect control will continue to gain market share in the crops and geographies, such as rice and sugarcane in India, and further grow in Southeast Asia, China and Japan.","New products in the form of new active ingredients coming from FMC's legacy pipeline and new formulations of the acquired products, will be another leg of growth starting in 2019. Our first new active ingredient, the fungicide, Bixafen, will be introduced near the end of the year in North America. These growth factors will have no clear impact and we are only starting to see the benefits of the synergy opportunity. FMC will continue to outperform the global crop protection market for many years to come.","As I said earlier, the integration process is progressing very well. After six months of ownership, we are finding that the business requires lower spending than was forecasted by the acquired management team. We are seeing significant savings on the SG&A line, which I outlined earlier and lower cost in our manufacturing facilities. We expect these cost savings will continue through the rest of 2018 and beyond, helping to drive EBITDA margin of approximately 29% at the mid-point of the full year 2018 guidance. As the DuPont transition service agreement roll off and as we implement a new SAP system at the end of 2019, we expect to realize further cost savings and another meaningful step-up in EBITDA margin in 2020.","In Lithium, the key drivers for 2018 and beyond are unchanged from what we showed you in February. FMC is very well positioned to take advantage of a unique strategy focused on high performance lithium hydroxide applications. We have demonstrated that our approach to expand our hydroxide capacity in line with market growth is capable of meeting accelerating demand, with relatively low capital needs. Our low cost production resource in Argentina provides us with the raw materials we need to make the downstream products highly cost competitive.","Prices in 2018 will be higher than in 2017 across all product categories. The majority of the 2018 forecast revenue falls under multi-year contracts that have defined pricing and we believe this trend will continue in 2019 and beyond. We expect that by the end of this year we will have 80% over 2020 lithium hydroxide capacity of 3,000 metric tonnes committed under long-term contract. To that end, our current expansion in both carbonate and lithium hydroxide are on track and progressing as expected.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Thanks, Pierre. Since this is my last time delivering this section of the earnings call, I will keep it as short as possible. Let me start with FX and its impact on FMC's consolidated results. The euro has had the largest impact on our results in Q1, with the RMB and the Argentine peso smaller factors. We estimate that around 3% to 4% of the year-over-year growth in FMC's pro forma revenue was due to currency tailwinds; meaning that underlying top line growth for FMC as a whole was around 12% to 13%. We estimate that the Q1 benefit to EBITDA compared to last year was around $10 million. We do not have sufficient data on last year's earnings from the DuPont portfolio to be more precise than this.","Looking at full year guidance, we are not expecting this FX tailwind to continue. We have far lower euro revenue in the latter half of the year, and forward rates do not suggest the same tailwind will occur. We always watch the Brazilian real carefully at this time of year. The forward rates for the real, which are the rates at which we protect our revenues and receivables, are in line with the assumptions underpinning the guidance we have provided. Our estimate of the impact of FX on our full year revenue guidance is unchanged from our previous guidance of 1% to 2% positive; meaning underlying revenue growth guidance of 7% to 8% across all of FMC.","Interest expense continues to tick a little higher as interest rates climb. However, the impact on our guidance is muted by our expectations of cash generation go into debt to pay down. Tax expense is in line with our estimates, but we continue to work through the interpretation of the new tax rules and we'll have more clarity on the overall impact on our tax rate and especially on our tax provisions by the end of the second quarter. Cash generation in Q1 was another bright spot. Q1 is historically a cash outflow quarter and the required build in receivables for the acquired portfolio was expected to make this pattern even more pronounced.","However, a very strong collection performance in Brazil with past dues falling by over $100 million compared to the same time last year, allowed us to largely offset this build and generate operating cash flow in our legacy Ag business that was stronger than prior years. We did not increase our cash flow guidance, despite the EBITDA we forecast and the strong first quarter. However, we have greater confidence that we will deliver cash flow at the high end of the guidance range and we will revisit our full year cash flow guidance in early August with our second quarter results.","We believe that 2018 will be an unusual year in terms of cash generation; and the ones with through the build in receivables, we will generate significantly more cash from operations. When we normalize for this receivables build and remove the non-recurring capital spending from our base, we expect that adjusted cash from operations less CapEx will be at least twice that of 2018, assuming constant EBITDA.","A final comment on the Lithium separation. We remain on track to IPO of the business in October of this year. We will be looking to file with the SEC this summer and we'll have a clearer view of the timing when we get our first set of comments back. It is important to be aware that as we get closer to the filing, our lawyers have advised us that we will be expected to reduce the commentary we provide on the Lithium business during earnings calls and investor meetings as required by securities laws.","You should therefore expect that this is the last quarter that we will give extensive comments or undertake substantial Q&A on the Lithium business, before we enter what will be effectively an extended quiet period on the business.","With that, I will pass the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Paul. We feel very good about where FMC is today. Our Ag Solutions business delivered an exceptionally strong Q1 and we're set to deliver an outstanding 2018, with revenue growth significantly above the market growth rate. This channel growth above market will carry on for the foreseeable future.","The integration of the acquired business is progressing very well. Gross synergies are being realized and our costs will be lower than we were expecting a few months ago. Lithium had another strong quarter to start the year and is on track to deliver another exceptional year in 2018.","With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you for your attention.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question will come from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. You guys continue to buck the sluggishness trend in ag chemicals pretty well in most geographies, which many attributed to your earlier actions on inventories, years ago leading to better flow through. But it now appears you're expanding your addressable markets, enhancing distribution and have a pretty solid pipeline of new products. As the competitive environment is still fairly fierce, what do you, Mark, have up your sleeves left to further assess the opportunities to outperform the market? Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Chris. I think the way we're looking at the situation \u2013 as we said, first of all, I think we have a pretty clean base of operation. We do have a situation from an inventory of FMC products, including the acquired business which is healthy and which is close, if not normal, so allowing us to operate under normal conditions.","I think to this, as we said in the previous half hour, there is multiple drivers which are going to play out over the years to come. I think it is very clear that, and it's even better than what we were expecting, on the customer front there was way less overlap than we were expecting. There is many customers which were only solely served by FMC and some solely served by DuPont, creating an incredible cross-selling opportunity.","We are seeing, as we were expecting, a capability to reach more crops and more markets or distribution over the years. And then we have, above all of this, the quality of the portfolio we have brought to market where we keep on expanding registrations. So you put all of that together.=, it is giving us a picture of growth potential not on the quarter, not only this year, but when you create multi-billion dollar growth opportunity, those are multi-year growth opportunities we are facing. Mark, do you want to add any comment to that question?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Chris, I think Pierre hit on the main points. For me it's a two-way factor really. It's the market access and the portfolio that we have and that we have coming. We talk about the growth we've had this year in all the regions in Q1 and it's come from different places. I think of North America as an example, which is, let's make no mistake, it's a tough market right now. We know it's delayed.","But our Authority franchise for pre-emergent herbicides, we launched a new product, Authority Supreme. It's a different combination. It's there to address growers' needs that have extremely tough weed resistance issues. It's taken off very well in its first quarter of sales and Q2 is also looking strong. So that's kind of the example that we're looking at in terms of bringing new technologies to address growers' needs.","And that's not just with the acquired portfolio, it's with the legacy FMC portfolio. But more importantly, longer term is the technology pipeline that's coming and I'm very excited about the opportunities we have to address those growers' needs both from an insecticide, herbicide and fungicide needs. So for us, it feels very good where we are today.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question will come from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning and congrats on a nice start to the year. And Paul, congrats on becoming the CEO of the Lithium business.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thanks, Frank.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And given your commentary, Paul, perhaps this is a great opportunity to ask just a couple questions on Lithium. Pierre mentioned that by the end of the year you're going to have 80% of your 2020 volumes under contract. How should we be thinking about those contract terms in terms of flexing with the underlying lithium carbonate costs? And I guess more broadly, there's been a lot of discussion about new supply of lithium carbonate. What are your general thoughts there on what we can expect how that plays out?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Sure. Look, I think the first point I would make is that the hydroxide market is distinct and different from the carbonate market. They have very different supply and demand dynamics. There is a very different supplier landscape and there is a very different requirement on the part of the purchaser of that product in terms of performance of the product. So, it's difficult to draw direct parallels to carbonate, because frankly it really isn't a conversation with the customers. The carbonate market, as I say, it really is truly a distinct and different market than the hydroxide market.","An analogy I draw, although a different product, it's no different to our Butylli business, which is also clearly a Lithium business, but again, is sold under very different market structure, very different customer requirements. And so, you see very different contracting expectations.","Customers are far more focused on security of supply of hydroxide than they are on certainty of price, while price is always important. The conversations and the contracts are far more focused on security of supply, especially as the demand pattern for hydroxide in the coming years is significantly great to grow than it is for any other product. It really reflects the move of our customers towards different cathode technologies, which require hydroxide. And they all recognize that this is not a straightforward product to manufacture; it's not a straightforward product to source on their part. And it's a key question in their own supply chain that they have to answer to their customers is, do you have the security of supply of all of the required metals for your product. So they are the dynamics that are at play, and that's what's driving the contract terms. It's what's driving customer behavior, and it's what's driving frankly the degree of confidence we have in our business today.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Chris Evans on for Bob. I took note of the, in your guide for Ag EBITDA, you've got an implied margin that's below the 1Q level for the second quarter and for the full year. So I thought maybe that would be a good opportunity to talk about the seasonality of the business, maybe the costs and how they flow through, and just maybe why you guys are expecting the second quarter profitability to be below the first.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. What is happening, and if you think about the way the business is now distributed. The first reason for which you have a Q1 and then Q2 for that matter, and overall the first half had a higher EBITDA margin, it is because there is a higher percentage in our business mix of the acquired portfolio, which itself carries a higher margin than the FMC legacy portfolio. So that's one of the drivers to have a first half and mostly a first quarter higher EBITDA margin.","The second reason is that, the beginning of the year is a much stronger business in North America and Europe, which also are regions which are carrying higher margins. So, those are the reasons. There is nothing else to it than the percentage of new business versus legacy FMC business and the regional distribution in the first half versus second half.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Yes. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. You commented earlier about having really strong growth in Ag and being able to cross-sell, and I wanted to dive into that. How much of these products had the existing necessary registrations, and there just wasn't a historical relationship with the distributors? And how do you think about the longer-term outlook to expand product registrations in different crops and regions? Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. This is Mark. So I think, clearly, when we look at distribution, I think Pierre mentioned a number of statistics and it's on the slide there, you can see that we have a much broader market access in many of the major Ag countries and growing regions. That's a key development for us, because to be able to walk into a major co-op or distributor or retailer and have a broader portfolio, is very advantageous, it's something we've been looking for for a while, and this acquisition really brings that to life.","I would say the second piece that you're mentioning is registrations, and it's an important part of the Ag space. I think everybody knows, without the registrations, you can't sell. If you think about Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr as two active ingredients, we have today over 200 new registrations and label extensions around the world. They'll be coming through in the next 48 months; that is all new potential for us. It is new countries, it is new crops. And I have numerous examples where we're looking at niche crops in smaller countries that we don't participate in today.","Now, that is what is already rolling through the process, and I think a lot of people know it can take anywhere from three to five years depending on which country you're in for registration. We ourselves, after six months of ownership of this business, have some very novel ideas of how we intend to use Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr in the future. We have a whole suite of new active ingredients coming through our pipeline that will actually go very well with these products. So we have a mixture strategy that we will be executing over the coming years that will further enhance that growth into different crops with different pest spectrums.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question is from Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. So we're hearing from some of your competitors that there might be some inflation coming out of China on the active ingredient front. And I was just wondering can you comment what you're seeing and how you think that could have an impact on part of the pricing environment as the year progresses? Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. Thank you. Yes, there is, today, there is issues of restriction of manufacturing for some of our raw material, or I say some of our or some of the industry raw material suppliers and active ingredient suppliers. We have limitation in manufacturing because of an environmental issue. It is a problem the industry is facing, it is a problem we are facing and we are dealing with. In some places, it's creating tight supply; and in some other places, it's creating pressure on cost of raw material. It's all factored in the guidance we have going forward. So it's there, it is not really a dramatic impact and all accounted for, but something which is real and we're dealing with on a daily basis.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi, good morning. Could you maybe speak to, as much as you can, about what the two balance sheets might look like of the two companies once post-split? And what your plans are for the proceeds from the IPO effects?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Sure. I know it's pretty straightforward I think. Look, our view on the Lithium business given its investment needs is that it will be separated with a very clean balance sheet. There's not a lot of logic to piling it up with some structural challenges even if we wanted to on a tax basis, et cetera. But frankly, the right decision for the business is to let it go public with the ability to finance its investment plans in the future without stressing the balance sheet. The proceeds will, frankly \u2013 and they won't be used for debt pay down. So we will raise proceeds in the IPO and we will attempt to raise enough proceeds to make the transaction leverage neutral for FMC as a whole, which will allow us to keep our net leverage at about 2.5 times EBITDA after the IPO.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good morning.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Was wondering if you can just address the margin performance in the Lithium business. What things went right for you, and can you talk about what happens in the rest of the year that would lead the margin to be a little bit lower than the Q1 level?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Sure. The punch line is pretty straightforward and I think we've mentioned this before. On a full year basis, we expect the margin to be largely where we said it was at the start of the year, in the low-to-mid 40% range. We do have in this industry different customers and different prices and with different margins, depending on who they are, how long their contracts been in place, or ultimately what kind of product they're taking.","And so, we will see and we'll always see likely on a quarter-to-quarter basis, customer mix impacting the reported margin. There's no fundamental change. We have full year plans as to when we ship to which customers. This is not a shock to us, which is why it came in largely where we guided, and it's nothing more than a simple customer mix issue or effect, should I say.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice start to the year.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thanks, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Pierre, I think you mentioned that you felt prices for lithium will be higher in 2018 versus 2017 across all product categories, and you expect prices to be up in 2019 and through the end of the decade. Is that largely because of your contracts? And can you maybe just give us some color; in the last presentation you had a really nice supply outlook. Exactly what you think, on an LCE basis, demand will be in 2019 and 2020, and what you think industry supply will be in those two years? Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I think Mike, it's always a difficult topic to address like that because it looks like there is the rules and there is the bears and there is the believers, and there is non-believers. So we build a model from two things; demand from our customers and what are their plans, as well as the contract we have and the prices we have in those contracts which are multi-year contracts. Then we apply our knowledge around manufacturing and how much the capacity \u2013 the actual real capacity with usable product will hit the market.","When we bring these together and our customers view it the same way, if not, you know the automotive industry, they are not known to overpaid for any products. Everybody looking at the real capacity potential which will be in place and the demand. You have a situation where every numbers point to a very tight supply\/demand situation on the lithium hydroxide front and also on the lithium carbonate. And that is creating a set of contracts with our customers, which have price escalation every year. So, between our understanding of the market, supply\/demand and the actual contract we have and some certainty around price increase every year, we are pretty sure that we're going to see price going up next year and the year after.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I just want to go back and understand what you meant when you said your costs were lower than expected in the Ag businesses. Was it just from faster, so the rationalization of head count or manufacturing efficiencies and maybe putting some of your products into the existing plans? Kind of can you provide a little bit more detail around the \u2013 I understand the sales synergies, but I'm just looking at the cost \u2013 our cost outs which seems to be happening a little bit faster.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah, Dmitry. So go back to November 1st, we closed on the business and at that time we do have two distinct business; the FMC legacy and the DuPont legacy, each of them having a budget. The DuPont legacy business, which is coming to us from DuPont, is an extract of their ag chemical business. And this business is coming to us with need for resources to run the back-office and to run the sales and technical organizations. And we knew it; there was no surprise there.","The management team of DuPont had analyzed where they would believe we would need to add costs by adding resources, to be able to run the front-end and the back-office of the company. That's what we put into the budget. After operating the business now for five months, we realized that, I would say, into the beginning to me the first quarter, there is different way to operate. First of all, we are finding ways to leverage the FMC and DuPont sales, marketing and the field engineer organization across different regions without having systematically to add resources.","We were also able to leverage much more the structure we have at FMC or back-office, to run the DuPont part of the business. So all of these led to a much lower SG&A cost that was expected by the management team with the previous business, and for that matter for \u2013 to some extent, from us. On the plant operations, we are looking at opportunities and it's not big change on the way we operate the plant, but lots of small contracts you have in plant services where we are able to do things a little bit differently, which are bringing savings at the level of gross margin. So all-in-all, it's just a matter of finding ways to operate the business by leveraging much more the existing FMC infrastructure rather than adding resources to operate the DuPont business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Pierre, you just mentioned certainty in lithium price increases for some years. Is this you're referring to your belief or is this part of the contract structure that you have with your customers?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","It's definitely in the contract with customers. I mean, there is a yearly annual price escalation in the contract with customers. There is a formula base which guide if the price should go up or down, with a bias to price increase in the contract. So, that is the main driver of a certainty. But as important for us is maybe the way we look at the real capacity, which will be hitting the \u2013 not capacity, supply, which will be hitting the market versus the demand our customers are contemplating.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good morning.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","So if I had sort of one takeaway from this call this morning, it would be probably the previously underappreciated top line synergies story associated with the DuPont transaction. And so, sort of a follow up on the opportunities you're seeing there. Clearly, the Rynaxypyr is a story with broad expansion of registrations and uptake for that product. But can you just talk about the registrations in other areas? And over what timeframe do you see the development of those, the expansion in the addressable market opportunity that you referenced?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I'm going to ask Mark to go into more detail around registration label, label expansion, and maybe give some example as occur. But before he does that, I would like to say, Rynaxypyr is one of the critical elements for growth. But it is also Cyazypyr which is important molecule, it is also, and we should not forget that the complementarity of the two portfolios, remember, there is very little overlap.","So we leverage the relationship of the DuPont business with some customers to sell more of the FMC product and vice versa. So it's a very broad base. I would dare to say, it's a multi-billion dollars broad-based growth opportunity we see, which will be accelerating even beyond what we see today in 2019 and 2020. And Mark, maybe you can talk a bit more about label and registration for Rynaxypyr and even others?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No. Sure. I mean, we all focus on Rynaxypyr because obviously it's the largest molecule. But we've said many times that we believe Cyazypyr is far from its peak in sales. And indeed, it's a later product. It was launched later, its patent estate runs much longer than Rynaxypyr. If you think about registrations and label extensions, we have pretty much approximately 50 coming this year, 50 coming in 2019 and going all the way through 2022, we have approximately 130 to 150. So we know that this year and next year, we are going to expand the opportunity for Cyazypyr considerably. Our sales force is ready for it. We have plans to exploit and aggressively grow Cyazypyr.","So you can see why we feel that Cyazypyr has a strong growth trajectory ahead of it, certainly through the next four to five years. And it's those label expansions and brand new registrations that really drive all of that. I do also want to say though that we have the new portfolio coming. Those products are starting to hit in 2019. We're well advanced for 2020 and 2021 with new products from our existing legacy FMC portfolio. That also adds to those billions of dollars of market opportunity that Pierre is talking about. So, it's multifaceted. It's not based around one product or one technology.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Mark Connelly from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you. As you talk about all these new opportunities, I'm wondering whether your view on R&D is changing. You had talked earlier about finding some savings in R&D, but it almost sounds like maybe you need to be expanding R&D with the strength you've got in the pipe and these market opportunities?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think if we are giving the impression at any point that we're looking for savings in R&D, I think it's we gave the wrong impression. There is no intent to realize cost savings in R&D. If anything, we're investing more. And it was part of our contract with the European Commission to make sure that we would protect DuPont and FMC R&D investments once we did the acquisition. The European Commission was very strong about creating a fifth large technology-based company and their requirement was for us not to create cost synergies in R&D. So, I know pretty much what we had in FMC and what we had in DuPont is what we'll be adding up this year plus the no more R&D increase you'll see on a yearly basis.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on Ag and, one, then Ag and one on Lithium, if I may. So in Ag, looking at the second half, looks like it implies a little bit lower result than what I was expecting. And I guess I was just wondering if that's due to greater strength in the northern hemisphere in the first half.","And then secondly in lithium, do you still feel confident on hydroxide prices longer term? We've seen some recent pressure on carbonate in China, but I would imagine that that's not as relevant for you guys. So, just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think H2 performance for the Ag business is very much in line, but, even above. I mean, you look at a growth rate overall for the year, 7% to 8%, is above what we've been indicating in any previous conversation or call. So we are feeling very strong about our second half business, driven of course as always by Latin America, specifically in the fourth quarter.","Now, as we said before, the H2 will be more based on legacy FMC business which means lower gross margin and also it is based on regions like Latin America, where margins are lower than North America or Europe. So de facto you're going to see a business with a lower EBITDA margin. That's why we like to talk about across the year our target this year is a 29% EBITDA margin, but above 30% in the first half and below 30% in the second half. Paul, do you want to? I think I talked about the hydroxide, but maybe Paul, you want to reiterate differently what I say?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","I'll just repeat what Pierre said. We have both, for this year at least and beyond, pretty strong contractual protections around price. When we look at the supply\/demand dynamics in hydroxide, it is tight. It's extremely tight and the demand is growing incredibly rapidly. And so, we don't see that tightness changing in any meaningful way. I'll keep making a point that maybe people miss with our business, that there is no connection between carbonate pricing and hydroxide pricing in our conversations with customers.","And the fact that the two have moved together just reflects the fact that there's been tightness in both markets. Carbonate is and will always be a raw material to FMC's Lithium business. And so, the hydroxide market, you really have to understand completely, separately and independently today from the carbonate market.","Operator","Thank you. And your last question will come from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Hi, there. Could you address, I guess, just maybe some areas where you have some optionality? And I guess, what I'm thinking about sort of an update on the Christine Hansen biologicals effort and when that could be meaningful, whether the terms have changed in the Roundup Ready PLUS cross-marketing effort with Monsanto? And how you're thinking about sort of CapEx for the two separated businesses once the SAP and TSA have drop off?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah, I'll address the two related to Christine Hansen. Our relationship continues to grow. We are investing in what we call out plant health platform. Plant health for us is biologicals, micro-nutrients and sea treatment. That business is growing rapidly around the world that is now north of $100 million in revenue. As I said, we continue to invest. We're seeing great opportunities in Asia on micro-nutrients. But more importantly, on biologicals, we're seeing growth in Brazil and certainly growth in the U.S.","As we've said many times over many calls, this is a platform that we intend to continue to invest in. We see both opportunities for standalone biologicals, but also biologicals with synthetic chemistry and we're seeing growth in both areas. So for us, very important and we'll continue to invest. On the Monsanto Roundup Ready, FMC last year made a decision along with Monsanto that we would not be part of the Roundup Ready program. We have instituted in North America our own Freedom Pass program, which has been extremely successful in the first year.","We are aligning with our retailers around the products that we sell and how they can benefit from various activities. It doesn't mean to say that we don't have a very strong relationship with Monsanto and other areas which we do, and we continue to both enjoy that relationship and both grow. But I am very excited about the Freedom Pass program that we put in place in the U.S., and especially how well it's taken off in its first year.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I think on the \u2013 what's call, on the CapEx question, one of the reasons for separating the Lithium business is to really demonstrate the fact that the two businesses have different capital requirements. The Ag business will probably be in the $80 million to $120 million of CapEx range in any given year. Lousy maintenance CapEx, some expansion, and you've heard about the growth plans for Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr and other molecules. So there's likely to be some expansion in those numbers.","The Lithium business is obviously a completely different beast. There's a large expansion in Argentina planned between now and 2025. I think we've talked about somewhere between $550 million and $700 million for that, plus the hydroxide expansion which while much lower capital is coming sooner, we talked about anywhere between $100 million and $200 million coming in the next three or four years on the hydroxide piece as well.","Operator","Thank you. And Mr. Wherley, please go ahead with your closing remarks.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","That's all the time we have for the call today. As always, I'm available following the call to address any questions that you may have. Thank you, and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude the FMC Corporation first quarter 2018 earnings release conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Andrew Sandifer, Vice President, Strategic Development and Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Sandifer, sir, you may begin.","Andrew D. Sandifer","Thanks, Tony. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to FMC's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call and Webcast. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Let me start by reminding everyone that our discussion today will include certain statements that are forward-looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors that are summarized in FMC's 2012 Form 10-K, our most recent Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. This information represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Our discussion today will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. Under the heading entitled Glossary of Financial Terms on our website available at fmc.com, you will find the definition of adjusted earnings and certain other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's conference call. Also on our website, we've posted our current 2013 outlook statement, which provides our guidance for the full year and second quarter 2013 and a reconciliation to the GAAP to the non-GAAP figures we will use today.","Based on our earnings release last night, we have a lot to cover. So let me now turn it over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. In our earnings release last night, you saw that FMC posted strong results for the first quarter in 2013 and have taken several strategic decisions to solidify our path toward meeting our Vision 2015 goals, while positioning the company for continued growth beyond 2015. What I would like to do this morning is begin the call with a recap of our first quarter performance. Then have Paul provide an update on the company's financial position. During those comments, we will refer to our results under our current reporting structure. I will then review the benefits and rationale of our announcement portfolio realignment. Finally, we will be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President, FMC Minerals; and Mike Smith, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition to address your questions.","First, looking at the quarter. FMC delivered 10% growth on adjusted operating profit versus the prior year period. Total company sales of $990 million increased $50 million or 5% versus last year, led by continued strong performance in our Agricultural and BioPolymer businesses. Regionally, sales grew 19% in North America. EMEA was up 11%. Asian RDEs were up 11%, while Latin America was down 16%. Gross margin percent remained flat to last year at 37%. SG&A and R&D expenses of $148 million were also flat to last year. We delivered adjusted earnings of $1.10 per diluted share, an increase of 13% versus the year ago quarter.","Let's turn to a more detailed look at our first quarter performance in each of the operating segments. First, in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $495 million increased 9% versus the prior year quarter, driven by strength in North America and successful new product introductions around the world. Similar to the fourth quarter, North America saw strong early seasonal demand, particularly for resistance management product. In Latin America, due to the reduction in cotton planted area and a slow start in the sugarcane segment, sales decreased versus last year. However, market indications suggest increase in planted area in sugarcane, cotton and soybeans for the 2013 crop year, which signals strong performance in Brazil for the rest of the year.","Sales in Asia were up, with growth from new products, partially offset by lower sales in Australia, the market which has been significantly impacted by drought conditions. In EMEA, sales were up with growth from our recent alliance, as well as timing of sales into Africa. Segment earnings for Agricultural Products of $163 million increased 25% versus the year ago quarter. This increase was driven in large part by higher volumes, favorable product and regional mix and targeted price increases.","To put first quarter results for Ag in perspective, with sales up 9%, following a 20% increase in Q4, we are continuing to deliver leading performance across growing seasons. This performance is even more remarkable in light of the decrease in planted acreage for cotton in Brazil, highlighting our continued strength in our core crops. The progress we are making in penetrating other crops and limited reliance in any single crop or region.","Additionally, we continue to benefit from the strong market acceptance of our resistance management products in North America, giving us a favorable mix impact. And as I will discuss further, when I share our outlook, we are expecting a strong season in Brazil, with increased planting acreage especially for cotton, sugarcane and soybeans, supported by new products that are already in strong demand.","I would like now to move on to Specialty Chemicals. Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $236 million, up 9% versus the year ago quarter, with strong volume growth in BioPolymer, partially offset by lower Lithium volumes. BioPolymer sales grew in the high-double-digit percent, with volume growth in all of our core product segment, which benefited from a recent capacity expansion, as well as growth in our newly-acquired product line. We continue to see strong demand growth in Asia market and are pleased with the construction progress in our new Thailand facility expected to come online late in 2014.","Lithium sales were down mid-double digits, driven by lower volumes as a result of our continued production constraint. Segment earnings were up 6% to $46 million due to strong BioPolymer performance, but partially offset by expected weak financial performance in Lithium, which was substantially lower than prior year profitability. In our last conference call, we described the challenges of the Lithium business experienced in 2012. During the first quarter of this year, we identified and validated manufacturing process and equipment changes. This will improve production rates of final salt brine, debottlenecking the operation and achieving a full targeted production rate at our Argentina Lithium operation.","During the first quarter, we sustained production at throughput rates higher than the pre-expansion level. We also successfully demonstrated an extended full scale test production at 20% above pre-expansion levels. We are abbreviating our normal third quarter maintenance outage and adding an additional shutdown in the second quarter to allow phased implementation of these proven changes to our manufacturing process. This will position us to ramp up final salt brine production during the third quarter to the targeted 25% expansion throughput rate that we have discussed in past quarters. And because it takes about 4 months on average to go from final salt brine to saleable Lithium product, we will begin to see the final financial benefit of the expansion in the fourth quarter with a return to mid-to-high teens operating profit. As mentioned last quarter, we have also launched several Manufacturing Excellence initiatives in our Lithium operation that will reduce further manufacturing costs. We expect benefits from increased throughput and Manufacturing Excellence to be fully realized in 2014.","Moving to Industrial Chemicals. Revenues in Industrial Chemicals decreased 5% to $260 million, with high volume in Alkali offset by lower export prices. Segment earnings of $33 million were down 37% versus a year ago when overall soda ash export pricing was much higher. In Alkali Chemicals, revenues were down mid-single-digit percent, with higher export volumes and higher domestic pricing offset by continued pressure on export prices, particularly in Asia.","Although domestic soda ash prices were up slightly in the quarter, our overall average soda ash price was down in the high-double-digit dollars per ton in the first quarter versus the prior year. As anticipated, soda ash prices in Asia softened in the first quarter. We continue to see signs that Asian pricing is reaching a trough, with producers in China still only providing monthly rate, monthly rather than quarterly contract pricing.","We are also encouraged by the recent $30 per tonne price increase announced by ANSAC. And we continue to expect Asian prices to start increasing in the second quarter, though given the slower than expected GDP growth in China so far this year, we feel this pricing is likely to be later in the quarter than we initially anticipated.","So overall, the quarter turned out largely as expected, with strong performance from our Ag and BioPolymer businesses. Weakness in Asian soda ash pricing and a path forward for Lithium to deliver on its capacity expansion finalized.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Graves to cover our financial position.","Paul W. Graves","Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to briefly discuss working capital balances, cash generated from operations, progress on capital deployment plans, which includes capital additions, M&A and returns to shareholders. And finally, touch on our tax rate for the quarter and the full year.","Let me start by making a few comments on quarterly trends in working capital and capital investments in each of our major businesses. First in the Agriculture business, where we generally have higher accounts receivable in the first quarter since we have carriable balances remaining to be collected in Latin America, where collection periods are measured in months rather than weeks. And we also make the majority of our North American sales in this quarter. We typically see receivables balances fall in the second and third quarters as customer payments are collected. However, we typically see that as the Southern Hemisphere growing season starts in the third quarter, receivables balances start to increase again.","From an inventory perspective, we described to you last quarter that much of the recent increase in the inventory in Agriculture is related to excess inventory held as a direct result of 3 factors: Drought conditions in Australia, reduced cotton planted area in Brazil, and the delayed registration of a new product in Brazil. This inventory remains on the balance sheet and will do so on until the next Southern Hemisphere growing season gets underway in the second half of the year.","A final component of working capital associated with our Ag business is accrued customer rebates, which are primarily related to the timing of North American sales. In general, these rebates accrue through the year and are mostly paid out in the fourth quarter. And taking these factors together, it's not unusual to see a cash outflow in this business in the first quarter, with the second and third quarters typically our strongest cash-generation periods.","In BioPolymer, we have long supply chains, and for some raw materials, relatively short seasonal buying windows, especially in seaweed. And therefore the levels of inventory we hold in this business are relatively high. The first 2 quarters are seasonally our strongest, creating further upward pressure on inventory and in receivables during this part of the year. Although not as pronounced as in the Ag business, the first quarter is also one of the weaker cash-generation quarters for biopolymers.","In Alkali, we hold relative little inventory. However, our collection terms are typically longer for export than for domestics sales. As exports continue to become a larger part of our business mix in Alkali, we expect to see our receivables balances increase, all other things being equal. Although not a seasonal effect, we would expect that increased revenues generated overseas will, therefore, have an impact in our working capital due to these extended collection terms. And to be clear, our position on working capital is to ensure that we maintain or improve our working capital productivity metrics. It is not to focus solely on the quarter-end balances. We recognize that our businesses have quite substantial amounts of capital tied up in working capital. However, we continue to have working capital productivity levels that are consistent with historic levels. We consistently look for ways to improve these metrics and currently have a number of programs in place focused on this. That said, any benefits we see will likely take multiple quarters to materialize in a meaningful way.","With that backdrop, cash flow from operations in the first quarter was negative $32 million. However, we're reaffirming our guidance of generating cash from operations of $650 million in 2013, with the bulk of that cash expected to be generated in the second and third quarters.","Shifting now to capital deployment. Capital additions in the first quarter of 2013, including that reported in the other investing activities line, totaled $33 million. We are reaffirming our expectation for 2013 of deploying $350 million into capital asset additions. We previously described to you that nearly half of our 2013 spending will go toward construction of the new BioPolymer MCC plant in Thailand and to support expansion in our Ag manufacturing network. Much of the spending on these projects will occur in the second half of the year.","Secondly, in the first quarter, we acquired Nippon Sheet Glass's 6.25% minority interest in FMC Wyoming, which brings our ownership to 93.75%. This acquisition has led us to reduce our forecasted noncontrolling interest as reflected in the outlook statement posted to our website this morning.","During the first quarter, we returned $128 million to shareholders, $18 million via dividends and $110 million via share repurchases. In the quarter, 1.8 million shares were repurchased at an average price of $59.61. We expect this to have an approximate full year positive impact on EPS of $0.04. As you also saw on our press release, the FMC board recently approved an expansion of the company's share repurchase authority to a total of $500 million, replacing the previous authority and any unused amounts. We expect to complete this new plan over the next 2 years.","Our approach to share repurchases for the rest of this year will be related to the potential divestment that Pierre will talk about next. We believe we will generate enough cash from operations to fund the proposed capital investments and any acquisitions we may undertake. As such, we would expect to return a portion of the proceeds from the divestment of FMC Peroxygens to shareholders through share repurchases. And we'll consider these actions ahead of completion of the divestiture should we become comfortable that a divestment is reasonably likely to take place.","Finally, our tax rate in the first quarter benefited from a one-off gain from tax credits relating to 2012 which because of the delay in the U.S. in passing budget legislation in December, we were unable to claim in 2012. We expect our tax rate for the subsequent quarters to be in line with our historical rate of 27.5%.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Paul. Let me now offer some additional context on the portfolio realignment we announced yesterday. When we launched Vision 2015, we committed to actively manage our portfolio of businesses to optimize the long term profitable growth of the company. This is precisely what we have done over the past 3 years. We exited the phosphate, sodium percarbonate and zeolites product lines and invested heavily in the growth of our core Ag and BioPolymer platforms.","In our earnings yesterday -- release yesterday, we announced steps to simplify and focus the company's business portfolio around 3 core platforms where FMC has a sustainable competitive advantage. These platforms provide FMC with fast growth, high margin and high returns on capital. When we look at our portfolio, we see 2 growth platforms that are supported by a strong cash generator.","Our first core platform is focused on functional ingredients for the food and pharmaceutical markets. Our BioPolymer business has been an industry leader in that space for decades and is on track to deliver its ninth straight year of record performance. BioPolymer is an important growth engine for FMC, and we believe there are exciting opportunities to expand our participation into broader adjacent markets. With this expanded scope, our BioPolymer business becomes a standalone reporting segment called FMC Health and Nutrition. This new segment name better reflect the broader marketplace where we will expand our participation to fuel accelerated growth organically and through external opportunities.","Mike Smith who has run our BioPolymer division for the last 8 years will lead FMC Health and Nutrition. He and his team will implement a strategy to increase our investments to broaden FMC's participation in food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, personal care and related markets.","Our second platform is our Agricultural Product business. As you all know, this is a high-growth platform that's well on track to deliver its 10th consecutive year of record performance. This business can outpace market growth as we leverage our technologies, expanded geographies and acquired new product lines to broaden and strengthen our portfolio. Our unique business model delivers sustained industry-leading growth and profitability. To recognize the breadth of product technology and service value we bring to the market, Agricultural Products Group will now be called FMC Agricultural Solutions and will remain [indiscernible]. And finally, our third platform called FMC Minerals closer[ph] as a strong foundation to support the growth initiatives in FMC Health and Nutrition and FMC Agricultural Solution. FMC Minerals includes our cost-advantaged Alkali business, which sits on the world's largest natural trona reserve. This business operates under a low-cost model using advanced extraction and processing technology. This third platform will also include our Lithium business, which employs similar manufacturing methods. Operating these 2 business with 1 segment allow us to leverage technical resources and more efficiently improve operating performance through Manufacturing Excellence. We will operate FMC Minerals based on the fundamentals as we see them, commodity businesses driven by supply\/demand balance and relative cost position. Ed Flynn will lead the new FMC Minerals segment. He is a veteran FMC leader and brings deep experience in operating commodity mineral extraction businesses to our Lithium operation.","As a result of this realignment, Michael Wilson, President of the former Specialty Chemicals group is leaving FMC to pursue other opportunities. All of us at the FMC wish him success and thank him for his leadership over the last 16 years.","Finally, let me comment on Peroxygens. Although Peroxygens is a successful profitable business and has been an important part of FMC for many years, we no longer view it as a strategic fit given the evolution of our portfolio and our increased focus on the 3 core platforms. Given this, we have been exploring the potential divestiture of this business.","During this assessment, FMC Peroxygens will become its own reporting segment. This new segment will include certain product lines currently sold through the Environmental Solutions businesses given the high degree of integration with the Peroxygens supply chain. We believe that with the right focus and investment, this business has strong growth potential, but we think that potential can be a lot more successful in by others.","Let me now share with you our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2013. Please note that all of our guidance is under our prior reporting segment. Before the end of this quarter, we will provide historical segment financials under the new reporting structure and will begin reporting this way with the second quarter results.","For the second quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.87 to $0.97 per diluted share, flat versus the second quarter of 2012. Continued strength in Agricultural Product with segment earnings in the second quarter expected to be up in the mid-to-high single digit percent versus a very strong second quarter in 2012. Specialty Chemicals segment earnings are expected to be flat, as continued weak performance in Lithium offsets growth in BioPolymer. In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to decrease approximately 20% due to continued pricing pressure in export market, which we now expect to begin improving later this quarter.","We are increasing our full year adjusted earnings by 9% to a range of $3.93 to $4.07 per diluted share, a 15% increase over 2012 at the midpoint of this range. This change demonstrates our confidence in the full year outlook and the benefit of investments we made in the first quarter.","Our Agricultural Product Group is expected to deliver its 10th consecutive year of record earnings, driven by volume growth and new product globally as favorable grower economics and strong market conditions continue. Market indications in Brazil suggests increases in planted area in sugarcane, cotton and soybean for the 2013 crop year, which signals strong performance for the rest of the year and should result in operating earnings increasing in the mid-to-high teens percent for the year.","In Specialty Chemicals, segment earnings are expected to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent. Our BioPolymer business will benefit from capacity increases, while we implement process modifications to improve Lithium operations' operating performance.","Finally, in Industrial Chemicals, we anticipate earnings to be down mid-single digit for the full year. Domestic soda ash prices are expected to be up in the low-to-mid single digit dollars per ton versus the prior year. Soda ash prices in export markets are expected to begin improving toward the end of the second quarter and will continue sequential improvement through the remainder of the year. The net result of domestic and export pricing actions for soda ash should be a global average price for the year, which will be down compared to 2012. We also expect to begin seeing the benefits of our Manufacturing Excellence initiatives during 2013, which will enable volume growth and partially offset the weakness in pricing.","With that, I thank you for your time and attention, and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question in queue from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, in Ag this quarter you had 80%-plus incremental margins, was that simply mix? And I guess why do you expect that to change later this year?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, it's the improvement in operating profit is mostly due to a mix -- a regional mix. And we expect and you see that every year usually operating earnings go down in the second half of the year when the market is more driven by Latin America and Brazil and is higher in the first part of the year when it's driven more by North America and EMEA.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the assets for potential divestiture. Could you give us a rough EBITDA margin estimate for kind of the assets you're considering and a timeline for what you're using to make a decision?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Regarding the timeline, we believe the process is going to be moving forward at a good pace. I would actually believe that a divestiture of this business or at least a contract signed with a buyer would be possible somewhere between the end of the third quarter and the beginning of -- and the end of the fourth quarter. So sometime in the last 4 months of 2013. In terms of EBITDA for the business, we're going to take a little time to reissue all of the earnings number, EBITDA numbers, EBIT number for each of the segment during this quarter. So while we are doing this work, and we'll be issuing that for you guys to update your model, I don't want to be too precise, but I would say that our Peroxygens business has EBITDA margin which are in the mid-to-high teens.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Chris Perrella on for Kevin. Jumping to the Lithium business, what's the outlook for pricing for 2013 within Lithium? And in terms of volume production, I know you took more shutdowns in the first quarter. Will you be able to produce more Lithium in the second quarter?","Pierre R. Brondeau","So in terms of pricing, 2012 -- 2013, sorry, is a year of flat pricing. There is not much change on the market today, and we have stability. From a volume, I really think that you have to look at 2 things. First of all, the second quarter, we're going to be taking a shutdown. We're going to be implementing the retrofitting of the plant to run the plants under the new process. So on a change process. So I would not expect significant volume change. You will start to see volume change of the brine in the third quarter. We'll still have a little outage, a shorter one. You will see volume change from a brine standpoint in the third quarter, and we'll be reporting on that. But as you know, there is about 3- to 4-month period before you actually see that increase in production into the final saleable Lithium process, whether it's your hydroxide carbonate or butyl. So it's really in the fourth quarter that we're going to see the translation of this improved production into financial results.","Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And just a brief follow-up on Ag, with the delayed U.S. planting, what's the risk or what crops would be most affected for FMC?","Pierre R. Brondeau","It's going to be very low or no impact to us, but I'm going to ask Mark, Mark Douglas to give you a better color on what is happening overall for the industry with the delayed planting, which we estimate and Mark should confirm that by being about a couple of weeks.","Mark A. Douglas","Thanks, Pierre. As Pierre just said, we're looking at a couple of weeks to maybe 3 weeks delay right now. We know people are obviously planting. The weather changed from last weekend. Although if you watch the weather forecast every day, in the Midwest it's changing quite rapidly. It's too early to tell what the impact on us would be. We have a lot of preemergence and resistance products in the pipeline right now, as you could tell from our -- our Q1 sales very strong. It's a great business for us in North America. I wouldn't say right now there is any impact on us. We have a broad portfolio. We have insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. And as you know, we tend to focus on a lot of the niche crops. So right now, we don't see any impact.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Alina Khaykin ","This is actually Alina Khaykin sitting in for John. So first on Lithium, kind of given all the noise and moving parts over the past year or so, how should we be thinking about operating leverage or earnings from the business as we move through the year? I know it's obviously going to get higher in the back half, but can you give us some kind of order of magnitude?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Sure, let me broadly quantify what we are talking about today. We believe we do have process changes today under control. And we do believe the ramp-up will take place through the third quarter, with impact on the financial results in the fourth quarter. All of these will average to a range of about 10% operating earnings throughout the year. We believe it's a business which could sustain as soon as next year operating earnings in the 20% range. So think about a $250 million and a doubling of the earnings from the high-single digit, low teens into the high-teens 20% range.","Alina Khaykin ","Okay, that's helpful. And then also on the cash flow, in the past, you've indicated that you would buy back about $100 million the $150 million per year and you kind a hit that range already in 1Q. So are you taking a more aggressive approach to deploying cash towards stock buybacks? Or was it just more of a one-off opportunistic approach this quarter?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Well, I think -- I'll ask Paul to add to my comment, but I think it's 2 situations, which are happening in parallel and which are not connected. You know that we committed to do, to return to -- when we did our last analyst call, we committed to return around $150 million to shareholders, with a blend of stock buyback and dividends over the next 3 years. And actually, this is what we did in the first quarter. Looking at the strength of our business, the confidence we have in the year and where we are going, we decided to take advantage of what we believe was a strong cash flow situation and strength in our core businesses to do a stock buyback in the first quarter. So this is in line with what we decided to do every year and then we have the dividend, following the dividend increase we announced in the last December. Now there is another event which is taking place, our decision to simplify our portfolio and exploring the divestiture of the Peroxygen business. That is something which, we believe, will lead to a more aggressive stock buyback once the proceed -- or just ahead of the divestiture once we are certain of where we are going. That should accelerate and amplify our stock buyback for 2013 into 2014. Paul, you want to add something?","Paul W. Graves","The only thing I would add is, historically, we've made our share repurchase at various times of the year, and it just made sense to us to get this repurchase done in the first quarter. No big policy reason behind that. No change to the way we think about repurchases, but we wanted to get this done in the first quarter because it just made more sense to do so.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of Industrial Chemicals, I mean, you take a look at the year, can you help us understand why, at least in your opinion, soda ash price export should start to improve? And then if it doesn't, if it still happens it doesn't, what would the outlook for you look like? I mean, it seems like that's the only variable in that segment that causes some uncertainty for you.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Mike, first, you're correct. If I look at all of the variables we have in front of us, we do have a good handle on pretty much everything in the business, including Lithium. Now we believe we are at the execution stage, not an investigation stage. The place where we don't have full control, of course, the pricing situation export. There is multiple signs, and I will ask Ed Flynn to add to my comment, but there is multiple signs. The first one is clearly, there was no further decrease and a very clear signal of stabilization in the pricing in the month of March. So it seems every indicator we have seems to be showing that the pricing are reaching the bottom in the month of March. We are confirming, and our people on the ground over there have confirmed, that the Chinese producer as we said in the last call are not giving 3 months contract anymore. We just confirmed that. We had a team flying out to Asia last week. They're only going with monthly supply, which usually is a very good indication. You've also heard that ANSAC and all of the members of ANSAC have decided on a price increase for Asia of 30 tonnes -- of $30 per tonne. If you look from an industry dynamic, we are seeing 2 things happening. There is a start of a rationalization in terms of production and there has been a couple of companies, which have been announcing shutdowns and those are the high-cost producers, which have been announcing shutdown of capacity, and that will be tightening supplier supply into Asia. The final indicator, which come into our model is, despite the fact that Chinese GDP is not as robust as what we were expecting, some of the market, which are a leading market for soda ash are showing strength. And we're talking about the automotive industry, as well as the flat glass industry. So when we bring all of that, we do have the belief that there is no reason for us not to see price increase starting to rise in the end of the second quarter, showing impact in the third and fourth quarter. Ed, if you want to add anything?","Edward T. Flynn","No, I think you've covered it well, Pierre.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. On the Ag side, I was surprised to hear that Latin America is a little bit sluggish and impressed that the rest of the areas -- geographies were able to overcome that. So when you think about your comments of growth in acreage, are you seeing orders in those areas, or maybe just give us a little bit of color of what you're seeing now to show that Latin America is going to recover as the year unfolds?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, Mike, it's quite simple. The statements we are making are linked to orders, which are coming in very strongly for the Latin America and especially the Brazil season. As you know, you really see the sales in the third and fourth quarter, but orders are coming in very strong, and we also do have statistics and information around the planted acres. And I think, Mark, could you please confirm pretty much across the board, including cotton, we're expecting right now acreage increase?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Pierre. We're seeing cotton acreage increases. We know soybean is increasing. It's a strong replanting season for sugarcane where we have great market share. So all those crops for us are important down in Brazil. We're also seeing growth in Argentina, as well as the other Latin American countries. Mike, I think the other thing I would add is, we're introducing some new products this year into Brazil that already we have registration for and we're seeing good demand. So I'm very confident that as we approach the third and fourth quarters for Latin America, it will be a very strong season for us.","Operator","And our next question in queue will come from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just sticking with Ag for a minute, it sounds like a nice driver of the mix was products dealing with resistance streams. Are those typically more geared towards preemergent treatments that are going to be your highest profitability? Or is it something that -- something that we could see being strong all through the North American growing season?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think in Ag, we do have a very strong preemergence product line with a very strong mix here. So the impact is usually more visible in that part of the business down than in the rescue market, for example. I think we do have technology, which are -- which is very, very strong, especially around corn, woodworm resistance, around glyphosate resistance. I think we've developed product, which are very much in line with the trend we are seeing today in the market from a resistance standpoint. So we tend to have a stronger from a mix and profitability standpoint, preemergence market. I do not want to say that you can apply the same type of reasoning to the entire product line. Mark, you want to add something?","Mark A. Douglas","No, you've nailed it. I wouldn't add anything else.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. Maybe a couple of questions on the Lithium business. Just in terms of realigning Lithium and combining it with the soda ash business. Clearly, soda ash is something you use in the Lithium carbonate production process. But can you just help us better understand some of the overlap between those 2 businesses? And does the combination there suggest that you might be focusing more on, in the future, on mining of Lithium hard rock resources as opposed to brine-based production?","Pierre R. Brondeau","All right. First, when we bring those business together, it is not because they do have a connection at the end market or because we do use soda ash in Lithium. I think the reasons for which we are bringing those business together is first, the success as we have seen in the last few quarters, the success or failure of this business will depend upon our ability to run strong Manufacturing Excellence program and be able to be a low-cost producer. There is lots of commonality from a manufacturing standpoint, extraction standpoint, separation standpoint between the 2 manufacturing process. Actually, there is a team, which is putting in place all of the process change, which is supporting our Lithium operations. That is the team today, which the technology team from our Wyoming soda ash plant. So you do have a lot of manufacturing synergies and the need to operate those 2 businesses as low-cost reliable manufacturing processes. That's the first one. The second one is the leadership we have to run those businesses. Ed Flynn will be running this group. Eric Norris will stay to run the Lithium business, and he's doing a tremendous job by turning the situation around. We are convinced those business needs to be run as commodity business driven by supply\/demand. There is high barriers to entry when you want to get into the Lithium business, but once the product is made, they are very often interchangeable. I think you take a product made by a good manufacturer like Rockwood. All the quality will be very identical to the quality of a good product made by FMC. So you get into a situation where supply\/demand will guide how this business is doing. And we want to be managing the business the same way we do in soda ash, being very careful in understanding the end market to decide upon capacity. Those are the reasons. We are not intending to go more toward rock mining, spodumene production, while staying very true to what we know best, how to do today from a manufacturing standpoint, which is brine production.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And then just in terms of the resource in Argentina, how long is the expected maintenance shutdown in Q2? And in terms of the process changes, does the new process rely any more or less on evaporation?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, the new process doesn't rely more or less, the same thing. I think the biggest challenges we had, the process today, now the way we -- the process is designed with the different ponds we had and in operation process is very defined. Lots of the technology, which had to be worked on were around separation technology. And that's where we did most of the work in order to make sure that the ponds we used to have operating at very different concentration of Lithium would be operating with the same efficiency over the long run and what were the operating parameters to do that. This is what we have been working on. So we do believe now that we do have the evaporation well under control. We believe that we can feed of course as soon as -- we have always have to take into account the seasons and the winter versus the summer. But we do believe that we know now how to produce high-concentrated product, which will feed the separation. And we believe that we know how to run the separation pond in a way which will work as well, with high concentration versus lower concentration. So those were mostly the changes we are working on. I think the shutdown is going to be -- we're going to see as it goes, that's why we're not expecting much coming from the second quarter. It's going to be multiple weeks of shutdown in the second quarter.","Operator","We'll move on to our next question from Peter Butler with Glenn Hill Investments.","Peter Butler","If one was optimistic on the proceeds from the sale of the Peroxygen business, it's -- would you be expecting to get something like 3x sales or more?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No, I think we do not want, at this stage, to publicly speculate around how much we're expecting from the Peroxygen business. But as we said before, it's a $350 million business, with EBITDA margin in the high-teens. If you look at that -- and comps are fairly easy to find in terms of EBITDA multiples. So but I can tell you definitely I would be very happy to get 3x sales, but we will not get 3x sales for that business. Unless you know somebody who can do that, then please help me.","Peter Butler","Well, you got an expert sitting next side -- beside you, don't you?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, unfortunately, he's not a banker anymore. He's just a regular CFO. No, seriously, Peter, I think it's a good question. It's important for us to have a good divestiture process because it is a good business. It has a good potential. It's healthy business. It's not a turnaround situation at all. So we are selling a good business, which has a growth platform, a specialty platform and a commodity platform. So it is a very interesting business, which returns cost of capital, which has good EBITDA margin and cash generation. So it's going to be a good sale, but this kind of business don't go for 2x or 3x sale. But we're expecting good proceed, which will be important to keep on returning more aggressively in the coming quarters cash to our shareholders and also be important for the growth of the company.","Peter Butler","Does this -- you've separated out the Peroxygens, but you've sort of consolidated the Lithium. Does this say that Lithium is a keeper?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, for now, Lithium is a keeper. I think it's a platform. As I said, what we wanted to do -- Peroxygen is a great business. I do not believe today, it's a business where we are -- looking at the strategy we have in the company, the prioritization from one of the places where we are highly differentiated. I think we decided to focus our capital spending, research money and acquisition money into the 3 platform where we believe we are or can be advantaged and where we have growth potential. Today, with the work we have done, we are feeling much better than 6 months ago about Lithium, so we believe Lithium is part of that portfolio.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask quickly on the deceleration in the Agricultural sales growth that went from a year-over-year growth of about 20% in the fourth quarter down to 9%. I'm just wondering if in hindsight, there might not have been some pull-forward in demand into the unusually strong fourth quarter? And kind of related to that, what kind of gives you confidence that it's going to rebound back to -- looks like you're expecting kind of a north of 20% sales growth rate for much of the rest of the year?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think when -- we always look -- I mean, we report sales like any public company on a quarterly basis, but you know how much 2 weeks of orders can make a difference when you are jumping from a season to another. The fourth quarter is the strongest season in Brazil, and you just need the sales to be moved up or move down by the customers, and you can see major changes in the way sales are. So what we do here internally is very often we look at sales growth over a season. So we've been growing historically in the mid-teens and up. And I think if you look over a 2 quarters' period, we are in the 15% growth, if you take the fourth quarter and the first quarter, between Latin America and North America. And we believe if you look at the 15% growth over those 2 quarters, it's still a leading growth number. We believe it's a strong performance, especially -- I mean, let's face it, cotton, which is a big crop for us decreased in acreage in the fourth quarter last year. So we had some headwind, which we do not believe will be here going into the second half of this year. That's why we are forecasting a growth rate for the second half of the year between performance of the business today, new product introduction, orders which we have in the book. We are looking at a growth rate north of 15% and more in the 18% to 20%. That's for the Ag business than that we've seen as an average for the last 2 quarters. But I think we always have -- and you know that very well. There is no deceleration at all. There is seasons and there is a season which is more influenced by Brazil, one which is more influenced by North America and depending upon where few weeks go, you have a change in number. So we tend to -- between growing seasons together rather than looking at quarters when we analyze the business.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just looking at the potential sale of Peroxygens. It looks like, based on a $350 million of sales and a high-teen to EBITDA margin, it would probably be dilutive to EPS by around $0.25. So I'm just wondering if you are committing to buyback a amount of stock to sort of offset that level of dilution, or should we expect maybe less than that?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. A couple of things. It should be dilutive less than the number you are stating here in terms of EPS. So yes, there will be a dilution from the sales, but there will be a compensation through stock buyback. I don't want yet to comment around what will be the impact for the year. We're going to work through this process as we see the sale going. Let me tell you, if I would say at a high level how Paul and I will look at that financial transaction if all falls in place. We believe there could be a dilution in terms of operating profit, which would be due to the sale of the business, which is a profitable business. There would be a stock buyback, which would at least compensate for the loss of operating earning into EPS to avoid to see a dilution at the EPS level. Following that, the refocus on 3 platform, and especially on Health and Nutrition, should allow us to make some bolt-on acquisition to buy back, if I may say, EBIT when we look at our 2015. So if all goes well, you could see very little reduction of your EBIT when we target Vision 2015 numbers. But potentially, an improvement on your EPS number.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.","Sabina Chatterjee - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's Sabina Chatterjee in for Frank Mitsch. Just some quick follow-ups, Pierre. Can you quantify the amount of Asian capacity that's shutting down when you mentioned the Industrial Chemicals? And how many more of these $30 per tonne-type increases do you think you'll need to hit the full year guidance for that segment?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Well, first, I talked about shutdown, I did not specify Asian shutdown per se. I think I do not like too much to talk about other companies. I think those shutdowns have been publicly announced. So if you want to take a look at that, it's just difficult for me to comment about other publicly traded companies or companies in the call. But those shutdowns are defined and have been publicly announced. I think we do not need another price increase announcement. I think we will see how it goes. We have a price increase announcement now. And then we're going to be managing the market as it goes and see where this number is going to take us. But I want to make sure we don't mislead people when we talk about pricing being low in Asia. It is low. But to bridge the gap between an Asia pricing and the domestic pricing, you don't need multiple $30 increase.","Sabina Chatterjee - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Argentina Lithium question, you're calling for flat EBIT in Q2, so I guess the costs aren't going to be that onerous. And then we should get a nice boost in Q4, but it doesn't look like guidance is calling for that. So can you help me reconcile that? Is it that you see Q3 down from Q2 levels? Is that a seasonality issue?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No, I think what we're going to see is Q2 is going to be low because, as I said, the plants will be down. And it's not going to be -- you're correct, it is not going to be a very high-capital spending to get the plant to operate. It's a fairly -- those are more technology reasons and process changes. So it's not going to be a high expense, but the plant is going to be off for a while. We are looking at a slight improvement in earnings for Lithium in the third quarter, more toward the back end of the quarter. And it is only because when you produce salt brine between that time and the time you have your Lithium compound, whether it's butyl or a hydroxide, or a chloride, it takes about 3 to 4 months. So if you look -- imagine the plant, as we begin the retrofit at the beginning of the second quarter. We start to increase capacity toward the back end of the second quarter into the beginning of the third quarter, those products will only hit the market by the very end of the third quarter. So you will have a slight improvement in the third quarter, and you will start to see your mid-teens EBIT in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And we will take our last question today from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Pierre, have you seen any signs of pickup in the demand for Lithium related to either HEV or EV or energy storage? Or is that still kind of on hold?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I have to say that it is still pretty much the same story that we have been talking about for the last 6 month, which is, there is expectation which are differing from a company to another. But roughly, we are seeing the growth for EV if it takes off -- to take off post 2015. And it's a bit slower than what most company would have said 1 year or 2 ago. So there is no significant change or increase in pace in this market today. I think the growth from an energy standpoint is more driven by electronic device than it is by electric vehicles.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And are those still growing at about -- I mean, in terms of the demand for Lithium, at about a 10% a year?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, correct. That's the right number.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And since we are on Lithium, could you update us on the restructuring going on at your plant in North Carolina?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, it's going well. I think we are hitting all of the marks from a cost reduction, staffing reduction, improved operations, so we are right on where we were expecting to be.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And would that be enough to offset some of the expectations from the plant -- yes, the operation in Argentina?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No. If you look -- we are looking -- there won't be a positive impact this year, but which is pretty much into the [indiscernible] already. The way capitalization of manufacturing variance work and the way the accounting work and the speed at which you do it, our objective really is -- I mean, those are bits and pieces, which will improve the picture. But really for us, it's getting the plant to be changed in the second quarter, having full rate production reached of brine in the third quarter, bring this business to a mid-teens EBIT to sales ratio in the fourth quarter, get that business to a 20% operating earning to sales over 2014.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then on another subject. You talked about seeing some signs of demand for flat glass increasing in China. And if I am correct, demand for flat glass usually leads the demand -- the growth in commercial construction by about 6 months? First of all, am I correct in that assumption? And are you seeing the same type of demand in North America for the flat glass?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No, I think we are not seeing the same type of jump in North America for flat glass.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And am I correct, Pierre, in thinking that it leads commercial construction?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, your assumption is correct. When you see the demand, it's a sign in the building and construction, mostly driven by commercial. And yes, it's a 3 to 6, 7-month timing.","Operator","And at this time, we'll return the call back to Mr. Brondeau for closing remarks.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you very much, and thank you all for your question. I believe we had a strong first quarter. We believe that even in an environment of prolonged economic uncertainty, 2013 will be another record year for FMC, with EPS up 15% versus prior year. By the fourth quarter, we expect to see a recovery in FMC Minerals, with increased export pricing versus the prior year and manufacturing improvements in Lithium that will return the business to normalized EBIT margins. FMC Health and Nutrition will continue to strengthen its portfolio, while growing sales in a double-digit range. And FMC Agricultural Solutions will again outpace market growth on mid-to-high teens increases. We have delivered leading performance for several years. We will close the year with our 3 core business platforms performing strongly, and I'm confident that our portfolio realignment will accelerate our growth, continue our steady course to deliver our Vision 2015 goals and position the company for continued success beyond 2015.

This increase was driven by double-digit organic growth in Argentina, Canada, France, Russia, India, China, Indonesia and Pakistan as well as price increases across all regions except North America.","Adjusted company EBITDA was $320 million, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year period and at the top-end of our guidance. Company EBITDA margins were about 27%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, despite $28 million in combined headwinds from raw material costs, tariffs, and FX in the quarter.","Adjusted EPS was $1.76 in the quarter, an increase of 21% versus recast Q4 2018. The year-over-year performance was driven largely by a $0.34 increase on the EBITDA line and the benefit of reduced share count, partially offset by higher interest expenses.","Compared to a most recent guidance, adjusted EPS was also much higher due to very strong operational performance as higher volume and solid cost control drove $0.07 outperformance versus guidance, while much lower-than-forecasted tax rate in the quarter resulted in $0.21 of the beat versus guidance.","Moving now to Slide 4. Q4 revenue grew by 7% versus prior year with volume contributing 11% growth, offset partially by a 2% headwind from FX. Overall price was flat as increased rebates in North America offset strong pricing in the other three regions.","Given the start of the Southern Hemisphere season, Latin America made up over 40% over fourth quarter revenue. Sales in Latin America grew 10% year-over-year or 13% organically, driven by very strong growth in Argentina and single-digit growth in Brazil and Mexico.","Argentina posted significantly higher volumes for a pre-emergent herbicides and soybean. We are very pleased with these results in Argentina. As you may recall, we talked about the significant changes we made to improve our market access in Argentina, which are now delivering on their expectations.","As forecasted, following four quarters of very strong double-digit growth, Brazil growth slowed in Q4, but continued to deliver increased volumes. Channel inventories of our product in Brazil remain at normal levels for this point of the season and are well under control heading into 2020.","In North America, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for Rynaxypyr insect control in specialty crops, growth of Ethos XB, the combination insecticides and fungicides for infrared applications and our new Lucento fungicide. Herbicides sales in Canada were also strong.","Our overall volume was above what was expected in the quarter, resulting in higher-than-forecasted rebates. These rebates are accounted for on our pricing line, which offset price increases in other regions. We continue to closely monitor channel inventories of our product in the U.S. as we head into the spring.","To ensure a reduction of those channel inventories on a year-over-year basis, we proactively sold less of Authority pre-emergent herbicide into the channel in the second half of 2019 than we did in the same period in 2018.","In Asia, we had a very strong fourth quarter performance with a revenue increase of 9% and 10% organic growth year-over-year in an otherwise down market. India, China, Indonesia and Pakistan all recorded double-digit growth rates driven by insecticide volumes. Following a very strong Q2 and Q3, India delivered over 20% revenue growth in Q4, driven by rice and sugarcane applications and new product launches. China\u2019s strong revenue growth was driven by diamide demand and fungicide sales in citrus and vegetable applications.","In EMEA, sales grew 5% overall, as France, UK, Russia, Italy and Romania, all posted double-digit year-over-year growth. Q4 organic growth in the region was 7% and was driven largely by sales in France and Russia, which more than offset difficult drought conditions that impacted cereal plantings in Central and Eastern Europe.","Turning to the fourth quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. You see a $75 million volume contribution, which came from all regions and which drove the year-over-year growth. Relative to our guidance, both volume and cost management led to the strong outperformance.","On Slide 6, full-year revenue was $4.6 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. Excluding FX headwinds of 3%, this represents 11% organic growth. Full-year adjusted EPS increased $0.85 year-over-year or 16%, driven largely by EBITDA growth and the benefit of share repurchase.","On Slide 7, you can see that FMC growth for 2019 were well ahead of the crop protection market in every region. These percentages shown are all in U.S. dollar terms. Despite the extreme weather and trade challenges in the year, our full-year sales in North America were up 3%, which was ahead of forecast and 900 basis points ahead of the market.","FMC full-year sales in Latin America grew 19%, 600 basis points ahead of the market, and 23% organically. In EMEA, our sales grew 4% in the year, which was 700 basis points ahead of the market, and 10% organically.","FMC revenue growth in Asia was 3% on a reported basis, 800 basis points ahead of the market, and 8% organically, excluding FX headwinds across many currencies. Globally, FMC grew 8% in 2019 in U.S. dollar terms versus a flat global market. We believe our outperformance in every region was due to the strength of our portfolio accrued balance, and a strong commercial presence around the world.","Moving to Slide 8, where you can see our full EBITDA and revenue drivers. Volume was the main driver of revenue growth, while price increased sales by 3%. Almost 20% of this year\u2019s revenue growth came from 2019 product launches. And our vitality index, which we calculate as the proportion of total revenue coming from products introduced in the last five years was roughly 10% of total sales.","The diamide grew in the low-teens in 2019 and the rest of the portfolio, grew in the mid-single digits. On our Q2 earnings call, we outlined our plans to profitably grow our diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents and all the way through the end of this decade via the engagement of third parties.","We indicated we are in place or negotiating 15 such commercial agreements. Six months later, we have extended the number of agreements to cover four global partnership and 41 separate local company agreements covering 11 countries.","A number of these new agreements are active and commercial sales are occurring. We will continue to expand the franchise through more of these commercial agreements. These partnerships are important and in most cases, allow us to access markets we are not selling into today. They are a key extension of our commercial reach.","2019 adjusted EBITDA of $1.22 billion was up 10% year-over-year despite $228 million in combined headwinds from higher cost and FX. Revenue and the EBITDA growth rate in 2019 both above the high-end of the five-year growth target we provided in December 2018.","I will now turn it over to Andrew.","Andrew Sandifer","Thanks, Pierre. I'll start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement, then move to the balance sheet, cash flow, and share count. I'll also give a quick update on progress in implementing our new SAP S\/4HANA system.","Interest expense for full-year 2019 was $158.5 million, $3.5 million above our most recent guidance, primarily due to higher-than-forecasted foreign debt and commercial paper balances. For 2020, we anticipate interest expense between $160 million and $170 million with the increase largely attributable to higher foreign debt balances, particularly where we utilized local borrowings to reduce currency exposures.","Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the full-year 2019 was 11.6%, 290 basis points lower-than-anticipated. FMC's corporate structure, particularly the principal operating companies that were created as part of the DuPont transaction in 2017, provide FMC with a structurally low tax rate.","With this structure, profit outside the United States is taxed at lower statutory or negotiated tax rates than profit in the U.S., resulting in a weighted-average tax rate well below the U.S. statutory rate.","To be clear, even at this lower overall rate, FMC does incur a significant amount of U.S. tax on these non-U.S. profits under the Global Intangible Low-taxed Income or GILTI provision. The structural elements to drive our low overall effective tax rate are highly sustainable and we expect a low rate for many years to come. However, the effective tax rate in any period is sensitive to swings and profitability between geographies, most notably the amount of profit earned in the U.S.","The significant contributors to our lower-than-expected tax rate in 2019 were lower than forecasted earnings in the U.S. due to the factors in our North America business Pierre mentioned earlier, combined with stronger than forecasted earnings that flowed through our principal operating companies outside of the U.S.","Looking ahead to 2020, we expect a full-year tax rate of 12.5% to 14.5% based on our current estimates of taxable earnings by geography. At year-end, gross debt was $3.3 billion, down roughly $300 million from the end of the third quarter. Surplus cash on the balance sheet at year-end was in excess of $225 million due to timing of receipt of end of year payments, which prevented us from using this cash to further pay down debt prior to year-end.","Considering the surplus cash at year-end, gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was just under our 2.5x target. We remained committed to solid investment grade credit metrics and expect full-year average leverage to be in line with this commitment in 2020.","Moving to Slide 9 and cash flow. Free cash flow for 2020 was $302 million, up $172 million from the prior year. Higher adjusted cash from operations driven by higher EBITDA and lower use of cash for working capital and lower legacy and transformation spending more than offset an increase in capital additions compared to the prior year.","We are pleased with the improvements made in trade working capital. Trade working capital as a percentage of sales at year-end decreased 210 basis points to 32.5% in 2019. Free cash conversion relative to adjusted net earnings was 38% for full-year 2019, more than twice the prior year on a like-for-like basis with free cash flow growing 10x as fast as earnings. However, free cash flow came in below the low end of our outlook range of $375 million to $475 million.","Two factors largely contributed to this. The first was much slower than expected collection of refunds of value-added and similar taxes, especially in India. The delays were driven primarily by the complexities of operating in multiple SAP and non-SAP systems around the world. The second factor was delayed collections in Pakistan and Indonesia for weather conditions impacted grower liquidity late in the fourth quarter.","Both factors are execution related and will reverse. We fully expect to collect this cash in 2020. In the absence of these two factors, our free cash flow for 2019 would have been solidly in our guidance range with free cash conversion of roughly 50% on higher than guided earnings. We know we have more to do to continue to improve free cash flow.","Moving to a single instance of SAP S\/4HANA this year will give us a different level of visibility across our entire business and will provide us with state-of-the-art tools to continue to drive improvement in working capital and cash flow.","Looking ahead to 2020, we're forecasting free cash flow of $425 million to $525 million with free cash conversion from adjusted earnings of 55% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. We continue to believe we can drive free cash conversion substantially higher over the coming two to three years as we finalize our SAP implementation, ending the period of high cash spending on transformation activity, and as we drive further improvement in working capital performance.","We repurchased over 4.7 million FMC shares in 2019 at an average price at $84.73. This included $100 million in repurchases completed in the fourth quarter for a total of $400 million of repurchases in the year.","Considering the $210 million paid in dividends, FMC returned over $600 million in cash to shareholders in 2019. We are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders consistent with our long range plan. Further evident to this commitment is the 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend announced in December.","We intend to purchase between $400 million and $500 million of FMC shares in 2020. In light of the seasonal working capital build in the first quarter and ongoing product line acquisition discussions, we do not expect to make any meaningful share repurchases in the first quarter, but fully intend to remain a regular purchaser of shares through the rest of the year.","Before turning the call over to Mark, let me also give a quick update on progress in implementing our new SAP S\/4HANA ERP system. We successfully closed full-year 2019 with roughly 20% of the Company on the new system and are already seeing many benefits.","Today, we are going alive across the acquired business, which represents roughly 40% of FMC. This will allow us to exit the Transition Services Agreement at the end of this month, delivering annual cost savings of $20 million, which were incorporated in our earnings guidance for 2020.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Douglas","Thank you, Andrew. Moving to Slide 10 and the review of our full-year 2020 and Q1 earnings outlook. We expect full-year adjusted earnings of $6.45 to $6.70 per diluted share, representing an 8% increase at the midpoint. This outlook for EPS does not include the impact of share repurchases in 2020.","Revenue is expected to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.95 billion, representing 6% growth at the midpoint and 7% organic growth compared to 2019. Total company adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion, reflecting 8% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.","Looking at the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.86, representing an increase of 5% at the midpoint versus Q1 2019 and assuming a share count of approximately $131 million.","We forecast Q1 revenue to be in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.27 billion, representing 5% growth at the midpoint compared to the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $346 million to $366 million, representing a 4% increase at the midpoint versus the prior year period.","Turning now to our 2020 EBITDA bridge on Slide 11. Our EBITDA growth is expected to be driven by volume gains and continued price increases. We should note that we are also expecting to invest about $40 million more on R&D in 2020. This increase is driven by our continued success in moving molecules into development from discovery in 2019.","Total R&D spend should be approximately 7% of sales versus 6.5% of sales in 2019 as we continue to expand and progress 22 new active ingredients and eight new biologicals towards commercialization. Tariffs will be higher in 2020 while raw material costs will not materially improve until the second half of 2020. We will realize about $20 million in annual savings as we exit the Transition Services Agreement this month.","Foreign exchange is also forecasted to be a headwind in 2020 as the U.S. dollar has further strengthened versus key currencies. However, if you exclude the incremental $40 million in R&D spend, our price increases will cover over 100% of the combined headwinds from cost and FX.","I would also like to highlight our revenue drivers. We forecast 2020 revenue growth of 6% overall and 7% organically. Volume is expected to contribute 5% to growth, including about 1.5% from new products launched in 2020 and pricing is expected to contribute 2% growth. These are slightly offset by a 1% headwind from foreign exchange.","One aspect of our portfolio management that we do not often highlight is the change in the makeup of our portfolio. As is the case every year, in 2020 we will have an adverse impact from lost registrations on molecules as well as decisions to exit some product lines. This typically represents a drag of about 2% of our revenues and yet in 2019, we still grew volume 8%. These portfolio impacts are factored into our long-term revenue growth targets.","Our long-term product strategy of investing in an increasingly sustainable product portfolio requires that we continually replace older chemistries with newer, more sustainable technologies. As part of this effort, as of the end of the year 2019, FMC has stopped selling all carbofuran formulations, including fewer than insecticide globally.","Moving to Slide 12 where we will provide the key drivers for EBITDA and revenue growth in the first quarter. First quarter performance will be driven by strong volume growth, including new product launches, which are expected to deliver about a third of our total revenue growth in the quarter. These launches include Authority Edge pre-emergent herbicide for soybeans in the U.S. and Battle Delta herbicide for cereals in Europe. Pricing actions are expected to fully offset the FX headwinds at the revenue level.","Shifting to the Global Crop Protection market. We project the total market will grow in the low-single digits in 2020 on a U.S. dollar basis with each region also growing by low-single digits. We forecast Asia will have the highest growth rate, assuming a partial rebound in Australia and more normalized weather conditions across the region.","In North America, growth is expected to come from recovery in acreage for row crops, offset by a higher than normal channel inventory levels heading into the year. In Latin America, growth in soybeans and corn are expected to lead the crop protection market in Brazil. In EMEA, growth will be driven by spring cereal herbicides following the challenging winter cereal seeding.","I will now turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you, Mark. Our Company's outperformance in 2019 was the result of a very flexible and agile supply chain, limiting the impact of raw material shortages in the delivery of market-driven technologies that offer exceptional value to growers around the world. We strongly believe that our investments in discovery and development pipeline will continue to fuel long-term growth for the company.","In 2020, we will continue to effectively navigate through unexpected challenges that arise such as weather or macroeconomic developments, and we will deliver on the financial targets we set out for you today. We believe 2020 will mark the third year in a row that FMC significantly outperforms the crop protection market in term of revenue growth and EBITDA margins.","We expect our outperformance will be driven by broad-based geographic growth, launches of new products and technologies and the continued expansion of diamide franchise as we gain more registration and labels as well as grow via commercial partnerships.","I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you very much for your attention.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","Hi, good morning. How are you?","Pierre Brondeau","Good morning.","Adam Samuelson","Hi. I was hoping to maybe to dig into the guidance details a little bit and just think through the cost side and you gave some color in the prepared remarks about investments in R&D and raw materials, but maybe just a little bit more color around the moving pieces there?","Andrew Sandifer","Sure, Adam. I think if you look at the full-year guidance, we see it many ways, the pattern similar to what we saw last year, but with a less pronounced headwind from costs and FX. On the cost side, you're exactly right. We are \u2013 we have called out. We're increasing our investment in R&D about $40 million year-on-year. So of that $61 million that you see in cost increase for the full-year on our bridge on Slide 11, about $40 million of that is cost increase from R&D spending.","If you remove that, we really do have \u2013 we start to see the benefit of the pricing actions we've taken over the past five quarters, where prices and mix ends up covering more than the cost and FX headwinds. I do think we did see continued higher raw material costs in tight conditions going into the second half of last year that as you know \u2013 as they flow through our inventory in the first half of this year, will continue to be a bit of a headwind, and the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against the number of our key currencies. So we do still have some FX headwinds.","I will note that those headwinds are particularly heavy in the first half. As we start looking towards the second half, we start seeing much more favorable comparisons on costs and lessening FX impacts.","Pierre Brondeau","On the volume front, to talk about growth, I'll jump in. But roughly three big buckets I would say are diamides. We do believe it's going to be broad-based, geographical growth and it's going to be in the low-teens. Think about the rest of our portfolio, non-diamide as in 2019 growing at about 5% and as in 2019, we believe the product we will be launching in 2020 will also bring about 2% growth rate.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. That's very helpful color. And then just quickly on the cash flow conversion guidance, the 55%. Apart from the continued investments in ERP and transformation, I mean, what else would it take to get to that medium term target of 70% as we think 2020 versus 2021 and 2022?","Pierre Brondeau","Yes. Let\u2019s do one thing. Let me just take a bit the trend from 2018 all the way through 2021 at a high level, and then maybe Andrew, you can go into more detail into the 2019, 2020 number. If you look back at 2018, we had a conversion rate of 18%. In 2019, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, which represent a conversion rate of 37%.","Now the $300 million normalized should have been $400 million. We had $100 million miss, purely execution. Got our eyes off the ball on a couple of issues, but the normalized number would have been around $400 million, which is about 50% conversion rate.","Looking into 2020. 2020, I would characterize as a year of bit along the same line as 2019. We believe we're going to benefit from higher EBITDA, about 8% growth. But from the cost standpoint, we were expecting about a year-ago to be able to finish SAP implementation in the first quarter of 2020.","But there is no way around it. It's a three-year program. It's going to cost $250 million. So we're going to have to go all the way to the end of 2020 with SAP implementation cost. So we're going to have the same transformational cost as we did in 2019. So we believe 2020 will be a conversion rate of about 55%.","Now moving to 2021 and that's when you still see, if we go along the line of a five-year plan, another 8% EBITDA increase. But that's when the SAP implementation transformation costs start to significantly lower and that's when, just through this effect, we expect to be around 70% cash conversion from adjusted earnings. So that's directionally how we're going to go from 37% in 2019 to about 70% in 2021.","Maybe Andrew, you want to talk a bit more about 2019 and 2020?","Andrew Sandifer","Sure. Let me talk \u2013 get a little more specific on that bridge from 2019 to 2020. I think as Pierre referenced, we have about $300 million in free cash flow in 2019. We're guiding an increase in EBITDA of about $100 million, but we'll also be increasing the spending on CapEx, about $10 million year-on-year. And our legacy and transformation costs increased about $20 million year-on-year.","So the combination of those factors are \u2013 leave you at about $370 million. The net impact of the reversal of the two factors we called out in the cash flow shortfall this quarter and the impact of change in working capital in 2020 are the rest of the difference to the rest of our guidance range. It gets you up in that $425 million to $575 million.","So it's important in that 2020 walk, as Pierre mentioned, we do not see a step down. We actually see a slight increase in legacy and transformation year-on-year, with about a $100 million to $125 million of that being really transformation activity and the remainder being legacy expenses that \u2013 basically transformation being flat to slightly down to prior year in total with legacy going up slightly.","So again, that next real big step in cash conversion, we get to a more normalized level this year for how we're operating on a working capital. And then in 2021, we see the step down from the end of the SAP program in the end of the transformation spend.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar","Rebates in North America. Is that mostly rebates to retailers based on volume, like a volume rebate or is that more of a competitive action? And in what products is that occurring? Thank you.","Pierre Brondeau","Yes, P.J., it just a normal \u2013 it's a normal process which happens. Every year we do the same thing. We have rebates, which are indexed on volume and that's a normal process. There was no specific change in the rates or anything of that kind. It was just a normal year.","The only difference looking at the weather condition and the pattern in North America, we ended up a bit stronger in the fourth quarter than we\u2019re expecting. So when we had to look at all of the reserves and rebates, we would have to pay.","We ended up having higher rebate to be paid to our customers for the full-year and to be done in the fourth quarter. So it\u2019s just \u2013 we got a little bit surprised by the strength of the market in the fourth quarter versus what we're expecting and that\u2019s because it's purely proportional to volume created a step up in rebates we're not expecting.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. So you've done a solid job of evolving the portfolio for both the geographic and crop perspective, which I guess is kind of the key to enabling you to outgrow CPC markets. However, you're still underweight fungicides and kind of overweight insecticides.","It seems like you're entering a lot of agreements regarding texturing and the diamides over the long-term, but how should we think about your total portfolio evolution as it pertains to further establishing your presence in fungicides? And is it a coincidence that you mentioned product line acquisition discussions in M&A? Thank you.","Mark Douglas","Yes, Chris, you're absolutely right. We are heavyweight in insecticides. I believe, we're the world's leader in insecticide. So we're not disappointed with that profile at all. However, you're right. We do want to increase our participation in fungicides.","And really we're doing that in three ways. First of all is our current portfolio, which is limited, but with very, very interesting products. We launched a new product this year or 2019, Lucento in North America. It's going extremely well.","To be frank, I think if we'd have had more capacity, we'd have been able to sell more. So there is the notion of selling what we have today. Second to that is what we have in our pipeline, when you think about our discovery and development pipeline. We currently have today five new fungicides in our pipeline, three of which have brand new modes of action not seen before.","So we know we have the long-term view, which is very strong from the fungicide perspective. Closer to home, we will be launching in 2021 a brand new fungicide called Fluindapyr. We'll be launching that around the world. That will also add to the growth rate as we go through sort of the second half of our plan.","And then third is how we acquire technologies or access to products around the world. We are under active discussions and in fact some of the agreements that we have in place today for the diamides allow us access to various fungicides in different markets. So we pursue in pretty much every avenue we know to really grow that fungicides as fast as possible. But it is a target for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly","Thanks. So Pierre, last quarter you talked about Cyazypyr and the pickup we saw there. Cyazypyr has been a sort of a slow and steady success since the DuPont days. Are you seeing that continue? And if it is, what does that say about the acceleration in demand coming this late into growth cycle?","Mark Douglas","Yes. Mark, you're right. Cyazypyr was launched later than Rynaxypyr. I would say it is somewhat more of a difficult sell. As we've got our hands around the products. We understand that it has some attributes when it comes to the performance that also has plant health benefits in terms of how a plant responds to Cyazypyr and how Cyazypyr removes the pests. We\u2019ve talked about the size of our business in diamides over 2019. It's about $1.6 billion business.","Cyazypyr is growing rapidly, much faster than Rynaxypyr and is in the $350 million to $400 million range going forward. So it's already become a significant molecule. We don't believe at this point that its growth profile is slowing down, certainly not in the near-term. So you can expect us to talk more about Cyazypyr and especially the growth rates as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning and congratulations Mark on being named CEO-elect.","Mark Douglas","Thank you.","Frank Mitsch","And likewise Pierre, Executive Chair. And I assume taking a little bit more time off, but congratulations to you both. Pierre, you mentioned that over the past six months you've been signing multiple new partnerships. And I'm just curious if you could kind of describe them in a little more detail. I mean, what products are these covering? Are these just covering the diamides geographic? Any more color that you could expand upon this? And then perhaps just give us a sense as to what size of your total revenues you think this may grow to over the next couple of years?","Pierre Brondeau","Yes, I'll ask Mark to jump in. The only thing, Frank, I want to say before Mark talk a little bit is, with most of these agreements, we do have secrecy agreement. So we are very limited to what we can say around volume, especially being in an early stage, it would be quite easy to understand who is doing what. And as we said in the script four are global agreement and 41 are local agreements, all of them are diamides agreements. Mark, you want to say a few things that they cover?","Mark Douglas","Yes. Frank, they cover both Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr. As Pierre said, we are under pretty tight confidentiality rules here, but suffice to say 11 different countries so far, all major crops and more importantly some crops and markets that we are not active in today with the diamides.","So think of it in terms of growth from a market access perspective in various countries around the world. And these are not products that are just straight Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr. They are mixtures and sophisticated formulations with active ingredients that we don't have access to.","So the fundamental purpose here is not only to defend our franchise and grow it over the next decade, but also to expand the pool of where we operate. Think about it this way. The insecticide market is about a $15 billion market. A lot of the older chemistries are going away. And we have about $1.6 billion worth of business with the diamides. We have plenty of room to grow here over the long haul and that is the purpose of what we're doing.","Pierre Brondeau","I think what Mark said is, at the end is very important. We do believe those partnerships are going to help us expanding the market penetration of Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr. Those two molecules are big, but we believe they are far from being at the end of their market penetration. So that's one of the way to do it to complainant all of the marketing and commercial activity FMC has directed.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with Exane. Please go ahead.","Laurent Favre","Yes. Good morning, all. I've got a question on the step up in R&D from 6.5% to 7% of sales. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about what's driving the increase? Is it the underline cost inflation against the existing plan? Is it spending more on discovery, I guess new actives? Is it changing scope on the formulations or is it just a bit of everything? Thank you.","Andrew Sandifer","Yes. Laurent, really the $40 million is targeted at two new active ingredients that we moved into development from discovery in 2019. So we now have that run rate cost of spending more money on what is really the most expensive part of the whole R&D cycle, which is development. That's where we spend a lot of money on toxicology, et cetera. So those products are now moving into a phase where for the next three, four, or five years, spending will be increased.","7% of revenue is not something that we see as a problem for us. We actually have phased our R&D so that we should be in that 7% range on an ongoing basis. You should expect to see that number change as we go through the years and the business continues to grow. We will be spending more on R&D as we continue to expand, not only the pipeline of synthetics, but biologicals as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrne","Yes. I was hoping you could comment on whether or not you're seeing any indications of some competitive pricing from any one of the following buckets. One being the inventory, the channel inventory levels Mark that you mentioned in North America being higher than normal, another potential one would be the big seed companies are increasingly bundling crop chems with their seed platforms, another one being increased ecommerce offerings, anything that you're seeing there that \u2013 if you could comment on those please?","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you. Listen, first of all, we should know it's a highly competitive market. There is lots of companies in this market who are competing, but at the end of the day, it is a market we are offering in technology matter.","So yes, there is competitive actions, but at the end of the day, if you price right the right technology, you can protect your margin. Maybe Mark, let's start the comments about seeds and the bundling and maybe talk about the meeting you and I we had last week with our customers.","Mark Douglas","Yes, sure. So let's put it in perspective. You're talking about seed bundling. You're really talking about major row crops in the Midwest of the U.S. And frankly, when you look at that as an overall component of our business, it's not the majority of our business by a long way. And even in the U.S., we have tremendous exposure outside of the Midwest. We don't see the bundling aspect as a competitive threat to us.","The meeting Pierre was referencing, Pierre and I and the whole of the North America commercial team, we were with 250 retailers and distribution companies in the U.S. last week. And we spent three or four days talking about the market. Where are we? What's our competitive offering? And I can tell you at no time did we hear that the combination of seeds and chemicals is a detriment to our growth. ","In fact, we had the opposite. We had the fact that our offerings are offering technology on anybody seeds. It doesn't matter who seeds you buy. Can be an independent, can be one of the big two or three. So for us, we see this as an extreme positive and so do our retailers and so do our distribution partners. So in that sense, no, I don't see the seeds. Combination has been an issue for us.","On the last bucket that you had Steve, on e-commerce, we actually see e-commerce is having a place in the marketplace. But frankly, we see it at the low end of the market. It's easy to sell a generic on price. It's not easy to sell a very sophisticated pre-emergent herbicide or a very sophisticated diamide insecticide online.","We don't participate in those forums. We will not participate in those forums. Our customers are the people that are offering the service levels down on the ground with the growers. So for us, we're not seeing anything impacting our overall North America business through e-commerce.","Pierre Brondeau","I want to repeat what Mark said because that is very critical and it is a strategic decision of FMC. We will not get into the seed business. We do not need to be in the seed business. When Mark talked about 200 customers, it is true. It was 200 to 250 customers. We spent most of the week. I can tell you that to a person, they told us that it's very critical to have a chemical and biological supplier who is agnostic to the type of seed and somebody has the right technology they can use with any type of seed.","Our customers are not big fans of bundling or being pushed to use a specific seed with a specific chemical. They need the freedom to choose and we provide that to them. So it is not something we are concerned about. We do believe \u2013 I would even go one step beyond. I think it's a competitive advantage for us to not be in seeds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Michael Sison","Hey, guys. Nice end to the year and congrats to you both.","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you, Mike.","Michael Sison","I think you mentioned the non-diamide business is expected to be up mid-single digits in 2020. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color where the growth coming from, new molecules, geographies, new registrations? I'm sure it's a little bit of all of the above, but just a little bit of help there. Thanks.","Mark Douglas","Yes. Mike, it is a little bit of all of the above. As Pierre indicated, our legacy portfolio we believe is growing in roughly the mid-single digits. I would say across the board, we're seeing the highest growth rates with the fungicide portfolio that we have, spent a lot of time on growing that around the world, mainly in North America.","Certainly the legacy insecticide portfolio is doing extremely well, especially in Latin America where we have some very, very good products that are going into the soy complex. And then we would come to the herbicides, where we see growth in both the U.S. with some pretty sophisticated pre-emergent formulations like Authority Edge that are replacing current technologies that are out there. We see growth in Argentina on pre-emergence, and we also see significant continued growth with herbicides in sugarcane in Brazil.","Moving over to Asia. India is a big market for us now and we're offering brand new herbicide formulations that have not been seen before in India, especially for sugarcane. We continue to grow our rice herbicide business in China. So all those pieces that come together, you can see, it's quite easy for us to get into that mid single-digit range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Donald Carson","Thank you. I want to go back to raw material costs, and your outlook for the year. Pierre, you mentioned that that higher cost last year will flow through inventory in the first half, but once you get through that as you get into the second half, do you see raw material costs coming down? And I know you've recast your supply chain, but is availability out of China a problem now that's perhaps grown with some of the recent shutdowns? Could that have a second half effect on the industry?","Pierre Brondeau","Yes. So first of all, let you start with the cost as we are forecasting in our guidance. You are correct. The cost is turning into the second half of the year into positive, which means that most of the adverse costs in our P&L is happening in the first half of the year with a disproportionate amount in the first quarter and then in the second quarter.","And then when we get into the second half that's when these costs are improving. From an availability standpoint, where are we today? As you can guess, the issues we had last year, which were due to environmental issues and industrial parks shutting down, those issues are over. I think we are not suffering from any issues there. The thing we're watching, of course, is the impact of Coronavirus.","There is no impact of Coronavirus on demand today, as we see it. It is much more an impact on logistics because of parts of the country, which are being isolated or roads which are being blocked or air freight. Today, we have not seen any negative impact on our ability to pay rate so far.","We had some issues where we had to find options to get raw materials from a different location, but all-in-all the issues we have been facing, we have been able to resolve them and operate normally.","That being said, as you can guess, it's a very dynamic situation. So we do have a team fully focused on that and only doing this day after day, which is watching the flux of raw materials from a place to another to make sure we do have what we need for our growth plan. But yes, it is something we are aware of and carefully watching, but so far so good.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Michael Harrison","Hi, good morning.","Mark Douglas","Good morning.","Michael Harrison","Looking at the one slide you have in there, 13% growth in the Latin American crop protection market in 2019 that seems like a lot. Were there really that many more planted acres or did we see increases in the number of applications? Was this trade benefits? Just wondering if you can help us understand the drivers of that very strong growth in the market itself and maybe get us more comfortable that we weren't just seeing a lot of inventory getting stuffed into the channel?","Mark Douglas","Yes. Mike, listen, I think it's a very good observation. I think most people \u2013 when we talk about 13% growth rate, most people put that straight towards Brazil. I think you've got to parcel it out somewhat in the sense that the other regions are growing. Mexico grew in the North and then obviously Argentina has been growing certainly for us, but the market was relatively, I would say, mid-single digits.","If you look at Brazil, surface area was planted, it was probably about a 3% increase overall with soy leading the way. We had a very good season on cotton, strong infestation, which obviously helped us, but also the market was up because of that. Cotton is a high usage of pesticides. I would say though that overall I think the market has more channel inventory in Brazil than the market would take. So I think some of that 13% is setting warehouses right now.","I'm going to be very frank and tell you that, we talk about this constantly on every call and our inventories are exactly where we want them to be, normal levels across Brazil for the rest of this season and then heading into the new season that comes in at the end of this year. But I do start to watch the channel inventories in Brazil. I think they are higher than normal.","Pierre Brondeau","And to compliment what Mark said, and the level of inventory in the channel of FMC products, just to remind what we said in the script, growth was not driven in the fourth quarter for FMC by Brazil. It was other parts of Latin America and a big driver was Argentina. So that is part of the process we have in place to make sure that in Brazil we control channel inventory.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Mark, a question for you on insecticides as it relates to some of the regulatory dynamics. With regard to chlorpyrifos, we understand that that chemistry is being phased out in California and Europe. And so my question is whether FMC foresees any opportunity to gain share via substitute chemistry, such as pyrethroids or otherwise?","And then second, you mentioned the carbofuran exit. Just wondering if you could address that in terms of opportunity to backfill there, what options you may have in the portfolio? Thank you.","Mark Douglas","Yes. Thanks Kevin. Yes, chlorpyrifos is a molecule that is, as you said being removed in California. We have very limited sales of chlorpyrifos around the world and we have exited basically all of that business. So for us, we see it as more of an opportunity and you're right. Pyrethroids, especially our bifenthrin mixtures will be targeting those markets. So we'll be looking to grow that.","And then on carbofuran \u2013 yes, we do see opportunities for our portfolio to replace what we already have. And obviously if we were planning to exit, we had plans to replace and those plans will be rolled out in Mexico and parts of Asia, Indonesia in particular where we will be replacing our own products with some of the newer technologies.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson","Hi, good morning. You did a good job of bridging free cash flow conversion in major buckets in the next couple of years. I just wanted to focus on the 2019 versus 2020 free cash flow conversion. If looking at the roughly $100 million or 12% conversion that is expected in 2020 instead of 2019, it looks like normalized everything, 2020 free cash flow conversion is actually less than 2019 conversion. Is that right? And maybe you could just specifically walk through some of this, but specifically walk through exactly the difference between 2019 and 2020, if that's true. Thanks.","Andrew Sandifer","Yes. Joel, I think the free cash flow conversion on a like-for-like is pretty consistent between the two years. What you've got are some puts and takes. We have higher capital additions and higher legacy and transformation spending in 2020 than we did in 2019 to the tune of about $30 million combined.","We do see increased cash from operations. Part of that is the recapture of the delayed collections that we saw at the end of Q4. And we also have to acknowledge we're growing the topline, roughly $300 million, $350 million at the guidance point and generating $100 million of EBITDA. It does take some working capital to continue to grow the business.","When you think through that walk again, if we take $300 million in free cash flow in 2019, $100 million growth in EBITDA, $30 million headwind from higher legacy and transformation and capital spending, that gets you within $100 million of our guidance point.","That $100 million is the rebound \u2013 the reversal of the Q4 factors we've talked about and a very minimal change in working capital beyond that \u2013 very minimal use of working capital beyond that. So it does imply continuing improvements and working capital efficiency. And that's a part of our continued drive to derive and not just waiting for the step down, the transformation spending, but to continue to drive down the working capital use in the business.","Michael Wherley","That's all the time we have for the call today. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","And this concludes the FMC Corporation conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Sandifer, Vice President, Strategic Development and Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Sandifer, sir, you may begin.","Andrew D. Sandifer","Great. Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and welcome to FMC's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call and Webcast. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind everyone that our discussion today will include certain statements that are forward-looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors that are summarized in FMC's 2012 Form 10-K, our most recent Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. This information represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Our discussion today will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. Under the heading entitled Glossary of Financial Terms on our website available at www.fmc.com, you will find the definition of adjusted earnings and certain other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's conference call. Also on our website, we've posted our current 2013 outlook statement, which provides our guidance for the full year and third quarter 2013 and a reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP figures we will use today.","We'll begin today's call with Pierre reviewing second quarter performance, followed by Paul who will provide an update on the company's financial position. Pierre will then describe our outlook for the year and provide a midyear update on our progress in delivering our Vision 2015 strategic plan. Finally, we'll be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President, FMC Minerals; and Mike Smith, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition, to address your questions.","I'll now turn it over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release last night, we have a lot to discuss today. Let me start with the company's performance in the second quarter.","Total company sales of $959 million increased $54 million or 6% versus last year, led by a strong performance in our Agricultural Solutions and Health and Nutrition segments. Regionally, sales were up 16% in Latin America; 7% in North America; 6% in Asia; and EMEA was down 7%. Gross margin remained flat to last year at $343 million. SG&A and R&D expenses of $155 million were up 5% versus last year. Our adjusted operating profit of $188 million was down 3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings of $129 million or $0.94 per diluted share were up 2% versus the year-ago quarter.","Turning now to segment performance. In Agricultural Solutions, sales grew 12% in the quarter versus a year ago to $443 million, with strong demand in all major geographies except EMEA. In Latin America, we saw volume growth in the cotton segments in Brazil, driven by the expected planted area expansion and increased herbicide and insecticide demand in soybeans. Favorable market conditions, coupled with new product introductions, provide strong performance indicators for the 2013, 2014 crop year. In North America, continued healthy demand for pre-emergent product led to additional volume gains in the quarter. Sales in Asia increased versus last year, driven by volume growth, the result of our direct market access initiatives in several countries. In EMEA, demand was tempered by unfavorable weather that reduced past pressures.","Second quarter segment earnings for Agricultural Solutions of $125 million increased 11% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by higher volumes and targeted price increase. In Health and Nutrition, sales grew 9% in the quarter to $119 million, driven by price momentum from new technologies, volume growth in all regions, fueled by strong growth in our MCC product line and acquisitions. Our Food business saw robust demand growth in key Asian markets. In our Pharmaceutical business, higher demand led to market share gains with increased sales volume. And last week, we announced the acquisition of Epax, an omega-3 producer. This is a business that will be a very good fit with our food, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals product line. We are very excited by the prospects of this business, which I'll discuss in greater detail later in the call.","Second quarter segment earnings were $44 million. As you would expect, we incurred higher than normal acquisition cost in the quarter and we continued to incur cost in the implementation of our Manufacturing Excellence program. Including those expenses, Health and Nutrition segment earnings were up mid-single-digit percent, demonstrating the strength of our existing franchise as we are -- as we invest to broaden our portfolio and increase MCC capacity.","Turning to FMC Minerals. Second quarter segment revenues decreased 2% to $244 million due to lower soda ash export prices and lower Lithium volumes, partially offset by higher soda ash volumes. Segment earnings for the quarter were $35 million, 21% lower than the previous year. There were a number of elements that influenced this performance. Let me comment on a few of the primary drivers.","Beginning with Alkali Chemicals, revenue was $194 million, up 3% over the second quarter 2012, even though overall average soda ash pricing was down in the low double-digit dollars per ton versus last year, demonstrating the volume benefit from our Manufacturing Excellence programs. The year began with uncertainty around pricing in export markets, mainly in Asia. We expected soda ash prices in Asia to be at the bottom of the pricing cycle in the first quarter. From there, we anticipated sequential improvements each quarter. For the most part, this is a trend that's playing out for the year. However, the pace of recovery has been slower than we had originally anticipated. So in the second quarter, despite double-digit dollars per ton improvement in overall export prices, the movement in Asian export prices was less than we had expected. As a result, Alkali revenue and earnings were negatively impacted versus the second quarter of 2012. I'd say we are encouraged by ANSAC's price increase, and we believe sequential improvements will continue. At the same time, our pricing and volumes in North America remained steady.","Moving to Lithium. Revenues were $51 million, down 16% versus the second quarter 2012. During the quarter, volumes were down versus the previous year. However, we continued to successfully implement the production process changes needed to improve reliability and provide the foundation for the full expansion realization. We had an abbreviated shutdown, during which we upgraded our pre-operation pounds. Despite these outages, we produced at a flat rate in Q2 versus Q1 and are now seeing improved operating consistency in yields. In the third quarter, we will use the scheduled annual planned shutdown to make additional engineering upgrades. We are confident that these are the final changes needed to reach sustainable full operating rates. Starting in September, we expect daily production rates that will achieve our targets. Of course, we continue to pursue Manufacturing Excellence initiative in Lithium to improve our cost position and offset headwinds related to operating in Argentina.","In the Peroxygens segment, during the second quarter, we took a planned maintenance outage. This contributed to quarterly revenues of $84 million, down 5% versus 2012, and segment earnings of $4 million, down 49% over last year. In a few moments, Paul will summarize the status of a divestiture process and our decision to reclassify these segments to discontinued operations.","In summary, our businesses performed largely as expected. Agricultural Solutions' unique business model continues to outperform the market. Health and Nutrition's solid growing base business will be enhanced in the fast-growing nutraceutical market. And in Minerals, we delivered improvements in Lithium, and we are encouraged by sequential improvements in export soda ash pricing.","Let me now turn the call over to Paul for a discussion on our financial position and an update on our M&A activities. Paul?","Paul W. Graves","Thanks, Pierre. Today, I will review cash generated from operations, capital deployment, including our plans to return cash to shareholders. I'll touch upon our tax rate, and I'll update you on our M&A activities, particularly the Peroxygens divestiture process.","Let me start by providing what I hope are some clarifying comments on the impact of reclassified Peroxygens to discontinued operations. Our divestiture process is well underway, and we're pleased with the interest level for the business. We remain on track to conclude a transaction before the end of the year. Given this, we concluded that we met the tests for moving the segment to discontinued operations. This reclassification will impact our reported results starting in the third quarter. To be very clear, the second quarter results include Peroxygens results.","Now looking forward to the rest of the year, our third quarter results will exclude Peroxygens results for all of 2013, not just for the third and fourth quarters. In addition, the reclassification will result in changes to some of the specific line items that we have traditionally provided full year guidance for, such as operating cash flow, depreciation and amortization and capital spending targets. In light of this, we will no longer include Peroxygens in our guidance statements. All guidance we are giving today and going forward excludes Peroxygens.","So having hopefully cleared that up, let me now turn my comments to some specific items in the second quarter and for the rest of the year. Cash generated from operations for the 6 months in 2013 was $245 million. For the full year, we had previously indicated a target of $650 million of operating cash flow. The reclassification of Peroxygens to discontinued operations, combined with the lower earnings expectations in Alkali, means that the reported cash from operations for the full year is now likely to be closer to $600 million.","Turning to capital deployment. Capital additions in the second quarter, including those reported in the other investing activities line, were $53 million. Year-to-date, they were $81 million. A significant proportion of spending to date has been on the construction of a new MCC plant in Thailand and to support expansion in our agricultural manufacturing network. These will continue to be the largest items in our capital spending for the rest of the year.","Now onto share repurchases. Given our increased confidence in a successful divestiture of the Peroxygens business, we have made the decision to return a portion of the expected proceeds to shareholders, as we have previously communicated. To achieve this, we have entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for approximately $250 million of our shares. An initial delivery of shares will begin shortly, with the program targeted for completion by year-end.","Now onto M&A activities. During the second quarter, we made the final payment on our repurchase of the FMC Wyoming minority interest. We did not make any other acquisitions or divestitures in the quarter. You saw in our announcement last week that we completed the acquisition of Epax for approximately $345 million in July, which implies an enterprise value to EBITDA multiple which is in line with our current trading multiple. You should expect to see the impact of this acquisition and of the share repurchase on our net debt position in the third quarter. We expect that this acquisition will be immediately accretive to EPS and is included in our updated full year guidance numbers.","And finally, our tax rate. Our adjusted consolidated tax rate for the quarter was 24.8%. Although there were many contributing factors, the lower tax rate in the quarter reflects the trend we are seeing as we earn a higher proportion of our profits and lower tax jurisdictions compared to in the past. Although the impact of this can vary from quarter-to-quarter, this trend gives us comfort in lowering our guidance for tax rates for full year 2013 by 150 basis points to 26%.","Let me finish with some comments on our updated guidance for the full year. We recognize that there are many moving parts, so let me conclude by summarizing how they have impacted our guidance for the year. Our previous guidance range had a midpoint of $4 per diluted share, and our revised guidance is $0.20 lower than this, at a midpoint of $3.80 per diluted share. The operating profit reduction due to the reclassification of Peroxygens accounts for around $0.15 to $0.20 per share. The slower pace of recovery in pricing in Alkali export markets accounts for a further $0.10 to $0.15 per share. The combined benefit over the final 5 months of the year of Epax and the $250 million share repurchase program are in the range of $0.07 to $0.12 per share. Lower tax rates are offset by higher corporate costs, which is largely due to an initiative to reorganize our finance function to be more closely aligned with FMC's growth plans.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Paul. Let me now share with you our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2013.","For the third quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.75 to $0.85 per diluted share, a 5% increase versus the third quarter of 2012 at the midpoint of the range. Agricultural Solutions earnings will be up in the low teens percent, reflecting a continuation of our first half momentum and propelled by a strong start to the Latin America season. In Health and Nutrition, continued strength in our core businesses, offset by a residual M&A cost, will increase segment earnings in the low single-digit percent. And in Minerals, we anticipate sequential improvement in Asia soda ash export prices and improved Lithium margin. However, the slower pace of export soda ash pricing recovery will decrease segment earnings by low teens percent versus third quarter 2012.","Now for the full year. We believe our 2013 adjusted earnings will not accurately reflect FMC's earnings potential going into 2014 since they are temporarily depressed by the shift of Peroxygens out of our adjusted earnings outlook with only part-year benefits from Epax and share repurchase. We expect full year adjusted earnings to be between $3.72 and $3.87 per diluted share, as we take a prudent approach to expectations of the pace of soda ash pricing recovery in export growth markets.","We expect a strong finish in Agricultural Solutions based on early season indications of continued strong market condition and share gains in Latin America. Brazil cotton acres are expected to increase, and we're expanding our presence in Latin America soybeans, which are also forecasted to see increased acreage. New products will deliver volume gains globally, and demand for resistance management products in North America will drive segment earnings in the mid to high teens percent over 2012.","In Health and Nutrition, we expect segment earnings to increase in the low teens percent, driven by continued growth in our traditional market segments and partial benefit from our Epax acquisition. This will be partially offset by acquisition-related and Manufacturing Excellence costs. We anticipate Minerals earnings to be down about 20% for the year, although we expect recovery in both businesses, with improvements in operating profit in the second half. By the fourth quarter, we expect improved Lithium operating margin to be sustained into 2014. In Alkali Chemicals, although we cannot be certain of the exact timing, we anticipate quarterly sequential increases in Asia export pricing will translate into year-on-year improvement by the fourth quarter. Our North American markets will realize a low- to mid-single-digit dollar per ton increase in pricing versus the prior year. And successful implementation of Manufacturing Excellence program will continue to deliver additional production volumes.","Let me give you now an update on our Vision 2015. Since we launched our Vision 2015 plan, we have provided updates twice per year. Let me now describe where we stand at midyear 2013. To begin, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2015, with expectation to deliver $5 billion in revenues; $1.2 billion in EBIT; and adjusted EPS between $5.75 and $6.25 per diluted share. We have made significant progress on our goals of strengthening FMC's core business. In Agricultural Solutions, we continue to outpace market growth through our unique business model. 2013 will be our 10th consecutive year of record earnings. Our Agricultural Solutions business is fueled by organic growth and supplemented by additional investments in product line and geographic expansions where we bring value to the market.","In Health and Nutrition, our broadened portfolio will accelerate segment's earning growth. We are expecting executing our excellent growth strategy, and the Epax acquisition underscores our resolve to broaden the scope of this segment. This transaction expands our presence in the $21 billion nutraceutical industry and gives us a leading platform in the fast-growing omega-3 market. Epax is a leading manufacturer of high purity, high concentration segment of the omega-3 market and uses proprietary purification and concentration processes to produce high purity premium grade omega-3 fatty acid. These products are used in dietary supplements, pharmaceutical and food applications. We will use our global footprint to sell this premium functional ingredient to new and existing customers for their end-use applications.","We have targeted the omega-3 segment for many reasons, including the depth of scientific data supporting its health benefits and the high projected growth rate of 12% to 15% per year. It is a natural fit in our Health and Nutrition segment, sharing a number of key business characteristics. Omega-3 starts from natural sources derived from marine-based traceable raw materials from one of the world's most sustainably managed fisheries. Working with these natural raw materials requires the ability to manage a long and complex supply chain, something we are very familiar with at FMC. We are very excited about this important addition to our portfolio and the new business opportunity ahead of us.","Another complement of our Vision 2015 plan is to capture value of common ownership across FMC. In the past, I've talked about a procurement transformation and the benefits of Manufacturing Excellence, both of these programs remain firmly on track. In procurement, we now expect to exceed our original procurement target and save over $120 million by 2015. And we are already realizing the benefit from Manufacturing Excellence, which was launched early this year. Incremental volumes and lower production costs, as a result of Manufacturing Excellence in the Alkali operation, have given us the confidence to roll out similar programs in Lithium and Health and Nutrition.","Let me conclude this discussion about our Vision 2015 progress by walking you through steps we've taken this year and how they add up over the next 2 years. Earlier, I said that 2013 earnings were temporarily depressed as we lose the full year contribution of Peroxygens. The share repurchases that we complete in the third quarter will help mitigate the impact to EPS, but for 2013, it will only provide a partial year of benefit. The acquisition of Epax also helps to replace lost operating profit. But again, we will only get 5 months of benefit from this additional business.","So as we head into 2014, we are expecting tailwinds from: first of all, full year impact of $360 million in share repurchase, plus an additional $100 million to $150 million of share repurchases in the year; full year operating profits from Epax; full year improved Lithium operating margins; continued soda ash export pricing recovery; and benefit of Manufacturing Excellence initiative in 2013. All of this, supported by accelerating growth in our Agricultural Solutions and Health and Nutrition segments. For 2014, we anticipate that the combination of these factors could deliver between $0.80 and $1.20 of incremental EPS.","Moving now from 2014 to 2015. Accelerated performance will be driven by further realization of benefit from acquisitions in Health and Nutrition and continued portfolio expansion in Agricultural Solutions. Our new Thailand MCC plant expected to come online at the end of 2014 will deliver additional volume growth for the expanding Asian markets in Health and Nutrition. We will reach over $120 million in procurement savings and achieve the structure of steady-state Manufacturing Excellence improvements across the company. And we expect continued impact from share repurchases complemented by additional $100 million to $115 million of share repurchases in 2015. We expect that all of these initiatives when factored together will lead to another $1 to $1.20 in incremental EPS over 2014. As you can see, we remain very confident in our roadmap and our ability to reach our Vision 2015.","Now with this, I will turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Pierre, with regard to the Ag business, I know there's some concern around pricing in general and what that might have in regard to impact on your volume, so can you walk us through how you think about soft commodity pricing and how that drives your Ag business in terms of volumes one way or the other?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. And I'll ask -- let me say a few words. I'll ask Mark to add. But generally speaking, what we see today as fluctuations of pricing of commodities didn't have yet and we are not forecasting any significant impact. The range within which we see the variation are such that it is not likely to have an impact on protecting crops and improving yield. Additionally, some of the biggest fluctuations have been in corn, which, as you know, is not one of our largest markets. So 2 things. First, I think the variations in price are not such and not forecasted to be such that it will impact our crop protection chemicals, plus our mix in portfolio is less impacted than other companies which are much heavier in the corn market. I don't know, Mark, if you have any additional comment?","Mark A. Douglas","I think the only thing I would say is, John, that the fact that we have such a diverse portfolio across many different crops, when you look at where a lot of the commodities are today and even the forward curves, the prices are still considerably higher than they have been over the last 5 to 10 years. That bodes well for us. Obviously, yields are important as well. And given the types of weather conditions we've had across the world, there are no guarantees of where those yields are going to come out. So we're pretty confident that the numbers we're seeing in the forward curves dictate that there'll still be a lot of activity on the crop protection chemical market.","Pierre R. Brondeau","We continue to have a strategy of intentional fragmentation, and I think it plays quite well for us when there is fluctuation in prices of certain commodities.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just as a follow-up, the Epax platform, can you walk us through how to think about what the accretion might be for 2014 as part of the color and guidance that you've just given?","Paul W. Graves","Sure, happy to do that. Clearly, this is a business that is going to replace a significant chunk of the Peroxygens operating profit in '14 and '15. And certainly, by the time we get through the 2015 process, we would expect that really the entirety of the lost Peroxygens operating profit will be replaced by operating profit in this business. So very quickly, it gets us to operating profit neutrality. In terms of the cost of financing of this acquisition, it was a cash acquisition. We have a -- it's an interesting dynamic as to financing today. We have a bank and a long-term cost of financing that's in the 3.5% to 4% range. And also have a recently launched commercial paper program, which, as you know, short-term rates are extremely low. So we certainly are getting a benefit from the lower financing rates, and certainly, in the short-term, we will be funding this acquisition, along with the commercial paper. I would take probably that 3.5% to 4% range, though, as the more appropriate long-term cost of interest for which to calculate the EPS accretion in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Pierre, you affirmed your Vision 2015 EPS range of $5.75 to $6.25. Based on where you're guiding this year, it looks to be a 2-year compounded growth rate of 24% to 27% there, so I guess a few questions. One, could you assess your level of confidence you'll be able to get there? Also, how much would be achieved operationally versus financial levers? And in particular, do you think you need to do additional acquisitions beyond the Epax deal in order to get there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","So Kevin, thanks for your question. Let me try to -- I gave you 2 numbers. Let's look first historical performance versus going forward. Roughly, if you take into account the share split we went in the last 4 years from about slightly over $2 per share, so -- to close to $4 per share, $3.80. And if you remove Peroxygens on the both end, we doubled in 4 years the earnings per share. So what we have to do in 2 years, which is increasing by 50%, is about in line with the average growth rate we had over the last 4 years. I have to say that we do feel pretty confident in where we are. I think we have the company today where we want it to be. We have finally, at this point, the right structure with the focus on the segment where we are advantaged, the right portfolio and 3 very solid business models. So if you go into 2015, let me give you the high level bridge to get to this $5.75 to $6.25. Think about Ag Solutions, we've been growing earnings over the last 4 years close to 20 -- operating earnings, close to 20% per year. Today, if you look at our portfolio, the new technology which are coming on the pipeline, the strength in Brazil, we do not see any reason for a slowdown in the growth rates in Ag Solutions. So when you look at the operating earnings of Ag chemical, which are north of $500 million, and you apply the 20%, that gives you an idea of impact on earnings per share. If you look at Health and Nutrition, we believe we're going start to see the momentum in 2014 increasing in terms of earnings growth. Today, we've not been able to leverage. We did in 3 and 4 years ago, but that's 2 years we've been investing a lot in R&D, in acquisition, in integration for this business, so we've not been able to translate the top line growth into earning growth. But if you think about new plant coming on stream, the new portfolio, we do believe we're going to start to see the core business growing in the low teens. And you add to that the comment made by Paul about Epax adding in operating earnings, what we will be losing from Peroxygens. Think about Minerals now, the third segment. And once again, we have uncertainty around the timing, but just to frame the numbers. There is, today, a gap of about $40 per share in between the North American pricing and the export pricing. Think about the fact that every $10 of price increase represent about $20 million of EBIT. So that gives you a sense of the potential of EBIT growth in this business. If we go back to an historical situation, which should be the case, there is no reason for that to be different where export pricing are in line with domestic pricing. We don't know when and how, but potentially, you do have this $80 million to $90 million of EBIT in price balance between Asia and North America in terms of increase. So if you take those calculations and just total that and then add to this that we're going to have 2, most likely 2 positive impacts, we believe tax rate going forward will be lower, stock buyback will impact and we'll have higher interest, you very quickly get into this range of $2 of EPS growth.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's really helpful, I appreciate that run down. If I may summarize, Pierre, would it be fair to say that you don't believe you need to use the balance sheet incrementally to achieve your 2015 targets beyond the share repurchases that you've already outlined in your release last night?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No, we don't. We will most likely -- if we do further acquisition, what would guiding us will be making acquisition of the type of the one we did in Epax because from a product portfolio, it fits very well our growth. But impact will be seen mostly beyond 2015. So it's going to be much more acquisition done to improve and keep on growing our portfolio rather than being used to meet our 2015 targets.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then a quick follow-up question, if I may, for Paul on the accelerated share repurchase. I think in your release, you indicated approximately 3.2 million shares by the end of this month. Can you help us understand how that will flow through your share count? I think in some other cases across the sector, there's less than 100% immediate realization with a subsequent true-up. Is that the case here as well?","Paul W. Graves","It is, it is. We had delivered about 80% of the expected shares on day 1, so that's the number that we've referenced, and obviously we'll -- the counterparty, the bank that we've engaged with to do this has flexibility as to the timing and the pace of which they make the repurchases. And so once -- and they have the time limit on it, which means they have to get it done before the end of the year. So they will come back at the end of the repurchase program and tell us exactly how many shares they repurchased, and we will either have slightly more or slightly less shares repurchased. We may have a slightly different total cash payment around that $250 million, but we'll know the final 20% once the program is completed.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So the 3.2 million is net of the 20% haircut?","Paul W. Graves","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, how should we think about the cash flow bridge over the next 2 years? Any kind of puts and takes?","Paul W. Graves","Operating cash from the businesses, I think, historical cash generation patterns, we don't expect to particularly change in any of our businesses. Clearly, the sensitivities we have are around working capital, clearly, in our Agricultural business. And as I've said many times before, the faster and the more we grow in that business, the greater the demand it makes upon us for investing in working capital. We'll continue to do that. So that's clearly going to be a factor, as it always has been. And I think Health and Nutrition has been a relatively static and standard working capital draw on the business, too, so I don't expect that to change meaningfully in the future. And we don't expect the Epax acquisition to make a big change to it. The Minerals segment clearly has upside from where we sit today, with profitability lower in both the soda ash and the Lithium businesses. Clearly, as profitability feeds through in that business, it does feed straight through to the bottom line. In terms of capital spending, we expect and clearly we're in a little bit of flux with Peroxygens moving out and Epax and others coming in, but generally speaking, we'd expect to continue to spend in the $350 million range of capital spending through that period as well. The one thing that you will see as well is our cash taxes will be slightly higher going forward. We've tended to use up most of our offsets in the U.S., so our cash taxes will be a little higher. We've obviously factored that into our guidance for '13, and we'll continue to factor it in going forward.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just an update, I guess, what should we think for a time frame in terms of Minerals results sort of normalizing to that level you spoke to earlier?","Pierre R. Brondeau","We are being very, very prudent today. Let me tell you the facts we are seeing. I would be completely candid here and tell you that we still have some difficulties to translate the facts we are seeing with the timing of the recovery. We have no doubt that the pricing is turning around. We've seen sequential improvements over the last couple of quarters, and we are forecasting sequential improvements, especially in Asia, going in the next 2 quarters. It's more difficult to see when we'll go to a more normalized situation. We've decided to be prudent in this forecast and not to plan to go back to a normalized situation in 2013, believing it will happen in early 2014, but we have not precisely defined that. What are we seeing? First of all, you've heard Solvay has been shutting down facilities which were non-economical in Europe, as well as shutdown of capacity in Australia. We also are seeing now significant shutdowns taking place in China, other shutdowns which are extended from maintenance plant or of a less economical plant. So we are seeing today a situation where the demand and the supply directionally are starting to tighten. We believe Chinese producers are still selling below their cash costs, but we believe they are starting to retract from exports. So all the facts today are pointing toward a situation which would be going back to normal, but the speed at which we're going to go back normal will also be impacted by the speed at which the key market for soda ash appreciation will be growing in China and in Asia, and we see there some question marks. So today, more by being prudent than by great science, we have decided to be careful for the next 6 months as we don't see exactly the timing and believe it will be happening at this stage some time beginning of 2014, but we have not precisely defined when.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that last question, so at this point, from a demand perspective in Asia, you're unclear as to when we will see a rebound in demand to push the soda ash price back to normal levels, but sometime in the next 6 months is when you think that we will see that?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. Yes, that's correct, Frank. We believe sometime in the next 6 months, 9 months is when we will see the demand picking up as much as the demand picking up is with the growth, the supply\/demand being balanced. So it's a blend of demand, together with a capacity shutdown. And the 2 together should bring an equilibrium situation where we would rebalance back to more of an historical level. So 6 to 9 months would be something I would say is within the range.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, terrific. And then sticking with the Minerals space, I believe you'd mentioned that you expect, in Q4, your Lithium margins to get back to normal levels. What are you seeing there? What gives you the confidence that you will see that pickup on the Lithium margins side?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, we do. We -- the key reason is our ability now to run the plants. We had multiple weeks where we have been able to run the plants and to run the separation column at the higher capacity. Remember before the days when we started to make an expansion, we are producing at a daily rate of about 9.5 tons per day, and today, we are around the 12 tons per day production rate. And we've been able to do that on a very regular basis for a long period of time. So we're going to use the shutdown during the month of August to do the final engineering changes. And the plant should be up and running toward the end of August, definitely, 1st week of September, and produce for the next 4 months at full capacity. We have all of the evidence. We do -- I do receive personally 2 weekly reports on the status, and we feel very strong about the fact that we have the technical solutions and the engineering to run the plant at full capacity starting September 1.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of Ag products, you gave us an update on cotton and soybean. Any thoughts on sugarcane as it relates to Brazil, as well as some of the other major crops in terms of growth for the rest of the year? I think rice and fruits and vegetables are -- tend to be pretty important for you.","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Mike, it's Mark here. We are seeing increasing sugar production down in Brazil. We're looking at probably a 5% increase in total acres. Weather is wet right now, so the planting season is getting extended, which is good news for us. So you can expect to see sugar grow. Soybean, we expect to be in the 5% range as well in terms of expanded acres. But the good news there is we're expanding our presence. It's not just acreage for us, it's putting fungicides into soybeans, more insecticides, so we're taking share in those segments as well. So we get the double advantage of both market share gains and acreage. Cotton, we expect to see the biggest increase, probably roundabout 20%. There was a significant decrease last year, if you remember, and now, it's bouncing back quite strongly down in Brazil, and that's good news for us given our position. So we are seeing significant expansions in Brazil.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then did you -- I think last time, you gave us sort of direction of where the export pricing was. It was up $30 was the announcement. Were there any more increases announced for ANSAC soda ash?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No. We only announced the $30 increase a while ago, and that's what we are currently implementing.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And if that is implemented then, the outlook that you have for that business is what you're looking for?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Correct, correct.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one last one on -- it looks like the Epax acquisition can be a nice -- very nice addition. Are there a lot of these type of companies with this type of technology and products that are out there that you can buy going forward?","Pierre R. Brondeau","We have a -- I'd say we -- now that we have broadened the way we want to participate into this market, we do believe there is a healthy pipeline of companies of that type, or smaller or slightly bigger or divisions of companies. So we are doing our homework now. That being said, you know the way FMC operates. We're going to first digest this one, successfully integrate it before we look forward for the next one. And we're going to keep moving forward in acquisition, but avoid to run 2 or 3 at the same time. But yes, there is a healthy pipeline of opportunities which fit quite well our portfolio. And I would say, it's a nice range for me of cost versus sales, which is bringing as well as the speed of accretion. I think that's the kind of acquisition we would like to make.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Looking at the pectins and BioColors businesses, I believe that your plan was to purchase a regional player with good technology and then build out the platform more or less organically across the rest of the globe. Can you give us an update as to where you are in that process on pectins and BioColors? And then does the Epax business with omega-3s also kind of follow a similar strategy, or was that more global to begin with?","Pierre R. Brondeau","All right, that's a good question. So let me start with BioColors. BioColors, we actually bought 2 regional players, 1 in Latin America and 1 in England. Those 2 companies together give us the base manufacturing and technology we need at this stage to grow in this market. What we are doing at this stage and what the Health and Nutrition organization is doing is creating plants, smaller plants, dilution plants which will be positioned in the key markets, and we currently have in place the capital investment. So we're going to be building expansion in North America and in Asia to be able to supply these markets from the businesses we've bought. So we are following the plan as we announced it, which is using the 2 acquisitions we have made, supplemented by capital expansions, which have been approved now, and moving forward to expand into other regions with dilution plant. So this one is well on its way, and most of the spending will be done through capital spending. Pectin is much earlier. We are still at a stage where we are operating the plants in Sicily. We are learning the process. We are also developing new product, new technology to try to penetrate the high-end pectin market. So I would say versus natural colors, we are at a much earlier stage. I think we're going to have to decide how and when we'll expand. These plants by itself will not allow us to make -- to be a major player in pectin, we will have to expand with another sizable plant, that decision has not been made. I think we still are in the early phase of our development in the pectin business. Omega-3 is quite different. By buying Epax, we do buy 2 plants which have significant capacity possibilities. And we are going to be leveraging our sales organization to promote further those products. So here, it's a much bigger play already. It's bigger than pectin, it's bigger than natural colors together with the possibility of leverage the 2 plants we have acquired for the acquisition of Epax through our current sales force.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And then as we think about the cost structure in the soda ash business, what kind of benefits have we seen already from the Manufacturing Excellence program there? And can we also get an update on the timing of the longwall move? Is that something that's going to hit the fourth quarter?","Edward T. Flynn","Yes, Mike, this is Ed Flynn. I'll take the second question first. Right now, it appears that the longwall move is going to happen in the beginning of October, so that will be a fourth quarter event. And in terms of the price structure, we've only completed the pilot in Green River on Manufacturing Excellence on our largest plant, our model plant, but we have seen significant throughput benefits and increases on stream time, which lead to certainly greater efficiency. And so we have decided to roll the program out through the rest of Green River in 2013 and 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investment.","Peter Butler","Pierre, you're a really very conservative guy, so you must be really confident in the internal outlook at FMC to sort of encourage Wall Street analysts to scratch out their old First Call numbers and write in much bigger numbers.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Peter, I -- let's talk about 2015 in terms of my confidence in where the company is going. I know that the confidence is today for '14 and '15 is below our target number. But I tell you, I like where we are today. I like where the company is positioned. I believe we have a very well-structured company. We're much better than where we were at the beginning of the year. I believe we're going to have significant tailwind getting into 2014. And if I look at the numbers we are capable of delivering in a period where we have not only challenges but where we have the major decision, which was not obvious if you look at the EPS impact to remove Peroxygens, we're still delivering very strong results. And almost every single business is going to get into 2014, 2015 with tailwinds either because of market or because of acquisitions or because of technology or because of increased capacity. So yes, if I look at our objectives, the one we declared for ourselves in 2010 when we started this process and where I am right now in the second part of the year, I feel very strong about 2014 and 2015 and actually like where we are. Maybe it's kind of like -- maybe it's going to sound strange, but maybe it's the first quarter where I'm lowering the year target and maybe that the strongest I've ever felt since I've been at FMC with what we have in front of us.","Peter Butler","Yes. I had another thought, Pierre. I've been really impressed with 2 of your acquisitions, at least the Bayer and the Epax. And there's been a lot of thinking about your M&A program, but I think equally important at FMC is that I'm really very, very impressive with the top management team you've been building, bringing in people from hither and yon. And maybe you could highlight a few of what these guys are doing to reduce your fixed costs, improve your supply chain, manufacturing efficiencies, your acquisition program, your Ag, et cetera. I mean, you should -- you have an opportunity to highlight a few of these acquisitions.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you very much, Peter, for your comment. I never talk about what the others are doing because I want to take all of the credit. But no, seriously, yes, we do have a great team. And let me say a couple of words about what you've said because I think there is -- you made an important statement. This company has been growing over the last couple of years through tremendous changes. We do believe we're going to have a state-of-the-art procurement organization today, and it's only the beginning of the savings. If you look, we are only addressing partially our spending and generating significant savings. Our supply chain has improved across the company, and in Manufacturing Excellence, and we see it in soda ash today already, this 10% capacity increase, finding a plant within the plant with minimum capital investment is working. And I can tell you we're going to see some significant impact going in 2015. I think, Paul, today is also undertaking something which -- and you've seen the cost and the corporate cost increasing, that's mostly where it's coming from. Paul is undertaking right now a very significant change in our finance organization. That will lead to significant savings and a stronger organization as we grow. We believe that what he's doing, we will be able to run a much larger company with the same organization we have today and decrease our spending as a percent of sales. And last, I'd like to say the team has put in place tremendous organization today in Latin America, in Asia and mostly in China, to grow further. So I mean, your comment is welcome, and yes, we've made some -- I feel good because we made some great progress across the company from an operational standpoint.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of things. First of all, this Manufacturing Excellence program in Green River and the debottlenecking and the productivity improvements which you're able to get, what -- do you have an idea of what the sort of the growth in production will be coming out of that program once these initiatives are implemented throughout the Green River facilities? Are we looking at 100,000 tons a year? Are we looking at something more or less than that in terms of incremental soda ash volumes which you'll be able to get?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, Dmitry, I think what we're going to be able to get here is about what we'll be able to get when we implement the same program. But I would say, today, we produce somewhere around -- last year, we produced around 3.6 million, 3.7 million tons per year in the plant. And we are expecting Manufacturing Excellence, between the ramp of this year and through next year, about 10%. So we could expect 300,000 to 400,000 tons additional versus where we were last year. This is why when I bridged to 2015 number and vision, think about the $40 per ton I talked to you about and think about an additional 300,000 tons of production, that's what I was talking about.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So you mean you're basically able to get about probably 50% of the volume that you would have gotten from the restart of the remaining Granger without laying out the $200 million CapEx for it?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Exactly.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Wow. Okay. And then secondly, you talked about Peroxygens impacting you for the year, about $0.15 to $0.20. Can you give us an idea what the first half impact was?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. Roughly, the first half was -- it's about the same each in quarter?","Paul W. Graves","It's about the same in each quarter. It's about half of that. Yes. It's reasonably evenly spread on a half year versus -- the quarters move around, but on a half year to half year basis, it's roughly the same between the 2 parts. Again, just -- let me just repeat, though. You won't actually see that coming out of our report numbers until Q3. When you see the Q3 numbers, Peroxygens is going to be removed for the full year, the entire year will be removed. So at the moment, all the numbers include Peroxygens for Q1 and Q2. But from now on, everything you see from us will exclude Peroxygens from every period.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","I understand that, Paul. I was just trying to see how close my second half Peroxygens expectations were to what you were expecting.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you very much. So let me now close. I think to conclude, 2013 is shaping up to be quite a year of change, but we see our company emerging in a stronger position than when we started the year. Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition will each deliver another record year of operating profit. Minerals will finish a turnaround in Lithium operations and continue recovery in export pricing. We will integrate our Epax acquisition and complete the Peroxygens divestiture.","As I said before, we like where we are today. And we will be very well-positioned to start strong in 2014, with a structural focus on our core competencies and advantaged business. We remain firmly on track to meet or exceed our Vision 2015 targets. We're executing a growth strategy across the enterprise, pursuing the right opportunity to expand our portfolio and delivering premium shareholder return.

Following his comments, we will be joined by Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Ed Flynn, President, FMC Minerals; and Mike Smith, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Health and Nutrition, to address your question.","Today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary, based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms that we may refer to during today's conference call are provided on our website. Our 2014 outlook statement, which provides guidance for the full year and the third quarter of 2014 can also be found on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Alisha, and good morning, everyone. In our release, you saw that we generated $988 million in revenue, an increase of 13% over the second quarter of last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to $203 million, a 10% increase compared to last year, and we delivered $1.01 in adjusted EPS, an increase of 9% over last year.","The Health and Nutrition and Minerals segments performed largely as expected. Results were strongly ahead of the second quarter last year. As you already know, compared to the original expectation, the effects of poor weather conditions negatively impacted our Agricultural Solutions segment in the first half of the year. Dry conditions in part of Brazil reduced sales to the sugarcane segment, and prolonged cold in North America led to different patterns of crop protection use. Despite this, the business delivered above-industry growth, with segment earnings and revenues higher than the second quarter of 2013.","Second quarter sales in Agricultural Solutions were $531 million, a 20% increase over the second quarter of 2013. Segment earnings were $131 million, up 5% over last year. Segment margin was impacted by changes in product mix, unfavorable foreign exchange and a planned increase in business spending. We chose to continue to increase our sales and technology investment, despite these temporary pressures on our earnings growth. Within Agricultural Solutions, all regions show year-on-year growth in revenue. In North America, the unusually cold and prolonged winter led to later than usual plantings. This was followed by a very strong early growing period, with lower than normal pest pressures, which is leading to forecast a very strong yield in both corn and soybean. All of these factors combined have created unusual market condition and some challenges for the crop protection industry.","For example, the delayed planting of corn this spring led to later and faster planting cycle, with farmers choosing to use fewer applications of our plant insecticide, including our Capture LFR product. Initial market indications suggest that the broader market for this product was down low to mid-teens percent, compared to last year's planting season. Despite this, we were able to increase both our market share and our average realized prices of Capture LFR.","Countering these challenges were some better-than-expected opportunities. Higher planted soybean acres resulted increased sales of preemergent herbicides, an important segment for us, with our Authority brands. Early market data is showing that sales growth of our products in this segment outpaced market growth, which itself was significant. We believe the share gains in some of our most important segments demonstrate the strength of our North American portfolio, particularly in high technology areas, such as corn rootworm resistance and in the growing area of treating glyphosate-resistant feeds.","In Europe, favorable growing condition increased demand for herbicide used in spring crops, while increased demand for fungicide in China, and various products in Pakistan, Korea and Australia, also drove additional sales versus the same quarter last year.","In Latin America, sales increased in all countries as we began to see additional benefits of expanded market access in the region. However, the poor conditions faced by Brazilian sugarcane growers continued to significantly reduce herbicide and insecticide demand from this segment. Offsetting this, we saw stronger than expected sales of some secondary products, including third-party products. This mix shift had a negative impact on margin in Latin America this quarter. Our sales efforts remain focused on maintaining a premium on the high-value technology and services that we provide to our customers. We are launching some important new product in the second half of 2014, such as our Rugby nematicide for soybeans. This product already has strong brand awareness among soybean growers in Brazil, given its historical application pattern, and we are seeing a favorable market reception for this new product application.","We also expect to take advantage of a strong market position in Brazilian cotton, with our launch of Gamit Star [ph] insecticide into the segment this year. This product is a novel broad spectrum insecticide that controls the boll weevil, a pest that's increasingly impacting yield and quality in the cotton crop. Additionally, we are expanding our market access in many of the Latin American countries and expect significant growth to take place outside of Brazil. For example, we are seeing a sharp increase in demand for preemergent soybean herbicide in Argentina, a market that is experiencing increasing pressure from glyphosate-resistant weeds. We have been able to use our formulation science and experience in addressing this issue in North America to quickly register and bring our technology to growers in Latin America.","As we look toward the second half, we expect that Latin America will once again drive most of the year-over-year growth. In the third quarter, we expect that our focus on higher-margin differentiated products will increase segment earnings by low to mid-teens percent over 2013. For the full year, we expect revenues to grow mid to high single-digits percent, while earnings are expected to increase mid single-digit percent, compared to 2013. Our segment operating margin expectations remain between 24% and 26% for the full year.","Now turning to Health and Nutrition. Segment revenues of $207 million increased 9%, and operating profit of $49 million was up 11% over last year. In the quarter, we saw increased demand for pharmacy cold tablet excipients in Asia. Most of this growth to date has been with a multinational pharmaceutical customers who produce generic prescription products for sale in North America and Europe. We also saw increased demand for alginate used in pharmaceutical applications. We continue to see relatively stable demand patterns in the health markets that we serve.","Our omega-3 product line also contributed to sales growth in the quarter. Most of the omega-3 sales in this quarter were sold into high concentration nutraceutical markets. These markets have experienced steady demand in 2014, and we expect to launch a number of new products in the second half to target this market segment. Pharmaceutical application will also remain a focus of our new product development efforts in omega-3.","Our nutrition markets experienced mixed result in the second quarter compared to last year. In North America, we saw higher demand for fixture and stability solutions used in beverages. Offsetting this, demand for similar beverage product across Asia has slowed, showing little year-over-year growth. Although we believe these are temporary slowdown, we are watching this change carefully. Additionally, we have launched a healthy project pipeline that we believe will continue to generate stable growth across global nutrition markets.","Looking forward, we expect third quarter segment earnings in Health and Nutrition to increase in the mid to high single-digit percent over the previous year. For the full year, we continue to expect segment revenue to increase low to mid-teens percent, with earnings increasing mid-teens percent over last year.","Now let me review Minerals. Both businesses performed in line with our expectations, with higher pricing in Alkali and improved operations in both Alkali and Lithium, resulting in stronger profitability. In the quarter, revenue of $215 million increased 2%, and operating profits of $43 million increased 21% versus the same period last year. In Alkali Chemicals, revenue of $193 million was flat to the previous year quarter. Higher realized pricing was offset by the impact of the timing of shipments and lower freight due to different geographic mix. During the quarter, earnings improved over the previous year, as improved planned performance, manufacturing efficiencies and higher average pricing offset higher energy costs. In Lithium, sales of $57 million were up 11% than the previous year. Improved operations produced additional volumes and allowed for higher sales and profitability in the quarter. The environment in Argentina was relatively benign, with inflation and exchange rates largely in line with our expectations. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings to increase by about 30% over the same period in 2013. Improved profitability will be delivered through higher soda ash pricing and increased volumes in both Alkali and Lithium. For the full year, we have assumed stable pricing for the remainder of the year in both businesses. We continue to expect segment revenue to increase in the mid to high single-digit percent, with segment earnings up high-teens over 2013.","Turning now to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.90 to $1 per diluted share, a 16% increase versus the third quarter of 2013, at the midpoint of the range. In Ag, we expect segment earnings to be at mid-teens percent over third quarter 2013. We are anticipating a solid start to the southern hemisphere season, with market access initiatives and new product launches providing opportunities for continued strong growth. In Health and Nutrition, we expect segment earnings to increase mid to high single-digit percent over 2013, driven by increased demand in all major end markets.","In Minerals, continued operational excellence is expected to provide additional volume in both businesses. This performance is expected to deliver about 30% earnings growth year-on-year.","For the full year, our expectation of adjusted earnings continue to be between $4.10 and $4.30 per diluted share, an 8% increase over 2013, at the midpoint of the range.","In Agricultural Solutions, we expect full year revenue to increase mid to high single-digit percent, and segment earnings to increase mid single-digits percent over 2013. Second half growth will be driven primarily by new product introductions, expanded market access positions and market share gain in Latin America. We are confident that our focus on new technologies and high-value segments will demonstrate the stability and sustainability of our margin profile.","In Health and Nutrition, we anticipate full year revenue and segment earnings growth in the mid-teens percent over 2013. We are pleased with how our portfolio is performing in markets that continue to exhibit solid underlying growth. In Minerals, operational excellence programs will result in record annual volumes in 2014 for both Alkali Chemicals and Lithium. We continue to see stable to positive pricing trends in soda ash and strong market demand in Lithium. As a result, we reaffirm our expectation of revenues growth in the mid to high single-digit percent and segment earnings improvements in the high-teens percent over 2013.","I will now turn the call over to Paul to cover financial highlights.","Paul W. Graves","Thanks, Pierre. Today, I'll focus on a few notable items in the quarter, including foreign exchange impacts and cash generation. I'll also update you on our capital deployment plans for the rest of the year.","Movements in the Brazilian real and multiple Asian currencies adversely impacted adjusted earnings on a year-over-year basis. In addition, the greater volatility within currencies has led to higher hedging costs versus last year. Our consolidated businesses, these unfavorable currency movements and related costs reduced adjusted EPS compared to last year by approximately $0.05 in the quarter and $0.10 in the first half.","For the first half of 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $149 million versus $248 million in the prior year. Much of the lower cash generator was due to lower EBIT from Ag Solutions in the first quarter and higher receivables balances, again, due to our Agricultural Solutions.","As we previously highlighted, later timing of sales in North America and a changing crop mix, especially in Brazil, is resulting in a different receivables collection pattern than prior years. So as a result, we expect a greater waiting of cash flow generation to the second half of the year compared to last year. We remain focused on increasing our operating cash flow, and we continue to roll out working capital improvement projects across the businesses. We believe we're on track to generate approximately $400 million of cash from operations, before separation costs.","Capital additions in the quarter were approximately $46 million. Spending continues to be primarily associated with construction of the Thailand MCC facility, which is progressing well and remains on track to begin commercial sales in early 2015. We've also focused capital resources on the construction of a new gas pipeline in Argentina. This pipeline will provide a more economical and safer transport of natural gas, up the mountain to our processing facility. We anticipate completion by the end of the year, with benefits increasing our earnings starting in 2015.","Finally, while Pierre will provide more details on the separation, let me note that, in the quarter, we incurred approximately $14 million in separation costs. And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Let me now update you on the status of the separation. We have completed the initial organizational design for both companies and are working on project planning and legal entity's credit [ph]. Regarding the costs to complete the separation, we expect approximately $100 million to $130 million of onetime costs. These costs are in line with costs seen in another companies undergoing similar separation processes. Once the separation is complete, we expect additional ongoing corporate expenses to total approximately $25 million across the 2 entities. These are mainly associated with supporting an additional publicly traded company.","I will now update you on progress towards meeting the goals of our Vision 2015 plan. As you recall, the Vision 2015 strategic plan set a number of goals that reflected our objective of delivering to shareholder returns that we believe reflected the quality of the FMC portfolio.","Also a combination of lost -- by the middle of 2014, we can demonstrate tremendous progress against these goals. We have met or exceeded our original targets for return on capital and capital return to shareholders. We remain on track to achieve our organic revenue targets. Our target for EBIT and EPS offer the greatest challenge to this. Despite our Ag business significantly outperforming against the plan and our core Health and Nutrition segment performing in line with the targets set forth, there is currently a gap to our 2015 EBIT target. The reason for this can be explained by a few factors that are largely outside of our control. First, related to Minerals. Soda ash pricing is not as high as we had forecasted, and the Argentinian peso to U.S. dollar exchange rates is not in line with where our fundamental projection should be. These 2 factors alone account for a large portion of the GAAP to our targets. Also a combination of lost EBIT contribution from businesses that we have sold or closed, which were part of the portfolio when we first drafted the Vision 2015 plan and lower contribution that we had targeted from acquisitions, explain another portion of the differential.","Given that this year have seen some business patterns that are different from recent years, there is less predictability that we have seen during the plan so far. At this point in the year, it is certainly true that forecasting is more challenging in this environment. Agricultural markets are coming off a year of abnormally low growth, but signs continue to suggest acreage expansion in crops where we have strong portfolios. We have seen good traction in soda ash price increase. That could continue to strengthen. Our new businesses, Asipacs [ph] and Karros [ph], are demonstrating additional growth opportunities. In this changing environment, we'll refine, in the coming month, our 2015 expectation. As a result, we believe that Vision 2015 have highlighted the strength and quality of our asset portfolio and will continue to deliver premium shareholder returns.","To conclude, like others in the ag space, we are airing concern about the slowdown in agricultural market. The industry is facing uncertainty, and we're monitoring the situation closely and are in constant dialogue with our customers. We are also closely watching order patterns and inventory levels. Like many other industry participants, we believe there is greater uncertainty than in previous years, but we still see a strong second half of the year, driven by the strength of our Brazil business and the expansion of our presence throughout Latin America. As we look ahead for the next few seasons, we are keeping a close eye on our market but we remain very confident that our technology pipeline will deliver strong long-term sales growth, while maintaining our industry-leading margins.","Health and Nutrition has also a strong pipeline of new products that will drive continued growth through broader product offerings and organizational leverage. In Minerals, we believe that our constant focus on operational excellence will result in record volume for both Alkali and Lithium. This increased volume, combined with price improvement for soda ash, position us for solid earnings improvement in 2014, with continued momentum in the next few years. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and executing on the evolution of FMC. We also look forward to sharing with you our vision for the future of our companies at our Investor Day.","Now I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Okay. We do have a -- your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So when I look at the guidance for the back half of the year, and in particular, look at the weighting at how it kind of sequences, the fourth quarter, obviously, is going to be having to carry a lot more weight than it normally does. And I guess, I'm wondering, how much of that kind of back end-loaded guidance is really tied to stuff that you have complete control over versus the markets moving in maybe a direction you anticipate or hope, but you don't necessarily control.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, I would say that, today, and I would ask Mark to give more color to it, with a specific product discussion. I would say that a large part of the forecast we are making for the quarter depends upon things we are controlling. So we are looking at a normal fourth quarter from a weather standpoint. And most of the growth is coming -- and I could pretty much put 3 buckets into the growth. First, the first bucket would be mix. Our forecast is, today, with products which are much more differentiated, less third-party project than we did last year. So we have a much stronger mix in the fourth quarter. The other bucket would be, as we have proven, we've been able to grow our market share in soybean. And this soybean market share is forecasted to -- market share gains forecasted to continue for us. Together with a significant, as mentioned in the script, significant new product launch that we are seeing -- are getting very good reception right now in Latin America and in Brazil. And the third bucket will be we are very much seeing the benefit from our newly structured market access, for example, in Argentina. There is also one element, which we do not control, but we're just expecting no major change. If you remember, last year, we got very negatively impacted in the fourth quarter in our ag business by FX. We are not planning any major swing in the fourth quarter of this year around FX, which would create a significant year-on-year benefit. Mark, if you want to add anything around the specificity?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Pierre, I think, the -- and John, I know you know the market pretty well down there. I think, the piece I would add is the focus we've had in not only Brazil in terms of expanding market access through co-ops in distribution where, traditionally, we've had a lower share. We've put commercial people down on the ground, especially in the South of Brazil, where we're starting to see traction now with the products that we sell to a lot of the mega growers going through distribution. That really wasn't in place last year at this time, so there's a push there that you'll see. I would also that add that the market access outside of Brazil is paying off. Pierre just mentioned Argentina. I think, you know that we had a very good season in North America with our pre-emergent herbicides for glyphosate resistance. We're seeing exactly the same sort of acceleration in Argentina. We have the same brand name, the Authority brand. A lot of the technology used in North America is now being used in Argentina, so that's an accelerated market that we have, which should give confidence that we continue to grow in the soy area. And then, a lot of the smaller countries in Latin America that are extremely high value with specialty crops. We now have new market access in Ecuador, where we didn't have it this time last year, and we've expanded our presence in Chile and Peru. So all in all, when I look at Latin America, there are a number of things that are in our control and we feel very confident about putting those new technologies into the marketplace.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then, just as the follow-up question. With regard to the pipeline that you're putting through, it sounds like, in your Lithium platform, can you walk us through how that changed the profitability and how we should be thinking about the margin progression, from ex pipeline to with pipeline?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, first. We are expecting the pipeline to be in place toward the back end of the year, the back end of the fourth quarter. So we will see a yield impact this year. I would qualify the benefit in EBIT about the mid single-digit million dollar benefit over a year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you could speak to your contribution margins in the Ag business. It looks like you did have a nice sales growth of $89 million on a year-over-year basis, but about $6 million on the profit side, so maybe 7% incremental margin there. You mentioned FX. Perhaps, you can kind of walk us through some of the math there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. Same thing. I'll give you a view. And then, I'll get Mark to get into the specific. Let's put, first, the 2 things which are very concrete. First, FX went against us in the business in the second quarter. And the second aspect is the fact that we decided not to slow down, we have faith in this business, in our product development access, so we have decided to continue to invest in technology and selling. So we had a negative FX impact and increased investments into the business. But really, the main story is a mix story. First of all, as you know, we do have a very strong position in sugarcane in Brazil. Those are very differentiated product, high-margin products. And with the drought, we saw much less of these products than we were expecting. Second of all, in North America, as I just told in the script before, it was very different pattern from what we were expecting from the mix of product and the mix of pre-emergent versus post-emergent product. This also, within those high-margin products, there is some product with much higher margin than others, even all of those are differentiated. It went against us. So even in our high-margin products, we saw a lower sales of the very differentiated high-margin product. Now there is also a phenomenon which happened, and I unfortunately have to admit against what we would have liked. As you know, we have very sales-driven organization. And when they recognized that we were losing ground on the EBIT, they very aggressively went at selling products, where customers, because of our strong relationship, all things would be equal, would be willing buying from us rather than competition. But those quick sales are mostly of low differentiation or third-party product, which do not carry at all the same margins as our regular products. So we had a very strong push in Latin America, to some extent in North America, of products. I would not or we would not have pushed that hard to get those products in the market if we would have a full understanding of what was going on. So it was a way from -- we have a very strong, very sales-driven organization, and they were committed to an EBIT and they went for it. Maybe the way we were hit was with the mix, which would not be the one we would have chosen. So when you put those together, it created a very strong top line growth. There is places where we gain market share. We talked about it. I think, Authority is one of the brands where we have strong market share, so there is some very good reasons for the top line growth. But the big story behind -- beyond FX and investment in the business is a big mix shift, which we will control much better in the next couple of quarters. Mark, do you want to add something?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes. The only thing I would add, Kevin, is -- well, Pierre just touched on the business spending. I think, it's important to recognize that, that business spending is primarily based around research. I think, a lot of people know that we're investing in research for the new active ingredients that we're bringing through that will come through to the end of the decade. It's important to recognize that once we start that work and we get into the chronic talks work and we get into the regulatory side, we can't slow that down. So that's been the major investment when it comes to the business spend side.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's really helpful color from both of you. As a second follow-up question maybe for Paul. Your DSO declined about 11 days sequentially. Can you update us on some of the initiatives on trade working capital. How much lower do you think you can take that metric? And what would be an appropriate equilibrium target for you?","Paul W. Graves","Sure. Clearly, the business is really driven by, under the working capital targets, really driven by ag. And some of the moving pieces that we have going on Ag at the moment, we touched upon the North American sales patterns being a little different. The sales being made later in the quarter changes the year end receivables balances that we would normally have. And in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, we sell on crop terms, and so when you get a different mix of crop terms, and particularly when you move from the very short payment periods of sugarcane to the much longer payment periods of soybean and cotton, you start to get a very different pattern emerging. And what I would say is we look at a few key metrics, as well as DSO. We do look at industry terms and to make sure that we are not selling on any different terms to the rest of the industry. And we also look at collection rates and past due and default rates. And all of those things are back in line with where they've always been historically. So we're not seeing any major shifts. I think, to Pierre's point around some of the mix challenges that we had in the second quarter, I think, what we believe is that there is an opportunity around the DSO to be somewhat more differentiated about the terms we offer for different products that we're selling to our customers. We also think there are opportunities in some of our other businesses. In Health and Nutrition, we have some opportunities, for sure, around inventory levels in that business and we have some aggressive programs in place. So you put all those pieces together, we're still working through all this. As you can imagine, particularly in ag, moving the needle in working capital, when you have very long-dated terms and you're kind of cross growing seasons in different regions, you don't move things quickly, but we're pretty comfortable with the progress we're making so far. We recognize we need to start showing that in the cash flow numbers, but we're pretty confident that we're on the right track.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions. If you -- I'm just trying to understand your outlook statement for, particularly in the ag business versus where you thought it would be 3 months ago. It looks like, at least revenues in the second quarter, you did a little bit better, but if you sort of can contrast and compare your view about the ag market in the second half of the year now, versus what it was 3 months ago?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I don't think that we have a major change in the view, Dmitry, while looking at the market. I think, the first quarter, we -- the year, the year is very much tainted by the first and second quarter. First quarter, sales were down 6%, EBIT was down 26%. In the second quarter sales were up 20%, and EBIT was only up 5%. So when you have such a start of the year, when you get a penalty and it's all weather-driven, and I would tend to admit, at the end of the first quarter, we misread the impacts of the weather on the second quarter. We thought we had a good handle on it and it was much more -- I mean, a couple of the other [ph] companies fell into the same trap as we did. So we had a changing view of the second quarter as we were going through the second quarter. But now, getting into the second quarter and -- sorry, the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we have kept pretty much the same view. The fourth quarter, we are believing will be very strong from a mix standpoint. We are looking at top line growth but very strong from a mix and point, where we are targeting sales and where we are forecasting sales with these good product. And the third quarter also we're showing improvements. So mid single-digit growth rate for the third quarter and high-teens for the fourth quarter, all driven by Latin America with a very strong mix, related to the kind of numbers we are showing. But we are forecasting just a normal back end of the year, nothing special around acreage or nothing particularly changed, or nothing special around the weather.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Okay. Switching gears to the Minerals part of the business. Can you talk about the sort of the pricing trends in the ANSAC business in Latin America and Asia. And also, there's been, as I'm sure you're aware, a couple of announcements of capacity expansions in soda ash or at least plants in Wyoming area from your competitors. So I was wondering how sort of how you look at the market now, with after several years of no capacity additions of any size, just de-bottlenecking. You actually do have some CapEx project starting up. And how does that impact your decision on bringing the rest of Granger online, in terms of timing on cost or whatever you can share with us?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Sure. So pricing, we had pricing stability in the low single-digit percent in domestic in North America. And pricing, I would say, stability in Latin America and good pricing traction, with double-digit percent increase in Asia. Now we didn't get the full benefit of this double-digit pricing increase in Asia, because the mix was a bit unfavorable. Pricing in Asia remains still lower than Latin America. And true, in fact, we had more sales in Asia than we had in Latin America. So the mix was not as good. But certainly, we've seen some firming of the pricing in Asia. Now still, for next another couple of quarters, until we understand better, we're not going to keep on forecasting a continuation of this price, but the quarter was robust at -- and stable. And Asia is the place where we saw the highest increase. We believe, the pricing situation, if we look at the next couple of years, is firming up in Asia because there is no major capital spending which are forecasted in Asia. And we start to see the demand and supply balance getting better. The capital spending, I think, you're mentioning about other announcements from my colleagues at Solvay. I suppose, that's the one you mentioned, which we see more as a de-bottlenecking than truly a capacity increase. As you know, when you produce de-bottleneck plants in Wyoming, with natural soda ash, you are at a very low pricing. So usually, it's not a very big issue to place those volumes. And the amounts are not such that they are changing the supply-demand pattern. Ed, you want to add something?","Edward T. Flynn","Yes. I would add, if you recall, Solvay also had announced that they shut down operations in Portugal, and that is actually more of a decrease than the roughly 150,000 tons they're going to bring on in Green River. In terms of that additional capacity, as it relates to the overall market, it's about 0.5% of global market demand, so we don't think it will have much of an impact. And there has been, in the last year or so, about 1.5 million tons of shutdowns that actually have occurred across the globe. So net-net, supply has actually been decreasing of capacity, that has currently been on line. And I think, the second part of your question Dmitry, was related to Granger, and we have experienced great success in the Manufacturing Excellence arena. And so while we've done pre-engineering work for the Granger facility, I can't go to Pierre and ask to make an investment until I can assure him that I've really been able to get everything I can out of the assets that I currently have in place.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thanks, Ed. So in summary, we are, I would say, very cautiously optimistic around pricing, with stability in Latin America and North America, and strengthening in Asia. As Ed said, we are focusing capacity expansion through de-bottlenecking and we are seeing our Manufacturing Excellence is still giving us opportunities. I didn't share, I don't think I would be comfortable making the decision around a very large investment at this stage of the corporation. We are still looking at a separation. And I think it's a decision which will be better made by the business when acting as a standalone business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Pierre, that almost begs the question as to who will Ed be asking about that capital allocation project, or when might we find out when the CEO comes. And actually, more broadly, regarding this $130 million -- I'm sorry, $100 million to $130 million spending target for the cost of the separation, which you indicated was in line with other sort of separations out there. How should we think about the timing of that? Very little has been spent -- well, not very little, 15% has been spent so far. But how should we think about the timing of that? And what are the big buckets that accounts for that $100 million to $130 million?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Certainly. So about who will be making the decision, we are still in interview process and interviewing candidates, and I would like to say that I have been meeting with very high-quality candidates today. So have a -- we are down to a handful of high-quality candidates today. And as soon as we've crossed the bridge of deciding who it is, you will be -- you guys will be the first to know. We'll put an announcement out. From the timing, I think, we still believe, it's a very complex process. The timing for a separation is always hard to predict, but we have no reason to believe that we will not stay within the timeframe we've announced, which was the first half of 2015. The spending for a separation, I would say, if you think about in between now and the separation, I would say the bulk of the spending will be happening in the next 6 months. That's really where we will have a large part of the spending. Spendings, if I look at the big bucket, I'm going to ask Paul to help me, but certainly, IT is definitely one of the big buckets we do have today. Tax is another parts of the -- those are the big hitters across the corporation.","Paul W. Graves","And they're the 2 big ones, and there's obviously the external consultant costs, which is all around managing the project, and legal costs, consultant costs, bankers' fees. All the wonderful third parties that are willing to come and help us do this, they don't do it for free unfortunately. They're the big bucket.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. So external help, we would call that IT and taxes would represent maybe 80% of your costs.","Paul W. Graves","In that range, yes.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Great. And that's over the next 6 months. And one of the things that you mentioned with respect to Vision 2015, and coming short was on the M&A side. I guess, it's been about a year since you did the Epax transaction. Can you update us on how that's going in the integration and the accretion that you're seeing there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. The integration is going well. The plant is operating, where they even have customers. I think, the -- so we are very pleased with where we are. It's accretive this year. The key question for us, and when I talk about Vision '15 and ramp up is, there is a base business, which we got with Epax, but there is all of the creation of this new business with the new manufacturing process and the new plant for the high-concentration, high-purity, either for pharmaceutical or for the high-concentration nutraceutical. That is really for us what will differentiate a decent acquisition from a great acquisition. So really, if I want to think about, today, very pleased, nothing wrong with we've done, good results. I'm feeling quite good with our new product line, but what will make it a great acquisition is how much progress we're going to make with the new Seal Sands plant and the high-concentration hydrology product. That's to be seen in the next, I would say, 12 months.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is George D'Angelo sitting in for Lawrence this morning. Can you give some color on the comments around glyphosate resistance. What regions are you guys seeing the most interest in those types of products?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, George, this is Mark. First and foremost, North America is the market where we're seeing the most spread of glyphosate resistance, not only in terms of acreage but in terms of types of weeds. So that's a market where our sort of venture is on base products, the Authority brands are taking share and doing very well. Secondary to that, we're seeing the resistance in Argentina, as I talked about earlier. That's another large soy market and a market that we're focused on. Also outside of glyphosate, we do see resistance, insect resistance in Brazil growing, so we'll have opportunities there with our range of insecticides. Overall, it's been an important market for us. It will continue to be as we go into the next few seasons. Resistance is continuing to grow, not only in North America, but down in Latin America as well. And not only in Brazil, but Argentina, so an important market.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And any update on the JV with Chr. Hansen. What kind of products that might be yielding?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, thanks for asking about that. The biologicals platform for us is, as you know, something we're focusing heavily on. I have to say that we put the alliance in place back in October. We have, right now, 5 new products that are in field testing in North America. A suite of products is expected to go into Latin America for field testing, as we hit their season in the second half of this year. The collaboration is working very, very well. As you know, we also put into that a company we bought, which is a research-based company for screening and identifying of microbial agents for use in biologicals. They're doing a tremendous job. And we have a very strong pipeline of opportunities both in fungicides and in plant growth regulators. So we're very hopeful that, that project will come to fruition. We expect the first products to be out in the marketplace in 2015, predominantly in North America. But I have to say, as an alliance, given the short space of time we've been working with them, we are very impressed with Chr. Hansen, in terms of their ability to scale up the products we're feeding into that alliance, so it's going well.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","If I'm looking at the ag business, you commented that you're going to keep an eye on customer inventory levels. Is there any concern that some of the aggressive selling tactics, that came about in Q2, led to some inventory build and maybe you pulled some of your top line from Q3 back into Q2?","Mark A. Douglas","Mike, it's Mark. No. What Pierre was referring to in terms of the aggressiveness of the sales group was predominantly down in Latin America. And as you know, Q2 is a pretty quiet period in Latin America, rolling off one season and starting to get ready to gear up for the second season in Q3 and Q4. There may well be pockets of increased inventory throughout that enormous market down there. But fundamentally, it's not going to slow down the growth for FMC, with our active ingredients and our proprietary products. I would say, North America, given the conditions that we saw with weather, it would not surprise me that in some segments, that as the numbers come in, that we see elevated levels of channel inventory. I'm particularly thinking of the corn market. That was particularly affected in terms of insecticides. We may well see elevated levels there. However to offset that, we did extremely well with pre-emergent products, and I would expect, when the numbers come in, that those inventory levels are extremely low.","Pierre R. Brondeau","So I mean, just to support what Mark said, the aggressiveness in terms of selling, those were not on product we are focusing on in Q3 and Q4. Those are products we sold. I believe, we gained market share. But it's market share gained on low margin product based on relationship with customers and certainly not places which are critical to our sales projections for Q3 and Q4.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then, Mark, maybe you can give a little bit more detail to help us understand the issues around the Brazil sugarcane market and maybe what the drought means to the long-term trajectory of growth in acreage there?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, sure. We talked about it a lot in the various calls over the last few quarters. The droughts had a significant impact on productivity, from the sugar mills themselves in terms of how much sugar is produced out of the actual acreage. But combined with that is the economic impact of what's been going on with ethanol and with sugar pricing in the world markets. That's also been a significant impact. We expect longer term. And certainly, as we go through the rest of this decade, as we think about the next phase of our growth, that sugarcane will continue to be a major growth area for us. This business has gone through these cycles in the past where you've seen significant consolidation on the back of weaker economics for the smaller players. That is also playing out as well. But for us, with our suite of herbicides and insecticides, new products coming to the marketplace, we continue to see it strong. Ethanol mandate will change in Brazil at some point. Prices will change. Sugar prices have been coming back over the last few months and continue to look more healthy. So we do expect the fundamentals to continue to look good. But in the short term, it's been a rough ride.","Alisha Bellezza","Okay. Well, I think, with that, that's about all the time we have for the call today. I want to thank everyone for joining us. I am available for additional questions that you might have, and I hope you have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin.","Michael Wherley","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Rondeau, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Mark Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Pierre will review FMC's second quarter performance and provide the outlook for the rest of 2019. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results, Mark will then address the long-term sustainable growth for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls. We will then address your questions.","The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2019 outlook statement are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Finally, let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors including but not limited to those factors identified in our press release and in our filings with the SEC. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion in this forum materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations and free cash flow, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings and EBITDA shall mean, adjusted EBITDA for all income state references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's call are provided on our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.","As you saw in our earnings release FMC continued to outperform the market as we have for the past seven quarters. We delivered results in-line with the forecast and adjusted to specific global conditions in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 3. FMC reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects the year-over-year increase of 4.5% on the reported basis and 9% organic growth excluding FX headwinds. This increase was mostly driven by strength in Brazil, India and EMEA. Adjusted company EBITDA was $330 million, an increase of 6% compared to recast financials from last year and $3 million above the midpoint of the guidance.","Company EBITDA margins were up 28%, but year-over-year despite $64 million in combined headwinds from raw material cost and foreign currencies. Adjusted EPS was $1.66 in the quarter, an increase of 11% versus weaker Q2, 2018 and $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. The strong year-over-year EPS growth was driven by price increase, higher volume and the lower share count.","Moving now to second quarter revenue on Slide 4. Q2 revenue grew 4.5% versus prior year, with volume contributing 5% growth and price mix to another 3% growth. This was offset partially by 4% headwind from FX.","Although, Q2 is a seasonally smaller quarter of the year in Latin America, sales in that region grew 29% year-over-year or 34% organically, continuing the trend from Q1. Drivers include strong revenue growth in Brazil across the portfolio with high demand for applications on cotton and sugarcane, and price increases that more than offset the impact of FX on both revenue and earnings.","Following such a strong first half in Latin America, it is important to note that we continue to monitor channel inventory levels of FMC products very closely in Brazil. They are at an all-time low for this point in the season.","In EMEA, improved market conditions in Russia and Ukraine grew demand in Southwest Europe and new country registrations for Cyazypyr insect control drove year-over-year revenue growth of 4%. Organic growth was 10%.","In Asia, revenue was down 2% overall, but increased 4% organically year-over-year. We were especially pleased with the strong performance in India where our sales grew over 20% driven by growth in herbicides for sugarcane and the benefits of our new commercial organization structure, which we put in place about a year ago.","In North America revenue was down 2% year-over-year as the well-understood whether issues in the quarter caused a reduction in demand from our rootcrop customers. This low demand was offset in part by strong sales of Rynaxypyr insect control, especially in niche crops in California, and our new fungicide Lucento.","Turning to Slide 5. Second quarter EBITDA was $338 million, price increases in all regions and strong volume demand everywhere, but North America combined to more than offset the headwinds from raw material cost and FX, leading to 6% growth versus recast results from Q2 2018.","Moving to our 2019 outlook on Slide 6. We are maintaining our guidance for 2019 revenue and EBITDA. We expect full year 2019 revenue to grow 6% at the midpoint on 9% organic growth, excluding the forecasted 3% FX headwind. We expect total company EBITDA to grow 8%, we are increasing our 2019 EPS guidance to a range of $5.68 to $5.88, which represent a gain of 10% at the midpoint over recast 2018.","Our EPS guidance now reflects the $200 million of buybacks completed in the first half of 2019, as well as an additional $200 million of buyback anticipated in the second half. We continue to plan to make $400 million to $500 million in total share repurchases in 2019. But our EPS guidance reflects the lower end of this range.","For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $960 million to $990 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 6% at the midpoint. We are also forecasting EBITDA of $190 million to $210 million in Q3, which would be an increase of 7% year-over-year at the midpoint.","As expected, the impact from FX will be more muted in the second half of the year. We expect third quarter EPS to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85, up 13% at the midpoint versus recast results from Q3 2018.","The third quarter is a seasonally smallest quarter for FMC, which is in line with the quarterly pattern from 2018 as Q3 is not a high season in any of our regions. The healthy growth we forecast is in-line with our full-year growth expectation and the Q3 guidance is essentially in-line with the prior year period as a percent of annual sales, annual EBITDA and annual EPS.","Guidance for Q4, implies a very strong quarter with sales growth of 7%, EBITDA growth of 17% and EPS growth of 10%, all at the midpoint of the ranges versus recast Q4 2018 results. Q4 performance will be driven by Latin America. In Brazil, similar to last year, we have already received nearly 70% of the orders needed to deliver our second half forecast. This is giving us a very strong confidence in our ability to deliver our financial targets for the second half. However, we are carefully monitoring the North America market and channel inventories.","For 2019, we now expect the overall global crop protection market will be flat on a U.S. Dollar basis. Down slightly from our previous outlook, we expect Latin America to grow faster in the high-single digits and North America to be weaker down mid-single digits. These adjustments in market forecast does not change our overall outlook for FMC's financial outperformance related to the market.","Turning now to a full-year EBITDA bridge and revenue drivers on Slide 7. Our full-year cost headwind is higher than our prior forecast, mainly due to increase tariffs in the U.S. and a delayed reopening of a key tolling partner in China. However, strong pricing is now expected to offset over 70% of the $220 million in combined headwinds from cost and FX.","Moving to Slide 8. We provide the key drivers for EBITDA and revenue growth in Q3 and Q4. Volume growth and price increases are expected to be consistent driver over revenue and earnings performance.","I will now turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Sandifer","Thanks Pierre.","Let me start this morning with a few specific income statement items. Interest expense for the quarter was $4 million higher than implied by our prior full year guidance due to higher interest rates on foreign borrowings and higher than anticipated commercial paper balances.","Interest expense for the full year is now expected to be in the range of $144 million to $148 million. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. We are maintaining our full year tax rate guidance of 14% to 16%.","Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter was $132.3 million, down nearly $4 million shares versus the prior year period, reflecting the benefit of the $400 million in share repurchases, we've made over the past three quarters.","Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Gross debt as of June 30th was $3.2 billion, up roughly $100 million from the end of March. Gross debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA at quarter end was 2.8x. This is above our targeted leverage of 2.5x due to the seasonality of our cash flow and the timing of share repurchases. We continue to expect to see leverage drop to 2.5xor lower for the full year.","Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted cash from operations was negative $174 million in the first half of 2019, below the prior year period. Non-recurring impacts that benefited working capital in the prior year period as discussed in our last earnings call remain the largest contributor to the year-on-year change.","Additionally, cash from operations in the second quarter was also impacted by credit term accommodations made to certain North American customers in light of extreme market conditions, more than half of which have already been paid to us in Q3.","We also had higher sales in Latin America and India where normal terms extend beyond the quarter end. These additional factors will unwind over the following two quarters and as such we are maintaining our full year guidance for adjusted cash from operations at $750 million to $850 million, with strong operating cash generation in both the third and fourth quarters.","Capital investment through mid-year while lagging the pace implied by our full year guidance is in-line with project schedule. We are maintaining our full year guidance for free cash flow of $375 million to $475 million.","However, we are currently exploring a few product line acquisitions as well as certain capital investments to support the rapid growth of our diamide platform. These opportunities - if pursued - would reduce full year free cash flow somewhat, so they would further reinforce our growth trajectory.","We repurchased $2.56 million FMC shares year-to-date at an average price of $78.11 for a total of approximately $200 million. It is our intent to remain a regular purchaser of FMC shares throughout the year. So we have not purchased any shares since the quarter-end, you should expect that we will make further repurchases during the third and fourth quarters.","As Pierre said, we intend to repurchase a total of $400 million to $500 million of FMC shares in 2019, I note that our full year EPS guidance reflects the benefit of repurchases at the lower end of this range in light of the potential additional investment opportunities I just mentioned.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Douglas","Thank you, Andrew.","Over the last few months, we've seen numerous published reports discussing our diamide insecticide portfolio, speculating on the timing of patent expirations and the impact these may have on the long-term profitability and growth of these important active ingredients.","I want to take the time today to provide further clarity on not only our patent estate and the timing of key patent milestones, but also on other critical elements that will allow FMC to continue to profitably grow the diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents.","These other critical elements include registration and data protection, commercial strategies, brand recognition, as well as manufacturing and supply chain complexity. Our diamide portfolio consists of two key molecules, Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls with current combined annual revenues of approximately $1.5 billion. It's important to note that Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr are FMC's trademark brand names for the active ingredients chlorantraniliprole and Cyantraniliprole.","These two molecules class-leading in terms of performance, combining highly effective low dose rates with fast-acting systemic long residual control. These attributes quickly established Rynaxypyr's the world's leading insect control technology and we expect it to continue a strong growth trajectory.","Moving to Slide 11 to begin our discussion of the diamide patent state. Let me first pause to recognize DuPont. Out of all the quality assets we acquired in 2017, the IP estate and thought that went into building the IP protection of these molecules was extremely well done.","Today I will largely confine my comments to Rynaxypyr, though the same comments are generally true for Cyazypyr with extended timelines by 18 months. The Rynaxypyr patent estate is made up of several different patent families which cover composition of matter - both the active ingredient and certain intermediates - manufacturing processes - both the active ingredients in certain intermediates - formulations, uses and applications.","For Rynaxypyr, we have 21 patent families filed in 76 countries, with a total of 639 granted and pending patents. Together with Cyazypyr related patents, we have over 30% patent families and close to 1,000 granted and pending patents. Composition of matter patents cover the structure of the molecule and are generally the patents that most observers have focused on.","Process patents cover the manufacturing processes for both active ingredients chlorantraniliprole and Cyantraniliprole, as well as the key intermediates that are used to make the final products. In the case of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr, these process patents are extremely important.","Chlorantraniliprole is a complex molecule to produce. In fact its production requires 16 separate steps, many of which produce an intermediate that sole use is in the production of chlorantraniliprole. This is very important as it means there are no other commercial uses for these intermediates and hence no other commercial outlets for them.","Importantly, FMC has many of these 16 process steps separately patented. Several of these intermediate process patents run well past the expiration of the composition of matter patents and in some cases stretch all the way to the end of the next decade.","Third parties that intend to manufacture and sell generic chlorantraniliprole Cyantraniliprole and rely on FMC's product safety data will be required to demonstrate that their products has the same regulatory safety profile as FMC's Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls. To meet these stringent regulatory requirements for such a difficult to manufacture molecule, the AIs will have to be made the way we're making it which is protected by FMC process patents.","Process patents can also include manufacturing processes that are not currently used, but are alternative ways to manufacture our diamides. We hold patents on several alternate processes, but it is important to note that these alternate processes do not match our diamide impurity profile.","Formulation patents cover the use of an active ingredient in specific formulations, while used in application patents cover how the products are used and how they are applied. In addition to the patent estate, various regulatory bodies around the world also offer added protection to the holder of patented molecules in the form of data protection and registration timelines that can extend after the composition of process patents have expired. This means that the patent holder is afforded a further period of exclusive use after the application after applicable patents have expired.","Over the coming slides, I'll show by major country how the patent estate registration timeline and data protection come together. These highlighted countries currently account for over 70% of our diamide revenue.","Turning to Slide 12 you can see how we view the entire timeline for Europe. We have two parts of protection. First, we have patent protection for the composition of matter through August 2022 and later in certain EU countries.","In addition and importantly, we have patent protection through December 2025 for key processes that are required to manufacture Rynaxypyr. In effect this means that no one will be able to manufacture or import chlorantraniliprole in the EU until December 2025 as they would be infringing our process patents.","Second, in Europe, owners who have patented active ingredients are also granted exclusive data protection, which for chlorantraniliprole effectively means of third-party cannot use the FMC data to gain a registration for a period of 13 years after the first registration.","In addition, a further 2.5 years of data protection will be given at the initial re-registration of the active ingredient. Practically speaking, this means that no one, seeking to register chlorantraniliprole can use FMC-generated data to apply for registration during the data protection period, which runs through the end of October 2026.","A third party can start to generate their own product specific data for registration purposes during this period and after the data protection period has expired, they could then apply for registration, which under EU rules should take 18 months, but generally takes two years. This multi-layered framework means that we will not see competitive sales of chlorantraniliprole until Q2 2027 at the earliest in the EU, unless it is sales of products sourced from or under license from FMC.","On Slide 13, you can see a similar chart to what we had in the EU with regards to patent protection, but with a different registration process. The U.S. does not have the same type of data protection as in the EU. However, under U.S. patent law, a third party cannot test or generate data or sell a product in the U.S. prior to patent expiration.","This means that any third-party company wishing to gain registration to manufacture and sell chlorantraniliprole cannot start the regulatory process and allow main process patents begin expiring in December 2025. At that time the third party company can apply for a federal registration, which under normal circumstances will take about 12 months.","After the federal registration has been granted, a state registration is also needed for each state where the products will be sold. These state registrations normally take an additional six months to be granted. In addition, the third party is legally required to compensate the data holder, in this case FMC, for using FMC's data to gain a registration.","This robust patent protection and regulatory timeline, means that we do not expect third party to be able to sell chlorantraniliprole in the US until June 2027 at the earliest, unless they are supplied or licensed by FMC.","Moving to Slide 14, which shows the timeline for two other key countries for diamides: China and India. Similar to other countries we've reviewed, you can see that the AI composition of matter patents expire in August 2022 and the key process patents begin expiring in December 2025.","In India and China, a third-party can start applying for registration for a product during the time frame that a molecule has patent protection. However, in both these countries, we have the key manufacturing processes patented, which effectively means that even if the registration is granted, a third party could not start selling competitive chlorantraniliprole until Q1 2026 at the earliest.","Finally, the last county I'll cover is Brazil on Slide 15. The patent timelines for Rynaxypyr in Brazil are longer than most other countries. The composition of matter patent on the active ingredient will expire in April 2023 and our key process patents will begin expiring in August 2026.","Under current Brazilian regulatory practices, a third-party can apply for registration before the patents have expired. However, Brazil has a law of protecting the exclusive use of initial registrant's data for a period of time, after the initial registration.","FMC believes that any company that filed for registration during the period of our continued data exclusivity falls foul of this Brazilian law, we have initiated a legal process with the Brazilian regulatory authorities to have FMC's data exclusivity respected. Taking this into account, it means first competitive sales of chlorantraniliprole will not occur before September 2026.","Turning to Slide 16. The second part of our growth strategy for the diamide is our commercial approach. It should be very clear that we have an air-tight patent coverage for the process of manufacturing the diamides.","However, we are also advancing a strategy of allowing others to sell Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls as long as they purchased the active ingredient or formulations from FMC and license the trademarks.","Selling the active ingredients to third parties is a profitable way for us to grow our business as it increases the market reach for the molecule, it is not EBITDA margin dilutive. At a reasonable gross margin the absence of SG&A expense for FMC means incremental gross margin drops straight to EBITDA. The third-party bears all costs related to formulated the active ingredient into a marketable product as well as selling and distributing the product to the customer.","As of today, we have commercial agreements already in place or are actively negotiating new agreements with more than 15 companies to supply Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr on a global or country basis before patent expiration. We are continuing to explore opportunities with additional companies beyond the 15 we already engaged with today.","The duration of the agreements extends well beyond the patent expiration dates and are exclusive in nature. This means our third-party partners will be required to purchase a large majority of their diamide requirements from FMC over the lifetime of the agreement and all their needs prior to the expiration of our process patents.","The number of companies where we already have signed supply contracts all have ongoing negotiations demonstrates that many competitors would prefer to partner with us rather than attempt to manufacture a complex product that is highly protected by IP.","Our commercial strategy ensures that the diamide technologies will continue to gain share. These new commercial partners will leverage different market access in different geographies and crops with different formulations than FMC has today. These actives will be additive to the overall growth of the FMC diamide franchise. For years past the patent expiration date, FMC will have a growing diamide business with a strong share of the market at the grower level and an even stronger share of the molecule at the manufacturing level.","Beyond our significant patent protection in commercial strategy, the complexity of manufacturing and scale of economies FMC enjoys are further under-appreciated aspects of the long-term strength of the diamides platform.","Today, FMC manufactures all the required intermediates in the 16-step process as well as the final Rynaxypyr products and our own active ingredient manufacturing plants all via partners under exclusive long-term agreement for a third party to replicate this complex supply chain and manufacturing network would be a major undertaking with very large capital requirements.","In addition, given the know-how we have in the scale of our operations, FMC's manufacturing cost will be substantially lower than any new entrant. This explains why we are confident, most companies that want to participate in the formulated diamide market will choose to do so in partnership with FMC.","In closing, I hope of addressed any misperceptions about the long-term sustainable growth of FMC's diamide franchise. Our deep patent estate proprietary regulatory data, manufacturing scale and knowledge, strong brand recognition as well as commercial approach will ensure that FMC is a company of choice to supply diamides to third party partners. This will further ensure that the diamides franchise continues to be a major driver of value for FMC through the end of the next decade and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you, Mark, for covering that important topic.","To conclude our prepared remarks, FMC delivered another quarter of financial performance despite the challenging Ag environment in the U.S. Volume demand and price increases in other regions around the world are continuing to deliver strong revenue and EBITDA growth. At the beginning of this month, we successfully launched a new SAP system with the pellets in Brazil.","The new system is performing very well. 20% of FMC now operates on the new S\/4 HANA system and we expect to complete the full implementation in Q2 2020. The Brazil launch is a major milestone in the implementation process which is giving us strong confidence, that we will be able to implement the full system without disrupting our operations.","In May, we indicated that we will provide an update on the R&D pipeline on today's call, but we felt more important to dispel misperceptions about our diamide franchise. Rather than squeeze an R&D update into a future earnings call, we will have more comprehensive and in-depth R&D investor event in the first half of this year.","FMC remains well-positioned to outperform the industry and our focus on crop chemicals and biological product is an advantage. Short-term execution is delivering superior quarterly results and we are confident that our current portfolio and technology pipeline will deliver longer-term growth.","I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you for your attention.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Chris Parkinson","As we enter 2020, you have a few moving parts on the cost front, including a new baseline for raw materials just given on what's happening in 2019, the SAP which you mentioned, as well as the roll off of the TSA among a few others. Can you just update us on your thoughts regarding the setup for the second half and also just into 2020? Kind of run rates et cetera, your general line of sight into these variables and your conviction on your ability to drive margins higher?","Pierre Brondeau","Sure, Chris. As you know, we had adverse cost and a part of those costs will not be seen next year. So we know we're going to start 2020 with a tailwind from a cost-standpoint and also from an FX standpoint. There is also the fact that we are expecting to get out of the TSA with DuPont and settled by Q2 2020the new SU on a system.","I look at two buckets. The total cost will be the increase in cost we are facing in 2019. We will not repeat themselves in 2020. But we will still see only a part of that coming. We have not yet quantified exactly how this will be impacting next year. We know it will be a tailwind but don't take the entire cost increase into 2020.","From an S\/4 HANA implementation and TSA, we still believe that the cost saving on an annual basis will be in the $60 million to $100 million a year, but we will only see fraction of that in 2020 and same thing, we have not yet quantified.","So we have two source of benefits from a cost standpoint that we will eliminate a bit more time most likely at the Q3 earnings call to give you a more qualified number. The other thing which is positive as we are seeing today and we are pleased with as the cost increase - decreasing in H2 as well as FX, price is sticking quite well.","So it's also a third tailwind we will see in 2020. You guys have to give us a bit more time. We're still highly focused on 2019. Those are tailwind for 2020. But we're hoping to quantify that in next two, three months.","Chris Parkinson","And just on the cash generation fronts. You put some targets out there which are kind of in the stark contrast to the old FMC, but obviously in a good way. Can you just comment on your progress on the cash conversion for 2019, what else needs to be done in the second half and into 2021 to kind of further drive that conversion up to a peak level potentially let's say 85ish%. Just any incremental color on the moving parts will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Pierre Brondeau","Yes, the cash, in fact there is not much change on the cash forecast for the year versus what we were expecting the difference as Andrew said in the prepared remarks was Q2 was not as cash generative as we are hoping, because we made the commercial decision to support our customers distributors and growers in Q2 we are facing tough very challenging time and give them some a break on the cash correlation, a big part of that has been paid as was promised and will be seen in Q3 and Q4. So not much change in term of the forecast outlook for the year, maybe a bit more weighted towards Q3, Q4, then we're expecting, Andrew you want to add anything?","Andrew Sandifer","So I think for the current year. I think Pierre comments are spot on. I do remind everyone that in the first half of last year, we did have some benefits to working capital that don't repeat related to the DuPont transaction both on inventories and payables, as well as a pretty market step down and in past news in Brazil.","So that comparison is a bit extreme. I think looking beyond 2019. I do think that long term 80%-ish conversion of free cash flow from net income. It's still very much in reach, we do need to see a step down in our legacy and transformation spending, which we anticipate as we move past the S-4 HANA implementation in the finalization of the DuPont integration. And continue to drive efficiency and working capital, but very much in reach.","I think this year's the cash flow forecast as Pierre mentioned, as staying where we are and really does give us the capacity to commit to large return of capital to shareholders, both through share repurchases and the dividend and the flexibility to do some incremental investment depending on opportunities through the rest of the year.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly","Pierre every quarter we get questions about whether the diamide growth can continue. I think, in addition to the confusion over the patents. There is some misunderstanding about how FMC goes to market with products versus the way the previous owner did, so can you talk about your market penetration and why you're confident about diamide growth?","Pierre Brondeau","I think there is not a fundamental difference in the way we go-to-market versus the previous owner. I think we just have a very different profile in terms of the crops to which we sell and the region of the world, which we sell. So, it allows us to, to keep on penetrating markets, which we are underpenetrated in the past by DuPont's, not because there is as much of a difference of approach and usage. Just because of the fact we are a different company and we are benefiting from position in crops, which are very strong crops for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr.","There is also the fact that as we've seen in the prepared remarks, we keep on getting registration, especially for sales appear in multiple countries and that is generating more growth. So when we look at the long term. I would not say that we would continue in the 15% to 25% growth rate of the franchise as we had last year and this year, but a long-range plan, we would be doing taking us way into the next 10 years. Looking for mid-single-digit to high single-digit growth rate for the diamide is very appropriate. Mark, do you want to add any color to this?","Mark Douglas","Yes, I think we're not finished with the sales synergies. So that's where a lot of the growth is coming from. So greater market access. Pierre said for Cyazypyr, we had - this year, we've had eight new registrations in eight different countries, both in Europe and in Africa. We continue to leverage our position with major co-ops and distributors in the South of Latin America in the U.S. and we have our new channel access in India, which is a large market for us.","So wherever those niche crops are in terms of what I would consider fruit and vegetables, that's why we're seeing continued growth. So you can focus on Asia, you can focus on the south of Europe. You can focus on the South of Latin America and Mexico.","Pierre Brondeau","There is a final point, maybe this point is a bit different from what the previous owner deal, those all the comments made by Mark. We are looking at Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr had a great partnering tool with other companies and as we said, we have partnership and are negotiating with about 15 companies.","We are allowing those companies under some conditions to sell Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr in different crops different part of the world. So those companies are increasing dramatically market reach and allowing us to grow faster and that is a very profitable way for us to grow the franchise, it's not at all EBITDA dilutive and it's a tool we intend to use for the years to come. I think our competitors understand well, the quality of the patent estate and are very willing to enter into those 10 years contract or more to partner with FMC on those molecules.","Mark Connelly","I want to follow up with a question about Brazil, you've obviously been exceptionally strong there and that's been a core strength of FMC for pretty much forever. We're starting to see some big retail players and distribution struggled down there and we've got a major North American retailer talking enthusiastically about that market. If we do see the Brazil ag retail market gradually shift to be more like the U.S., how is that going to affect you in Brazil and how realistic do you think it is that that happens given the massive differences in market structure down there?","Pierre Brondeau","So first, let me make a statement. As a large supplier of crop chemicals to the ag market, we like the U.S. structure. We do like to have large buyers, well established companies, public or private or corps, which play by the rules of the time and pay in time.","So we are not adverse at all to a market outside of the U.S. starting to structure itself more like a U.S. market. It is not - it's good from a cost standpoint, it's good from a cash standpoint, it's good from an operation standpoint.","Now, I still believe, if you look at the size of the growers in Brazil that we will see last distributors at our U.S. model happening, but it's going to take some time. It's a very big market, it's a market where there is a large number of large players, who are growers. Soto see a market where you go down to five or six or seven largest distributors like we have in U.S., I don't see that in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, a transition more towards the U.S. market is not a negative for us. Mark?","Mark. Douglas","Yes, only thing I would add to that is you've got some extremely large co-ops in the South of Brazil, which operate in a very similar way to the U.S. model in terms of scale and breadth of capabilities.","So I think in parts of Brazil, you already have more of a U.S. type model. I do think the market is consolidating in terms of distribution, you are seeing acquisitions and roll ups. I think that will continue. But as Pierre said, I think it will take some time to get to where we are in the U.S. for instance. But I do see it going in that direction.","Pierre Brondeau","And we don't see that as a negative at all.","Mark Douglas","No, not at all.","Operator","And next we go to line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","Mark, appreciate the review of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr patent protection time on that. Obviously, you mentioned that's $1.5 billion in terms of sales today, so very attractive. I just wanted to drill into one of the comments you made, that it would be very capital intensive for someone else to duplicate your supply chain. Can you give us an order of magnitude of what would be involved there in terms of dollars and cents?","Pierre Brondeau","It's complex to do, because understand that when you have a process which is 16 steps, which for us is done through a series of partners who are manufacturing some of the intermediates and some of the final steps, which are made by us, it is a very-very complex network.","You would not imagine somebody building that in a short period of time over a single site. So it would require not only capital spending at the level of the company itself, which intend to, but most likely to find partners to produce some of those intermediates.","None of these partners could be the partners we do have today, who are in exclusive arrangements with our sales for the long-term. The number is certainly, we have not quantified if somebody would try to replicate all or part of a product. But, I'd say, for part of the total, to see numbers more in the $1 billion range would not be surprising.","Frank Mitsch","Pierre, I believe you mentioned that at this point, here we sit on July 31st, you have 70% of orders already received to meet your second-half objectives. I'm just curious, how does that stand in prior years in terms of the percent of orders that you would already have in-house? Is that somewhat typical or is that a higher than normal sort of percentages?","Pierre Brondeau","It is the same as last year, which was a very strong year. So I would say the last two years, we reached that 70% number. Usually by this time of the year, we are about 40% to 50%, maybe 40% range at this time of the year. Last year for the first time, we hit the 70% range, which was positive and resulted into a very strong second half. And once again this year, we are at the same place. So we view that as a positive versus a normalized year.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar","Given the delayed planting inventories in the channel, question on that, if I look at your inventories, they are up year-over-year, so, like, compared to second quarter of last year. So was there any missed early application that led to inventory increase? And where do we stand about inventories?","The reason I'm asking is, couple of years ago we had this inventory situation in Brazil. That was painful and took some long time to get that inventories down. So how do you compare that situation?","Pierre Brondeau","Sure. So first of all, let me make a comment outside of North America. We are in low to normal level of inventories. So we currently have a situation in Brazil. Actually, we have a new process in place, as we said before. I think it's the lowest ever level of inventory in the channel we are having.","In other part of the world, we are under a more normal situation. We recognize that there was misapplication in North America. We are taking that into account in our forecast for the rest of the year where we have made plans which are contemplating not selling some product, which will already be in inventory and our customers or in the channel, or we have also accounted for returns.","So that's a place where we are facing fundamental difference from Brazil in 2015. Brazil in 2015 was a consequence of a process from all of the ag players over multiple years. We had multiple years of selling too much into the channel. Here it's a more isolated event over this year, because of weather conditions.","So we have a year which is difficult versus multiple years in 2015 where the channel was too loaded. So it is not good, but it is manageable, accounted for in our forecast. But we are still watching it. Mark, you want to say?","MarkDouglas","Yes, PJ, the only nuance I would put to what Pierre said about the U.S. is, the U.S. for us is really two core markets, what we call the Heartland's, which is the Midwest, mainly row crop business. And then the Horseshoe, which stretches all the way from California through the Southern states up the East Coast, very different situation in those two markets.","I would say, where we know we have or we think we have higher channel inventories, is in the Heartland on the row crops where we believe pre-emergent herbicides were missed in certain areas. But in the rest of the U.S., where all the niche crops are grown, we're in absolutely normal conditions. So it's very-very isolated to that part of the U.S. and that part of the business.","P.J. Juvekar","And a quick one for Andrew. Andrew, you mentioned the extended terms of payments in the U.S. for growers; can you talk about when did we do that last time and what was your experience back then?","Andrew Sandifer","Yes, we've done it on a very limited basis in the past. Our experience has always been that we catch right back up as agreed. Yes, I think, as I mentioned, over half the accommodations we gave in Q2 have already been paid at this point in Q3, and the rest will be cleared out by year-end.","So really just trying to support our customers as they work through their quarter end, and what's been a tough year. But historically, in this year, I think no concerns about the collection time and timing our ability on that.","Pierre Brondeau","And just a quick comment, PJ. I mean, we made that decision, it is not something we've done in the past or we used to do, it was just exceptional to the - especially in the Midwest, our customers were facing a situation where we felt we had to support them. Lots of them, as we said, are big corporations. They live by their word. They pay when they say they will repay and as Andrew say, as half of it has already been done with a very precise schedule. So, no concern. It's an exceptional situation, but no concern on this.","Operator","Next we move on to the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","A question on the CapEx potential expansion diamide, just wondering, is that decision a function of, sort of, your assessment of how much incremental inventory you want to have for your own needs or is it a function of, perhaps as you referenced in the patent discussion, maybe extending some of the license agreements or creating new license agreements with other interested parties or is it bit of both? And is this a significant capital expenditure? What time period would it be over and potentially where would it be located?","Andrew Sandifer","The CapEx increase, we are, looking at today are simply due to the fact that when we made our capital, three-year capital spend plan when we acquired the DuPont business. As you remember, we were forecasting a high single-digit growth rates for those products. We've been in the 15% to 25% range since the acquisition. So we are getting tight on capacity. Those are not big capacity it's for part of the chain of manufacturing well, we're doing it.","Especially, including some of the, the intermediate you\u2019re talking about of tens of millions of dollars you're not talking hundreds of millions of dollars, for the one which are taking place potentially this year. And as we said before, from a location standpoint we have a couple of locations, but as we said before, the idea for us is to manufacture you as much as we can today outside of China. So those expansions will take place outside of China. It's not huge, but it's necessary to ensure we can keep on growing at the speed at which we are growing.","Vincent Andrews","And if I could just follow up there's been a lot written recently about armyworm infestation in new geographies. I would assume that is an attractive opportunity for your diamides\u2019 portfolio. So is that something you've already contemplated sort of as we think about your long-term growth rate or would that be incremental?","Mark Douglas","Yes, it definitely is you know the diamides are right at the top of the tree when it comes to impacting for armyworm. We've seen the growth of these pests in India. We seen it in China and it's now moving through Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Thailand moving south. So we already have in our forecast, some incremental revenue from Rynaxypyr essentially - in those countries, but we believe there is more upside as this pest becomes more prevalent especially throughout the rest of South Asia.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson","All right downgrade to one question. Thanks guys I'm just kidding. Okay, so you've got it down, the market growth to about flat. So on rough math to me that will be like a $100 million or $200 million gear, excuse me $120 million of headwinds on the topline macro pressures. You've maintained your guidance like you said despite that, could you talk about what's offsetting some of that pressure down on the macro? Thanks.","Pierre Brondeau","Yes, you know, I think the pressure down in the market is mostly driven by North America as we said. So what does it do to us, if you look at the disproportionate strength of our business versus many competitors outside of North America plus the fact that within North America. We do have a very balanced crop profile with loss of specialty crops. The slowdown of the world growth in Ag is impacting us not as much as it could impact other competitors.","So yes, it is a bit of a headwind, but what, we are very well positioned to compensate that other by growing more into specialty crops in North America or by using the strength of our business in place like Brazil, Latin America or India. Remember, as we said, we only do 25% of our business in North America. So all in all, it is balancing out quite well for us.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don Carson","Yes, Mark a question for you on these commercial arrangements you're negotiating with other parties you say you out of the 50 now. What is the margin profitability on that and then as you bifurcate that into supplying generic AI's post patent what's the margin implications for that versus selling it on branded product?","Mark Douglas","So Don, we don't obviously give out the margin expectations. But what I put in my prepared remarks were the fact that when we have these agreements and we make these sales. They're not EBITDA dilutive to our overall business so when you think about it there are highly profitable marketing-exercise for us. Now on a pricing standpoint again, I'm not going to disclose the types of conditions we have in these various contracts, but they are very long-term in nature.","And obviously the prices that we agreed with outside parties allow them to make a more than adequate margin on their sales. So both parties are compensated for what we're doing in the marketplace. So the bottom line is, these are highly attractive relationships for us and doubt that party partners and they are there for the long term.","Pierre Brondeau","Let me quantify a bit by using information, we've already shared with you. As you know, we do have depending upon the quarters and EBITDA margin for this business in the 27%, 28%. This EBITDA margin of course is driven and we've said that when we made the acquisition of DuPont with the damage which are expected to be north of 30% from an EBITDA margin. That's what we are able, through this process to protect.","So we are selling this product, the active part to a partner and it's generating for us with limited SG&A spending and R&D and formulation spending an EBITDA margin north of 30%.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Laurence Alexander","Just one last one on the diamide discussion, as you've looked at the manufacturing chain that already exists for these products and FMC's historical approach to re-engineering the chain and finding new manufacturing partners. How should we think about the five to 10 year opportunity for bringing down the cost of manufacturing and should we see that in terms of lower market prices. So basically protecting the growth rate and protecting the margins, which we see it as margin expansion over time?","Mark Douglas","Yes Lawrence, I mean we have our whole engineering group looking at the diamide manufacturing processes and looking at how we can bring cost down over the mid to long-term. So, that's certainly something that we're not going to let pass. We know how to do this we've done it very successfully - not only our own molecules, but other molecules as well. I wouldn't comment on this point about price volume relationships in the marketplace going longer term.","In today's world, these molecules are highly valued. They produce tremendous results for their cost in use. So right now, we're growing the market at the right margin at the right price. I don't see that changing in the near term at all. So whatever we get in terms of manufacturing cost reductions over the mid-term will stay within FMC.","Pierre Brondeau","And we've already done in two years, in two years we've already done multiple debottlenecking, brought new partners into the process. So we already actively increasing capacity at very low cost you've not seen a major increase so far in capital spending despite the fact that we've already increased our capacity in a significant way for diamide. So your point is correct for both Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr. We are doing it and intend to continue to do it.","Operator","And our last question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Thanks for squeezing me in a two-part question on your capital budget. The first part is that you affirmed your range for the year at 140 to 160 yet you spent only $34 million in the first half. Looks like the last couple of years the spend has been quite back end loaded. So I was wondering if you could speak to what is driving that kind of quarterly cadence, number one. And then number two, do you have any preliminary thoughts on how the budget could trend in 2020 versus 2019?","Pierre Brondeau","So from a capital spending, I have been doing that for years now and I think it's been the same thing, year after year, which mean usually you start your big project, lots of your big projects are starting with - the beginning of the year, when you start with the new capital spending. So you usually highly process where there is a lot of planning an engineering study which do not represent a lot of spending. And then it accelerates by the middle of the year when things are already put in place and you start to spend the cash.","So I don't think there is anything abnormal, I must say that 70% or 80% of my years in the industry yeah I have always seen back-end loaded, big engineering product and capital expenditure. I think from next year today, we have not been yet through the process. We believe we\u2019ll have a higher capital spend, mostly due to capacity increase for the product we are commercializing new products for the existing product as the diamide.","Mark Douglas","Yes Kevin, the only thing - the attitude to what Pierre said is, basically we have two new active ingredients that are coming out of our pipeline that come to market in 2021. We're putting steel in the ground next year for that capacity expansion. So it's a combination of both current products and new pipeline products.","Pierre Brondeau","So you will see a slightly limited number next year for capital spend.","Michael Wherley","That's all the time that we have for the call today.

Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for both businesses at the revenue and earnings level. For Ag Solutions, the demand for our products, revenue synergies, and cost were very much in line with expectation we laid out a quarter ago. The business integration is on schedule and the commercial teams continue to perform very well. The strong global performance through the first half of 2018 combined with a high percentage of orders in hand for the rest of the year in Latin America gives us great confidence for our second half.","Beyond the immediate future, we continue to see very strong growth potential for our acquired portfolio, especially Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls. On the technology front, the integration of our R&D organization is progressing very well and is confirming the strength of our expanded pipeline. We remain on track to launch our first new active ingredient from the legacy FMC R&D pipeline the fungicide, Bixafen, in North America later this year.","The Lithium business, which we recently announced, will be named Livent Corporation, continues to perform strongly with demand for differentiated performance products continuing to grow. Realized prices and delivered volume are in line with our previous expectations. We remain on track to list Livent in an October 2018 IPO, which will be followed by a direct spin to FMC shareholders within six months.","Turning to slide 3, FMC reported second quarter revenue of just over $1.25 billion, which was nearly double the revenue from Q2 2017. Adjusted EPS was $1.78 in the quarter, which was $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 270% versus the same period a year ago. The guidance beat was mainly due to stronger operational performance driven by revenue growth in Ag Solutions and the combination of higher pricing and favorable customer mix in Lithium.","Moving to slide 4 and Ag Solutions, revenue of about $1.15 billion in the quarter nearly doubled year-over-year on a reported basis and increased 8% on a pro forma basis, with zero net impact from foreign currencies. We continue to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities and our global sales force delivered another impressive performance in its second full quarter with the combined portfolio.","You can see in the bridge on the right side of this page that we saw top line growth on a pro forma basis in every region for the second consecutive quarter. Stepping back and taking a look at the first half revenue, we delivered a very strong performance with 11% pro forma growth. This was led by the acquired insecticides, Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control, which grew 24% and continue to gain market share and demand across every region.","Second quarter segment EBITDA of $344 million was triple the earnings from the year-ago quarter, and was $14 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Segment EBITDA margin was 30% on strong mix and a continued focus on cost control. This performance was achieved despite the broader challenges faced by the chemical industry.","The Chinese government has been shutting down facilities and industrial parks as part of their environmental strategy. These shutdowns have limited the supply of certain active ingredients and intermediates causing shortages of material and, in certain cases, rising raw material cost.","FMC has been able to mitigate and manage the impact on our ability to supply our customers, thanks to a global diversified supply network. We are very pleased with our margin performance in today's environment and believe this will grow in future years as the portfolio continues to shift to higher margin product.","Turning now to slide 5, Q2 revenue growth was strong on a pro forma basis in every region. North America revenue increased 8%; Europe revenue grew 3%; Latin America revenue grew 21%; and Asia revenue increased 6%.","In North America, we performed well compared to the broader crop protection market, which we estimate was down low to mid-single digit. We saw very strong volume growth for insecticide, mostly driven by Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control. We are also seeing strong demand for our latest Authority branded herbicide, Authority Supreme, as the market for pre-emergent herbicide continues to grow due to increasing weed resistance.","In Europe, despite difficult growing condition, our business grew 3%, which was ahead of the crop protection market that we believe was down low single digit on a U.S. dollar basis. The market conditions were in line with the strength of our portfolio. The insecticide and herbicide market performed better than the fungicide market which was weak. Consequently, we have seen strong growth of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control.","In Latin America, our business grew 21% on a pro forma basis, which is a very positive indicator of underlying demand for our products even in a seasonally lighter quarter. This strong performance is primarily due to a low channel inventory in Brazil and our crop exposure across the region. The Brazilian crop protection market is healthy. FMC's sales in Brazil grew an impressive 35% in Q2, driven by strong demand for our legacy FMC herbicides and insecticides. Mexico also delivered a strong performance, driven by expansion of niche crop applications.","In Asia, we saw strong pro forma growth in nearly all countries. In India, we have made significant change in our market access model as we highlighted on the last call. This change to the super distributor model is going extremely well and delivered mid-teen revenue growth on a pro forma basis, led by strong demand for Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control.","In China, our legacy rice herbicides drove a double-digit sales increase on a pro forma basis, as we continue to gain traction in a market that is trending toward higher value crop protection product.","Growth in these two major markets, along with a host of smaller ones in the region, was more than enough to offset the impact we felt from significantly weaker demand in Australia due to the severe drought.","Moving now to Lithium on slide 6. Lithium delivered another strong quarter, with revenue up 46% compared to Q2 last year and segment EBITDA of $51 million, 85% higher than a year ago. We continue to see very strong customer demand for FMC's performance product. Higher realized prices remained the primary driver on a year-over-year growth, with hydroxide, carbonate, and lithium metal prices each up at least 20%.","Volumes were also higher in all major products as increased production in Argentina, increased hydroxide production and higher demand in BuLi all contributed to the year-over-year growth. Our Q2 EBITDA margin of 48% was higher than our full year margin forecast of 45% at the midpoint, due mainly to favorable customer mix in the first half of the year.","Turning to slide 7 which summarizes our outlook for the full year and for the third and fourth quarters. We still expect adjusted earnings per share for full year 2018 to be between $5.90 and $6.20 per share. At the midpoint of the range, this represents an increase of 123% versus 2017 EPS. Third quarter 2018 adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.87 and $0.97, and fourth quarter 2018 adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.41 and $1.61.","We expect 2018 Ag Solutions revenue will be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. On a pro forma basis, this equates to a 9% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. We also expect Ag Solutions' EBITDA will be in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.23 billion.","Our expectations for the overall crop protection market remain unchanged from what we said in May. We continue to expect the global crop protection chemical market on a U.S. dollar basis to be flat to up low-single digit in 2018. We expect North America to be down mid-single digits, Europe to be up low to mid-single digits, Latin America to be up mid to high-single digit, and Asia to be flat to up low-single digit.","For FMC, third quarter Ag Solutions revenue is expected to be in the range of $870 million to $930 million, and fourth quarter segment revenue is expected to be in the range of $980 million to $1.1 billion. These revenue forecasts represent pro forma growth rate of low-single digit in Q3 and low-double digit in Q4.","The third quarter is a low season for the majority of our market, and it will be the lowest sales quarter for FMC from now on. In 2018, this is magnified by internal events which are moving sales into Q4. In any major integration process, there often are delayed closings of countries and sites due to legal entity, registration and permit transfers under local laws.","Since the close of the transaction with DuPont, we have known and planned for delayed closings. DuPont is operating certain countries and sites on our behalf under our direction, and we are receiving the economic benefit. The majority of this delayed countries and sites along with the related permits, licenses and registration are being transferred to FMC in Q3, thus creating a temporary sales blackout period in Q3. These sales will occur in Q4.","FMC's outperformance versus the crop protection market in the first half of 2018 will continue as we expect second half Ag Solution revenues to grow 7% on a pro forma basis. We have very high confidence in our forecast as our visibility into Latin America, which represents roughly 40% of expected revenue for the period, has increased versus previous seasons.","In particular, in Brazil, we have over 70% of our orders in hand to reach our full year target, which is meaningfully above what we have seen in past years. Segment EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $195 million to $215 million in Q3, and in the range of $275 million and $315 million in Q4.","Our guidance implies nearly 60% of 2018 Ag Solutions' EBITDA occurred in the first half of the year. This is a reversal of the ratio in previous years when 40% of segment earnings were generated in the first half. The shift is driven by the acquired business, which is much more heavily weighted on the first half.","Moving over to Lithium, we expect full year segment revenue to be in the range of $430 million to $460 million, a year-over-year increase of 28% at the midpoint. We are increasing our full year EBITDA forecast by $2 million to a range of $195 million to $205 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of 41% at the midpoint.","Our Q3 guidance for the segment is for revenue to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million and EBITDA to be between $45 million and $49 million, each representing a year-over-year increase of 17% at the midpoint.","I will now turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew David Sandifer - FMC Corp.","Thanks, Pierre. Let me start this morning with the income statement, specifically taxes and the impacts of foreign exchange. We've lowered our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to a range of 16% to 18%, a reduction of 50 basis points at the midpoint of the range, driven by our updated forecast of the mix of earnings across various jurisdictions. The 16.5% adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter brings our year-to-date provision for taxes in line with this updated guidance.","Foreign exchange impacts on revenue were a net zero in the second quarter for our Ag Solutions segment, with euro strength offsetting weakness in key Latin American currencies, aided by ongoing price increases. For the Lithium business, FX was a modest tailwind in the quarter.","Looking to the remainder of the year, we will, as always, be watching the Brazilian real closely. We manage our currency exposures throughout the year and this year is no different. With the combination of price increases and our hedging activities, we expect to completely offset any FX headwinds in the Ag Solutions business in the second half and the full year.","Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, net debt at June 30 was $2.75 billion, down more than $150 million from the beginning of this year, reflecting solid cash generation and the pay down of $100 million of outstanding term loan debt in the quarter.","Turning to slide 8, FMC generated adjusted cash from operations of $287 million in the first half of 2018, up 34% compared to the prior year period, driven by higher EBITDA. We also benefited from lower working capital build of the DuPont acquisition than was previously expected.","Looking to the full year, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted cash from operations by $100 million to a range of $650 million to $750 million. This increase is driven by our updated forecast for the working capital build for the acquired DuPont business, supported by our continued expectation for strong EBITDA.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Andrew. First, a comment on the Lithium separation. We remain on track to IPO Livent this October. We made a confidential filing with the SEC in June, and we will file a public version of the S-1 in late August. Securities laws require us to reduce the commentary we provide on the Lithium business now that we are within 30 days of its public filing. Therefore, we will not be able to undertake substantial Q&A on the Lithium business today.","We feel very good about the direction FMC is headed as we move to becoming a standalone agricultural sciences company. The business delivered another strong quarter, and we have high confidence on our second half estimate. Our full year pro forma revenue growth will be significantly above the market growth rate in 2018, and our disciplined approach to cost will help drive an EBITDA margin approaching 30% for the full year.","The integration of the acquired business is progressing very well, and our SAP implementation is on track for the end of 2019, which will drive significant margin improvement from 2020 and beyond. Growth synergies are being realized faster than we would have expected nine months ago as our new portfolio is gaining well adoption with our strategic customers. We expect to outperform the crop protection market for the foreseeable future.","Before moving to Q&A, I would like to remind you we are hosting an Investor Day in New York on December 3rd and we hope to see many of you there.","I will now turn the call back to Michael Wherley.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Pierre. As we're in a quiet period for the Lithium business, we're happy to answer questions on the first half performance of that business. But we're very limited in what we can say about the future, so we may choose not to answer some forward-looking questions at this time. Please frame your questions in that light. Operator, you can now begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America.","Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you and good morning. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. In the agricultural outlook for 3Q, could you help describe the moving pieces in the lower margin of legacy business, or currency and maybe some of those trucking issues in Brazil or perhaps compare the margin structure in 3Q to what it would have been pro forma for 3Q of 2017?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","That's a lot of questions at the same time. Yeah, Q3, as we explained \u2013 first of all, Q3 and \u2013 has to be, and will be in the future the lowest season. So, if you think about it, the margin, the EBITDA margin for the business is very much the result that your SG&A and your R&D cost go against a gross margin which is lower because the revenue is lower. So, the math just makes you end up with an EBITDA margin which is lower. So, it's purely the fact that your below-the-line cost doesn't move as the spending is about the same every quarter, while your revenues are lower.","Historically, Q3 has always been a low quarter, because Europe is non-existing, and Asia and North America are fairly low, while Brazil mostly start in September. It is magnified with the new portfolio, which is much more of an Asia, North America, Europe portfolio making the first half even stronger and Q3 even weaker. So, for the future, I think we have to expect Q3 to be the month with the lowest revenue, consequently with the lowest EBITDA, and consequently with the lowest EBITDA margin.","From a currency standpoint, if you look at each half and the full year, we are pretty much \u2013 not pretty much, we are going to offset any headwind we will be seeing from currencies and mostly the real by a combination of our hedging strategy and our price increase. Now, if you look at the two quarters, I would say we might be slightly lagging in Q3. So, you might have a slight negative impact of FX in Q3. And you will have more of a positive impact when we're really in the full season in Brazil in Q4.","Last question, I think last point of your question was around the truck and trucking strike. And maybe I'll let Mark add a couple of sentence. There is no direct impact of the trucking strike on the crop chemical industry. There could be some side effect to the agricultural industry, maybe Mark you want to comment on that?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I think the way we're structured in terms of our logistics contracts for Brazil, we are not seeing and not expecting any issues when it comes to supply of trucks to move our materials. And let's be honest, a lot of our materials are extremely concentrated. So, we tend to ship a lot less volumes unlike some of the other Ag inputs such as fertilizers which are extremely bulky.","I think the other impact you might see if this doesn't get resolved, it's not necessarily for this year but certainly into Q1 when the harvest starts, is how the grains get moved to the ports. And I think you've heard a number of the grain traders talking about that already. So, those are maybe the two impacts right at the front end of the season in terms of fertilizers and right at the back end in terms of grains. But as far as FMC is concerned, we don't see any issues in terms of delivery.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Now, let me finish to answer your broad question around Q3. Something I want to be \u2013 to make very clear. Q3 is always a difficult quarter to predict. We do have today \u2013 you could see, and I'm not forecasting, it's hypothetical, but you could easily see $40 million or $50 million in Latin America or specifically in Brazil shifting from Q4 to Q3. We have a very strong cotton season ahead of us, and the customers might decide to secure supply earlier, and that would create a shift in the buying pattern. If that will happen, we would rebalance the growth rate of Q3 and Q4 to a level which are much more in the same range.","Finally, I hope I was clear in my explanation around what we are facing, pure integration process. We knew about it. But there is a few countries like Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam or a site in Brazil where there is a delayed transfer to the company. We knew about it. That creates a blackout in sales. Those sales are not lost. The orders are taken, but the sales will be delivered and accounted for in Q4. So, that comes and creates more noise and creates a lower Q3 than we should have.","Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, on the Lithium business, how has spot prices declining in China affected contract negotiations in the first half of the year?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","So, most of the contract negotiations for us for any business we have under contract is done in the back end of the year. So, we have very little contract negotiation in the first half of the year. So, today, as we said for hydroxide, carbonate and even metal price are up over 20% year-on-year. We participate very little in the lithium carbonate spot market. But I can tell you for our sales (31:41) between Q1 and Q2, sequentially, pricing are also up for hydroxide and carbonate. So we are seeing sequential up pricing as well as very strong year-on-year pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jester with Citi.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to ask you about the comment you made in your prepared remarks about your order book for Brazil and how it's much stronger today than maybe it's been in the past. Is this something specific that you're doing to build an order book differently this year, or is this something that's more a market drive \u2013 market driven driving early orders?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think it's purely market driven. It is the fact that we have been very, very careful in supplying the market. So, there is a very low inventory in the channel of the FMC product. Consequently, our customers who have a pretty good visibility on their demand are placing orders and firm orders at an early stage.","So, I would say we are in a much more normalized situation in Brazil and because we keep on being very careful even today in a high demand period in not supplying product when they are not absolutely required to keep a low level of inventory in the channel, we're getting very strong demand. Now, I said 70%, and I'm not saying that jokingly. I said 70% because we wrote a remark a few days ago, but the number is already above 70%. So I think it's one \u2013 it's been a long time since we had such a high amount of orders in hand before (33:36).","Mark, maybe you want to give more color?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No. I do believe that the last few years of working down those channel inventories have served us very well, and we're in a very advantageous position. I also do believe that our crop focus in Brazil is going to serve us very well as we go through the rest of this year.","Cotton increased significantly over the last season in terms of acreage and prices were good. So, the cotton growers are once again looking at a pretty significant increase in acreage going forward. So, we're eyeing that market not only with the acquired portfolio, but with our legacy portfolio. So, we expect significant growth there.","And then, overall, with what is happening around the world on soy, obviously the growers in Brazil are feeling very bullish about their acreage. So, we expect to see acres increase in Brazil as well for soy.","So, for us, it's a combination of a lot of hard work over the last two to three years to get ourselves in good shape, and then an advantageous market position right now.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then actually that touches exactly what I have on my follow-up question, Mark, is with what's going on with soy, I think the conventional wisdom is that Brazil is going to sell a bit more to China, and the U.S. will need to find new suppliers to sell their soybeans. Is FMC agnostic between a planted soybean acre in Brazil versus a planted soybean acre in the U.S.? And I just wonder if long-term the U.S. plants less soybeans, what kind of impact that could have on FMC's business given how important soybeans are for you. Thanks.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I mean, it's a good follow-up question. I mean, just over 20% of our portfolio is exposed to soy around the world. There's one country you're forgetting in that mix which is Argentina, which is a big country for us. We have a significant pre-emergent herbicide business down in Argentina, and obviously the acquired insecticide portfolio is important to us down there as well.","Yeah, we are pretty agnostic. I mean, we're growing in all three regions. Soybeans will be provided around the world from one of those three or all three. So, for us, it's \u2013 we really don't mind. We want to grow in all three and we'll grow with our technologies.","Operator","Your next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. We're clearly seeing the benefits of the combined portfolio given the pro forma growth rates you showed in the first half. You're guiding to a strong 2H top line expectation as well, but maybe at a decelerated rate versus the first half. Could you give us some context here?","And then maybe secondly, can you opine on the growth drivers for Ag as you move beyond 2018? What contribution do you think is possible from new formulations and the acquired DowDuPont product pipeline that you receive?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I'll take the first part, and Mark will take the second part on the new technology. I think, yes, we had a very strong first half and that was driven by the demand on our insecticide. We believe Rynaxypyr, Cyazypyr are still the benchmark molecules in the insecticide market, and they grew 24%. So, we believe that the quality of the portfolio plus the customer synergies are creating a very significant market share gain. We actually \u2013 the overall portfolio of FMC in the first half grew also a healthy 17%. So, we believe we are in very strong position now.","When you move in H2, and I think the right way to look at this business within H1, H2, there is \u2013 we foresee a deceleration versus H1. It is mostly because, as we said before, the DuPont acquired business is much more of an H1 business, and that business is growing faster than the legacy FMC business. So, if you look at the Latin America and Brazil, the growth will be driven a lot by the herbicide and insecticide from the FMC portfolio and to some extent, the acquired business, but less. That is why we do have an 11% growth rate in the first half, and we would expect to be more in the 7% range in the second half of the year.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. With regard to the portfolio, we've talked numerous times about the strength of the two combined portfolios coming together. We launched our first product, as Pierre said in the script, Bixafen, a fungicide targeted at North America later this year, so for the 2019 season. We pretty much have launches coming every year after that, certainly through the mid part of the decade, and actually we expect some more products to come that will be hitting later in the decade.","We've had a metric for some time that we think of in terms of products introduced over the last five years. That's kind of a metric that we had in the legacy FMC in terms of how efficient we are in turning over the portfolio. We're going to be revamping that metric, and we'll talk more about that at the Investor Day in early December. But you can expect a healthy increase in formulations that are coming to market not just new active ingredients.","I talked on the prior calls about the number of registrations we have coming for the acquired portfolio. We have similar numbers for the legacy FMC portfolio in terms of both herbicides and new fungicide mixtures. So, it's a very robust portfolio going forward starting in 2019.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And maybe I was hoping you could comment on the impact of the Argentine peso on FMC Lithium in the quarter? I was surprised a large devaluation didn't result in a bigger impact and it doesn't seem to be, let's say, factored into your guidance.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","The Argentine peso was a tailwind in the second quarter. I think, Paul, maybe you want to...","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Yeah. It was \u2013 look, you have to understand that our exposure to the peso is \u2013 it doesn't seem \u2013 it's not as large as people seem to believe. It was less than $1 million tailwind to the EBITDA in the quarter. It is factored in for the rest of the year. Clearly, you have to bear in mind that one of the drivers of the depreciation of the peso is cost inflation. And so we do have an offsetting cost in peso terms. By the time you've washed through all those, we're not seeing a huge tailwind or headwind for peso devaluation year-to-date.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question will come from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","I just want to reconcile something you're talking about expecting a bit of the sales blackout on some of the DuPont sales moving from Q3 to Q4. It looks like you have a $900 million revenue guide for Q3 for Ag and $1 billion for Q4, give or take. How much revenue is roughly swinging from Q3 to Q4, because if Q3 is the lowest quarter of the year for Ag, it seems like Q4 in a normalized basis would be very similar to Q3?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. If you look at the \u2013 right now, at the numbers for revenue in Q3, we have about $200 million differential in the two quarters from the sales. Yeah, $140 million differential between the two quarters in Q3 and Q4. So, that is a bigger differential than we've seen in the past, and it's a big \u2013 if you remove the impact of the blackout sales, we are not talking about $100 million of blackout sales. We are talking about tens of millions of dollars. So, I think every $10 million is about 1%. So, if you have a few $10 millions, you can bring another 2% or 3% more in a quarter. So, that's the kind of shift we are talking about.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question now comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Yes. Good morning. Thank you. Just to confirm, the sales blackout is purely an accounting issue, and the sales are actually being made and booked by DuPont at this time?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","No. It's more of a sale recognition. It's just \u2013 when we have the orders, and we do have the product, the only question is if we can \u2013 so, we have a firm order, we have the product, it's only a matter of being entitled to register the sale, ship the product, and do have revenue recognition. So, it's already as soon as we get the registration or the legal entity transferred or the permit, then we do ship and do the revenue recognition. It's purely a revenue recognition, legal issue for us to be able to account for the sales.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","So you're waiting for government approval to ship the product. Is there any risk that this slips further into next year and you don't get that approval in Q4?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","No, absolutely not, because when you do delayed sites, you do transfer the site only when everything is secured and ready to go. So it is not a full quarter for us. I think it's going to depend on the place, but sometimes it's a couple of weeks, sometimes it's a month. It's mostly impacting a part of July or a part of August. But it is not something \u2013 there is no questions around the delayed transfers.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good morning. My question is about this sort of more pronounced or acute seasonality that you're referring to with the new portfolio. Just wondering if what emerged \u2013 new information emerged last quarters about the enthusiasm around both the cross-selling opportunities with the DuPont business as well as a strong pipeline of the new registrations. I'm just wondering if there's anything about this that is \u2013 as we now have two and a half quarters of the DuPont business having closed, anything about this more pronounced seasonality that's inconsistent with those views about cross-selling opportunities and the new registration pipeline associated with the new chemistries?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","No. We feel actually the same, if not stronger. Just to look at the number, we have a \u2013 if you look at the total forecast in sales, at the end of Q1, we were expecting for the full year to see a growth rate for the company for the full year in the 7% to 8% range. We are forecasting today for the full year 9% range. So, our level of confidence around growth synergies has enormously increased versus where we were at the end of last year and increased to some extent versus where we were at the end of the first quarter.","So, there is no change. It's only a situation where Q3 is a quarter where the acquired business is a very low percentage of the overall portfolio, and there is less demand for this business. So, it's an historical low quarter for DuPont and it was for us. That's all there is. But there is no \u2013 if anything, we are increasing the forecast in term of growth and speed at which we are creating synergies versus what we said at the end of the first quarter.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And if I had to follow-up on the Lithium business and just about the market and the industry more generally there, there's disconnect between spot prices in China, and obviously you and other sort of incumbent players are seeing obviously strong both year-over-year and sequential pricing trends tied to the contract that you guys have both inked and are rolling over.","So, the question is about the spot price, one possible explanation or plausible explanation is just that in China you have a surplus of either low-grade spodumene or DSO that's generally low quality that the conversion industry over there is constrained, and therefore, there's kind of a surplus of that sort of material in inventory over there, which is sort of creating the sort of short-term phenomenon of de-stocking.","Do you sort of view it that way? Do you feel that's a plausible explanation? And the other thing that might be contributing, of course, is this longer term shift towards high nickel cathode chemistries that's favoring hydroxide, therefore, maybe spurring some destock on the carbonate side in China? Any thoughts on if those are plausible explanations and the disconnect? Thanks.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","This is Paul. I think your second explanation there really goes to the heart of it. What we've seen in Q2 particularly, bear in mind that the new Chinese rebates and incentive structures really kicked in in June. And what we saw early in the year, in the first half of the year, one of the underlying trends that we've seen is a more rapid move towards hydroxide-based cathode technologies than we had expected.","And what we're seeing is, as the new rebates and incentives kick in, a retooling going on amongst the cathode manufacturers to be able to meet those energy density and other requirements of the new incentive programs. To do that, we've seen plants closing down while they retool. We've seen certainly a drawdown of their own inventory of carbonate as they finish production of cathodes that are using carbonate. And we've seen an increased focus on their part as where they will secure the hydroxide from. And there is a significant disconnect between the availability of carbonate and the availability of qualified usable hydroxide in China and elsewhere in the world.","I'll keep making the point until I maybe go blue in the face that this Chinese spot market for carbonate is not a really very useful market even if it is a market to look at. It carries very little informational content for the overall state of the market of what customers are looking for with them on contracting strategies. So, while I recognize that people pick up on that data, it's leading everybody down the wrong path as to what the true fundamentals of the market are, I'm afraid.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you. Pierre, do you think that your raw materials and sourcing are going to have to shift towards India if China keeps up the pressure on producers, and where else would you be increasing your sourcing?","And second question, before the DuPont deal, you've been expanding some of your basic R&D through collaboration. Is that still strategically important, and how does it fit together with your big R&D efforts now?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, when we look at the manufacturing strategy, we've been looking and starting to diversified our manufacturing from different location. India is a location, but I can tell you also that we have moved some of the manufacturing for some intermediates, for example, toward Europe with some partners and towards some of our plants in Europe and other locations.","So, yes, over time, there is a strategy to keep on investing in China where we do have a stronger \u2013 strong partnership and players, but certainly diversification will take place. We'll produce more in India, but you have also to look at Europe and North America as potential places where we will be generating most \u2013 generating some of our products which are critical.","I think also one critical aspect of what we do, and that's why we got out of the tough situation in the first half of the year, what the organization in Ag has done for years is always, always make sure that your key molecule or intermediates, you have multiplied suppliers who are qualified and registered. I think it's very important; you cannot be depending, even in China, solely on one. So, you always have to have two or three or four capable suppliers to be able to manage potential shutdown.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","On the question of the R&D, your point is a good one, Mark, that we did have strong collaborations in the past as legacy FMC. And obviously, now, we're very heavily into basic research. That basic research actually helps when it comes to collaborations because what it means is you have technology that you can actually, in the broadest sense, trade for new technologies.","I'll give you an example. FMC, we're very interested in expanding our fungicide portfolio. That may mean that in the future we're willing to trade technologies that we're developing in terms of herbicides or insecticides to get access to new fungicides. Our ability to do that is vastly enhanced with the capabilities that we acquired last year.","So, for us, it's very much a game that we know very well. We've played it very successfully over the last five years. And we will continue to keep that tool in our toolbox as we look to continue to broaden that portfolio of technologies.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the Brazilian real and your exposure in Latin America. The last time we saw the real under pressure like this, you ended up seeing a lot of challenges in your business. Can you just talk a little bit, Pierre, about how the business has changed since the last time FX was an issue in Brazil and comment in a little more detail on what steps you're taking to mitigate this impact in the second half? I think you mentioned price increases and hedging activities. Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Absolutely. I think we learned a lot from 2015, and we'll do all we can not to get back to a situation equivalent. I think we are very close to what is going on in Brazil, and we are looking at it from two different angle, and I'll ask Andrew to talk about the hedging.","I think, first, on the pricing, we do have a very tight connection between the currency and the price list, and as long as there is not very, very abrupt change over a few weeks of significant amount, I think now we are structured from the way we negotiate price and establish the price list to be very much in line with the currencies. And also remember that only half of our business in Brazil is dollar denominated. So, we've moved from the less vulnerable business with a tighter control of the pricing. And I have to say, since the beginning of the year, we've been doing very well in connecting pricing.","Plus, Andrew, could you talk about the change of approach we had to hedging, and how do we do that to limit potential issues on the one side (54:34)?","Andrew David Sandifer - FMC Corp.","Sure. Thanks. I'll speak to two things. I think \u2013 since 2015, I think we've become much more systematic and routine in the way we approach hedging the BRL. It's been our practice since 2015 to hedge a significant portion of the anticipated BRL denominated sales once we have a confirmed order from the customer.","Now, it can be some time between confirming the order with the customer and actually invoicing the sale. So, that protects us from BRL movements between that time of confirming the order, fixing the order with the customer and actually invoicing the sale. This year, as we saw higher volatility and anticipated some continued volatility in the currency in Brazil, we also chose to do some additional hedging, hedging a portion of our sale, anticipated sales in advance of confirming orders where we felt confident on the demand to take some of the risk in terms of their ability to move price sheet fast enough against rapid movements in the currency off the table.","So it's really a combination of regular, systematic, as we confirm orders, taking that risk off the table and then some additional work we did this year to prepare for potential volatility in the currency through the year.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then I wanted to ask also about the Asia Ag business. You mentioned the strength in the rice markets in India and China. Is that related to market dynamics or just some new application wins since the combination with DuPont? Could you just talk a little bit about how you're positioned for growth in the rice market in Asia going forward?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah, sure. Three very big markets: India, China and Southeast Asia. I think taking India first, we made a significant step this year in changing the legacy FMC go-to-market model by adopting the acquired super distributor model. That is affording us opportunities where we were selling some very key products from the legacy FMC portfolio into that new channel. And also, I would say having a broader access channel in rice with the acquired portfolio, i.e., continuing to take market share with insecticides in India.","In China, slightly different story. We introduced a very, very good rice herbicide in 2017 that is continuing to gain traction in China. That combination with sales synergies with the acquired portfolio is helping drive both pieces of the portfolio, so hence, a very strong first half in China for us.","And then laterally, in Southeast Asia, obviously, the acquired portfolio complements very well the legacy FMC rice portfolio, and we have a very good market access in places like Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. And now, with the acquired assets, we get more access to key countries such as Vietnam. So, overall, for us, it's a lot of sales synergies and a very good strong portfolio in terms of herbicides as well as insecticides.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning. Mark, it sounds like channel inventory levels of crop protection chemicals are quite low in Brazil. I was wondering if you could comment on the levels that you're seeing in your other key markets, at least in terms of outliers, including both your perception of industry inventories and FMC's own inventory levels?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. I think, in general, I would say, from an FMC perspective, we're feeling very good about our channel inventories around the world. Obviously, we've focused for the last few years on Brazil, absolutely no issues for FMC in Brazil.","I think North America, we've talked about where we've had insecticide, legacy insecticide inventories in terms of corn rootworm applications. That certainly still holds true, although we are seeing more pressure on corn rootworm than we have in the last few years. So, we'll see how this season develops.","Market, in general, is probably going to be spotty depending on different companies' portfolios. I would say the biggest area that I see going forward is Europe. Given the extremely dry conditions in Europe, I would expect to end this season with higher than normal channel inventories of fungicides, just given the market conditions.","India and China, China has elevated inventory levels mainly because of both weather and market conditions there. The rest of the world, pretty much okay. I would expect \u2013 oh sorry, one more, Australia, I would think Australia will end up with very high channel inventories given the severe drought that we've seen this season.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's helpful. And then perhaps for Paul, I just wonder if you could comment on the sequential pattern of earnings in Lithium as per your EBITDA guide. Is the decrement that you expect there a function of volume, price or other factors if I compare your stated guide for 3Q versus 2Q? Not sure if you can answer that or what you can tell us that might be helpful to discern that.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I think there is one factor you have to bear in mind in this business. And as we mentioned in Q1 and we'll mention it again today, and it will be a feature of this business really for a while which is the timing of which to ship to different customers in different regions in hydroxide business can meaningfully move the margin, revenue in any given quarter. Most of the contracts are annual contracts, but we don't necessarily ship everything to every customer on an equal basis through the year. So, we certainly, and I think we've talked about this, saw a richer mix of customers in the first half than we expect in the second half.","So, if you look at our full year guidance, strip out what you saw in the first half, you'll see the impact of essentially equalizing throughout the first year. I just encourage people not to assume that the first half margin is replicable across the entire year, and instead look at our full-year guidance. Just bear in mind that almost all of our contracting is done on an annual basis. And both volumes and price are pretty much predetermined by the time we start the year. So it is simply a question of timing as to when we ship to which customer that drives some of these movements.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","It's all the time that we have for the call today. As always, I'm available following the call to address any questions you may have. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. That's all the time we have for today. This concludes the FMC Corporation's second quarter 2018 earnings release conference call. Thank you."],"9495":["FMC Corp.

Phone lines will be placed on listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. You may begin.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Mark Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pierre will review FMC's third quarter performance and provide the outlook for 2018 and the fourth quarter. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial results. All three will then address your questions.","The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and the 2018 outlook statement, are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for both businesses at the revenue and earnings level. It also was a quarter for executing on our commitments. The Ag Solutions business performed very well in a seasonally weak Q3, driving 5% pro forma sales growth, which was about 300 basis points higher than our forecast, despite an estimated 4% to 5% headwind from foreign currencies.","Revenue synergy continued to boost results and demand in Brazil was very strong in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not have precise data from DuPont in 2017 to calculate exact year-over-year impact from FX, pricing, or volume, but we base our FX estimates on what we saw in our legacy businesses.","In Q3, we successfully transferred to FMC delayed sites and country from the DuPont acquisition. As discussed on our last earnings calls, these transfers did result in a shift of revenue into Q4 that was in line with our expectation, but they will not result in any missed sale for the full year. There remain one more delayed transfer, a small formulation site in India, that will occur in the second half of 2019. We expect no impact on business results.","On business integration is on schedule and we have begun the systematic rollout of the new SAP S\/4HANA system starting with our corporate finance function. The complete rollout will be implemented by the end of 2019.","On the technology front, we are on track to launch our first new active ingredient from the legacy FMC R&D pipeline in North America in the first quarter of 2019. This fungicide will be branded Lucento, and is based on the active ingredient Bixafen.","Our Lithium segment performed strongly in Q3, and we successfully completed the IPO of approximately 15% of Livent Corporation on schedule last month to begin the separation of that business. Last night, we announced our intent to spin-off the remaining 85% to FMC shareholders in the form of a dividend of Livent's shares on March 1, 2019. The spin will complete the full separation and is expected to be tax-free to FMC shareholders.","FMC Lithium will remain a reporting segment of FMC in the fourth quarter of this year, but will be reported as discontinued operations when we report first quarter results next year, assuming the spin is completed in March.","We have significantly reduced debt this year, having paid down nearly $600 million of debt through October. Andrew will expand on this topic later on the call and describe the rationale for an announcement to buy back $200 million of FMC stocks by year-end. Our five-year strategic plan is complete and being implemented. We will share it with you at our Investor Day on December 3.","We are proud that we have been able to make significant progress on all our major initiatives that we set out to accomplish at the beginning of this year, including the DuPont integration, our SAP S\/4HANA implementation and the completion of the Livent IPO, while delivering strong quarterly results.","Turning now to slide 3 and our third quarter results. FMC reported third quarter revenue of just over $1 billion, which was 60% higher than Q3 2017. Adjusted EPS was $0.98 in the quarter, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 40% versus the same period a year ago. The guidance beat was due to the strong performance of Ag Solutions, a $0.07 beat, plus $0.01 from Lithium and $0.03 from the lower tax rate, offset somewhat by a $0.05 headwind from higher-than-expected corporate cost and other costs. Andrew will address the higher corporate cost in his section.","Moving to slide 4 and Ag Solutions. Revenue of $924 million in the quarter increased 67% year-over-year on a reported basis and increased 5% on a pro-forma basis. This was driven by 17% growth of our acquired insecticide portfolio and 8% growth in our selective herbicides. We continue to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities and our global sales force delivered another impressive performance in its third full quarter with a combined portfolio.","On a pro forma basis, we delivered strong top-line growth in both Latin America and North America, which more than offset lower sale in Asia and EMEA. Third quarter segment EBITDA was $216 million, increased 57% versus the earnings from the year-ago quarter and was $11 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Segment EBITDA margin was 23%, which was in line with expectations.","As previously discussed, Q3 is the lowest margin quarter for many reasons. First, it is our lowest revenue quarter, yet SAR spend is flat; second, product mix shift to a higher percentage of FMC legacy products; and third, geographic mix shift to a lower contribution from our highest margin region. These elements were expected and will be seen each Q3 in the future.","Turning now to slide 5. Q3 revenue growth was strong on a pro forma basis but it was mixed across the regions. North America revenue increased 32% and Latin America revenue grew 9%. Revenue in Asia dropped 4% and in Europe revenue contracted 17%. North America and EMEA are in the low season in Q3. And therefore, the relatively small absolute dollar increase or decrease creates a disproportionate percentage swing.","In North America, the key driver was volume growth from Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect control. We saw continued overall expansion of the diamide portfolio. Of note was the late season growth in California on tree nuts, combined with growth in our herbicide portfolio.","In EMEA, our business contracted 17% in a seasonally light quarter, which only represents about 15% of annual sales of the region. The decline was due in large part to lower herbicide application on all seed rate because of dry weather.","In addition, we saw orders move into Q4 on the back of a distribution change we are making in Belgium and Holland. This change is a timing move and will not result in any lost sales. We are consequently expecting strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter in EMEA.","In Latin America, our business grew 9% on a pro forma basis despite a strong FX headwind. This performance was primarily due to strong demand in Brazil, which grew 17% on the strength of our acquired products due to our expanded market access.","We have taken advantage of increased exposure to crops in the South and more broadly to existing distributors. We are cross-selling our new portfolio with an emphasis on crops such as coffee and citrus. In addition, we expect that cotton acreage will increase 25% this coming season, driving stronger sales over insecticides and herbicides portfolio which started in Q3. We also successfully implemented significant price increases across the board in Brazil.","In Asia, revenue declined 4%. However, excluding a proactive restructuring of our India business, we grew revenue 2% despite significant headwinds from foreign currency. We had strong sales of our acquired insecticide portfolio in rice and soybean in India, and in rice and fruit and vegetables in Japan and Korea.","Moving now to Lithium on slide 6. Lithium delivered a strong third quarter with revenue up 19% compared to Q3 last year and segment EBITDA of $49 million, 21% higher than a year ago. As a reminder, we will continue to include FMC Lithium in our segment results for the fourth quarter because FMC still owns approximately 85% of Livent Corporation, but we will limit our comments as Livent is reporting its quarterly earnings separately. When we issue fourth quarter results, you will see 15% of Livent's earnings deducted in the non-controlling interest line of our income statement, and this is reflected in our guidance.","Turning to slide 7, which highlights the impact of the Livent's IPO on our EPS guidance. Excluding the adjustment for Livent, the midpoint of our guidance would still be at $6.05, exactly where it was a quarter ago. However, we now must account for the full stand-alone cost of Livent, which are a $0.03 headwind, as well as the approximately 15% minority interest deduction for Livent post IPO, which is a $0.04 headwind. Incorporating those factors, we expect adjusted earnings per share for full-year 2018 to be between $5.93 and $6.03 per share or $5.98 at the midpoint, which represents an increase of 121% versus 2017 EPS.","Turning to slide 3 (sic) [slide 8], which summarizes our outlook for the full year and for the fourth quarter. We expect 2018 Ag Solution revenue will be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.26 billion. On the pro forma basis, this equates to a nearly 10% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. We also expect Ag Solutions EBITDA will be in the range of $1.195 billion to $1.215 billion, which is a raise of $5 million at the midpoint relative to prior guidance.","Our expectation for the overall crop protection market has slightly improved from what we say in August. On a U.S. dollar basis, we now expect the global crop protection chemical market to be up low-single-digit in 2018. The two regional outlooks that have improved are North America, which we expect will be up low-single-digit due to more pronounced strength in herbicide; and Latin America, which we expect will be up high-single-digit with a change in forecast primarily due to recent FX-driven price increases.","We still expect the market in Asia to be flat to up low-single-digit, while our European forecast is slightly more conservative. We expect it to be up low-single-digit on a U.S. dollar basis and down low-single-digit in local currencies.","FMC is growing considerably ahead of the market in 2018. Increased market access in many parts of the world is one of the largest factor. First, this includes new and enhanced distribution and crop access in Brazil, particularly in the South; second, full utilization of our new super distributor model in India, resulting in more coverage; and third, full direct market access in Europe with growth in Eastern Europe and improved access in France and Benelux countries.","Another growth driver is the launch of new formulations developed by the regions to respond to local customer needs. In 2018, we launched 30 formulated products, which we expect will contribute 1% point of the overall growth rate. For FMC, fourth quarter Ag Solution revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.015 billion to $1.075 billion. This revenue forecast will present a pro-forma growth rate of 12% at the midpoint for the quarter and implies 9% pro-forma growth for the second half of 2018.","Segment EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million in Q4. This outlook includes an estimated $3 million to $4 million headwind for the quarter from the recent trade tariffs. We are confident in our Q4 forecast largely due to visibility in Brazil, with 85% of expected revenue in that country already booked as orders. This is a much higher level heading into the period than in previous years. We are also confident we will manage the FX headwind in Brazil with pricing and hedges.","Moving over to Livent. I am just going to repeat the guidance that Livent issued last night. We expect full-year segment revenue to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million, a year-over-year increase of 28% at the midpoint. Livent decreased its full-year EBITDA forecast by $5 million at the midpoint to a range of $193 million to $197 million to account for $5 million of stand-alone costs.","Q4 guidance for Livent revenue is in the range of $117 million to $127 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 8% at the midpoint, and EBITDA guidance is between $43 million and $47 million due to about $4 million of stand-alone costs. We now expect adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be between $1.33 and $1.43.","I will now turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew David Sandifer - FMC Corp.","Thanks, Pierre. I'll start this morning with a few specific income statement items then move to the balance sheet and cash flow. I'll also provide an update on the use of proceeds from the Livent IPO.","Corporate expense was $29.7 million, $7.6 million above the quarterly pace of expense implied by our guidance at our last earnings call. This increase in expense was driven primarily by foreign exchange impacts on inter-company fund movements. We are currently operating in a dual IT system environment, which makes it more challenging to address currency imbalances on inter-company fund movements.","While a large portion of the impact in the quarter was non-recurring, the system challenges are likely to cause some volatility in our corporate expenses on the order of plus or minus $1 million to $2 million per quarter. This variability will go away as we exit the DuPont TSA in late 2019.","We estimate foreign exchange was a 4% to 5% top-line headwind in the third quarter for our Ag Solutions segment. Importantly, in Brazil, we estimate that we offset 100% of the impact of FX on earnings in Q3 through significant price increases complemented by our hedging activities. For the Lithium segment, FX had virtually no impact on revenue and with a modest tailwind to earnings in the quarter.","We lowered our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to a range of 16% to 17%, a reduction of 50 basis points at the midpoint of the range, driven by our updated forecast and the mix of earnings across various jurisdictions. The 14.6% adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter brings our year-to-date provision for taxes in line with this updated guidance.","Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 9, FMC generated adjusted cash from operations of $550 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, up nearly 80% compared to the prior-year period, driven by higher EBITDA. We also continue to benefit from lower working capital build for the DuPont acquisition than initially expected. Looking to the full year, we are raising our guidance for adjusted cash from operations to a range of $700 million to $750 million.","Using strong cash flows from Q3, we paid down $300 million of term loan debt, ending the quarter with $2.75 billion in gross debt. This is down nearly $450 million from the beginning of the year. We completed the Livent IPO in October and FMC received net proceeds of about $320 million from the sale of 20 million shares of Livent. On October 31, we used $150 million of those proceeds to further pay down term loan debt, consistent with our commitment to reduce leverage in line with the impending loss of Livent EBITDA early next year. This increases our cumulative debt reduction this year to nearly $600 million.","With debt-to-EBITDA, excluding Lithium, now below 2.5 times and consistent with our targeted solid investment-grade credit profile, we will use the remainder of the Livent IPO proceeds and other excess cash on hand to begin repurchasing FMC shares. We are launching a program to purchase $200 million of FMC shares via open market purchases by the end of this year under our existing share repurchase authorization.","This initial $200 million share repurchase marks an inflection point and FMC transformation, as we move past de-leveraging from debt-funded acquisitions to generating substantial free cash flow going forward. You can expect the cash generation and its deployment are key topics we will cover at our upcoming Investor Day on December 3.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Andrew. I could not be more pleased with where we are today. We are preparing FMC for a long period of growth, while delivering exceptional results in the short-term. We are delivering on every front, the 10% global revenue growth rate for Ag business in 2018 on a pro forma basis, much above the market, with a strong EBITDA margin close to 29%.","We are flawlessly integrating the DuPont business and realizing early sales and cost synergies. We successfully completed the IPO of Livent in challenging market condition. Our SAP implementation is on track. Our cash flow is strengthening. We are paying down debt quickly and returning $200 million to our shareholders through a stock buyback.","More importantly, we have a strategic plan firmly in place which leverages our core competencies, the strength of our current portfolio and our unique ability to develop short- to long-term technology. As I said before, our team is delivering on every front. I cannot wait to discuss the future of the company on December 3 with all of you.","I will now turn the call back to Michael Wherley.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Pierre. As Livent has just had its own conference call, we'll keep this Q&A session focused on our Ag business, other than to answer to any potential questions you might have on the Livent separation plan.","Operator, you can now begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. Given your new ever-evolving portfolio on a geographic and product basis, how should we think about your long-term outlooks given your newly found independence? I'm sure you guys don't want to front-run yourselves on the Analyst Day, but just how should we perceive your own thought process regarding acquired R&D platform from DuPont? And maybe just a quick comment on the strategy regarding the FMC of old, if you want to call it that, in acquiring mid- to late-stage molecules. So, just any comment on that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the question. But as you can guess, really discussing technology in depth would require a lot of time, which we intend to do at Investor Day. We'll have our Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Technology Officer going deep into our technology capability.","What I would say is we do have, with the combination of FMC and DuPont, the DuPont business we acquired, developed a capability which is quite unique. We do have now coming from DuPont a very strong discovery organization and ability to bring new molecules, new active ingredients, new mode of actions towards development stage. FMC is bringing a formulations technology which DuPont didn't have before, enhancing the value of those active ingredients which are being developed by DuPont.","Third of all, FMC and DuPont have complementary capabilities in terms of technology development and field testing in each of the region of the world, allowing us testing, data gathering, but also the fast development of formulation for local requirements. So we will describe all of these, but technology and blend of short-term, mid-term, long-term technology will be a very key driver of FMC growth in the future.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just a quick follow-up. Just given the role for the TSA, the eventual refined corporate cost structure as well as your, let's say, greater geographically balanced portfolio with better Asian exposure, which to my understanding is better payable terms. Can you just give us any sense on just how you're thinking about your future cash flow generation versus history, especially given your relatively low maintenance CapEx requirements? Just any broad color there would be appreciated. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes, Chris. Broad color and as Andrew said in his comment, we want to make cash deployment a very critical topic on Investor Day. You will start to see in 2019 a significant increase in the cash generated by the company and the real step-up will be in 2020. The reason for which 2019 will be a little bit less than the following years is because we'll still have SAP implementation cost and some integration cost. Then you have a real jump into 2020 all the way to 2023.","If you look at the cash we will be generating, including the structural saving which will take place with the S\/4HANA implementation, if you look at the capital spend, and we'll detail that, if we look at the cash before R&D because we want to make sure we fully fund R&D for growth, you're going to get to a place where we're going to have to change the way we are returning cash to shareholders. So we'll have very significant non-allocated cash for the next few years, which we intend to return, in most part, to shareholders through dividend and stock buyback.","And we'll be discussing with you this unallocated part of cash, which you will see for the size of our company is a pretty significant number, how we are deciding to do that through the regular payment of dividends and what we will do through repetitive stock buyback.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's great color. Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. One moment.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Please move to the next question if he is not available.","Operator","One moment, please.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Operator, please move to the next question.","Operator","Yes. One moment. My computer is froze. One moment.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hello. Can you hear me?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","We can hear you.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Oh, thanks. Sorry about that. Yeah. Question on South America. There was a lot \u2013 you kind of round-tripped on the reais. You went from BRL 3.68 to BRL 4.10 back to BRL 3.68. How did that affect your ability to raise local currency pricing? And if you raised them at that BRL 4.10 peak, should you be able to hang on to those increased reais pricing and, hence, expand margins as you get into the fourth quarter?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes, Don. That's a regular situation you always face when you connect your pricing to currency. I think it's an important point you're making. As we said before, on the way up when the \u2013 sorry, when the currency goes down and we are increasing price, we have a lag. We're always behind by a few percentage points. When then the currency strengthen, the same thing is happening, then we become ahead of the game because we hold the price as long as we can to the previous currency.","So, needless to say that while the currency was going up quite fast all the way to BRL 4 in Brazil, the fact that we're able to take to zero impact the currency on EBITDA in the third quarter made us feeling pretty strong about our ability to move price up. And now the job you have is, as the currency strengthen, is to try to hold on to your older price as long as you can, but you will have to bring it back closer to currency as it goes.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And can you talk about...","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","But you'll face a lag negative at the beginning on the currency weakening and positive when the currency is strengthening.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And can you talk about your sales position in Brazil? How collection's been going and where are receivables by historical standards as a percentage of sales?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah, Don. It's Mark. Receivables are in very good shape and especially in Brazil. I think you know that we spent a lot of time and effort over the last couple of years really getting the quality of our business back in shape after 2015. So we feel very strong about where we are.","Collections have been very good. Past dues are down at the lowest level they've been for the last three to four years. We're obviously in the season now, so we'll see how things go. But for us, we're very confident about where our receivable levels are, and more importantly so, about where our past dues are heading.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question goes to the line of Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. So I think in your prepared remarks you said that you might have a couple cents of headwinds from tariffs from China. Can you just comment about, if those tariffs are sustained in 2019, just color on the order of magnitude of what that could be? And is there anything that you could do in your own supply chain to mitigate some of those costs?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think the currency impact, if we project out our sales to 2019, to give you an order of magnitude, if tariffs stay around 10%, we believe it's going to be around a $10 million negative impact on EBITDA. If the tariffs move to a 25% range, it would be in the $30 million to $35 million impact on EBITDA. That would be if we are not successful at getting any exception. As you know, we are fighting for exemption to some of the critical raw materials of product. I cannot anticipate on how successful we will be in doing that, but the two numbers I gave to you would be the max impact.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And you commented on your higher market growth view for North America. I think previously you thought the North America to be down a little bit this year and now it looks like it's going to be up. Can you just dive into that? Is there something specific that's driving that change? And can you give us any broad sense as to where do you think the market could go into next year with some of the anticipated shifts in acreage that we might see between corn and soybeans? Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah, Dan. It's Mark. North America was stronger than we thought. We continued to do very well with the diamide acquisition, especially in California. I think we noted that on one of the slides. We saw it in other niche crops as well towards the end of the season. Now, of course, as Pierre said in his prepared remarks, it's a bit of a slow time in North America, so you don't need much movement to get significant percentages.","I think we also saw good business with our selective herbicides based on two key molecules. We've launched some new products this year, and they've done very well going through the third quarter. So, think of the herbicide and the insecticide portfolio as doing better than we thought.","Obviously, we're watching very carefully as we roll into the next season for the U.S., given where corn and soy projections are. Frankly, I think it's too early to tell where growers will go with this. We're watching it very closely. I think you do know that we have much more of an exposure to soy in the U.S. market than we do corn. Obviously, that's offset by a greater exposure in Brazil. And we know that Brazil are right in their planting season now which is going very well. We expect them to have roughly about a 3% increase in acreage for soy.","So, for us, it's been a much of watch and see really. We're making sure that our supply chains are well-positioned to take any advantage of movements in the U.S. and, in particular, in Brazil. But right now, as I said, a bit too early to figure that one out.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","And one additional comment around Europe and North America, we like to repeat that. So, third quarter is a low season, so don't forget that dollars change creates significant movement in percentage, when actually it is not that big of a change. So there is a bit of the fact we're occurring at a time that Europe is only 15% of the U.S. sales. So, not as big as the percentage might indicate it. There are no...","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. I understand there's been reports recently of some corn rootworm resistance developed to the Herculex proteins, and just wanted to know whether or not that created an opportunity for you. Does your insecticide platform include some products that would control below-ground insects as a seed treatment?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah, Steve. We're not in the seed treatment side, but we're very much in the in-furrow application of insecticides, especially for corn rootworm. We have also seen instances of increased infestation. We're well-positioned to take advantage of that as we go through the next season, not only with our branded product Capture LFR, which is a liquid fertilizer-ready in-furrow application, but with our new foam-applied technologies that we're introducing into the marketplace, which are much more sustainable in nature. And we'll talk more about that on Investor Day. But, yes, you're right, we are seeing instances and we're well-prepared for that with our portfolio as it stands today.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And the recent EPA-labeled revision on dicamba has a lot of the professional applicators upset about the additional certification requirements that many of them think they're not going to be able to achieve. Is that a net benefit to your selective herbicide platform?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Well, yeah. I mean, obviously, we don't participate in the dicamba market directly, but we do have a market-leading position in pre-emergent herbicides for soy with our Authority brand. Obviously, if we can continue to grow that franchise, if there are issues with dicamba, we will certainly take that opportunity. However, I do have to say, a lot of the new technologies of the companies that are promoting those are also promoting the use of pre-emergent herbicides as well, of which as I said we're the market leader. So we will take advantage of that.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Sison, KeyBanc.","Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Curt Siegmeyer in for Mike. I was just curious in terms of the benefits that you've seen from DuPont largely from cross-selling and some of the distribution benefits that you've talked about, what inning would you characterize us in in terms of those benefits and how should we think of that in terms of contribution to potential pipeline growth in 2019?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think today we are growing \u2013 if you think about this year, the overall company will be growing about 9% in the business and that will due to the DuPont portfolio growing in the high-teens and maybe low-20% range, which is very fast. So, what is important for us, and we're spending a lot of time studying that, is to try to understand how much of this is very short-term synergies versus what is more sustainable synergy.

I can hear you now.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Okay. Let's go back in the Q&A and start with the next question. I believe it's Mark Connelly at Stephens.","Joan Tong - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. How are you? This is actually Joan Tong for Mark Connelly. You guys called out Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr are one of the key drivers for the strong North America results despite weak seasonality. Can you just tell us what additional growth opportunity these products have, which geographic regions offer the best potential, or maybe perhaps talk about how deeply penetrated are these product there in the market? Hello?","Operator","One moment, please.","(51:44-52:01)","Operator","I hear you.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Can you hear us?","Operator","We can hear you now.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Well, if it goes blank again then we're just going to have to end the call. But let's try and answer this question. Mark, go ahead.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Sure. Thanks. So, yeah, as I was saying that over 50% of the growth of the diamide products are coming from Asia. So we see growth both in Asia, in Europe, North America, and in selected parts of Brazil and Latin America.","When we get to Investor Day on December the 3rd, we'll be digging into more details around why we see these products continuing to grow, what is it that makes them special in terms of their performance versus other competitive chemistries. But we do see Cyazypyr in particular, which was a later launched product, as having very good growth opportunities especially on niche crops. So, rather than going through all the details today, we'll certainly address that at the Investor Day on December the 3rd.","Joan Tong - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then just one follow-up. So, thanks for the color on the impact of the Chinese tariffs earlier. Just maybe one follow-up on China as well. So we are seeing Chinese chemical producers are facing rising environmental compliance cost. Just wondering how much of your business are being sourced in China? And also maybe longer-term, are you thinking about maybe perhaps the evolution of how you change like, how you source your raw material going forward? Would that be a more of a significant shift towards India and other part of the world? Thank you so much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Regarding China, I mean, from a business and size of the country itself, China is one of the top 10 country in the world, but this not where the issue is for us. One of the challenges I would say we have is the supply of active ingredients and raw material for FMC as well as for most of the other Ag chemical company comes from China.","So there is always two issues we are facing. One is, is the cost; and more constraint on supply there is from China, the higher the risk of the cost going up. And the other one is because of environmental reason, shutdowns, which would prevent the supply of active ingredients or raw material.","So the second one is always something we're watching because if the issue happen, there is not much we can do. We've been dealing quite well with that. We are well-structured with multiple qualified suppliers for most of our products. So we have to use the flexibility of the supply chain, but is something so far we have been able to manage and expect to be able to manage without shorter paying customers in the foreseeable future.","The price is something which we'll have to address. Now I have to say the cost of raw material impact in 2018 is not very significant. Just because of the way accounting work, the increase of cost is pushed into the products which then are going into inventory, and you're impacted on the cost when you sell the product. So we are currently expecting raw material pricing not to be a very significant issue in 2018, but certainly something we're going to have to watch in 2019 and, for which, we're going to have to define a very well-thought through pricing strategy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Harrison, Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Hi, Mike.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","You didn't realize that separating Livent would lead to some potential technical difficulties on the call. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit in a little more detail about your ability to manage through the FX impact. And in particular around the hedges, I'm just wondering if there was sort of an unusual contribution from the hedges in Q4. And as we go forward through the season, maybe they get shorter-term or they get more expensive, they become less effective somehow.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I'm going to ask Andrew to address the hedging process and what we've done. Now, let's put things within context.

Phone lines will be placed in listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","And I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Angeli, Vice President of Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Angeli, you may begin.","Brian P. Angeli - Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Development","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me his today is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's second quarter performance and discuss the outlook for Q3 and the full year 2016. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and 2016 outlook statement, are currently available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call.","As with our prior calls, Mark Douglas, President, FMC Agricultural Solutions; Eric Norris, President, FMC Health and Nutrition; and Tom Schneberger, Vice President and Global Business Director, FMC Lithium, will join to address questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including but not limited to those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's information. Actual results may vary based on these risks and uncertainties.","Today's discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and EPS references, and pro forma revenue and segment earnings for FMC Agricultural Solutions. A reconciliation and definition of these terms, as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the first slide, for the second quarter of 2016, FMC reported revenue of $810 million and adjusted operating profit of $143 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.69 was $0.01 below the second quarter of 2015 but above the midpoint of our guidance range.","Ag Solutions delivered another solid quarter as it continues to realize the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Lithium outperformed on higher sales volume and higher realized prices across the portfolio, with lower operating cost from ongoing manufacturing excellence program. Earnings in Health and Nutrition were below expectation, as results in Omega-3 were significantly weaker than anticipated.","Based on our performance to date and the outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. I will provide more detail on how that breaks down across each of the businesses shortly.","But first, I will discuss second quarter results for each of our three segments, starting with Ag Solutions on slide 2. Overall, market conditions and our performance in the quarter were in line with our prior expectations. We remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel and on maintaining discipline on price and terms. We also took actions needed to complete the product rationalization that began in late 2014.","For the second quarter, Ag Solutions reported revenue of $550 million and segment earnings of $101 million, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue declined 19% compared to the second quarter of 2015, largely due to lower sales volumes, unfavorable weather conditions in Europe and Asia, the drawdown of channel inventory by customers in most regions, and planned product rationalizations all contributed to the decline in volume in the quarter.","Excluding planned product rationalizations, revenue declined broadly in line with the crop protection market as a whole. Segment earnings declined 14% compared to 2015, as the impact of lower sales volumes, less favorable product mix in Asia and North America, and the stronger U.S. dollar were partially offset by lower operating costs. Compared to pro forma results from Q2 last year, operating margin increased 100 basis points, reflecting pricing discipline, the elimination of sales of low-margin products due to portfolio rationalization, and cost savings from the Cheminova integration.","As we move to slide 3, I will first give a few comments on the global crop protection market, then I will move on to review FMC's performance by region and discuss the outlook for Q3 and the full year. So, first the market. Overall, conditions in the global crop protection market were as expected and little changed from Q1. In North America, soft commodity prices continue to put pressure on farm incomes, resulting in more cautious buying behavior by growers and elevated inventory levels across the channel. In Europe, unfavorable weather conditions early in the quarter, most notably in Central and Western Europe, reduced market demand leading to lower volumes and increased channel inventory in certain countries.","In Brazil, channel inventory across the market remained elevated, especially for insecticides. And while foreign exchange rate had been more stable, growers continue to be negatively impacted by a lack of credit availability. In Asia, weather conditions were poor across most of the region, resulting in weaker market demand. We believe these challenging market conditions will persist for the remainder of the year, and we still forecast that the global crop protection chemical market will decline by mid to high single-digit percent in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis.","I will now discuss FMC's performance in light of these market conditions. First, let me address the lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter. Markets in Asia and Europe were weaker than expected, but the main driver of the lower revenue is a more successful and aggressive product rationalization. We continue to manage the quality of our sales in order to protect margin, earnings and working capital.","In North America, our strategy remained one of defending price and terms, allowing the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel to reduce. All the data we see support our view that inventory of FMC product in the channel is declining. Reflecting the benefit of the actions we took early in the season to reduce inventory of FMC product in the channel, sales in Q2 increased 5%. We saw strong demand for FMC's Authority brand of pre-emergent soybean herbicide, and independent data show that the Authority brand has taken market share this year. We also saw grower support for the expanded fungicide products we can now offer as a result of the Cheminova acquisition.","In Europe, revenue declined by 19%, driven largely by poor weather conditions and reduced volume due to the planned product rationalization, as well as the impact of transitioning to a direct market access model. However, the product rationalization and move to direct market access have resulted in improved operating margins in the region.","In Latin America, revenue declined 43%, primarily as a result of steps we took to reduce the level of FMC product inventory in the sales channel in Brazil. We were encouraged by our ability to recover U.S. dollar pricing in the quarter. While not material to overall segment performance, given the seasonally lower sales volume, realized price increased in Brazil more than offset the negative impact of FX on our reported revenue. In Asia, the combination of poor weather condition, further portfolio rationalization, and a stronger U.S. dollar caused revenue to decline 22% compared to the second quarter last year.","Moving on to the outlook for Ag Solutions. Our full-year segment earnings guidance remains unchanged at $380 million to $420 million. For the third quarter, we expect segment earnings of between $80 million and $90 million. At the midpoint of guidance, second-half segment earnings will increase by approximately 35% compared to 2015, driven by improved performance in Brazil and Latin America and additional cost savings from the Cheminova integration.","The steps we have already taken to rationalize our product portfolio and reduce the level of FMC inventory in the sales channel leave us well-positioned as we enter the 2016-2017 crop season in the Americas. The relative stability of the Brazilian real over the past few months gives us increased confidence in our ability to recapture price despite tightening credit conditions for growers and weak market demand as channel inventory levels decline.","We expect full-year segment earnings margin to be between 17% and 18%, which at the midpoint represents more than 250 basis points of improvement compared to 2015, driven by more favorable mix, improved pricing in Brazil, and realization of cost savings. We remain on track to deliver an incremental cost savings target of $60 million to $70 million in 2016, and a full run-rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of next year.","Moving on to Health and Nutrition on slide 4. The business reported second quarter segment revenue of $195 million and segment earnings of $45 million dollars. Revenue declined approximately 6% and earnings declined approximately 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by worse-than-expected performance of Omega 3. The headwinds we saw in Omega 3 over the past year increased in the second quarter. Specifically, prices and volumes were much lower than anticipated.","There is significant overcapacity in the industry, which, combined with lower demand for higher-concentration products, has exerted even greater pressure on prices than we saw earlier in the year. We have seen new entrants win business at prices that are close to cash cost of production, resulting in considerably lower volume for our products in certain key area. We have aggressively taken cost out of this business, with fixed cost falling by almost 40%. We continue to pursue new opportunities for high-end concentration products, but do not expect to recover this lost volume this year and do not anticipate a change in pricing levels any time soon.","Excluding Omega 3, results were in line with expectations. In nutritional ingredients, volumes in the quarter were slightly below Q2 2015, largely due to timing as orders shifted to the second half of the year. In health excipients, sales volumes increased in all key pharmaceutical markets.","Given performance to-date in Omega 3 and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are lowering our guidance for Health and Nutrition. We now expect full-year segment earnings to be in the range of $190 million to $196 million, roughly flat with 2015, and third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $44 million to $48 million. We continue to expect operating margins of approximately 25% for the full year, helped by lower operating cost and improved production yields.","Turning next to Lithium on slide 5. Lithium delivered another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $63 million, and segment earnings more than tripled to $16.5 million. Lithium's performance reflects the success of FMC's strategy of converting lithium carbonate into higher-value downstream specialty products, supported by strong manufacturing performance, especially in Argentina and at our Bessemer City hydroxide facility.","Higher sales volume, higher average prices in all major product categories, improved mix and lower operating cost all contributed to deliver segment earnings above the top end of our prior guidance range, and pushed segment earnings margin to over 26% in the quarter. We expect supply\/demand conditions to remain tight for the remainder of the year, as previously announced capacity expansions across the industry have been slow to come online. This reinforces our confidence in favorable pricing conditions through the remainder of 2016.","For the full year, we expect segment earnings to be in the range of $58 million to $66 million, an increase at the midpoint of approximately 30% compared to prior guidance, and nearly three times segment earnings in 2015. Higher prices and lower operating cost compared to last year will support operating margins in the range of 24% to 25% for the year. We expect third quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $13 million to $17 million, as the benefit of higher prices will be partially offset by seasonally lower production and operations in Argentina.","FMC's midterm business is positioned to deliver significant earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In May, we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30,000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our customers, starting with a 4,000 metric ton expansion scheduled to come online in 2017. Last week we announced we will accelerate that capacity expansion, and we now expect 8,000 metric tons to come online by the middle of 2017. We continue to evaluate the timing of further capacity expansion and expect the entire 20,000 metric tons of additional capacity to be online by 2017. We believe we will more than double the revenue and earnings of our lithium business between 2016 and 2020, resulting in over 20% per year growth through the rest of this decade.","We recognize that our hydroxide investment plans require us to have cost effective access to sufficient lithium carbonate. Our current carbonate capacity is sufficient to support expansion in FMC's hydroxide production through at least 2018. Beyond this, we are actively pursuing multiple paths to ensure we are not carbonate constrained. First, we have several low-capital options to debottleneck our Argentina operations, potentially adding 20% capacity. Second, we are in ongoing discussions with multiple carbonate producers who have announced plans to add capacity in the coming years, and are exploring mutually beneficial long-term supply agreements or strategic partnerships. And of course, we retain the option to add significant capacity at our operation \u2013 our existing operations in Argentina, beyond the debottlenecking I just mentioned. Consequently, we are highly confident that excess lithium carbonate will not be a constraint in our ability to extend the hydroxide business in the coming years.","Before I turn the call over to Paul, I will comment briefly on the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2016 on slide 6. As I mentioned, we are maintaining full-year segment earnings for Ag Solutions and adjusting our full-year earnings expectation for both Health and Nutrition and Lithium. As a result, on a consolidated basis we are increasing full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint to $2.60 to $2.90 per share. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.63.","I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Pierre. As usual, I'll start with the income statement, and specifically the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, given there's a small benefit this quarter compared to Q2 last year. This lowered rate is largely due to the continued change in the mix of our earnings away from high-tax jurisdictions such as the U.S. toward regions where tax rates are lower.","Foreign exchange was not a major factor in our results this quarter, with the stronger dollar mainly impacting the Ag Solutions segment. Various Asian currencies plus the Mexican peso were the drivers of the FX headwind in the quarter. The second quarter is not a period of significant activity in Brazil, and therefore, the recent strengthening of the reais had a limited impact on our financials in the quarter. However, with an FX rate in the quarter that was weaker than the same period of last year, and with a price list that largely reflected the current spot rate, the combined effect of price and currency in Brazil was a net positive to our second quarter earnings.","Looking into the second half of the year, the recent stability in the reais-U.S. dollar exchange rate means that the assumptions regarding the future exchange rate that has underpinned our guidance is unchanged. To remind you, our guidance has assumed that we have a reais-to-U.S.-dollar rate that is relatively stable with no major short-term swings in the FX rate, combined with a price list that largely reflects the prevailing spot exchange rate. Sitting here today, both of those assumptions remain unchanged, and therefore, we do not expect either a positive or negative impact on our second half performance from the reais FX rate compared to our previous guidance, provided these conditions hold.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 7. We continue to make progress in increasing our cash generation while maintaining discipline on capital spending. For the first half of the year, our adjusted cash from operations was 40% higher than the first half of last year, driven primarily by stronger working capital performance. We remain on target to meet our outlook for the full year of $450 million to $550 million of adjusted cash from operations. Net debt fell by $90 million compared to the first quarter and by over $120 million since the start of the year.","The second quarter is an important period for us in terms of cash collections in Brazil. We remain very focused on the credit capacity of our customers, particularly given the constrained access to third-party financing for Brazilian growers. This has an impact on both our ability to collect cash from customers and our willingness to continue to extend credit in a form of new sales.","On the first point, we were pleased with our performance in collecting in Brazil, with net cash collection slightly ahead of our expectations, and particularly good progress in collecting from our past-due balances. As a result, we saw a meaningful reduction in our Brazil receivables balance. However, it is still significantly higher than we would like, and we will remain focused on reducing our exposure in the coming quarters. The credit tightness in Brazil has been an important factor for us for several quarters now, with our willingness to extend credit to certain segments of the market reduced. As we head into the key second-half selling season in Brazil, our guidance reflects this disciplined approach to credit exposure.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul. And before I continue with my remark, let me correct the statement I made. The 20,000 tons of additional lithium hydroxide capacity is to be online by 2019, not as I said 2017. So to continue and to conclude, I am very pleased with the overall execution of our strategy and improved outlook for the year. Despite ongoing challenges facing the agricultural industry, our strategy and the actions we have taken in the back end of 2015 and the first half of 2016 give us strong confidence in our performance for the remainder of the year.","We have remained focused on reducing the level of FMC product inventory in the channel, maintained discipline on price and terms, aggressively managed our mix by rationalizing our product line, leading to stronger margins. This strategy, combined with the successful integration of Cheminova and a more benign FX situation in Brazil, have increased the predictability of our business and will drive the second-half performance of Ag Solutions, with earnings up 35% compared to pro forma results for 2015.","We are investing in our technology road map in order to offer unique value-added solutions to our customers. We see high acceptance rates for our new product launches, including our biological platform, and remain on track to introduce our new active ingredients pipeline starting in 2017.","Lithium continues to deliver strong performance, altering its product mix and increasing output to meet growing market demand. FMC's focused strategy has enabled the business to take advantage of favorable market conditions to realize significant earnings growth in 2016. Our announced capacity expansion strengthens FMC's leadership position in lithium hydroxide and specialty lithium applications, and will deliver further growth in the years to come.","Health and Nutrition had a weaker than expected quarter. However, the business continues to generate high margins and returns, and demand across key nutritional and pharmaceutical markets multiple growth over the second half of the year. Finally, we are generating increased operating cash flow to improve our balance sheet. We are on track to increase adjusted cash from operations by approximately 40% in 2016.","I thank you for your attention this morning. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. Can you just comment a little more on your longer-term expectations for your European business, given your shift, or I'd say rather evolution, of your go-to-market strategy, and then also parse out your views for Northwest Europe versus CIS? And then also you mentioned a product rationalization as well. Just any additional detail will be helpful. Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Hi, Chris. This is Mark. Well, first of all, for Europe, obviously we now have a very different business model, with the acquisition of Cheminova. I think you can expect us to see, over the long haul, outperformance in the marketplace. Any it kind of fits in with your second question around CIS and Western Europe. We obviously have a bigger exposure in Western Europe with the Cheminova acquisition.","But we see a lot of opportunity in the CIS countries, other parts of Eastern Europe in terms of Poland, Hungary, Czechy, Slovakia, as well as the Ukraine. Introduction of new technologies is important for us in Europe. The portfolio is strong. But with our pipeline, we have new products that will benefit both niche crops and especially cereals where Cheminova have exposure that FMC did not have. So, if you think of outperformance versus the market, it's really going to be cereals and the niche crops, especially in the south, and then accelerated growth in the east.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. Can you just comment a little bit more about the working capital improvement you saw during the quarter? And then also on a go-forward basis, specifically how do you typically evaluate growth versus credit risk as we head into the third quarter with Brazil? And is it becoming more dependent on crop type, farm size or even region within Brazil? Just any comments on the puts and takes would be helpful. Thank you.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Let me touch on that. The working capital progress we made, really if you look at the cash flow improvement we had over last year and the first half of the year, you can really put almost all of that down to better collections in Brazil. So we've made significant progress over there. We've talked many times about the steps we're taking, and I can't point to any one thing that's changed that. It's about getting some momentum behind those collection conversations.","Now in terms of growth versus credit, I'm not sure we really think about it that way. We think about credit in terms of credit. And we think about the ability of the customer to repay us, the stability of the customer and their access to finance. There are natural differences by crop and by region in Brazil, and we obviously factor all of that in the way that we go to market. But we have the same questions that we ask and the same standards that we set regardless of region or crop, essentially based on our confidence that we will recover the payments from our customers on the terms that we sell them to. That's the single largest factor that we consider.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead. Go ahead.","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah. The only thing I would add, Chris, is you know Brazil very well. Given where the exposure is, I would say the north \u2013 the Cerrado regions are where it is probably the most stressed. The south with the co-ops and the distribution channel is in better shape, and then sugarcane as well. Sugar industry has gone through a lot of challenges, but with the price of sugar today, they're in a better shape as they go forward into 2017. But it's definitely the north where the stress is.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you for the detail. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. Just staying in Brazil, you commented that you had a good destock of your own FMC product. Can you talk about where you're seeing your competitors for their \u2013 in the channel for inventories? I think we've seen commentary before that there has been over a year of products from your competitors? Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. No. We can't and we don't want to comment on competitors. It's sometimes quite difficult to understand the overall inventory in the channel. So really what we've been doing, and that's a change we started to make in the fourth quarter, is truly focusing on trimming down our own inventory of product. There is product in the channel, but really to comment specifically about our competitors would not make sense for us to do so.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","If I look at your guidance, you seem to be implying a 300 or 400 basis point improvement in Ag Solution margin in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about that, where you see the big margin pickup in Q4 and how it's going to play out? Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Certainly, and I think the comments I would make are valid for the entire second half, is we are getting now into a position, if you look, compared to the back end of 2015, where there is multiple area of improvement. First of all, our product mix is getting much stronger than what it was. Our actions to walk away from a low-margin third-party more generic product is working very well. So we are increasing the margins of our product through mix.","Second of all, we have been pretty successful over the last three or four quarters in moving the price. So with a situation looking at the importance of Brazil and Latin America in Q3 and Q4, and taking into account the pricing versus FX situation, we are in a stronger position. So a blend of stronger volume we're going to see in the second half of the year, a better mix because we are moving away from third-party product, and the pricing FX situation will lead to, first of all, to more predictable business. We have a much better visibility going into the second half of the year than we had in a long time, and with stronger margins for the business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Pierre, you mentioned last call that Q2 in the Lithium business was when you were expecting some seasonal production weakness there, yet you were able to deliver well ahead of your guidance. Can you talk about what drove that upside during the quarter and whether there could be some potential upside as we look at your guidance for Q3 and Q4?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Certainly. I think that seasonal weakness is not only in Q2. It's in the back end of Q2 and through Q3. So, we've seen part of it and we're going to keep on seeing it. It's usually due to the fact that it is winter, there is more rainy season right now in Argentina where we're operating. So it's not only a Q2 phenomenon, it's the back of Q2, early Q3.","I think the visibility we have today due to production is quite, quite correct at the earnings level. Mainly, there is multiple reasons which are we leading to the improved earnings. First of all, the mix. We are moving more business toward our lithium hydroxide, where we've been able to operate our plants quite well and where there is a healthy demand and pricing situation.","Second of all, our plants have been operating also very well for carbonate production and we have been \u2013 and we're continuing to do that for the second half, selling more product made within the company than third-party product we would resell. And then there is some volume. So if look at the second half of the year, I think our earnings is quite in line with our expectation. I don't think there is a lot of upside. Most likely, what you will see is we decided not to change the revenue range, because we were a little bit below the middle point of the range initially. Looking at the demand for the back end of the year, it's most likely going to lead us toward the higher end of the range from the revenue standpoint. But I believe the earnings we have forecasted in lithium for Q3, Q4 are correct.","Unless \u2013 I tell you, the only place where I could see upside, but it is not possible for us to predict that today, is pricing. Pricing is always something, depending upon demand and how capacity come on stream. So that one, we've made some assumption; you never know.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thank you. And then a question just on the product rationalization that you did in Ag Solutions. Is that mostly legacy FMC products or are they some Cheminova products? And is there any more to come? Just trying to get a sense of whether we could see some additional pressure there. And at some point, do you hit a point where you could see some negative leverage as a result of scaling back on the number of products you're selling?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the product rationalization is very well advanced today. I think it's a mix. It's as much from Cheminova legacy products as it is from FMC product. Both company used to resell third-party products as a service to customers. And the things you can afford to do at a given time with a very healthy market, you cannot do when the market is more tense. So it was a normal thing for us to move the way we had, very precisely define what those products could be.","I'm very pleased with the speed at which the organization responded to it. I think more than half of the shortfall in our sales today in the second quarter is coming from product rationalization. But that's pretty much where it is. So you will not see numbers going beyond what we've talked about, which was a total run rate at the end of this year of $350 million, which is $100 million more than we did last year, we did $250 million last year, and this is it. There will be no further, as far as we can see, actions to be taken.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and appreciate all the details and color. Hey, Pierre, I was struck by the comment that the inventory levels of insecticides are rather high in Brazil, and I guess I was thinking about Zika there. Does that offer any opportunity for you in that marketplace?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah. Frank, this is Mark. Yeah, we have seen increased sales of specific insecticides that we're providing to that vector control market. It's not huge though. Let's put it in perspective. It's not going to move the Ag business. It's a nice business to have. We have a leading position in Brazil, and we've seen that business grow over the last 18 months, and we expect it to continue with the way Zika is progressing through the region. But it's not going to be significant enough to really move the needle.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Interesting. I mean, as the geography of concern spreads, one would think that that would be an opportunity, I guess, just simplistically. How would you describe your market share in that application?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","It's pretty good. Why don't we just put it in perspective? The global public health market is about $700 million, and that's within the total ag space, crop protection chemicals, of over $51 billion. So really, for mosquito control, the market worldwide is about $325 million to $340 million, and the U.S. is about $90 million of that. So you can get a sense of the scale of that business. In particular applications we have a very good market share, not only with our pyrethroids, but with a product call malathion that we brought from Cheminova. So just keep it in perspective. I mean, people talk about it a lot, but the U.S. market is only $90 million out of that $700 million.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Mark, I appreciate you throwing a wet blanket on that thesis. And then, hey, lastly, Paul, you sounded more sanguine with respect to the FX impact for 2016. Do you have a size as to what you think the negative effect will be when all is said and done on the year?","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I wish I could predict FX markets that well, Frank. I mean, I wouldn't be in this job, I'm pretty confident around that. I think the key is that we seem to have more predictability around rates. We've seen the peso has been a surprising area for us. We didn't \u2013 I mean, we never see them coming. And Brazil has been \u2013 the reais has been kind of a bright spot, not because of the absolute rate, but as I mentioned, about the stability around the rates. And I think that's sort of the key for us, as we look forward, that stability of the rates and then the lack of surprises is more important to us on most of our business than the actual movements in the exchange rates.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citibank. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, everyone. What kind of visibility do you have in Health and Nutrition in the second half of this year? Your guidance seems to imply an acceleration in process, which seems seasonally maybe a little bit different than the past few years. So given sort of the comments that you called out about Omega 3, can you just walk us through some of the key drivers for the second half?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Certainly. You know, I think we do have a pretty good visibility on our three segments today, from a demand standpoint. But it is important to understand that the earnings growth, especially in the fourth quarter, is maybe more predictable because it is due to a cost situation. You know, we always work our cost and decrease our cost. But the way cost flows into operations depend upon the speed that you turn your product, and I think we call that capitalized variance.","But the main reason for the bump in earnings in the back end of the year is due to the fact that we will be operating at a lower cost than we've been operating the other quarters and previous years. That is why you will see such a jump. So it is not due to a major turn in demand for any of our product, but much more the benefit of prior activity we've done on operational cost and manufacturing excellence.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, of the $60 million to $70 million of full-year cost synergies from Cheminova, can you quantify how much of that you realized in the first half? And then maybe just holistically, beyond just cost synergies, where do you see the integration process for Cheminova today? Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks. I think, at a run rate basis, we're going to close the half year, on the run-rate basis, in the $30 million to $40 million range for the first half of the year on the Cheminova.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You want \u2013 Mark?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Do you want me to talk a little bit about the integration side?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","From an integration perspective, we're very much done on the commercial side. That's all in place. A lot of the functional groups are also fully integrated and operating. We have some systems that we're still working through, SAP in Europe is an example, which will be completed early in the fourth quarter. And then the long-lead-time item is how we bring together the different manufacturing units, the tall manufacturing units and the formulating units. We are well progressed with that. We still have some to go, but that will occur over time. And the basic need there is to make sure that we have registrations as we move products around the world. So that's the rate-limiting step, but everything else is pretty much done by now.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think from a Cheminova integration, we're going to stop reporting. I mean, we'll answer any question you guys might have. But we can almost declare success. Everything is in place to which, as we discussed, by the middle next year the $140 million to $160 million run rate, the 800 to 900 positions being eliminated. So we are very much more than on track, ahead of initial schedule. And I think the \u2013 lots of the remaining activities are more under in Paul's shop around IT, SAP, finance integration, so much more back office integration than anything dealing with the front end of the business.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you, and good morning everyone. I was wondering if you could talk about the expected lithium capacity \u2013 lithium carbonate capacity increase in 2017. Based on what you see in here in the marketplace, is that coming onstream a lot of it in the first half of 2017, and therefore would have a negative impact on pricing?","Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director-Lithium Division","Thank you, Rosemarie. Yes. We're starting to see some exchange of volumes coming on even in the back half of 2016, mostly out of the new spodumene capacity that's coming online in Australia. As you know, there's also some capacity in Chile and there's been capacity ramping up in Argentina, targeting back end of 2016 and early 2017. So these are the volumes that we're watching, and I characterize it, could be anywhere between 50,000 tons to 75,000 tons by early 2017. So, as Pierre has commented earlier, this is where we make a pricing assumption, and we're monitoring the conditions as we interact with customers, in terms of pricing expectations.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","And that particular capacity addition is going to be smaller than the demand increase, isn't it? And therefore, pricing is going to come down across the board, including lithium hydroxide, or you don't think so?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","First, yes, there will be \u2013 we are expecting, as time goes, turning in 2017 and into 2018, we're expecting carbonate pricing to go more toward normal pricing, which mean a lower pricing we are currently seeing, when they will be more of a balance between the carbonate demand and the supply. It will not impact the hydroxide pricing. If you look right now, and if you put together all of the hydroxide capacity increase, which actually we are leading, they are very much in line with the demand increase. So from a pricing standpoint, we might not see hydroxide rising tremendously in the year to come, but I think we'll be in a healthy pricing situation for the next three to four years.","Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director-Lithium Division","And just to add a little bit to that, Rosemarie, in our hydroxide business, we're targeting specific segments of that demand, where it's high quality hydroxide, where they're willing to pay for the quality we bring to the market. So when we look at supply\/demand, we're looking even specifically at that customer mix, versus ones that might trade off to carbonate or other supply.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thanks. And my second question deals with the inventory, overall inventory in the Ag sector. You said that you have lowered the FMC product inventories, but without talking about any specific competitors. What do you see in terms of the overall inventory channel? Is it declining or is it still growing or more or less at a flat \u2013 has it plateaued?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think from a \u2013 as I said and want to repeat, we are mostly focusing on our inventory. But overall, if I would have or if we would have to make an overall statement, we believe overall inventory in the channel is declining. We do not believe right now we are at a turning point from a market standpoint. But we can see we are at a place where the dialogue with the customer is changing. There is more certainty, there is more predictability. It still means that the inventory in the channel is pretty heavy. We are not yet at a situation where it is not. But the dialogue is changing, and I believe everybody's trying to do their bit to decrease their inventory. We believe we most like are the most aggressive. But overall, I think the situation is improving.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Two things. Paul, you talked about the longer time line for rationalization of the manufacturing in Europe. Is that sort of a 2020 time goal in your mind, or is there a specific target in your mind?","And then the second question, to Latin America again. As we think about the working capital cycles in cotton and sugarcane, is your penetration in that market permanently shifting your working capital cycle in a material way? My understanding is Cheminova managed working capital much differently than you did, using more receivables, for example. I'm curious whether that has all shifted over to your way of doing things?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me address first the question on the manufacturing rationalization. Right now, we are at a place where we have a stable manufacturing network for Ag business. We are always looking at improving, but any improvement, any decision today is always a mid- to long-term decisions because there is some product registrations which are changing when you do a change of manufacturing.","So I have to say that right now, as any company would do, we are keeping our options open. But we are in what I would call a stable manufacturing network. And we will see, as time goes what are the best decisions to be taken for our business in terms of network. But today we are not penalized by the structure we have, and it's a matter of dong continuous improvement and being able to supply what will be requested by the market at the time when the market turns around.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","So, you're comfortable then not being quite as asset-light as you had been, sort of in the medium term?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We are asset-light. I think if you think about FMC prior to the acquisition of Cheminova, our manufacturing cost was 95%, asset-light. I would say today maybe we're at 90%. We should not believe that the fact that we have a plant in India, in Panoli and the plant we have in are fundamentally changing the mix of products which are made at all manufacturers, versus what is being made today. Those are big plants. But in the big scheme of things, their production capacity versus what we do with our total network is fairly small. So, it is not a fundamental departure to what we used to be in the past.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me just on the working capital question down there in Brazil, sugarcane and cotton can have very, very different terms. Cotton tends to be longer term. Sugarcane tends to be much shorter term, although that does vary, depending on the nature of the planting cycles and on the financial health of the sugarcane guys. But as a rule, as we shift it away from cotton, we'll expect to see our working capital terms come in, and towards sugarcane also does the same thing. I would not, though, expect that you're going to have to track that through our working capital balances, as you look at it. It's definitely a factor that helps, but it's not so large that you're going to really see a major movement in our numbers.","In terms of how Cheminova approached it, Cheminova \u2013 let's just separate the two important differences. Cheminova did not have a different approach to working capital than anybody else in the industry. They did have a different approach to how they financed that working capital. And to be blunt, as a weak-balance-sheet company with very unsophisticated treasury operations, there used to be some very, very expensive local financing in Brazil, which can give the impression that they're reducing their working capital. It was appropriate for a non-U.S.-GAAP reporter. It was appropriate for a sub-investment grade company. It was incredibly expensive, and will certainly factor into why their overall profitability was so low, and it's certainly not something we intend to do.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. What is the current competitive environment in Latin America and North America? Do you see your competitors generally being more disciplined on crop protection prices?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Well, obviously, I'm not going to talk about what the competition is doing on price. I'll tell you where we are. As Pierre said earlier, we're doing everything we can to make sure we manage price and terms across North America, and certainly in Brazil where we have reduced our exposure to the Brazilian market by taking out, through product rationalization, a significant amount of volume and revenue. But we're very focused on making sure that we maximize price, not only in terms of pricing but across the portfolio of what we're selling.","I think you're going to see all sorts of different activities as we go through the next year. But for us, it's very much around protecting the margins, protecting the value of the business, and certainly looking after working capital.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think in term of pricing, just to get back to one of the comments Paul made around the balance of FX and pricing, as you know, we tend to have a rule in Brazil where we index price on currency. Last year, we were, with our pricing, running after the currency and trying to move up our price. This year, the same process of adjusting pricing to currency is going the other way, which means this is not any longer us asking the customers to take higher price, but the customer asking us to lower the price more to other currency.","So, needless to say that for all of us, regardless of what behavior individual companies would take, it is an easier conversation from the predictability of the pricing. I think this FX situation give us a much better position to talk about pricing, more control in term of understanding pricing in the next two quarters. And I think it's got to apply to every company. It is just an FX price situation.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Very helpful. And turning to Europe and crop protection, you have some revenue declines there. How much of that was your move to direct market? And was it a one-time impact, or is there any way to improve that next year?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The direct market situation is a one-time impact. It is just a couple of situations which happen all the time when you do this kind of a transfer. First of all, you work with your distribution network, which you're moving away from. Those guys have inventory, they have stock, they are filling it while you're replenishing your own, now, warehouses to sell. So there is a period of time where you have two networks which have to overlap for a little while, and you have to give the time to your distributors to sell the product they were supposed to sell in the past by contract.","Second of all, you are at a stage also so where your distributors are not replenishing their inventory in advance. So, by the time we get into \u2013 this is happening as a transition now. Our belief is by the time we get into European season, Q1, Q2 next year, we should be in a very normalized situation and it will be stable for the future.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just curious, you maintained your outlook for the crop protection markets this year, down mid- to high-single-digit. What was it down in the first half, and just trying to gauge what the expectation is for the second half in terms of demand?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I think in the first half, the way I would look at it, Mike, is when we give a range, we say mid-single-digit to high-single-digit, maybe we were thinking about more toward, when we started this process, the lower end of the range, maybe 5%, 6%, 7%. We are more today on a 7%, 8%, more toward the higher end of the range. And that is maybe less due to channel inventory than it was to specific reasons in Asia and Europe, mostly driven by weather.","So for us, when you look at the market, if you remember, we were thinking about North America and Latin America in the higher end of the range, and this being helped by a flattish to slightly down market in Europe and Asia. We don't see that any longer. I mean, we still see North America and Latin America on the high end of the range, but we see Asia and Europe being down in the 5%, 6% for this year. That is why, today, we are looking at maybe more the higher end of our range.","For us, what we've been doing is we've been able, no matter what, to protect earnings by being even more drastic on pricing, more drastic on product rationalization. So we'll be slightly lower on sales, but we believe we're going to be \u2013 we're going to have very solid performance in the second half, and predictability on the earnings side.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then for the fourth quarter for Ag Solutions, you talked about better visibility than in the past. But just curious, what sort of gets you to the high end of the range? I mean, it's pretty wide in terms of the top end, given your guidance for Ag Solutions in the third quarter, and the low end. What sort of gets you to the top?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say always the same answer. When we give a middle of the range, it is under normal circumstances from a demand and weather standpoint. In those, there is always a range. You just need an infestation, you just need very strong insect pressure or other pressure, and you will drive that either to the lower or either to the higher end. Today, we believe we are very comfortable with the middle of the range. To see anything going up or down would be due to external events, not linked to channel inventory or anything of that kind, but much more to specific agricultural seasonal situations.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mostly weather.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investment. Please go ahead.","Peter E. Butler - Glen Hill Investment Research","Hey, good morning. Pierre, early on regarding lithium, you folks had a conservative outlook on shorter term lithium growth, but you saw good possibilities longer term, and this outlook has been proven correct. What do you see now for the longer term growth of lithium? And how do \u2013 how does your research pipeline on lithium derivatives look compared to what you're seeing from competitors, and how does this change your future position on earnings and cash flow growth, et cetera?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Peter. Yes. So lithium, I have to say we do have increased confidence in the future today. We believe this market is getting more and more solid. I have to say that we are still prudent. But the big breakthrough for us is technology we're able to develop from a manufacturing standpoint, allowing us to, at a very low capital spend and efficient cost of operations, ability to create 4,000 tons to 8,000 tons modules for lithium hydroxide instead of having to build, in one shot, a 20,000 tons or 30,000 tons.","So today we do have an improved view and more certain view of what lithium hydroxide is doing, but all the work we've done over the last two years was to develop a manufacturing process allowing us to follow the demand growth, which means that if the growth is not as we're expecting, we can stop one or two of these modules manufacturing and slow down the capacity increase we have planned. If the demand becomes more aggressive, very easy for us to speed up the building of those modules.","So first to your question, yes, we have increased confidence. Our strategy is very highly focused on the downstream product where we have the highest profitability. Third, we have a safety net around demand by this manufacturing process we have in place, so allowing to match the demand. Where are we on our forecast? We are taking pretty much a middle of the range. We are far in a process and predictability for the numbers I gave to you to take the highest prediction from EV companies. So, that was the upside, but you know we are prepared also for the downside. And maybe I'll ask Tom to comment on the technology.","Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director-Lithium Division","Yes, and thanks for the question. On the technology, we've got a technology roadmap, and I'd say that with this strategy that we've undertaken on the high value products, the biggest shift is increased collaboration and formalized collaboration with our customers. So we do have a number of exciting opportunities that are being discussed with customers and being trialed with customers, and we're looking forward to that. It will continue to add to high quality sales of new lithium derivatives and new applications of existing lithium derivative.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As this was the last question let me close with a couple of words before I hand the closing comments to Brian. I think we went through those two quarters very highly focused on delivering what we promise to do. Everything we've done in the two quarters has done a few things for us.","First of all I believe, from an ag standpoint, if any of the market are not yet returning to the level of growth these kind of markets could expect to see one day, we have improved highly our control, visibility and predictability of our own business.","I think from the lithium standpoint, it is a bright spot for us. We have refined our strategy. And I have to say, the breakthrough we had in technology around lithium hydroxide manufacturing are an enormous win for us looking at the future.","Health and nutrition, the business is solid. The business is highly profitable. But we also understand the challenges we have on Omega-3, and it's something we'll be focusing in the quarters to come. So with this, I am going to tell to call back to Brian.","Brian P. Angeli - Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Development","Thank you, Pierre. As always, appreciate the time and the questions. I'll be available following the call to address any further questions that you may have. So with that, thank you and have a good day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference will be available for replay after 10 AM today through September 3 at midnight.

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Pierre Brondeau. Pierre?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Brennen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release, our first quarter results provided a very strong start to what we expect will be another record year for FMC. ","Summarizing our first quarter 2012 performance. Sales of $951 million increased 18% above last year's first quarter, and adjusted earnings of $1.94 per diluted share grew 30% versus a year-ago quarter. Agricultural Products delivered a robust performance in the quarter. Sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based growth across Latin America, North America and Asia. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by the sales gain, partially offset by higher spending on several growth initiatives.","In Specialty Chemicals, the performance met our expectations. Sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling prices were achieved in all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceuticals and lithium primary markets. Partially offsetting these pricing gains were lower volumes related to downtimes associated with capacity expansions and plant tie-ins at our Argentina lithium facility, and to a lesser degree, at BioPolymer's alginates facility in Norway. Segment earnings of $44 million were down 1% as the sales gain were more than offset by higher weather-related operating costs in lithium, plant downtime effects, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. ","In Industrial Chemicals, sales of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices, especially in soda ash, and volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48.1 million increased 19% as the result of the sales gains, favorable export mix in soda ash and the continued mix shift in peroxygens towards specialties markets. ","Taking a look at total company sales on a regional basis in the first quarter. Sales in Latin America demonstrated the highest growth rate, up 38%, driven by Agricultural Products as a result of the strong finish through the crop season in Brazil and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina. We also increased soda ash exports to the region and realized healthy sales growth in BioPolymer. ","Sales growth in North America was strong, of 14%. Sales in Agricultural Products benefited from healthy demand for pre-emergent herbicide, new product introduction and the shift of some sales from the second quarter due to an early start of the 2012 season. Industrial Chemicals benefited from higher selling prices across all businesses in the region. ","Sales in Asia were also up 14% in the quarter. Drivers of this growth were broad-based, with gains in Agricultural Products, soda ash exports and in food and pharmaceuticals businesses in BioPolymer. ","Sales in EMEA were up 8% as greater penetration in peroxygens market, sales gains in BioPolymer's pharmaceuticals business and higher sales of herbicide and fungicide in Agricultural Products all contributed to the increase. ","As you know, we are focusing on increasing our presence in the rapidly developing economies of the world, RDEs, as we refer to them internally. Looking at sales growth in these economies by region shows good progress being made. Sales in Latin America grew 38%; sales in Asian RDEs grew 13%; sales in Middle East & Africa grew 14%; and sales in Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey grew more modestly at 5%, mainly due to timing effects in the quarter. ","Moving now to corporate items. Corporate expense was $14.2 million versus $16.8 million last year. Interest expense was $11.3 million as compared to $9.9 million last year. On March 31, 2011, gross consolidated debt was $947 million; and debt, net of cash, was $876 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $32.2 million, and capital expenditures were $38.8 million. ","On a GAAP basis, the company reported net income of $119 million or $1.71 per diluted share versus net income of $94 million or $1.30 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. Net income in the current quarter included charges of $16 million after-tax or $0.23 per diluted share versus charges of $14 million after-tax or $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. With that reconciliation, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.94 per diluted share in the current quarter, up 30% versus $1.49 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. ","Now let's take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter, starting in Agricultural Products. First quarter sales of $454 million increased 32%, driven by broad-based volume growth across Latin America, North America and Asia, augmented by targeted price increases. Latin America delivered the highest sales gain, driven by a strong finish to the crop season in Brazil, particularly in sugarcane and cotton segments, and sales from a new market access joint venture in Argentina. North America also delivered a significant sales gain, resulting from strong demand for pre-emergent herbicide, growth from new product introductions and the shift in some sales from the second quarter, driven by an early start to the 2012 season due to favorable weather conditions and high crop prices. In Asia, sales gain reflected continued strong demand across the region, particularly China, Indonesia and Pakistan, and growth from new product introductions. In EMEA, the sales increase was driven by higher herbicide and fungicide's volumes. Segment earnings of $130 million increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter, driven by the broad-based sales growth, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. ","Agricultural Products continues to deliver sustained premium performance as we successfully execute on our differentiated strategy. The first elements of our strategy, innovation by continuously aggregating technologies and applying them to key focus market has been a key factor. While we continue to deliver the superior performance quarter-after-quarter, we are also thoughtfully investing in the future growth of Agricultural Products. We have a rich pipeline of organic growth initiatives in the group that will deliver profitable growth, not only in the near term, but well beyond our Vision 2015 time frame. We have been carefully including spending in both R&D and in selling and technical service.","In a very short period of time, Agricultural Products has also established a strong track record in pursuing external growth initiatives. Last year, our first full year of implementing this initiative, the group successfully made accretive product line and technology acquisition, signing licensing agreements from development alliances and move into adjacent spaces. Clearly, Agricultural Products is well on its way to meeting or surpassing its Vision 2015 objectives. ","And now moving on to Specialty Chemicals. Sales of $216 million were up 3% as higher selling price were achieved across all businesses, particularly in food, pharmaceutical and lithium primaries markets. Lower volumes resulting from downtime associated with capacity expansion and plant tie-ins at our Argentina lithium facility and to a lesser degree, at BioPolymer's alginates facility in Norway, with limited top line growth in the quarter. Segment earnings of $44 million declined 1%, essentially in line with our outlook given to you last quarter. The sales gain was offset by higher weather-related operating costs and plant downtime effects associated with the capacity expansion projects, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. ","Looking at each business for more detail. In BioPolymer, sales increased solidly as a result of higher sales price across the business. Sales growth in pharmaceutical buyers and these integrants was especially strong in the quarter on higher selling prices and continued steady volume growth. In food ingredients, we benefited from higher selling prices and favorable mix. We anticipate continued premium growth in our microcrystalline cellulose product line, or MCC, serving beverage and dairy markets, especially in Asia. We're making a series of capacity expansion to serve this growth. Last year, we expanded our Cork, Ireland facility, which increased our global capacity by 25% for food and pharmaceutical grade MCC. We are currently expanding our Newark, Delaware facility by 25%, and expect this additional capacity to be in production by the end of the year. And in addition, we are evaluating the setting of a greenfield MCC plant in Asia. BioPolymer delivered strong earnings growth in the quarter as a result of the pricing gain and favorable mix, partially offset by lower volume and higher specialty wood pulp costs. ","Moving to lithium. Sales grew modestly, driven by pricing gains, especially in lithium primaries, which were more than offset -- which more than offset lower volume resulting from production downtime associated with our capacity expansion in Argentina. The plant tie-in in Argentina was completed despite heavy rain in January and February, which are seasonally very unusual for the region. The rains impacted production volumes and costs by diluting peroxygen [ph] operation pond inventories. Lithium earnings were lower than expected due to these adverse weather impacts. We are seeing higher processing cost and a slightly lower ramping production volume as a result of the dilution. The impacts will be largely behind us by the end of the second quarter. Therefore, sequentially, we anticipate a significant pickup in lithium sales and earnings in the second half of this year compared to the first half. ","Moving now to Industrial Chemicals. Revenue of $273 million increased 12%, driven by higher selling prices across the segments, particularly in soda ash, augmented by volume growth in soda ash and specialty peroxygens. Segment earnings of $48 million increased 19% as a result of the sales gain, favorable export mix in soda ash and a continued success in shifting peroxygens mix towards specialties market. ","Now let's look at drivers of performance for each of the businesses. In soda ash, we realized strong sales and earnings as we benefited from higher selling prices in 2012 contracts and volume growth from food production at our Granger facility, which came online in the middle of last year. Granger product serves export demand growth, which continues to outpace domestic growth. Export demand for ANSAC remained healthy. We benefited from higher ANSAC selling price in both Latin America and Asia. For perspective, in 2012, we expect to ship just over 50% of the total volume to the export markets. Within the export market, about half of the volume goes to Latin America and the other half to the rest of the world -- to Asia and the rest of the world. ","The contract nature varies by region. Nearly all North American and Latin American contracts have annual fixed price provision. In Asia, the majority of contract terms are 3 to 6 months in duration. So with domestic and Latin America contracts essentially fixed for the year, the only area for pricing change is in Asia. In Asia, ANSAC configures our trainings intended for users. In recent quarters, trainings for users have benefited from historically high margins despite rising input costs. We have seen Asian pricing suffering as we went through the first quarter due to lower demand and pricing for domestic Chinese soda ash, which impacted export prices from China. ","In our outlook for the year, we continue to make a conservative and prudent view that ANSAC Asian export prices will decline modestly as competition accelerates. Nonetheless, we are very confident that the average export price for 2012 will remain materially higher than the average in 2011. This higher export price, coupled with higher domestic pricing, give rise to our outlook for significant profit growth from our soda ash business in 2012. As a result, we are also very confident that the Industrial Chemicals segment will deliver the 20% earnings growth that is in our full year guidance. ","Moving to peroxygens. In peroxygen, we also realized strong sales and earning growth. The sales increase was driven by higher volume and selling prices in specialty peroxygen, augmented by higher selling prices in European hydrogen peroxide. Earnings benefited from the sales gain and the continued several shift mix towards specialties. ","As we have been running the specialty strategy for a couple of years now, the split between specialties and commodities in North America is almost 50-50, which is far more balanced than the rest of the world. We are focusing our efforts on driving globalization of the specialties business to continue on the path to achieving our Vision 2015 goal. ","During the quarter, we took another significant step toward realizing one of Industrial Chemicals' Vision 2015, that is the building of the environmental solutions platform. Today, we are announcing the launch of FMC Environmental Solutions, a new business that elevates and formalizes our company's commitment to the growing pollution prevention and remediation market. This business integrates our existing portfolio of products, processes and application that sustainably address complex pollution challenges in air, soil and water. We are committed to building in our already strong foundation and to expand our technology portfolio of products, offerings and people resources in this high-growth specialty market. Our expectations are to grow FMC Environmental Solutions over the next several few years into a business with sales in the $100 million to $200 million range by 2015. ","To ensure we bring appropriate focus and resources to air, soil and water markets, we have structured FMC Environment Solutions with 3 platforms or business units. The first one, Air Pollution Control, we are targeting power utility and manufacturing industries with low-cost capital solutions to help meet current and pending regulations for air quality standards. We are focused on the removal of acid gases, such as SOx and HCl, via the use of trona and sodium bicarbonates as reagents in dry sorbent injection, or DSI, through our joint venture with Natronx; and hydrogen peroxide for the removal of NOx in conjunction with conventional scrubbers through our new Environmental Solutions business. ","Soil & Groundwater Remediation, this business unit develops and markets unique fast-acting chemistries that treat a wide range of contaminants in soil and groundwater. With our recent acquisition of the assets of Adventus Intellectual Property, we are the global leader in chemical remediation technologies that are used underground. Our chemistries are focused on the remediation of normal and halogenated organics and minerals via reduction and oxidation. Our portfolio of technologies is unique. From a persulfate-based Klozur products to the carbon-based products we acquired from Adventus, we can now address the full spectrum of site issues, namely soils, plume and groundwater. ","And now Water Treatment. We are utilizing a number of chemistries from our peroxygens business in municipal wastewater facilities that are more environmentally benign than traditional chlorine chemistry. This business unit will also market various proprietary green chemistries for enhancing water treatment in the oil and gas exploration field by neutralizing sulfur-reducing bacteria. ","With that review of our business, I will turn the call over to Kim Foster for a review of our financial position. Kim?","W. Kim Foster","Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. First, share repurchases. Recall that in November of last year, we committed to repurchase $200 million of shares by the end of the first quarter of 2012. Following that commitment, we repurchased $55 million of shares in the fourth quarter of last year. And I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter, we completed the $200 million program with the repurchase of approximately $145 million of shares. At the start of the second quarter, we have $245 million of repurchased capacity remaining under an existing board authorization. ","Going forward, we will continue to govern and balance the pace of execution of our share repurchases with our capital needs to drive organic growth in the investment and targeted external opportunities. ","Moving to our recent announcement of a 2-for-1 stock split. Following our shareholders' approval of an amendment to increase the number of authorized shares, last week, our Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock. The split will be affected in the form of a distribution payable on May 24, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2012. Trading in the common stock will begin on a post-split adjusted basis on May 25, 2012. ","I'll close by reaffirming guidance for certain financial items, which we gave you during last quarter's conference call. Free cash flow for 2012 is reconfirmed at $200 million to $225 million for the year. Our capital expenditure forecast is reaffirmed at $250 million, and our tax rate for the year is reaffirmed at 27%. ","With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you, Kim. Regarding the outlook for the full year of 2012, we have raised the midpoint of our previous outlook and now expect adjusted earnings of $6.80 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 16% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. ","Our Agricultural Products segment expect to achieve its ninth straight year of record earnings, up 10% to 15% over last year. Sales gain is the result of volume growth in all regions, particularly in Latin America, North America and Asia, due to strong market condition and growth from new and acquired products, partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. ","And our Specialty Chemicals segment expect to achieve its seventh straight year of record earnings, led by the eighth straight year of record earnings in BioPolymer. Segment earnings are expected to be up approximately 5%, reflecting higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer and lithium specialties. Partially offsetting this growth are higher lithium operating costs in the first half of the year, higher raw material costs and increased spending on several growth initiatives in BioPolymer. ","As I mentioned earlier, in our Lithium business, we expect a significant sequential pickup in sales and earnings in the second half of the year compared to the first half. ","In our Industrial Chemicals segment, we expect earnings to be up 20%, driven by higher volumes and selling price in soda ash and specialty peroxygen, augmented by the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygens. ","Moving to our outlook for the second quarter of 2012. We expect adjusted earnings of $1.65 to $1.85 per diluted share, a 14% increase in the midpoint of this range. In Agricultural Products, we expect earnings to be up about 5%, reflecting growth in all regions, partially offset by the shift of some sales in North America to the first quarter and higher spending on targeted growth initiatives. To get a better read on trend line earnings growth, without the shift in some North American sales in the first quarter, the second quarter percent earnings increase would've been in the low teens. ","Specialty Chemicals segment earnings are projected to be up 5% -- or to be 5% lower as higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in BioPolymer are offset by higher operating costs in lithium, higher raw material costs and increased spending on targeted growth initiatives in BioPolymer. ","And in Industrial Chemicals, we expect second quarter segment earnings to be up approximately 30%, driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and specialty peroxygens, volume growth in soda ash, the absence of Granger's soda ash facility start-up costs incurred in the prior quarter and the continued mix shift towards specialty peroxygen. Again, for a better read on trend line earning growth, where Granger's start-up costs not incurred in last year's second quarter, the percent earnings increase for the second quarter 2012 would have been in the low teens. ","With that, I thank you for your time and attention, and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Thank you for providing that pull forward on the Ag side. I was wondering if you could do something similar in terms of the lithium weather impacting Q1. Obviously, specialties came in a little bit lighter than expected. What -- how -- could you give us the order of magnitude of that -- of the negative impact due to weather for lithium in Q1?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, Frank, this is Michael Wilson. In terms of the weather impacting Q1, I would say it was probably $1 million to $2 million of EBIT.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, so not too significant. And sticking with that, you saw the headlines that the Argentine government is looking to take over YPF. What concerns, if any, do you have with respect to your position in that market?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Well, right now, as you know, we do have agreement with the government in terms of how we operate and tax and cash repatriation. But clearly, we are taking a pause in looking at where we are going with our expansion. I think the way the business is operating today is fine, but as you know, we are going to be very quickly even with the current expansion, again, at a 100% capacity utilization. And we are studying the situation in Argentina to make a final decision in the next few months about our future expansion. I think there's a lot of moving parts today in Argentina, and it is very hard for me to make a full commitment to the next step of expansion until we have a better picture of what is going on. And we are talking with authorities over there in Argentina.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. So it's something that sometime in this late summer and so forth, we'll have a better idea what FMC's plans are there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Absolutely, Frank.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then lastly, you mentioned that you're expecting a very positive growth on the soda ash business and pricing up year-over-year in that business, although you did mention a competitive threat to the export market. Can you talk a little bit more about that?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, what -- I mean, if you look year-on-year, we're going to have very solid -- and it's part of our guidance and what we've said, very solid year-on-year pricing. Today, we have started looking forward to be prudent, and that's why despite the very strong first quarter, you see that we are keeping above the year number for Industrial Chemical in term of earnings growth at the same level. And we are looking at a 20% despite a stronger first quarter than we're expecting. We mentioned the fact that we had a very favorable export mix, which should re-establish and be a little bit less favorable in the second quarter. And we have seen some sign of price decrease in Asia around soda ash because of the reduction in demand versus what we're expecting. It's not big, but it's there, and we just took the prudent approach to have a more conservative pricing from ANSAC in Asia and only in Asia. The rest of the world stays about what we're expecting.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. Well, you certainly -- your results here in the first quarter certainly made your guidance for Q1 very prudent and conservative, so -- well, I guess we'll expect the same for the balance of the year.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I was just hoping to talk about the soda ash business a little bit. You had talked about seeing some increased royalty payments during 2012, and I was wondering if that had an impact in Q1 or maybe kind of what the timing is. And can you remind us what the magnitude of that higher royalty impact will be?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, Mike, it's Mark Douglas here. We'd never actually gave an order of magnitude when we talked on the fourth quarter call in terms of what the royalties was. The rate has moved from 2% to 6% on any federal land that we mine. We don't actually break that out, but yes, it did have an impact in Q1, and it will have an impact in the rest of the year on a quarterly basis as we go forward. But we did not break that out.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And the impact, compared to Q1, should be about the same as the year progresses?","Mark A. Douglas","It's not easy to say. It's not actually as simple as that because as we mine, we go through different leases, so it varies quarter-to-quarter, but we don't actually break that out in terms of quarterly analysis.","Pierre R. Brondeau","And we started to move into the new royalty partially during part of last year, so it's not -- I mean, the impact was high in the first quarter, but it varies from quarter to quarter.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And then in the BioPolymer business, you referred to improved mix in the food business and specifically noted dairy beverages in Asia. Are we going to continue to see within that business that your higher-value products are growing faster than other areas? And can you maybe just give us a little bit more color on how much higher the margins are in something like dairy beverages versus the average for the food business?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think the -- more than talking about dairy or other application, I would say that we have 3 product lines in our BioPolymer business: carrageenan, alginate and MCC. And by far, the highest profit, faster growth is our MCC product line, and that if you look, that's where all of our investment are going. So I think this business will grow faster and faster when the MCC part of that business will get bigger because that's the place which is commanding potentially high single-digit or double-digit growth rates, while the other businesses are just low single-digit growth. So MCC is really -- and you're right, MCC has application in the dairy market in Asia; very fast growth in Asia; double-digit growth in Asia. It has application also in pharmaceutical, protein beverage, so it's a broad range of application but more specialty and more differentiated.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And then the last question I had is just maybe to elaborate a little further on lithium and the downtime. It sounds to me like your downtime, because of the adverse weather you saw, the downtime and the startup of the capacity expansion is maybe taking a little bit longer than you had initially anticipated. You talked at first about 6 weeks of downtime during the first quarter. Is that more or less where you are, or maybe a little more color there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, the downtime itself in term of time was about the same. It was more difficult. We had issues in bringing some of the equipment we need because of the weather on the road. But the length of the downtime was about the same. The problem is the downtime, combined with the weather, created some issues to operate the plant. Even the pod was working the way it was working at full capacity. We also had dilutions, very significant dilutions of the ponds, which is forcing us to work with brine which is more diluted. So we had -- it's much more a combination of 2 negative effects together, which have created a situation where in the first quarter, the performance was low compared to -- significantly below what we had a year ago. We will still see that effect in the second quarter because even if the tie-ins of the plants are done, we're going to be having diluted ponds, and we're going to be operating with the brine which is less concentrated, which will create less product from the plant in a high operating cost. Things are starting to get better in the third quarter. So third quarter, you will see sequential and year-on-year improvement in the EBIT, not yet at full capacity. I think we will have fully recovered from all of that, and the lithium business will be at full performance in the fourth quarter. So you will see sequential improvement from first quarter to the fourth quarter with the start of the ramp-up, the most visible start of the ramp-up being in the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Pierre, if you ultimately elect not to proceed with a follow-on expansion of lithium capacity in Argentina, can you give us a sense of the other potential options available to you? For example, does FMC today have access to any reserves outside of Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America or North America, for example?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Well, today, the places where we would be -- first of all, let me say that we are pausing and observing and negotiating, but we still believe Argentina is our #1 option for expansion. So we cannot make a decision today because of the political situation. But it still remains our #1 opportunity. If it is not a place where we would increase, the options we have are, clearly, you know that Chile is a place today which is opening up to companies. Now we would have to start a grassroot plan. So we would not any longer be talking about major expansion in 2014. I would most likely push that to 2016-plus. We also have possibilities in Australia and possibilities in China. So we are right now looking at all of our options we might be able to use, but Argentina remains our priority. Argentina, by far, is the cheapest and the fastest way to bring additional capacity.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then if I may switch gears to soda ash, can you give us an update on how you would assess prospects for a restart of the remaining idle capacity that you have at Granger? And then a second question on mix, I think you alluded to favorable mix. Is that essentially more tons flowing into Latin America versus Asia? And would you expect the geographic mix to be different this year relative to last year in that regard?","Pierre R. Brondeau","First, let me talk about the expansion. I would say that the probability that we'll expand Granger is very high. The question is only the timing. As you know, we do have 3 major projects to be undertaken. We are -- we will be building a large MCC plant in Asia. We do have the doubling of the capacity in Argentina potentially for lithium, and we do have the Granger 2 expansion. So we have to prioritize and decide what is the best timing for all of this. I would say that we will be, as Frank said before, maybe by end of the summer, fall, we'll have a better idea of where we're going with the lithium timing. And I would say that by the end of the year, we'll have a better idea of where we are going with the Granger timing. So all of those are most likely to happen. It is just a timing of one versus the other. I would say the one which is the most likely to take off first and be quickly undertaken is the MCC plant in Asia. Regarding the mix, we believe the mix is going to be -- the export mix is going to be the same year-on-year. The only difference is more of a quarter. We had left shipment towards Russia or Eastern Europe or some other countries which are more difficult and less favorable from a mix standpoint, but we're going to ship more toward those in the second quarter. So it's more of a quarter balance than it is of a year balance.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. On the -- in Ag, in the North American pull-forward that you saw or you took from a little bit maybe of the second quarter earnings and pulled it into the first, can you please discuss how we should think about the margin on that business compared to the rest of your core business in Ag?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Margins are about the same. What we believe is we believe that we pulled forward about $5 million to $8 million of EBIT into the first quarter. That's about the number we are estimating. Those are speculations. I mean, it's sometimes very hard to know if we could stay strong on EBIT more, but we're expecting that -- North America tends to have higher margins than places like Brazil, but there is not a very large difference. And assuming about the same level of margin, we pulled forward $5 million to $8 million of EBIT.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then for the Environmental Solutions opportunity, and I guess, the segment that you're going to be carving out going forward, is this more of a management direction kind of change in terms how you resource it with management, or should we be thinking about M&A and capital projects that are incremental to what we've been looking for in some of these businesses in the past?","Pierre R. Brondeau","That's a good question. A couple of things. First of all, there is a management change, which means we wanted to create an organization where people would wake up in the morning thinking solely about that business and would be capable of leveraging the resources we have a bit spread around that business around the company. So we wanted a much more focused accountable management for that space and bringing together the technologies, allowing better innovation. I do not foresee beyond what we have announced any significant capital spending, but I do foresee potential M&A activities.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question with -- somewhat tied to that, with the venture that you have on some of the trona opportunities, can you discuss what you've been seeing so far since you've started that venture and when we might be seeing some sort of a growth pick-up there?","Mark A. Douglas","Yes, John, this is Mark. I assume you're referring to Natronx, our DSI joint venture.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's right.","Mark A. Douglas","With the Cross-State Air Pollution Rules being stayed from April of this year until early next year, obviously, we've seen customers being very cautious in terms of what they are looking at for trials, et cetera. But for us, it's very much a case of not if the rules are in place, but when. And we fully expect that to occur early next year. So our plant expansion that we have underway in Wyoming is scheduled to be on stream at the end of this year, and that is on track. So we're very bullish on this market. We recognize there's been a delay from the April of this year to early next year, but it's very much a market that we expect to grow. So you should be looking for some impacts as we go through next year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Going back to the soda ash for a second, is your -- the delay of your decision, Pierre, on adding additional capacity at Granger linked to the higher competitive environment in Asia and lower prices? Do you feel that you have more time in front of you before you decide what to do depending on what happens there?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Not at all. We have a very positive outlook. If you look at -- an expansion in Granger would bring about 700,000 tons of products in the market, which is 45 million, 50 million tons a year, where you have growth, which is in the mid-single digits. So -- and if you add to that the low manufacturing costs we had, it would not be an issue at all to push this product into the market without even creating more price pressure on the world. So the vision is not due to market constraints. We feel very strong about the market today and where we're going for this year and next year. It is more a prioritization within the company in term of resources. Those 3 projects represent significant capital investment, which could dimension in the order of $0.5 billion, and they all require -- if not more actually, and they all require significant engineering resources. And I just want to make sure that we are resourcing all of those projects in an appropriate way to successfully deliver on each of them. That's why we have to maybe stagger the start of each of those projects and not undertake everything at the same time.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay, that is helpful. And at the end of the fourth quarter, you mentioned, if my -- if I am remembering correctly, that the 8 transactions that you did in 2011 were going to -- would add about $90 million to 2012 revenues and $15 million, 1, 5, of EBIT or $0.07 per share. Are you on track to get those particular increments, or are you ahead there or behind? Could you give us a better feel for what -- bring us up-to-date as to how they are performing?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Absolutely on track. Some, maybe positive news, if I look beyond 2012 on some of the product line we have acquired, which are showing greater opportunity I'm thinking for -- about Ag, for example. But yes, for 2012, completely on track. And we will be -- as you know, we give every other quarter, we will give an update on 2015, and that will be part of monitoring. So we'll talk more about that when we do that, but we're on track.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And if I may ask one last question on lithium. The stated goal is that there will be 1 million EV vehicles on the road by 2015. But we are beginning to read that actually, if we have 200,000, that will be good. Is that -- if this is the case, would that change the growth rate you're anticipating, and therefore, there is not as much of a rush or pressure to add additional lithium in order to supply a market that may grow slower than previously anticipated?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No. If you look at the way we are building the capacity, as well as what has been announced by some of our peer companies in this market, the kind of capacity increase we are planning to add in the 2014, 2015 time frame will be absorbed by the market outside of the EV market. So it is not a big decision. We will be building the capacities to double the full capacity in 2 different tranches. Now if EV is slower than what we are seeing, that could impact the timing at which we have tranche 2 of the capacity expansion. But right now, where most of the industry is in capacity and the growth of the market outside of EV or, let's say, of the car industry, outside of the car transportation industry, we have no issue in the first step of the expansion. Same ways is being -- it's the same for our competitors. I think the question will come for the next step in the '16, '17.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Mike Sison of KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of your outlook for Industrial Chemicals, I thought you had noted initially that Granger will be running full out. Will it still be pretty much running full out for this year?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Correct. It's running full out.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just when you talked about some of the pricing in soda ash slipping a little bit, is that -- just to clarify, is that more supply-driven or was it really more demand-driven?","Pierre R. Brondeau","I think we believe, what we understand and also, again, it's not like we have 6 months of price decrease behind us, but the signs we are reading is that there has been capacity buildup in the end of last year in China and a market growing a little bit slower than we're expecting, which has been pushing some of the Chinese competitors to push product outside of China into their export market, and those product came head-to-head against ours, and that has created a little slowdown in the price increase. Now pricing are still robustly above where they were last year. Don't get me wrong. It's not a decrease versus last year price. The price is actually going up. The problem is what we see today is the ramp-up of the price in Asia might not be as steep as what we're expecting, and we are slowing down a bit the curve but still contemplating year-on-year price increase.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. And it sounds like demand is still pretty solid over there. It's not deteriorating too quickly.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, the demand is solid, and we are at full capacity in the summer 2012 expansion, and it's all soda.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And last question, the Bayer acquisition, the fungicide business that you bought from Bayer, the exciting potential -- potentially, sorry. Is -- can you give us an update there or how that business did in the first quarter and what your outlook for that business could be for the next couple of years?","Pierre R. Brondeau","The business actually is doing quite well. We are still in the integration process. It's quite a complex process to bring all of the Bayer product registration and all of the supply chain issues. So we are still in the integration phase, but I have to say that we are very pleased with that acquisition. We're very pleased with our cooperation with Bayer, which is extremely positive. And we do see more and more opportunities. We just had a review, for example, in Latin America. We do see great opportunities beyond what we're expecting. So when I answered the question before, we're on track, and say maybe beyond 2012, we have some good surprise there, that's one of the one which is going to grow faster than we are expecting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Lucy Watson on for Laurence today. You've mentioned that BioPolymer sales were up solidly with a good contribution from price. Were you able to achieve the full targeted 15% price increase that you announced in December? And what is your current overall MCC utilization rate?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, in terms of the price increases, we had very successful price increases across BioPolymer. Unlike some of the other businesses, BioPolymer increases prices more on a customer-by-customer basis as opposed to across-the-market. So it really varied across the product line. But then in terms of the volume, we did add capacity last year, we filled out a great deal of that capacity. And as Pierre mentioned, we have another expansion of MCC coming on in the fourth quarter of this year, so we think that's going to be well-timed to bring that on given the market growth that we're seeing.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And also in your prepared remarks, on regional terms, you mentioned some timing impacts on sales in Central and Eastern Europe and in Turkey. Could you expand on that?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, those are small volumes from small sales. It's part also of what I discussed around the -- it had a positive impact in term of the mix for soda ash, where we saw more sales going to non-Eastern Europe, Russia countries and more toward western, toward Latin America or Asia, which was a positive mix. But it's -- we are pretty small over there, so it's not a -- it had a positive impact on earnings, but it's not a big volume contributor.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one more. Is it possible to put the Agricultural Products sales increase by product or maybe to provide what level of growth you saw in herbicide versus fungicide?","Pierre R. Brondeau","No, we don't usually break down herbicide, fungicide or our product line in term of growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions, if I may. To follow up on the last question and not focusing specifically to the question that Mike asked and not focusing specifically on the business you bought or the product you bought from Bayer. But if you take a look over the past year, you've made several product acquisitions. If you look at them in aggregate, could you give us an idea what the contribution on an annual basis to revenues is in the Ag business from these new products?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, I would say that those product will be in the range of $50 million.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","$50 million, 5-0?","Pierre R. Brondeau","5-0, $50 million or slightly more.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, okay. That's pretty significant. Great.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, it is. Yes.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Secondly, when you are bringing on -- you talked about the lithium problems that you're continuing to have as far as weather is concerned but -- in the rains and the dilution. But as far as the cost of bringing on or starting the ramp-up of production in the third quarter, should we expect that to be dilutive to margins until you ramp up fully and then see the full benefit in the fourth quarter, is that the right way to think about it?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Lithium, yes. I mean, the way you have to look at lithium is, up to the fourth quarter, we will not be at the full sales and earnings potential of the business, so you won't see an improvement in the second quarter versus the first quarter, versus only a long way from the potential as we recover. Sales quarter, as you start to feel better, but we are still operating at higher costs, but it's improving for the third quarter, and end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter is what we know and believe we will be at the full operations of the business, which means we'd be operating at a lower cost, with margins more in line with our expectation in historical margin and higher volumes because we'll benefit fully from the expansion.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So the full impact, if you will, when we looked to, is really in 2013 when you're going to have all 4 quarters of higher volume and a better margin business?","Pierre R. Brondeau","You're absolutely correct. I think we're going to see a very different performance of the Lithium business in 2013, which will be a continuation of the performance with the same ratio in sales that we're going to have in the fourth quarter.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it, got it. Just staying with the specialty business, the investing that you talked about doing in the BioPolymer's area, can you talk about sort of the magnitude of the investments that you're making and where is it going? Is it personnel? Is it marketing? Is it product line expansions or capacity expansions? And then talk a little bit about the timing of all these initiatives and what's the payoff and when is the payoff.","Pierre R. Brondeau","All right. We -- the capital spending for a plant like that, we are still at the pre-engineering phase, so it's going to be plus or minus $50 million, but I would say in the range of $100 million. And we would be moving into a full-mode detailed engineering before the end of the year. We believe a startup before the end of 2014, Michael, is correct?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Before the end of 2014. The $100 million is capital spend. We do have an organization today which is ready to bring to market. I mean, we still have to hire, I'm sure, a few salespeople. But overall, we do have an organization which is in place with the technical and sales structure to sell the product which will come out of this plant. I don't know if you've seen but we have opened up a lab in Singapore this quarter, in the first quarter, where we had about 50 customers that was there. We do have expanded our lab and offices in Istanbul. We have a new lab also in India. So we have in -- plus, as you know, we have a new innovation center in Shanghai. So from a front end of the company, sales, marketing, tech service, we are pretty much ready to sell more. We are at 100% capacity, and by 2014, we'll bring that to the market.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So the extra investments that you talked about that's impacting the margins of the BioPolymer's business, that largely had to do with labs that you opened more so than the CapEx for the MCC expansion, right?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Correct. That's correct.","Operator","Your last question will come from the line of Peter Butler of Glen Hill Investment.","Peter Butler","I'm wondering if -- could Mark Douglas give us an update on his or your cost reduction programs?","Mark A. Douglas","Hi, Peter, it's Mark here. Yes, sure. If you remember back to the Investor Day and consequent calls, we said we would have run rate savings by the end of 2011 of $25 million, an additional $25 million on top of that by the end of 2012 going towards an $18 million run rate of savings by 2015. I can tell you that we beat our $25 million at the end of 2011 by a couple of million dollars, and we are on track to deliver the next $25 million by the end of this year. So things are in -- on track, where we expect it to be. We've built out the organization as I said we would, and we're very much focused on adding value to the company by a very professional procurement organization.","Peter Butler","Good, sounds good. Could I ask, please, Pierre, about the -- you've mentioned several times the extra spend on growth initiatives, some in Ag, some in BioPolymer's. I'm wondering is this just normal growth initiatives or is this extra expenditures because maybe your earnings and cash flow are coming along better than you thought and you could spend more?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes, Peter. I mean, that's an important question. We believe today -- we truly believe today that we have the capability to deliver significant top line growth and double-digit EPS growth every quarter, but at the same time, take advantage of all of the opportunities we have for future growth. And we believed, after looking into our portfolio of technology pipeline, that we were limited, not by the ideas, not by the portfolio of what we could bring to the market, just by the resource and money. And seeing the growth potential of the company, the earnings potential of the company, we have decided that we can deliver beyond expectations, but still invest more in the future of the company and in the past. So what we called growth initiatives are mostly strengthening our research globally by more resource in North America, but also in other places like Asia or Latin America, more sales, more tech service in order to bring more work on registrations in Ag, so more spending to bring new technology to the market faster. And we've been thinking about should we do that for a couple of years when I joined, but I believe, for a little while, we're going to want to take opportunities or what we have in front of us because we do have lots of positive things which are happening in the company, which will allow us growth for many years.","Peter Butler","Okay. And slightly different, you mentioned 3 or 4 or 5 different, nonrecurring, temporary negatives that have impacted your short-term earnings. I know you're not going to want to go through each and -- each one of them and give us a number, but could you sort of aggregate and tell us how much this cost you in the second quarter and what might show up on the bottom line a year from now in the second quarter due to the amelioration of some of these negatives that you had itemized?","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. If you look in the big scheme of things, there is only one negative today. It's the performance of the lithium business. We -- I mean, frankly, if you look at all of the businesses, they're all performing very, very strongly currently, and they are going to perform very strongly for the next 3 quarters for the year and beyond. So the major orientation we have in the earning growth despite the -- and despite that, we delivered a 30% year-on-year EPS growth in our lithium business. It is multimillion dollars, I mean, more than single digits, which we're going to see to the bottom line in between the first quarter and the fourth quarter this year in term of amelioration of the financial performance of that business. So what we really have to focus on today is keep on operating all of our businesses as strongly as they have been performing and turn around the Lithium business. And we know exactly where the issues are, so you will start to see some improvement in Q2, some in Q3, and you will see the full earning potential of that business in Q4. The rest -- yes, there is some issues right and left, but there is some positive. They pretty much offset each other, and they do not impact majorly the performance of the company.","Peter Butler","Well, I was thinking whatever this number is, it's a pretty sizable number in the first half and sort of builds in a very nice earnings gain year-to-year, that should show up next year in the first half.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Yes. I mean, if you look at -- I think we delivered it -- I mean, I'm pretty, pretty pleased with the quarter we delivered. It's a great thing to be able to talk about a company delivering quarter-on-quarter performance, 30% up in term of earnings. Looking at a year, we're going to have a -- I think, a midpoint of our guidance is around 16% EPS growth, which is a strong performance. And when you know that we're delivering that, with 4 business out of 5 performing, and we have 1 with strong earnings growth potential. And when you -- you have to believe that those 5 businesses will be operating at full potential in the fourth quarter, that tells you the magnitude of improvement we can see demonstrating to a 30% now.","Operator","I will now turn the call back to Mr. Brondeau for his closing remarks.","Pierre R. Brondeau","Thank you very much to all for your time, your attentions and your questions. I hope that during today's call, we have demonstrated again our ability to deliver strong performance quarter-after-quarter, while at the same time continue to make well-placed organic and external investments to ensure our future profitable growth. We delivered 2 superb years in 2010 and 2011 and are off a strong start in 2012. We are confident that we will continue to realize the earnings power investors should expect from the FMC portfolio. 1.5 years ago, we shared with you a plan with our overriding objective to drive top quartile total shareholder return. It has an aggressive organic growth component, which would be augmented by a focused external growth component. As we say, we were to realize this aggressive growth, we have made targeted increases in our below-the-line costs. We have increased research and development spending, especially in Agricultural Products and BioPolymer. We had increased selling and technical service expenses, and we had invested in critical infrastructure to deliver this growth where it is needed. The vast majority of this spend is out in the business and regions where it should be, close to our customers. We are fortunate that today, we have a rich organic growth pipeline that will leverage our strong new product and technology innovation expertise. Equally, we have a rich external pipeline that offers us the opportunity to make focused equity and acquisitions. Our success here is evident. In 2012, we will derive $90 million in sales and $15 million in EBIT and EPS of $0.07 from the 8 transactions we completed in 2011. Including the related organic growth investments to fund the growth of each of these transactions, we are on track to meet our goal for external growth to contribute $800 million or more in 2015 revenues. ","So in summary, I can say that now, more than ever, we are confident that 2012 will be another record year for FMC, that we are solidly on track to achieve our Vision 2015 objective, and equally importantly, that we are building a company that will deliver premium growth and value well beyond 2015. I look forward to providing you an update on the Vision 2015 progress during next quarter's call, and I look forward to presenting an in-depth review of our Vision 2015 strategy at an Investor Day to be held on Tuesday, December 11, 2012, in New York City. Details will be forthcoming. ","Thanks, again, for your time and attention. This completes our call.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to FMC Corporation's first quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me this morning is Pierre Brondeau, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's first quarter performance and discuss the outlook for Q2 and the full year 2016. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. The slide presentation that accompanies our results along with our earnings release and 2016 outlook statement are currently available on our website.","The prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available at the conclusion of the call.

A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. 2016 marks the beginning of the new era for FMC. Today's FMC is a more focused and streamlined company. Our businesses operate in attractive end-markets namely agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceuticals and lithium. The actions we have taken over the past 18 months have aligned operation with regional market demand and position each of our businesses to better capitalize on market opportunities. With our transformation complete, we are now solely focused on the execution of our strategy to drive performance in 2016 and beyond.","In Agricultural Solutions, we continue to see the benefits of the Cheminova acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Ag Solutions was very much an American business. In 2014, more than three quarters of its revenues were generated in North and South America. Cheminova significantly increased the size of Ag Solutions operations in Europe and Asia, bringing greater scale and market access to Ag Solutions operations across our regions. The increased global scale of operations combined with actions, we have taken in North and South America will bring greater regional balance to Ag Solutions, align operations with a global crop protection chemical market and limit Ag Solutions reliance on any one region or market to drive performance.","For example, in 2014 almost 40% of Ag Solutions revenue was generated in Brazil alone. In 2016, we expect Brazil to account for less than 20% of segment revenue and only 15% of total company revenue. Across the global Ag market, conditions in the Americas remains the most challenging.","With greater scales and regional balance, FMC is able to better manage our business in the Americas to address market conditions. Specifically, we restructured operations in Brazil to align the size of our business with market conditions and rationalize our product offering to increase our focus on higher margin proprietary technology platforms and differentiated products.","While these actions reduced our revenues in Brazil, they improved the quality of operations and enhanced the potential to deliver higher earnings and return on capital. In North America, we are supporting customer inventory drawdowns to more closely match our sales with underlying global demand and important step to further strengthen FMC's position from which to protect price and terms.","Cheminova also extended our product portfolio and technology pipeline and provided new opportunities to realize meaningful cost savings.","We are already seeing the benefits of our expanded product portfolio in North America and Europe and the integration of Cheminova is progressing well. We remain on track to deliver the full run rate cost savings of $140 million to $160 million by the middle of 2017.","In Health and Nutrition, global demand for FMC's naturally derived ingredients product lines continue to be robust and we remain focused on maintaining the business's high margins through the implementation of manufacturing excellence program, process technology improvements and product differentiation.","In Lithium, we are seeing the benefits of our strategy to focus and grow FMC's business in the technology driven specialty end markets, where demand continues to climb and pricing trends across FMC's portfolio remain favorable. I will discuss the performance of each of our businesses shortly and provide an update on our outlook for Q2 and the full year.","First, I will start with a brief review of FMC's consolidated reported results on slide two. FMC reported first-quarter revenue of approximately $799 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.58 for the quarter was flat compared to the first-quarter of 2015 but was towards the top end of our guidance range as a solid performance in Ag Solutions and a very strong quarter from Lithium drove the results.","Turning now to Ag Solutions on slide 3. Ag Solutions reported revenue of $546 million, a decline of 22% compared to pro forma results for the first quarter of 2015 as lower sales volume in North America and Brazil, due to high channel inventories, planned product rationalization and currency headwinds more than offset the impact of price increases, revenue synergies and new product introductions in the quarter.","As I mentioned previously, we are focused on executing our strategy to drive improved performance. This includes completing the process of rationalizing the Ag Solutions product portfolio that began in 2014. The actions we took to eliminate certain products from our portfolio reduced revenue by approximately $30 million or 4% compared to pro forma revenue for Q1 2015. However, as discussed in prior quarters, this product rationalization has a limited impact on segment earnings.","We also remain focused on pricing discipline. At the operating earnings level price increases implemented in Brazil more that offset the year-over-year impact of the weaker real. However, the broad-based strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in headwinds in Europe and Asia that were only partially offset by price increases. Despite challenging market conditions, the Ag Solutions business delivered segment earnings of $82 million, ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, and maintained operating margins year-over-year on a pro forma basis.","I will make a few additional comments regarding regional market condition in Ag Solutions performance now on slide four. Overall market conditions and our performance in the quarter were very much as expected. In North America, as we discussed on our Q4 earnings call back in February, the deterioration in farm incomes over the past year combined with elevated channel inventory levels led distributors and growers to delay purchases of agriculture inputs including crop protection chemicals. We determined it was critical to maintain price and payment terms in North America this season.","And as part of our strategy to achieve this, we believe it was important to allow the level of FMC product inventory in the sale channel to reduce. Our decision to allow FMC product inventory in the sales channel to be drawn down was the main factor behind the 35% decline in revenue in North America in the quarter compared to pro forma revenue from the first quarter 2015.","However, we anticipate full year revenue performance for Ag Solutions in North America will be largely in line with the broader North America crop protection market, as the actions we are taking today will facilitate increased sales in the second half of the year.","In fact, the data we are seeing give us increased confidence that our approach to managing Ag Solutions business in North America will help protect price and terms in 2016. Despite lower sales into the channel, FMC continues to gain market share when looking at growers' use of product.","Based on independent data, application of FMC products, or products on the ground, rose 7% in the quarter compared to Q1 2015. In particular, we continue to see strength in FMC's Authority brand pre-emergent herbicides, which address the growing number of soybean acres which exhibit glyphosate resistance.","As a result, we are confident the reduction in revenue in Q1 is due more to our decision as when to sell than it is to any change in underlying demand for FMC products. And it is the strong grower demand for FMC's portfolio of technical products, which will ultimately provide the support for pricing and terms as we are \u2013 that we are focused on.","In addition, we continue to see demand by growers for new innovative and differentiated products that provide high value in use. Recent product launches by FMC in core herbicides and the introduction of our expanded fungicides product offering as a result of the Cheminova acquisition received strong support from growers and distributors in the quarter. We also saw strong acceptance of our new biological and synthetic product combinations, including brand such as Capture VGR and Ethos XB.","In Latin America, revenue declined approximately 25% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Lower demand and planned product rationalizations in Brazil more than offset increased sales volume in the rest of Latin America. Excluding this portfolio rationalization, sales in Latin America declined approximately 15% in line with the overall market. Market conditions in Brazil were little changed from the fourth quarter of 2015.","Channel inventory levels have improved but remain elevated, most notably, in soybean insecticide in the northern states. However, we are seeing an increase in demand in the north for insecticides such as FMC's Talisman to address secondary pest pressure in soybeans.","In Southern Brazil, market conditions are improved, especially in sugarcane and certain niche crops such as coffee and citrus. We continued to remain disciplined on pricing in Brazil. As we have explained previously, greater stability in the Brazil real to U.S. dollar exchange rate supports price increase to offset FX headwinds. Paul will comment further on the impact on foreign currencies later in the call.","Outside of Brazil, we continue to see increasing demand for pre-emergent herbicides in Argentina and products for niche crops in Colombia and Mexico. In Argentina, we see improved conditions with far fewer restrictions on imports and with the lifting of export taxes for key crops.","In Europe, sales declined approximately 11% as foreign exchange headwinds and lower market volume more than offset commercial synergies from the Cheminova transaction and new product launches in the quarter.","A cold snap at the end of the winter impacted the season in certain Western European markets and we have seen some tightening of demand by growers in an attempt to control costs in the face of persistently low grain prices.","Strong demand in Central and Eastern Europe and FMC's transition to Cheminova's direct market access model in Europe partially offset the pullback in market activity in the quarter.","Sales volumes across Europe increased for FMC's legal portfolio including herbicide and insecticide for cereal. With the benefit of a broader combined portfolio, we believe the business is well-positioned to address market demand in key crops including cereals and oilseed rate.","Profitability in the region improved meaningfully year-over-year as the move to direct market access combined with other cost savings from the Cheminova integration increased operating margins in Europe by about 200 basis points.","In Asia, we saw increased demand in China and Australia, however, the stronger U.S. dollar combined with planned product rationalization and cool weather in India and Southeast Asia resulted in a 13% decline in pro forma revenue compared to the prior year quarter.","Excluding the impact of currency and planned product rationalization, revenue decreased about 3% driven largely by lower sales volumes in India. Globally, we expect challenging market conditions to persist for the remainder of the year.","As previously stated, we believe the global crop protection chemicals market will decline by a mid to high single-digit percentage in 2016 on a U.S. dollar basis, driven largely by market conditions in North America and Brazil.","We remain highly focused on decreasing FMC product inventory levels in the channel holding on pricing term and increasing collections of accounts receivable. Our full year guidance for Ag Solutions remains unchanged. We continue to forecast full-year revenue of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion and full segment earnings in the range of $380 million to $420 million.","In the second quarter, we expect to deliver segment earnings in the range of $90 million to $110 million along with sequential margin improvement as we move toward the main selling season in North America and Europe.","Turning next to Health and Nutrition on slide five. First quarter performance for Health and Nutrition was broadly in line with expectation. The business reported revenue of $192 million and segment earnings of $47 million.","First quarter 2016 revenue declined approximately $19 million compared to the first quarter of last year. As discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, last year's first quarter revenue included certain Omega-3 sales which were not expected to occur in 2016.","These sales relate principally to pharmaceutical API product and account for the decline in revenue compared to the prior year period. Excluding these sales volumes, and the impact of currency, revenue was essentially flat compared to last year.","Global demand for FMC's health excipient products continues to grow resulting in higher sales volume of binder and ingredients (27:00) products for in the quarter. However, lower sales in functional health due to timing and the more competitive Omega-3 pricing environment broadly offset the increase in health excipient revenue.","For the first quarter of 2016, Health and Nutrition reported segment earnings of $47 million, while lower operating costs resulted in an increase in segment earnings margin to 24.6%.","Looking forward, we continue to expect full year revenue in the range of $775 million and $825 million in segment earnings of between $198 million and $208 million, driven principally by continued growth in demand for MCC based health excipients and nutritional ingredients in North America and Asia and lower operating costs from ongoing manufacturing excellence program and process technology improvement. We expect Health and Nutrition second quarter segment earnings of between $49 million and $53 million with a sequential improvement in segment earnings margin in the quarter.","Turning to Lithium on slide six, Lithium delivered an outstanding quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, revenue increased 8% to $60 million and segment earnings almost tripled to $14.9 million. Segment operating margin climbed from under 10% last year in Q1 to almost 25% this quarter.","These results reflect the impact of our strategy to focus on the downstream specialty markets. As a result of our advantage process technology and ability to manage sales mix, FMC is uniquely positioned to serve the higher growth and higher value specialty segments while maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate and chloride.","Demand trends across specialty end markets remains strong. Demand for lithium hydroxide for energy storage and the electric vehicle or EV applications continues to grow at double-digit rates.","Our success in increasing throughput from our existing hydroxide assets allow FMC to deliver higher sales volume in the quarter. In addition, we managed our production mix in order to optimize our sales of butyllithium and high purity lithium metals.","Favorable market conditions supported price increases across the FMC portfolio. We continue to realize price increases for lithium hydroxide while approach to the carbonate and chloride markets is allowing us to achieve meaningful price increases on these limited sales volume.","The extent to which carbonate and chloride prices remain elevated will depend on how quickly new supply comes online. We expect market supply of all product to remain tight in the near to midterm.","Lower operating costs coupled with higher specialty sales volume and price increases resulted in significant increases in segment earnings and margins in the quarter. Manufacturing efficiencies from ongoing process improvement initiatives and lower cost associated with the natural gas pipeline installed in 2015 reduced operating cost by more than $5 million year-over-year helping to drive the increased operating margin in the quarter.","We expect the second quarter to be another strong period for the Lithium business. We continue to shift our sales mix to grow our specially product line serving markets such as EVs and polymers while capitalizing on favorable market conditions in lithium carbonate. However, we expect to have slightly lower available carbonate volumes in Q2 compared to Q1 as a result of lower seasonal production in Argentina.","Consequently, we expect quarter segment earnings to be in the range of $10 million to $14 million and segment earnings margin in the range of 19% to 20%. Based on Lithium performance to date and our expectations for the remainder of 2016, we are raising our full-year outlook for the Lithium business. We now expect full year revenue to be between $245 million and $265 million and segment earnings to be in the range of $43 million to $53 million, up $10 million from the prior range.","Moving next to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2016 on slide seven. I previously commented on the outlook for each business for both Q2 and the full year. As I mentioned, we are maintaining segment earnings guidance for the full year for both Ag Solutions and Health and Nutrition.","Segment earnings guidance for the second quarter reflect normal earnings level for these businesses based on their expectations for 2016. We are increasing the full year segment earnings guidance for Lithium as stated earlier.","On a consolidated basis, we're increasing full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 versus previous guidance to a range of $2.55 to $2.85 and we expect second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings to be between $0.62 and $0.72 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss select financial results including taxes, foreign exchange and cash flow.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you very much Pierre. As usual, I'll start with the income statement and specifically the tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate fell from 27.5% in the first quarter 2015 to 26% in Q1 2016. Part of this was the continued change in the mix of our earnings away from the U.S. and Brazil and towards Europe and Asia where rates are typically lower. We continue to take steps to increase our tax efficiency and expect that the full year rate will come in somewhere in the 24% to 26% range.","The theme in our earnings in recent quarters has been the impact of foreign currency movements and the movement in the Brazilian real has been a particular area focus. In the first quarter, the average rates of real to the dollar was 3.9, significantly weaker than the 2.87 average of the same quarter a year ago.","However, the total impact on our earnings was far less than we have seen in prior quarters for two main reasons. First, as you know, Q1 is not a large selling quarter for us in Brazil, reducing the impact of currency moves.","Also since we have not seen particularly volatile movements in the currency, our price list has been able to reflect the new currency levels for the entire quarter. As a result, the $13 million headwind created by the weaker real year-on-year was completely offset by price increases. In fact the positive impact of the weaker real on our cost base meant that the change in the real was actually a net positive to our income statement in Q1.","Looking to the rest of the world, although a number of Asian currencies collectively reduced earnings, the only major currency in which we faced a headwind in the quarter was the euro, which devalued by 2% versus the same period last year. The net hit to operating earnings from currency movements in the quarter was approximately $14 million.","A second common theme on our earnings has also been the challenges of operating in Argentina, including areas such as import license restrictions, negative impacts of export duties and the headwind created by the disconnect between cost inflation and the pace of devaluation of the peso against the dollar.","Since the election of Macri as President, we've seen a rapid shift in all these areas to the benefit of our operations in Ag Solutions and especially Lithium. The devaluation of the peso had a relatively limited impact on our earnings in the quarter in Lithium, since the lower cost of operations takes one to two quarters to work its way out of inventory and into the income statement. And our earnings guidance for 2016 reflects this lower cost of operations. We remain cautiously optimistic that the business environment in Argentina will remain positive and will continue to create opportunities for FMC.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide eight. Q1 is historically the period in which we consume the most cash given the seasonal nature of our Ag business. However, discipline around spending, the increased focus last year on sales terms, and of course the ongoing collection measures globally, resulted in an improvement of operating cash flow of over $100 million compared to the same quarter last year.","Cash flow was helped by higher EBITDA and a better performance around working capital, most notably from collection of receivables. This improvement was seen in all regions. With certain cash outflows, particularly capital spending and pension expenses also lower than last year, we were able to hold net debt flat during the quarter.","As noted in our filing of March 28, we elected to amend the debt covenants for our term loan and revolver, deferring the timing of step downs of our leverage ratios, such that we retained the covenant limit of 4.5 times for Q1. Our actual leverage ratio under the covenant calculation was 4.0 times giving the half a turn of headroom that we consider to be prudent.","Looking to the rest of the year, adjusted cash from operations is forecast in the range of $450 million to $550 million, an improvement over last year of over a third at the midpoint of the range. This is driven by improvements in both EBITDA and working capital performance. Capital expenditure will remain broadly flat to 2015 in the $120 million to $140 million range.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul. To conclude, we continue to expect a challenging market in Ag Solutions, but we're managing the business to increase visibility and to protect both price and term. As a result, we continue to expect full-year earnings to be in line with prior guidance.","Health and Nutrition is performing largely in line with expectation and Lithium is well ahead of our initial forecasts. The portfolio transformation is done. We are now in execution mode targeting year-over-year earning growth for each of our three businesses.","Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",". And the first question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. You mentioned in your presentation that Central and Eastern Europe were showing solid demands, but can you comment on the pricing landscape given the FX headwinds there as well and whether or not you were able to offset that? And then also on the demand front, do you believe the growth was simply driven by the market, or do you believe there's any benefit from adding the FMC portfolio to the legacy Cheminova one in the region? Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think on the Central, Eastern Europe, the pricing is pretty stable and you know, it's not a very, very large market, interesting for us because there is a strong possibility to increase volume. But pricing is quite stable. And I think definitely, the growth is one of the place where FMC had no structure in Central and Eastern Europe where it was an area of focus for Cheminova. So definitely a place where using the infrastructure and commercial organization from Cheminova and bringing in the product portfolio for FMC is going to create some significant possibilities (41:21) for us.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. And just kind of a tangent question to that one, given the progression of cost savings with Cheminova, it's clearly going well, can you just comment on the other geographies as far as intermediate to long-term revenue synergy opportunities inclusive of the US and then also in Latin America with Argentina in particular? Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah, Chris, this is Mark. We've talked about North America in the past and in the US, we are seeing very good synergies with the fungicide portfolio from Cheminova going through our distribution network. In Latin America, obviously Brazil in the south, we're seeing increased sales through co-ops where we've made decisions which co-ops and which distribution network we'll go through.","Argentina is certainly very beneficial for us. Obviously we have a bigger footprint there now. We have the right products for the soy market, so we're expecting to see growth in Argentina. And then in other parts of Latin America, I would say, obviously Mexico, Columbia, are two countries that we are focused on and we are seeing very good synergies in Colombia on these crops.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think when we did the last earnings call, as well as multiple discussions we all had, we've been talking about the share getting to $100 million -- $50 million to $100 million run rate in between the synergies and the new products and very much on very much on track with that. So it is a place, I think the opportunities created by Cheminova from a cost saving and the revenue synergies are very much in line with what we're expecting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, gentlemen and nice start to the year. Pierre when you were talking about the Ag business, you were talking about some positives with respect to, glad to say, resistance in terms of providing a boost, so I was wondering if there was a way for you to kind of quantify it and in terms of where you see that -- where you see that over the next 18 months or so. And then, what sort of concerns may you have about some new technologies that Monsanto and others are rolling out in that area?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah, Frank, it's Mark. I think for us when we look at Glyphosate resistance, we are really talking about the US, Argentina as the two big markets. I think you know that through our Authority brands based upon sulfentrazone, we've had great success in the pre-emergent area in both those countries. I expect that to continue. There will be some headwinds with new technologies coming in. But I think to offset that, we still see more weeds getting resistance to glyphosate and more acres increasing especially in Argentina. It wouldn't surprise me if we don't start to see that in the next few years start to develop in Brazil as well and we are already positioning our brands in Brazilian soy for that area.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And as you think about some of the combinations coming -- some of the major combinations in the Ag chem world coming over the next 12 months or less, how do you see yourselves perhaps participating in picking up some pieces there, what's the interest level -- talk about your participation in industry consolidation here?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Frank, as you know, we made a move which was in line with what was our strategic intent by acquiring Cheminova. We have now a stable situation from a structural standpoint in Ag. We're finishing up on the integration. What we intend to do at this stage is watch what is happening specifically in places when two Ag companies are coming together.","So every time there will be consolidation of that companies, if at any point during this process there is, because of anti-trust reason, product which are made available, that is something we are usually very good at doing which is taking a product and commercializing that with our own sales organization.","So, we're going to be opportunistic, but it's certainly something we will be able to afford to do and would be very interested in doing. Beyond that, do not expect us making any major move in acquiring any type of company, it will be an acquisition of technology and product.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning. Maybe a couple of questions on Lithium. Price mix was a 4% benefit in the quarter. But by some kind of spot measures lithium prices were much higher. So can you just kind of elaborate as to how we should be thinking about pricing, kind of commodity versus your specialty end markets and spot sales versus the contract market as we continue throughout the year?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, if you think about our Lithium business, look at strategic price increase in place where we are technologically advantaged in grain markets where we have significant contracts which are renewed every year like in lithium hydroxide. And then think about on the chloride and carbonate side for what is not used for internal purpose or sold in the contract, we are using the spot market to do one off price increase. We believe that situation is going to carry-on for the next few quarters.","I think the market will remain tight which will allow us to, to use the spot market in the more commodity businesses like chloride and carbonate to increase price on a spot basis. And where we have opportunities where people need our technology or product, we will be increasing price on contracts when contracts are being renewed. So it is a situation which we see fairly, fairly stable for the future. If you look at our increase in gallons for the Lithium business, most of it is going to, of the over performance, will be due to pricing.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just sticking with Lithium, you commented that you think the outlook is going to be tight in the near to medium term, can you just flush out a little bit about what your expectations are for supply additions over the coming years? Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I cannot comment too much beyond what all of you know on the lithium carbonate side because that's a decision of the people who have announced capacity increase. I'm sure (48:57), when they talk on their earnings we'll be able to tell more about the timing. But we believe (49:04). And we believe also some Chinese or Australian company will be bringing carbonate capacity in the next couple of years. We ourselves are focused more on the downstream and we will bring in time and we'll bring more detail in the weeks to come. But we'll be focusing more on increasing lithium hydroxide capacity as we need.","Operator","And next we will go with Mike Harrison of Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Pierre, if we could just continue on the Lithium front. I guess I was just surprised to see that you put up a $15 million quarter in Lithium and your guidance is only calling for $43 million to $53 million for the full year. What's going to change during the remainder of the year that would suggest that earnings could be lower than the Q1 level as we get through the rest of the year?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I will ask for Tom to comment with me. But, as we said in the script, remember there is seasons in term of manufacturing in lithium and we are getting into a period where -- which is the winter part of the season and we're going to have more rain and more snow and conditions which are going to limit more to some extent, our production of carbonates. So, what we're expecting in the next three quarters is less carbonate available because of our manufacturing, like most people operating in this part of the world, in the next couple of quarters.","On the positive side, our costs continue to be good and our pricing will be positive. So it's a differential between all of this which creates maybe a little bit less of an over performance in the remaining three quarters than we have in the first-quarter. I don't know if you want to anything, Tom, to this?","Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director-Lithium Division","Yeah, I think if you look historically at the earnings, the seasonality has been there. We are doing what we can to reduce volatility, but that seasonality is going to remain where the first quarter and fourth quarter give us the most volume and flexibility on the mix we can sell.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And then, as I think about some of the lithium carbonate that you're actually purchasing to convert to hydroxide, are you experiencing higher raw material costs for that, or do you have lower prices locked in for the year, and you're actually getting a margin benefit for some of that raw material you're purchasing?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we first, as you know, most of the carbonate, by a long shot, we use is produced by us. So what we are buying under contract today versus the rest of the overall usage is incremental and what we are buying is locked under a long-term supply agreement. So we are not facing significant price increase in carbonate.","If it plays the way we expect it to play, and once again it's going to have to be confirmed, but the way we look at it is, for now, we are producing enough carbonate and buying enough to run our strategy around chloride, butyllithium, metal and hydroxide.","And as time will go, we're going to have to sell more hydroxide. We're going to have to increase our capacity in hydroxide and we'll have to buy more of carbonate on the actual market, which should be at a time when our peer company will be increasing capacity and making the product more available in the market. So, it looks like all of this is falling in place quite well. Tom, you want to add something?","Thomas Schneberger - VP & Global Business Director-Lithium Division","Yeah, thanks for the question. Pierre has it down well. The other thing that we look at always is the incremental things we can do in Argentina, and there are small opportunities for small capital to increase our throughput in Argentina, which gives us some flexibility as we go forward?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So right now, I would say there is no major issue around potential increase in the future of our cost in term of our ability to execute a strategy around carbonate and hydroxide.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys nice start to the year.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Pierre, when used think about \u2013 you didn't change your outlook for crop protection markets this year. I understand it's still difficult out there, but it does sound like you're feeling better about the integration and maybe the long-term potential. Can you maybe map out where Ag Solutions op income can go over time as hopefully things recover?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah let me \u2013 I'll tell you the way we look at Ag Solutions right now. First let me talk about the Ag market as we see it for this year. I think we are not changing our view for 2016. We still believe it's a mid to high single digit down market mostly driven by North America and Brazil within the high teens. And maybe Asia and Europe to the low \u2013 sorry \u2013 in the high single-digit while Europe and Asia would be in the low to mid-single-digit decrease.","So, we are not changing our view. It could be maybe turning more toward the high single-digit overall global market. The way \u2013 and why do I feel better about the way we are operating in the Ag market, it is not because we are seeing a fundamental change in the market in the short-term. But what I think we are doing at FMC, I think the key difference is that we know better how to operate in this type of market. I can tell you, you see it on our numbers, we are not fighting to keep market share on sales of product. We are much more looking at three type of objectives.","First, it's very important for us and focusing only on FMC product is to decrease FMC product in the channels. The second aspect is we want to be able by doing that to focus more on the quality of the sales, which is more term, price and collection. And then, looking at all of that, the objective is to align more sales with a normal demand pattern.","You see that on the numbers in Q1 in North America. Sales, down 35% I think, on slide four, while product on the ground were up above market, 7%. So the way we are operating in the market today, I believe, we have more control over our selling process than we might have had in the past when we got hit by the downturn.","Beyond that, I would say, I would not exclude the market to turn around in 2017, but I have no indicators telling me that it will be the case. So I think we are much more focused, Mike, on operating under the current conditions with very high control on term, price, managing very closely in partnership with our customers our inventory, to create much more predictability in ourselves.","So that's where the level of confidence for me is increasing at this stage. Market turnaround \u2013 I think we'll have to wait a little bit more and certainly to go into Q3, Q4 to have more visibility.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, Paul, just a quick one. I thought you said at the current levels where the real is at, that it, is it going to be a negative this year or is it a positive? I just wanted to make sure I understood your commentary around foreign currency there.","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's the million-dollar question with the reai. I mean, the truth is that the stability or the predictability in the movement of the new reai is really what matters to us. We've talked about it in the past with regard to the timing of changes and the pace of changes. Q1 and Q2 just aren't really periods in which we have a lot of commercial activity going on in Brazil. So it's really what it does in Q3.","And, again, it isn't so much the level. We've shown that in Q1 where with an average rate of 3.9 \u2013 today, it's closer to 3.5 \u2013 we were able to still capture pricing on the limited number of sales that we have in Q1. The question will come into Q3, how stable, how predictable is the reai.","In the rest of the world, I mean, you look at the forward curve on the currency, it does not feel like a strengthening dollar is what the market is expecting. And so that generally speaking is what's factored into our numbers \u2013 relative predictably, not a big strengthening of the dollar around the world.","Q1 feels like \u2013 when you look at where the dollar is today compared to a year ago, Q1 feels like the last of the quarters that we have those tough FX comps. So subject to any changes away from where the market expects today, it doesn't feel like currency will be quite the high level story that it was last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. You have really guided up your operating cash flow projections for the year by $50 million but raised your EBIT projections by about $10 million. Can you give us a sense of where the big delta is coming in the operating cash flow? Is it really an improvement in working capital?","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. It's a pretty straightforward story. We clearly have an increased expectation around EBITDA, but the truth is it's largely around working capital. And you have to bear in mind that if you look over the last few years -- two years ago we had a terrible performance with working capital with largely cash outflow. Last year we turned the corner and sort of stopped the bleeding and improved it slightly but this year we expect that trend to continue so that working capital becomes a positive generator of cash for us.","Our biggest focus is always going to be the Brazil receivables balance and getting that receivables balance down. But we're also very, very focused on inventory levels, our own inventory levels and making sure that we are very efficient and very thoughtful about what inventory we hold, where we hold it and how much of it we hold. So it's coming in multiple different areas, but you really should be looking at working capital as the primary driver of the increase in cash flow for 2016.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay, I'm sorry if this was asked already, but \u2013 in terms of synergies from Cheminova, $60 million to $70 million for the year, do you still maintain that and maybe give us how much more you think you can still get in 2017 versus your prior guidance?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I have a terrible time with...","Paul W. Graves - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...synergies in 2016, $60 million to $70 million still our guidance and how much more were we anticipating.","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes we are not changing the -- actually we still have the same numbers, so the numbers we've been talking about $60 million, $70 million are very well in line and a full run rate of $140 million to $160 million getting into the middle of next year are also still the target. So there is no change in our numbers right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with BoA. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Thank you. In the U.S. crop protection market are you seeing any increased discounting or bundling by your competitors? And do you see any risk of perhaps maybe losing some shelf space in the retail channel from allowing your product inventories to be trimmed?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, I think whenever you talk about terms and pricing, we want to be highly cautious and slowly comment about we do. Our strategy today is quite, is quite simple. We are highly focused on maintaining our pricing at a healthy level. We are very vigilant on terms, as you know balance sheet is always a key challenge for a company like us. And more than ever we are highly disciplined on terms and not giving terms.","What it means for us and only talking for FMC, what it means for us is certainly we are prepared to see timing change in our sales and that's what I've been talking about. We're not being willing to do anything to push product in the market if there is not a complete need from this product -- for this product by the market. You know, space shelf is a word we use a lot, but when you have technical product to be sold, those products you know they are needed. And then you have commercial contract with customers.","So it is not a situation where because we are aligning ourselves with the market demand, that we are taking an enormous risk to see somebody taking our shelf space by the end of the year and us not being able to sell our product. For example, Mark talked about our Authority product line. It's a pre-emergent product. It's required \u2013 needs to be bought in Q4 and Q1. We know this product will be sold. So I think our strategy might be a bit differentiated but we are only focusing on ours along the line of what we discussed before.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And Pierre, considering your comment about Authority, would you say that the outlook for eventual penetration of the Xtend and the Enlist soybean products, does that \u2013 is that a risk to your Authority franchise within the Americas or could you see that as potentially an opportunity where you might expand your herbicide franchise and move more over-the-top. And bring in formulations with either 2,4-D and Dicamba?","Mark A. Douglas - President-FMC Agricultural Solutions","Yeah, Steve, this is Mark. You know we talked about it earlier, I got a question earlier about whether we thought it would be a headwind or a tailwind. I think in the initial stages, I expect rates to be reduced.","Good news is we know with Enlist and Xtend that there will still be recommend in the use of pre-emergent herbicides of which Authority is one of the market leaders. So we know we are going to have a substantial market there.","I would say weed-resistant acres continue to grow, so we're going to see that pre-emergent continuing, certainly in the U.S. and as I said earlier, in Argentina. I think from an over-the-top perspective, I mean we have some very good products that we're going to be promoting such as our Cadet herbicide which we think will be a great tank mix partner for those products and really offer a broader spectrum of control. Don't expect to see as us in 2,4-D and Dicamba, that's just not the sort the business we're going to be in. We're going to be in the more differentiated products, more highly specialized where we can bring value to the growers and distribution.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Pierre the trend among food companies to reformulate to simplify is clearly getting faster, how much is that reformulation trend actually helping you do you think? And do you think about it as a tailwind?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, I think the food market for us, there is an acceleration of \u2013 the way we look at our market in Nutrition and in Health, are interesting. In Health, the good news is when you are with a customer, you are there for a while because you're not being reformulated out easily.","The problem with that is it's not easy to gain new business. Well, the same applied to food but the reverse. I think there is a trend to reformulate, change formulation. There is a very fast cycle which gives opportunities for us.","So the stronger we are with our product, the more opportunities. But by the same token also it opens the door for new product and competitors. So I would say today, it could be slightly a tailwind knowing that we are maybe the largest market shareholder and maybe the complete product line. But I don't see that as a major change from the past. Eric, you want to add some comment to that?","Eric W. Norris - President-Health & Nutrition","I would say we see it as a tread, this is, Eric, Mark, Eric Norris. I see it as a trend, we see it as a trend like many others that have come and go in the industry. The industry is very fad based. So to Pierre's point, unlike the health markets where there's very little change over periods of time, there is a great deal of change from every two or three years, whether it's low-fat, Atkins and now this simplification, clean label phenomenon. It really does come down to the breath of product line we have, the fact that they are well-suited to being all naturally-based.","And then having the applications capability to respond to them in the right places around the world, having the spread of knowledge in the right places near customers. So, we're well-positioned for it. Anytime there's a reformulation, there's a challenge, right? So, it does create an effort on our part to respond. Going forward we see it as a tailwind though for us, given the breadth of our product line and application capabilities.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Eric, in Pierre's comments you talked about product differentiation, can you talk about how you think about product differentiation.","Eric W. Norris - President-Health & Nutrition","In specifically in the food market?","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Sure yeah.","Eric W. Norris - President-Health & Nutrition","Yeah. It comes down to understanding very well not only what's going on with your direct cost customer, the large food or small food company, but with consumers and then being able to put together a formulation that meets the need. So, product differentiation for us is less about proprietary technology, intellectual property, such as a patent that might drive more what happens in our Ag business. It's more about the know-how of being able to put some, of ingredients together that meets a specific need and understanding either color, texture, and or taste issues that might impact the success of that brand. So, it really comes down to the differentiation around the application and the ingredients we bring as opposed to a proprietary ingredient in the food product itself.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi guys thanks for fitting me in here at the end. Pierre, you were talking about kind of the overall crop market and the focus that FMC is going to have in terms of working inventory down and being disciplined on price and terms. So, I just want to get a clarification, so if others, or other competitors are not acting rationally and pushing product into the market when the product doesn't need it as you were saying, FMC is not going to be participating in that kind of activity?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, I don't know what strategy our competitors are operating around. Their own market push of product discount. In our rationale, they tend to be, I think what we have made as a decision, and that's a decision we've made globally.","We believe we're in a situation where the markets are such and the level of inventory in the channel are such, that you can't guide your activity by what the others are doing. I think we have a plan in place. We are working very, very closely in cooperation with our customers who understand our strategy.","We're not going to sell in Q1, or Q2 or Q3 a product which is needed in Q4. And it makes sense, we maintain a healthy pricing and term situation. And that's what we're going to be focusing -- I believe what we're going to do during this downturn, and until these turns around is, we are not going to work hoping that the overall level of inventory in the market channel is going to go down. I think it's too tall of an order and too impractical. So, we're going to be focusing solely on FMC products.","I think the numbers are quite spectacular. I said that many times; 34% sales done in the first quarter in North America plus 7% product on the ground. That is millions of dollars of inventory, which are outside of our customers' inventory. We still will need to replenish when the market needed. And that's the way we our operating. Our competitors will have to use the strategy which is appropriate for them.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. And then just focusing again on inventory obviously in the quarter, your inventories were significantly elevated due to the strategy that you're speaking of. Could you just talk about the timing, you know that you expect to be able to, you know, work through that inventory along with what the channel is going to be doing? And then ultimately, I think you said you expect improvements in the second half in North America. Can you just talk a little bit about that?","Pierre R. Brondeau - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the way we look at it, and you know, there was a question before, I think it's Mike who asked that question around the level of confidence in the market. I think our strategy today, allow us to have more visibility in term of the timing and level of our sales because we become less dependent upon what the market is doing and rushing to place sales to be safe and have those on the shelf.","So what it does to us it creates more predictability and maybe increase the level of confidence of how the quarters ahead of us are going to be unfolding. We know which product will be required usually, which technology will be required depending upon the season in Q4, in Q1 and Q2.","And that's a discussion we have with our customers, that's the way we our operating, right now. So it's just giving us a bit more certainty on how things will unfold.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities.

A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Pierre.","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. Before outlining our fourth quarter results, I wanted to first state that 2017 was a pivotal year for FMC and we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us 2018. The integration of the acquired DuPont Ag business is progressing very well as is the process of separating the Lithium business into a public company.","As we prepare for listing in the second half of this year, we will continue to expand both our lithium hydroxide and our lithium carbonate capacity to capitalize on the significant demand expected in the coming decade.","Turning to slide three, FMC reported fourth quarter revenue of $918 million, which was 42% year-over-year -- up 42% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $1.10 in the quarter, an increase of 67% versus the same period a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.02 above the top end of our guidance, driven by strong operating result in each of our two segments.","We are very pleased with the fourth quarter results. In Ag Solutions, our business performed very well and earnings came in above the high end of our guidance range. The integration of the acquisition into FMC is meeting all our expectations.","In Lithium, we delivered our first full quarter of commercial production at our new lithium hydroxide facilities in China and finalized an important agreement with the Argentinian government, paving the way for expansion in that country and for the separation of the Lithium business into a standalone company.","Moving on to slide four in Ag Solutions, revenue grew 40% year-over-year. Performance of FMC's legacy Agricultural Solution business was very strong, growing 9% year-over-year, driven by double-digit revenue growth in North America, Asia, and Europe. Acquisition revenue of $193 million accounted for the remainder of the growth. We do not have comparable results for the acquired business for the last two months of 2016. However, it performed well and as expected.","Fourth quarter segment earnings of $189 million increased 48% year-over-year. Segment revenue for 2017 was approximately $2.5 billion, an 11% increase compared to the prior year.","Full year segment earnings were $486 million, a 21% increase year-over-year and segment earnings margin improved 160 basis points to 19.2%. Our legacy Ag business posted 3% revenue growth and strong earnings growth in the year.","On slide five, we outline the regional performance in the quarter. In North America, we posted a 38% revenue increase. Our legacy FMC business grew 14%. The performance was driven by early demand for pre-emergence herbicides as farmers plan for expanded soybean acreage this year and strong demand for our SU herbicides for cereals.","In Latin America, revenue increased 21% in the quarter. Our legacy FMC business grew 3% in Q4 and 9% for the entire year. In Brazil, FMC's legacy business grew 15% on a full year basis, a very strong performance in a market that contracted approximately 10%.","In Asia, revenue increased 84% in Q4. Our legacy FMC business grew 14%, driven by successful product launches and strong growth in our Plant Health product portfolio. We also saw strong sales of Rynaxypyr insect control, especially into rice markets in India and Indonesia.","And finally, in Europe, revenue increased 59% in Q4. Our legacy FMC business grew 13% with strong sales in Eastern Europe and in France, where you may recall we have moved to direct market access.","Moving now to Lithium on slide six, Lithium delivered another exceptional quarter. Revenue of $113 million increased 60% year-over-year and segment earnings more than doubled to $44 million. Significantly higher prices and the shift in mix to higher value product drove the increase in segment earnings margin to 39% versus 30% in the prior year period.","We took an important step in December when we finalized new operating agreements in Argentina. The provincial government of Catamarca formalized these agreements by passing legislation that sets our royalty rate and our commitment to corporate social responsibility programs while also paving the way for us to expand capacity and move toward the intended separation of our Lithium business later this year.","We want to highlight the revised royalties and CSR programs are at the level generally consistent with our prior commitment. Combined, this amounts to a mid-single-digit percentage of sale out of our Argentina operations.","Turning to slide seven, which summarizes our outlook for the first quarter and the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share for full year 2018 to be between $5.20 and $5.60 per share, which represents at the midpoint of the range a near doubling of EPS year-over-year. First quarter 2018 adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.45 and $1.59.","We expect 2018 Ag Solutions revenue will be in the range of $3.95 billion and $4.15 billion and segment EBITDA will be in the range of $1.05 billion and $1.15 billion. We anticipate legacy Ag Solutions revenue will grow 2% to 4%, while the acquired business is expected to grow by 6% to 10%. First quarter segment revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.07 billion and EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million.","The Lithium business is well-positioned to deliver another year of significant earnings growth in 2018. We expect full year revenue for Lithium to be in the range of $420 million to $460 million, a year-over-year increase of 27% at the midpoint.","Full year EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million, which represents an increase of 34% at the midpoint. We expect price mix and incremental volumes to each contribute approximately half of the increase in earnings.","The volume increase is largely due to the 4,000 tons of incremental capacity coming online from debottlenecking projects. We expect first quarter segment revenue to be in the range of $95 million to $110 million and EBITDA is forecasted to be between $44 million and $48 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of 78% at the midpoint.","Moving on to slide eight and the key drivers for the Ag Solutions business in 2018. Starting with the overall Ag Chem market where our expectations for 2018 remain unchanged from what we saw in November. We continue to expect the global crop protection chemical market on a U.S. dollar basis to be flat to up low single-digits in 2018.","We expect the market in Asia-Pacific will grow the fastest, increasing by low to mid-single-digit percent range, driven by India and Southeast Asia. We expect the market in Latin America will increase in the low single-digits. Brazil will be a bit ahead of that base, benefiting from increased acreage for nearly all crops.","The market in Argentina should see continued expansion in certain applications. And in Mexico, we expect growth in these crops. In North America, we expect the market will be flat to up low single-digits as farm incomes remain below trend.","Growth will come from post-emergence herbicides and a modest increase in serving acreage in general. We expect the market in EMEA will be flat to up low single-digits. Improved weather and growth in Eastern Europe could provide upside to this forecast.","Turning now to a forecast for how FMC will perform in 2018 considering the market conditions just outlined. We expect revenue for legacy Ag Solutions business will grow 2% to 4%, driven by several factors. In Brazil, we expect to see a continuation of positive trends in cotton and sugarcane markets where we are well-positioned as well as increased demand in the soybean market.","In Asia, we anticipate higher demand for our products going to rice, fruit, and vegetable, as well as cotton. In Europe, the move to direct market access in France, new products for oilseed rate and price increases will all drive growth in -- for FMC in 2018.","Moving on to our acquired business, which we expect will grow 6% to 10% in 2018 on a full year basis, well ahead of the market. This will be driven primarily by increased insecticide revenue. We believe Cyazypyr insect control is far from its peak in annual sales.","In 2018, volumes are expected to grow for cotton and soybean applications in Brazil. New product registrations in EMEA will also drive growth. Rynaxypyr insect control will continue to expand into new crops and geographies, such as rice and sugarcane in India and further penetrate into Southeast Asia.","Finally, we also expect to increase sales of our acquired SU herbicide with new formulations in North America for cereal applications. As I said earlier, the integration process is progressing very well after almost four months of ownership.","Our 2018 guidance reflects what we believe will be the maximum operating cost as a percentage of revenue for our combined Ag Solutions businesses. Our assumptions for gross margin, R&D expenses and SG&A expenses are not meaningfully different than what we have shared with you on calls last year. But as the DuPont transition service agreement roll off and as we implement a new SAP system in 2019, we will see further cost savings and improvements in EBITDA margins.","Turning to slide nine and starting with our views on the Lithium market. In summary, we expect global demand for lithium on an LCE basis to grow from about 200,000 metric ton in 2017 to 335,000 metric tons by 2020 and to 1 million metric tons by 2025. This is an average annual growth rate of over 20%.","On the supply side, despite recent news out of Chile, we believe that supply for high-cost spodumene producers will continue to be needed to meet the end market demand in every year through at least 2025. We expect this will create a price floor for lithium carbonate of low double-digit dollars per kilogram for at least the next seven years.","FMC is very well-positioned to take advantage of these market conditions. Our business is focused on lithium hydroxide and we have demonstrated that our approach to expanding our lithium hydroxide capacity is more than capable of meeting the growth in demand with relatively low capital needs.","Our locals carbonate production resource in Argentina are capable of expansion to at least three times our current capacity and we have secured the necessary agreements with the local and national governments to allow us to pursue an expansion of this scale.","In 2018, prices will be higher than in 2017 across all our product categories. The majority of our 2018 forecast revenue falls under multiyear contracts that have defined pricing already in place.","We expect this trend of customers looking for longer term supply commitments to continue, especially in hydroxide, reflecting customers' general view that supply will remain tight into the foreseeable future.","In 2018, FMC will produce more lithium hydroxide as well as more base LCEs that in 2017. FMC was the only producer to have significant hydroxide capacity in 2017 when we expanded our production capacity from 10,000 tons to 19,000 tons.","We will realize significant growth in 2018 as we run our channel plan for the full year. Our next phase of hydroxide expansion should see us commissioning at least one additional 4,000-ton unit by the end of this year.","In Argentina, we expect to produce about 21,000 LCEs in 2018, up from 18,500 tons last year as we realize higher volumes due to the debottlenecking project at our plant. The completion of this project will lead to an incremental increase in 0LCEs produced as the year progresses.","The subsequent expansion project in Argentina will add around 10,000 tons of lithium carbonate capacity by the end of 2020 and a further 10,000 ton increase by 2022. These first two increments are expected to require total capital spending of around $250 million to $300 million as we have previously stated. We are currently exploring adding a third carbonate expansion phase, providing a further 20,000 tons of capacity by 2025 at the latest.","Moving on to market demand, we believe that today, too much of investor focus is on supply and not enough on demand. In particular, we believe the investment community as a whole has yet to absorb the impact that the growth in demand for electric vehicles in the coming years will have on the lithium industry.","Simply adding mining or extraction capacity will not be enough without the corresponding increase in manufacturing capacity for battery-grade lithium products that are in a form that the customers can use.","Equally, producing technical-grade carbonate that needs to be further processed to remove impurities will simply add to the cost of that product. And as we move to nickel-rich cathodes in the high performance batteries, hydroxide will become a requirement in the production process, not just a preferred option.","A view of the demand outlook is summarized on slide 10. Clearly, the source of growth for lithium demand is the rapid penetration of pure EVs into the global auto market. We model the growth of EVs at the individual vehicle level based on public announcements as well as own directing directions we look to manufacturers and their suppliers.","The chart on the left shows the growth of pure electric vehicles and a few things stand out. First, we expect pure EV penetration to reach 2.5% by 2020 and 12% by 2025. The source of this growth is multiple launches by over 30 manufacturers. This is not dependent on any one manufacturer. And it shows the influence of China as this country maintains its position as the largest single market for electric vehicles. Of course, this growth in EVs needs to be converted into demand forecast for lithium.","The right hand side of the chart shows how important the EVs will be to the market as a whole by 2025. And equally important, you can see that the nature of the growth in demand is such that there will be heavy shift towards lithium hydroxide.","We reached these conclusions through a vehicle-by-vehicle assessment of the battery technology and size, which we expect to be used in each announced vehicle, as well as through discussions with the customers and end users.","In fact, many of our customers and the ultimate end users of lithium are coming to FMC today looking for multi-years contract that commence in 2019 or 2020, demonstrating their confidence in the demand growth shown here. Ultimately, it is the detail in relation [ph] of future demand that gives us the confidence to pursue a strategy in lithium.","Now, let me move on to the supply side of the equation. There is another reality that we believe the market as a whole is not correctly as it seems. We have seen repeated example of new entrants making large claims about intended capacity additions that are ultimately proven to be far too ambitious.","Even a simple review will show that almost without sale, the capital cost increase significantly and the start-up dates are pushed further and further back. Once projects have been brought online, we have seen production rate that fall far short of nameplate capacity, product quality that is inconsistent and operating costs per unit of production that are far higher than what was originally projected.","What is possible today to construct the cost curve using announced project that suggests a risk of oversupply in the future, all available evidence suggest that this is highly unlikely to occur.","The supply curves are well known to you all, and the current status shown on the left side of slide 11 is reasonably well understood and accepted. It is clear that incremental terms of supply is coming from high cost spodumene, which is being shipped to convertors in China.","We have marked a range for the market price based on data published by others. The prices publicized by our competitors have been realized price, plus those quoted by different market observers such as benchmark minerals indicate a price range of between $11 and $14 for carbonate in most markets today.","On the right side of slide 11 is the cost curve we expect in 2020, taking into account all of the expansions that have been made public. I would point out a few key items on here. First, you can see that at today's price range for carbonate, the higher royalties payable in Chile means that there is no meaningful cost difference between carbonate produced in Argentina and in Chile.","Second, the marginal producer of carbonate remains the high cost spodumene source and will likely remain so even if demand fell by around 10% from our forecast. There is simply not enough brine capacity of being added by 2020 to change this.","When you overlay the price range from today out to 2020, you ended with a chart that looks remarkably similar to the situation we saw in 2017. We acknowledge that there are many differing opinions about supply and demand growth over the coming decade and that this [Indiscernible] could see positive and negative surprises.","However, we remain of the view that the risk to the demand side are that we are underestimating the level of EV demand and that the risk of the supply side is that we are being overoptimistic about industry's ability to add capacity on time and on budget.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Graves","Thank you, Pierre. 2017 saw a solid cash flow performance, driven by a significant improvement in cash collection in Brazil. One important metric that we track is, of course, past due receivables in Brazil, which have declined by almost 30% compared to the end of 2016. While we do not expect past dues to completely disappear, we believe that 2018 should see us move back to levels consistent with historical performance.","For the full year, we saw adjusted cash from operations slightly below 2016. However, this was entirely due to a cash outflow in the final two months from the acquired business as we started to build trade receivables.","As you recall, we did not acquire any of the receivables with the business, creating this one-off cash flow in the quarter. Net debt finished the year at just under $3 billion, reflecting the $1.2 billion payment to DuPont made in the fourth quarter.","One important area that is getting a lot of attention today is the tax rate. We finished 2017 exactly where we expected with an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. This rate reflects the fact that the majority of our income is generated in lower tax jurisdictions, reflecting the nature of our supply chain and our revenue mix.","Looking forward to 2018 and beyond; recently enacted tax reform in the U.S. impacts us in three main ways. First of all, we will have a transition tax payable over the next eight years of approximately $200 million, reflecting tax on overseas retained income. This will impact cash flows in the coming years but will not impact our effective tax rate.","Second, we see a one-off charge to GAAP earnings, reflecting the revaluation of certain assets, most notably deferred tax assets of around $160 million. Again, this will not impact our future effective tax rate.","And third, we will see a rise in our effective tax rate for 2018 as a result of the imposition of what is effectively a minimum tax on overseas income, combined with the restriction on the use of foreign tax credit to offset this additional tax. What this means to FMC is that wherever we see a tax rate outside the U.S. of less than around 13%, we will be hit with an additional U.S. tax bill under the guilty provisions of the tax reform.","For us, the offsetting reduction in the U.S. tax rate will not be sufficient to offset this minimum overseas tax surcharge since we do not generate significant U.S. income today. While this change is a little as the result of the acquisition of assets from DuPont, the net effect is that our effective tax rate for 2018 is likely to increase by about 300 basis points at the midpoint of the range to 18%.","I would caution you we continue to work our way through what a very complex calculations and legislation that in many areas is somewhat ambiguously worded. We will continue to refine our calculations and seek clarity as to the treatment of certain items and you should expect us to update you on our estimate as for the tax rate in each of the coming quarters.","Looking into 2018 for cash flow, we expect to generate adjusted cash from operations in the range of $550 million to $650 million. Capital spending will increase to around $250 million at the midpoint.","Lithium will invest around $105 million, led by the expansion of lithium carbonate capacity in Argentina and the continued addition of lithium hydroxide capacity. The benefits of these investments will start to accrue later in 2018 for the carbonate debottlenecking, in 2019 for the hydroxide expansions, and in 2020 for the carbonate expansion.","Ag Solutions capital spending is expected to be approximately $95 million and corporate-level CapEx will be approximately $50 million, which is mainly the initial spending on the two-year implementation of a new SAP system.","Finally, the Lithium separation remains on track. We expect to be in a position to file initial drafts of the required documents with the SEC in the summer of this year, which gives us confidence that we will list Lithium in the late third or early fourth quarter of 2018, with the full separation from FMC taking place late in the first quarter of 2019.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Pierre.","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you, Paul. In summary, we feel very good about where FMC is today. Our Ag Solutions business delivered a strong Q4, and we are set to deliver an exceptional 2018, with revenue growth significantly above the market growth rate. The integration of the acquired business is progressing very well.","We are in the early stages of understanding the growth synergies, and we will communicate further regarding scale of these synergies on future calls. Lithium had a very strong quarter to finish the year and is on track to deliver another exceptional year in 2018.","With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you for your attention.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrne","Yes, thank you. How proprietary and\/or differentiated would you assess your hydroxide conversion capacity to be relative to the capacity that's out there in the industry? And do you have any Chinese partners for your operations in China?","Thomas Schneberger","Hi Steve, this is Tom. I didn't quite hear the second part of your question, so let me answer the first one first and then maybe you can restate that. In terms of differentiation of our hydroxide product, really, what it comes down to is how that product performs. There's not a spec out there that is specified where somebody could produce a product, measure against that spec, and then know exactly how that's going to perform in the cathode material.","So, our assets as well as our production processes are geared around detailed processes to produce specific products that then we test and we understand the performance characteristics of that product. And that's how it's going to continue going forward. Can you restate the second part of that question?","Stephen Byrne","Yes, sure, Tom. It's kind of an extension on that and that is, do you have Chinese partners for your capacity in China and therefore, the risk to ultimately losing that technological edge?","Thomas Schneberger","Yes. Partners is a good way to say it. And what we did was we began a partnership with a long-standing partnership of our Ag business. We invest in the assets, we manage the technology, and we keep tight control over the sensitivity of that technology.","Pierre Brondeau","One comment I would add to what Tom is saying is the -- we have a very thorough process to protect our process technology. I believe there might not be more than two people within all of FMC and our partners who have a full understanding of this process.","So, we have a way to protect the process technology by segregating part of the process, and nobody has a complete visibility onto the process and how the parameters of the process impact the performance of the products.","Stephen Byrne","[technical difficulty] forecast, is that consistent with what your expectations were prior to acquiring this business? And do you see any longer term acceleration in that by either expanding those -- the Rynaxypyr, Cyazypyr into new markets and\/or recruiting new formulations?","Pierre Brondeau","I think for some reason, we have a little bit of a connection problem. We couldn't hear the beginning of the question. But in a few words, what we believe is that Rynaxypyr, Cyazypyr and overall the acquired market is performing at least at the level of our expectations from where we do have markets and applications today.","There is definitely a process and you can see it through our comments, for example, what we said about Asia, India, Southeast Asia where we do have increased penetration of new crops, new registration, new formulations for product, which are allowing to grow faster. Needless to say that in the coming years, FMC will also be looking at developing new products from those base chemistry.","The last point we have not touched here and we are gathering a lot of data is around growth synergies. We do believe there is significant growth synergies to be seen in the years to come between the FMC and the acquired portfolio, allowing additional growth to what we have talked about.","So, I would say, all in all, everything we are seeing and we're operating is it's very positive for us. And I don't believe we are capturing all of the potential today of -- in the numbers we are presenting.","Operator","Thank you. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and then reenter the queue; we\u2019ll take follow-up questions as permitted.","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","Yes, good morning and congrats on a nice end to the year. Pierre, you were talking about Brazil for full year 2017 of being able to generate 15% growth, whereas the market was down 10%. I was curious as to what percent of that preferential performance was due to some prior actions you took on your channel inventories versus market growth and how we should think about your ability to continue to outperform in that part of the world.","Pierre Brondeau","I think I would say when you look at a plus 15% in the market shrinking 10%, there is two reasons to the performance. One is the fact that we are one of the very few companies, compared to others, which are operating with almost, I would call, a normal level of inventory in the channel.","So, we are not in a growth penalized by products which were in the channel, lowering our ability to sell into the channel, allowing us to have growth rate which are closer to product on the ground utilization.","Now, the number is, of course, increased by the fact that as we've been taking measures over last two years and moving away from some low profitability-generated products, you are comparing to -- for us, to sales which were understated because of the actions we are taking.","So, those are the two reasons for which we are outperforming so much. Do we expect to outperform the market next year? Yes, we do. Do we expect to outperform the market by the same extent? Certainly not because we had -- we're going to have a tougher comparison when comparing to 2017 performance.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. Apologies for being a little shortsighted, but your 1Q EPS guidance is particularly strong, which appears to be driven mainly by the Ag segment. Can you just kindly comment on your expectation for your legacy Ag asset growth as well as the seasonal cadence for the DuPont assets and whether or not you'd expect any considerable FX tailwind? And also are there any key trends within product mix which should further benefit margins? Thank you.","Pierre Brondeau","All right. Thank you. Those are some questions. Let me talk about the cadence. I'll ask Mark to comment about legacy products growth. We announced our legacy business will grow in the 2% to 4%, which is above market we're expecting. So, Mark will comment about that, and maybe Paul will say a couple of words around FX.","The cadence, as you can see, we do have a first quarter which is stronger as a percentage of the overall business than we used to have. And it's something which is important, very good for us with the acquired business.","If you think about FMC legacy business, we would have slightly above 60%, 6-0, 60% of the business in the back end of the year, mostly driven by the size of our business in Brazil and Latin America. So, it's 60% in the back end, 40% in the front end.","If you look at the acquired business, it is reversed. It's slightly above 60% in the first half and 40% in the second half of the year. And this is driven by the size of the business for the acquired business in Europe and North America with a very strong underlying business in Asia and smaller business in Latin America and Brazil.","So, what it does to us, it rebalances across all of the quarters, and as we wanted, decrease our exposure to Brazil and Latin America. Mark, do you want to talk about the growth of the legacy business?","Mark Douglas","Yes. Of course, as Pierre mentioned, we're expecting a range of about 2% to 4% growth for the full year. That's going to be pretty evenly spread across the four quarters. We're already seeing Q1 well into the business in North America where the retail is getting ready for the season in the Midwest. I would say the market in California or in the West has kicked off a little earlier than normal, so that's going to help in Q1.","Around the rest of the world, in Europe, we're seeing growth, as we said, from our business, particularly in France. This is our first year of direct market access. So, we're out in the market now selling and that's going very well. So, I think that 2% to 4% range is roughly what you should expect per quarter as we go through the year.","Paul Graves","Yes, the FX question, I think pretty straightforward. The euro is the only exchange rate that really had a meaningful difference on a budget basis, think about how we hedge forward compared to what we saw in 2017. A few small changes in other currencies.","The net impact of this is actually relatively small across the entire business. We do have a small tailwind, very low single-digits percent increase in revenue and a very small tailwind to operating profit as well as a result of the forecast FX rates, but really not meaningful numbers.","Operator","Thank you. And the last -- next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov","Good morning. Thank you. In your Lithium business, you earned about $48 million EBITDA in the fourth quarter and you're guiding to $44 million to $48 million in Q1 2018 and sort of similar level for the rest of 2018, if I just average your annual guidance. Can you help us build the bridge between your fourth quarter result and average cadence in 2018? And I mean, the bridge if you look at sequential price changes and also volume.","Pierre Brondeau","I think the operation for Lithium in the first quarter are about the same. I mean, there is no fundamental change in the business in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. It is the sequential comparison between Q4 and Q1. If you look back at historical performance, it's the same.","The fourth quarter is historically a quarter which is a strong quarter. Sales are high and the products out of Argentina, because of the seasonality of our production, are very high. So, it is just a normal sequential. And you will most likely see when you look at -- on a quarterly basis for this year, you'll most likely see a stronger fourth quarter than you will see first quarter. You will see earnings ramping up and being at the highest level in the fourth quarter.","First quarter -- there is a good thing about the first quarter. If you look at the sales to earnings, it's a high profit quarter because the mix is favorable. So, there is nothing fundamentally different. It's mostly driven by Q4 performance by production -- seasonal production in Argentina and first quarter margin by product mix.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson","Hi, good morning. Maybe, Paul, on Lithium. It seems like there'll be short carbonate in 2019. Is that true? And then how will that work out? Will you maybe run hydroxide a little bit lower? Will you go into the market and purchase carbonate? What will margins look like? It seems like the Nemaska project being on finance will probably not be able to offer your carbonate for at least a couple of years, so maybe you could just elaborate on that.","Thomas Schneberger","Yes, hi Joel, this is Tom. Yes, I mean, it's a little bit early to be forecasting 2019, but I'll give you an indication of where things are. The debottlenecking will come in over the course of 2018 and there's potential upside there. This is a number of different projects that have different characteristics on yield and some incremental capability of equipment that we may see additional there.","We do expect Nemaska volume to begin in 2019 and we still need to see, to your point, how much of that volume will be there, but there are commitments and penalties to that end. And we continue, I would say, a multipronged effort on the acquisition of carbonate elsewhere.","So, as you know, in 2018, we'll continue to be long carbonate and we have the ability to shift LCEs toward hydroxide to continue to grow. We have potential for more debottlenecking and we have the potential of more LCEs from the outside as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at the timeline of the Lithium spinoff, I think you talked about as recently as the third quarter conference call of doing this midyear 2018, but now it looks like the initials move is going to be made in the second half of the year and then the full spinoff in the first quarter of 2019. Am I just misremembering or making too much of the changes in timing? Or is there something going on that you pushed back the timing?","Paul Graves","Hi Dmitry, it's Paul. No, we've always had really Q3 lined up. It's largely driven, frankly, by requirements for listing a public company, SEC filing, the need for audited financials, the need for quarterly financials.","It's -- we are really exactly where we always said we wanted to be, internally at least, when we first announced this almost -- some -- almost a year ago. So, no. If we've made statements that implied the summer for an actual listing, then that's probably incorrect because in the past, there's always been an expectation of a Q3 listing.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael Sison","Hey guys, nice quarter.","Pierre Brondeau","Thank you.","Michael Sison","You seem pretty positive or bullish on lithium demand through 2020 and 2025. If you think about what the Lithium business could earn in EBITDA by 2020 and 2025, any thoughts on the earnings power there? And how much capital cost to sort of get to that potential?","Paul Graves","If it was early for Tom to forecast 2019, then forecasting 2025 is asking a lot, Mike. I think a couple of comments I'd just make. I think the capital commitment we've laid out there for the expansion in here is pretty straightforward. We took about $250 million to $300 million for a 20,000 ton expansion.","As we expand further in Argentina, we would expect a similar kind of cost, maybe a little less for the next phase, although we're still working on that, so I wouldn't want to stick a pin in it yet.","On the hydroxide side, again, it really sort of depends on where we put the units. So, there is a meaningful difference between the capital cost in different parts of the world, but you also get a -- in return for that, typically an inverse correlation between operating costs.","So, we will go through that and work out where is the best place to put these units based on demand, based upon supply of carbonate, et cetera, but it's a much, much lower capital commitment that comes through there.","Now, this business today operates at an EBITDA margin of about 45% or so. And I think we've been pretty clear that we -- where we view pricing to be into the future and I think we have a pretty clear view to how many LCEs we'll be producing. I think you guys can probably knock out pretty easily a headline view of what you think the earnings power of the business might be under those scenarios.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Donald Carson","Yes. I want to go back to the cost synergy outlook for Ag Solutions. In the past, you've talked about $40 million to $80 million, and I know your cost synergies are different because it's a question of what costs you bring in. So, as you've had a chance to run the new business and as the DuPont TSA rolls off, what's your current view on cost synergies for Ag?","Pierre Brondeau","So, I mean, you said it, Don. There is no cost synergies per se. We always talk about that as a tool to try to model EPS for 2018 based on the negotiation we made when we acquired the business.","So, where we are today is we have structured an organization which can run a $4 billion-plus business with a TSA supporting the acquired business. We spend about $50 million per year on that TSA and that TSA runs until end of 2019.","Today, we have not been able -- we're not separating the functional organization and we just have an organization which supports the entire business. So, the way we look at it is what we have today is a structure which supports, as I said, a $4 billion-plus business with minimum -- what we believe as being minimum EBITDA margin for this year on an average of 27%.","Then new projects [Indiscernible] toward the end of 2019, what will be happening then is we will have implemented and we started the process a month ago now, we will have implemented a brand-new SAP system, S\/4HANA and we will be rolling out -- rolling off the TSA.","Now, we have not yet done a calculation of what potential savings. But to think about three digits in million dollars by the time we're rolling off the TSA and having a new SAP is not a stretch. So, what we are thinking is we're operating today with a 27% EBITDA margin. Could we -- could it get better? Yes, it could. We are adding very carefully resources to operate our business. And then you project yourself two years down the road and you can eliminate $100 million of costs.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Daniel Jester with Citi. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester","Good morning everyone. A couple more on Lithium. Sorry if I missed this, but did you comment on the hydroxide operating rate in the quarter? I think, previously, you had said that you were running above the nameplate capacity. So, I was wondering if you're able to sustain that.","And then just secondly, you commented earlier about having conversations for 2019, 2020 sales in the Lithium business. Would it be fair to say that you would lock in some contracts before you would build your further hydroxide expansion? Thanks.","Pierre Brondeau","Yes, we are demonstrating our ability. Initially, we believe the two units for lithium hydroxide in China should be able to produce 8,000 tons per year, and we are operating and have been able to operate throughout the quarter above the number. So, yes, expectation that will be at or north of 9,000 tons of lithium hydroxide potential with these two units is being confirmed.","We are planning to add another unit in China of lithium hydroxide and then another two -- couple of units, most likely in North America for at least one of them. And we will have the exact same process, which we move the securing contract before the French [Indiscernible]. But with what we see of the demand today, discussion we have with customers, as it was the case for the first unit, we believe the unit will be sold out before we start operation.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning.","Pierre Brondeau","Good morning.","Mike Harrison","The -- in the Ag business, your Latin America sales you mentioned for the full year were up 15%, but they were lighter than that in the legacy business, looked like only 3% this quarter. Is that just a matter of lapping some tougher comps? Or can you maybe give a little bit more color on kind of how the underlying market looked in Latin America and how it's been trending?","Mark Douglas","Yes, Mike. Taking Latin America overall, I think Pierre alluded to earlier that we think the Brazilian market is probably down 9% to 10% full year. When you look at our business in Brazil, we're up significantly. As you said, we were -- we had about a 3% growth in the fourth quarter. I think one of the things that you have to recognize is that's exactly how we planned it. If you remember, Q3 was a very large quarter for us. We knew that was the cadence that was going to happen, so we fully forecasted that type of growth rate.","I think going around the rest of the region, Mexico is very good for us. Good growth in niche crops. Obviously, the newly acquired portfolio helps us there tremendously as well. In Argentina, market was very tough weather-wise. We see continued expansion of the pre-emergent herbicides with our Authority brand. So, Argentina was good for us in the second half of the year, expect that to continue as well. So, overall, Latin America performed very well for us.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Rizzo","Hi, this is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. How are you?","Pierre Brondeau","Good morning.","Daniel Rizzo","Could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of pest pressures and channel inventories in North America just given the weather we've had in North America over the past couple of months? Has anything changed in terms of outlook for that?","Mark Douglas","Dan, no, not really. I mean, it obviously is very early to tell whether what the pest pressure is going to be like. I can tell you, though, from a herbicide perspective, our sales already for pre-emergent Authority for soy is very, very strong. So, clearly, retail and distribution are gearing up for a very strong soy season, which will benefit us.","With channel inventories, I think different companies have different channel inventories. We've said it in the past for us; we think in-soil insecticides is a high for us. They will come down over the next season. But from a herbicide perspective, we're exactly where we want to be.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to get a question in on Lithium here. Maybe you can just comment on your outlook for pricing given that effective capacity, on your slide, looks like it could be above demand through 2020. Thanks.","Thomas Schneberger","Yes, this is Tom. First, let me comment on the effective capacity being above demand. If you look at 2017, effective capacity results were above demand. It doesn't mean that the right products are getting to the customers. We saw 2017 demand limited by supply, and we saw prices up substantially in 2017. So, the same could occur even though effective capacity is above demand.","Looking at what we see 2017 to 2018, we've gotten price increases across all of our products. If you take the midpoint of the revenue and the LCEs, you can come pretty close to see that we got a revenue per LCE that is well above the market and that is driven by a mid-teens increase in our lithium hydroxide product line.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly","When we look at your Ag business and all the markets you're expanding into, how much work do you have left to do in terms of capital, people or partners to really build out the distribution you need to take full advantage of that? I'm talking India and all the other new stuff.","Pierre Brondeau","I think the integration is moving forward quite well. The supply chain between the two businesses are being integrated. And we do have capacity without manufacturers, which is well in place. If I would say we have work to do and Mark's organization is doing a lot of work, I believe once the synergies are going to be in place that we do have upside to any numbers we are now seeing.","So, what -- where we do have work to do today is finding capacity increase in our own acquired business manufacturing network. That's where we want to add capacity as fast as we can because we have, as you can see, extreme synergies, we have a 6% to 10% growth, and we see that being the case for the future. So, that's where we are working at forecasting for the future. Mark, do you have any additional comments?","Mark Douglas","Yes, the only thing I would add to that is from the legacy FMC pipeline that's coming out of research, we now have products that are getting close enough that we're thinking about brand-new capacity for those new active ingredients. So, that's part of that overall capacity view of our supply chain. So, we would expect to be making those investments outside the next 12-month period, but it's coming quickly.","Pierre Brondeau","And it is more a, I would say, a normal course of business planning in a situation where we believe we're going to have very interesting growth rate for this business versus the market than an integration challenge.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no further questions in queue. Mr. Wherley, please continue with closing remarks.","Michael Wherley","Thank you. That's all the time we have for the call today. As always, I'm available following the call to address any additional questions you may have. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. And that's all the time we have for today.

Phone lines will be placed on a listen-only mode throughout the conference. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer period. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director, Investor Relations for FMC Corporation. Mr. Wherley, you may begin.","Michael Wherley - FMC Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Paul Graves, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Pierre will begin the call with a review of FMC's second quarter performance, and then discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2017. Paul will provide an overview of select financial results. As a reminder these metrics exclude any impact from the pending acquisition of the DuPont business and our Health and Nutrition business, which is reported in discontinued operations.

Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. FMC had another strong quarter and with the recent approvals from competition regulators, our pending transaction with DuPont remain on track for a November 1 close.","We are pleased to announce both our Ag Solutions and Lithium businesses posted strong results in the second quarter. I will review the overall Q2 performance, then focus on our projections for the second half of the year. And finish with an update on the 2018 financial impact of the pending acquisitions.","Turning to slide 3, FMC reported second quarter revenue of $657 million, which was up nearly 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $0.48 in the quarter up 4% versus the same period a year ago and $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance.","Before I get into specifics regarding our Ag Solutions results, let me start with a brief market update. Globally, we expect the crop protection market to decline by a low to mid single-digit percentage in 2017. North America continues to experience difficult market condition, largely due to weaker grower economics and we expect it to be down mid single-digits for the full year. In Europe, the season was negatively impacted by a late start in North and Central Europe in Q1 and by hot dry condition in Southern Europe in Q2.","We now expect the European market to be down in the low-to-mid single-digit range for full year of 2017, slightly weaker than we expected three months ago. In Asia, we believe the market will be flat to slightly up for full year of 2017.","Although we are pleased with what we have seen in Latin America with the largest selling crop enhancing grower finances and with improved fundamentals in sugarcane and cotton, it is clear that channel inventory levels are still impacting some of our competitors in the region. Largely as a result of this last factor, we expect the overall market in Brazil to be down low-to-mid single-digits for full year of 2017.","Let me now move onto slide 4, and FMC Ag Solutions performance in the context of these overall market conditions. Second quarter revenue of $583 million was up 6% compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased volume in Brazil and new product launches in Asia, offset partially by lower sales in North America. Overall, volume was up 10% offset somewhat by a 4% headwind from weaker price.","Segment earnings of $96 million were down 5% year-over-year with weakness in North America having the largest impact on our earnings. Price was a drag in the quarter. But year-to-date price was down 2% which is consistent with our expectations for the full-year. We continue to execute a strategy of maintaining discipline on price and terms and limiting credit risk while pursuing top line growth only where it makes sense. We see continued growth opportunities in Asia and Latin America and we will act responsibly, continuing to balance earnings growth with earnings quality, credit risk, and cash flow generation.","Turning to slide 5, I will provide additional comments on Ag Solutions' regional performance in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2016. North America sales declined 7% on lower demand for insecticide and lower pricing. In Latin America, sales increased 38%. In Brazil, we saw improvements in sales to cotton, sugarcane and soybean growers. Our move to direct access in Argentina continues to be a bright spot with strong sales in pre-emergent herbicides. In Europe, revenue increased 3% in the quarter as we largely recovered from a lower Q1 sales to perform in line with the market for the first half of 2017. In Asia, revenue increased 4% in the quarter. We saw successful launches of new rice herbicide in China, and increased demand for rice insecticide in Indonesia.","Moving next to the outlook for 2017, we expect that Ag Solutions 2017 revenue will be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, which is about 3% year-over-year at the midpoint and slightly higher than our previous guidance. We have tightened the guidance range for segment earnings to a range of $415 million to $445 million, with the midpoint reflecting an 8% year-over-year increase. At the midpoint, we are focusing earnings growth of 16% in the second half of 2017 relative to the same period in 2016. This includes third quarter segment earnings in the range of $100 million to $120 million, which represents a 22% increase at the midpoint.","This second half growth will be driven largely by improved performance in Latin America, as significantly higher volumes and lower operating cost will more than offset the forecast price headwinds. We expect continued margin improvement with second half earnings margin of 20%. Our expected year-over-year performance in Latin America reflect the benefit of how we have operated in Brazil the past few years.","As you recall, we took four broad actions commencing in early 2015 to position our business in Brazil to match the operating conditions we see today. First, we reduced our cost base to better match market conditions. Second, we became more disciplined in our sales process mainly with regards to sales terms and cash collection. Third, we eliminated sales of low value product from the portfolio, selling only those products where FMC was able to achieve acceptable financial returns. And fourth, we acted to reduce the amount of FMC product in the distribution channels. To this point channel inventory of FMC products in Brazil has declined by 60% since the end of 2015. The impact of these deliberate actions in the last few years have been painful, but we are now positioned to reap the rewards of these actions.","We have also seen improvements in cotton and sugarcane market conditions in Brazil where FMC has significant exposure. Outside of Brazil, our move last year to a direct access model in Argentina will continue to deliver significant opportunities in the second half of 2017.","Moving now to slide 6, Lithium delivered another very strong quarter. Revenue of $74 million was up 17% driven by improvements in pricing and product mix. The pricing improvements were seen across the portfolio. Segment earnings of $24 million in the quarter increased 47% versus Q2 2016 as significantly higher prices and improved mix offset higher costs.","The higher costs were largely due to the impact of seasonal operating conditions and costs related to expansion project. Segment earnings margins was 33% versus 26% in the prior year period. We are raising our full year guidance for the Lithium segment. We now expect revenue to be between $340 million and $360 million, a year-over-year increase of over 30% at the midpoint and earnings to be between $115 million and $125 million, an increase of over 70% at the midpoint. We expect a mid 30%'s earnings margin percentage for the full year.","We expect third quarter segment earnings in the range of $30 million to $35 million, which represents 34% sequential improvement at the midpoint as well as year-over-year growth of about 85%. The main driver of the increase in our earnings guidance versus our May guidance is increased confidence in the ramp up of our new Hydroxide operation in China, and the success in obtaining customer qualifications. We began selling products from this plant late in Q2, we will steadily ramp up through September and we should be selling at full capacity in Q4. As a result, total Hydroxide revenue in the second half of 2017, is expected to represent over 50% of segment revenue compared to about 35% of first half revenue.","Let's now turn to slide 7 to discuss in more detail our Lithium expansions and how they will impact the next few years. This starts with our Hydroxide phase 1, which we discussed in the context of 2017 already. In 2018, we expect to realize the full volume benefit from these two 4,000 ton lines built in China. Hydroxide demand projections continue to outpace capacity addition across the industry, especially in the segments of EV battery market where hydroxide has a distinct technological advantage, which is in high Nickel content cathodes.","Most of the pure EV models currently in development will rely upon high nickel content batteries, due to their greater energy density, which provides a longer driving range. We remain fully committed to the Phase 2 hydroxide expansion. Phase 2 will add a further 12,000 tons of capacity across three separate units. All of which will be online in 2019. We will give more details on the timing, the cost and the location of these additional units later this year. But we could see some sales from Phase 2 in the latter part of 2018.","We will continue to enter into customer contracts similar to those we currently have, before we dig in to build these new units. These current contracts for a Phase 1 hydroxide volumes are largely three or four-year of contracts with commitments on both volume and price.","Moving to the right hand side of this slide, the second leg of our Lithium expansion plan is to produce enough carbonate to continue to serve our downstream operations and remain a fully integrated lithium producer. With the plan outlined here, we will have enough carbonates and chloride to sustain our growth projection for our downstream business into the foreseeable future.","Our current facilities in Argentina are operating at record levels and as you saw this quarter, we're successfully managing the seasonal production variation caused by weather conditions. In addition, our debottlenecking project will add an incremental 2,000 tons to 3,000 tons of carbonate production in 2018 with the remainder coming in 2019.","Next, our agreement with Nemaska to buy 8,000 tons a year of carbonate, starting in 2018 runs for multiple years and we remain confident in Nemaska's ability to meet their commitments to FMC. We will continue to look at similar sourcing deals where terms and price make sense. However, our first priority option to source additional carbonate is to significantly expand capacity at our Argentina location where we are planning to invest $250 million to $300 million to add 20,000 tons of capacity. This facility is one of the lowest cost producers in the world, significantly lower than it was in 2015 before the Argentine peso devaluation. We estimate our current cash costs are less than half that of a typical bitumen-based producer.","Expanding this facility has low risk execution. We have operated at this location for many years and have benefited from our ongoing manufacturing excellence programs. We are progressing the engineering work and we are in discussion with local authorities to finalize these plans. As we have stated since March 31, it is our firm intention to create two independently listed public companies with leading positions in their respective industry. To this end, our current plan is to move toward a separate listing of FMC Lithium in the second-half of 2018. We expect to announce a final decision on the timing by the second quarter of 2018.","Moving briefly to slide 8, which summarizes our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. On a consolidated basis, our guidance for the third quarter adjusted earnings is in the range of $0.57 to $0.67 per share, up approximately 45% at the midpoint versus the same quarter last year. As I mentioned previously, we are maintaining full year earnings guidance for Ag Solutions, and raising it by 9% at the midpoint for Lithium. We are tightening our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year to a range $2.30 to $2.50, which represents year-over-year EPS growth between 20% to 30%.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Pierre. Today, I will cover three topics, cash flow and net debt, collections in Brazil and the forecast for the corporate cost line item. Starting with cash flow on slide 9. We have seen strong performance in cash flow generation year-to-date, which is reflected in a reduction in net debt of around $150 million, since the start of the year.","This is despite the headwind created by one-off cash costs related to the DuPont acquisition. In the last 12 months, we have reduced our net debt balance by over $275 million. Q2 saw encouraging trends in Brazil, which I'll touch on in a moment, leading to adjusted cash from operations of $214 million year-to-date, 24% better than the same period last year.","Brazil collections were ahead of forecast, with a particularly encouraging reduction in the past due receivables balance, which fell by over 15% in the quarter. Put simply, we're collecting existing past dues and reducing the occurrence of new past due balances. One of the key drivers behind this collection performance has been our success in reducing the level of FMC inventory in the distribution channels, which Pierre mentioned earlier. From FMC's perspective, channel inventory is a far smaller headwind to sales or collections than it has been in any of the last few seasons.","For the full year, we expect to generate operating cash flow in the $530 million to $630 million range, which would be broadly flat with 2016. We expect to see net debt continue to fall in the third quarter, before a small increase in Q4, as we head into the heart of the Brazil selling period and the start of the North America and Europe sales seasons. You'll have noticed an increase in the forecast for corporate costs for the full year and particularly high expenses in this quarter. The driver of this is the higher FMC share price that we have seen since the start of April, which creates a mark-to-market expense for the outstanding long-term incentive awards granted in 2015, which are delivered on the basis of historical total shareholder return.","The higher share price is also the reason for the higher estimate of fully diluted shares outstanding, from 135 million to 135.5 million shares. Finally, you have likely noticed that we are not increasing our full year EPS guidance, despite an increase in guidance for the segments of $10 million at the midpoint. The combination of higher corporate costs, higher share count and a slightly higher estimate for the full year tax rate offsets this increase in segment earnings.","With that, I will turn the call back to Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you, Paul. I mentioned at the start of the call, that I would give you some more thoughts on the pending acquisition from DuPont. We have received approvals from most of the major jurisdictions needed to close our transactions with DuPont and we continue to work constructively with the few that have yet to issue a ruling.","As a reminder, our transactions are contingent upon the close of the Dow DuPont merger which is expected this month. We also need to complete the step required to separate the business from DuPont. This remains on track for a November 1 close as set out in the purchase agreements.","If you turn to slide 10, this is a first look of the 2018 financial performance of FMC in its new form. The model starts with our current 2017 EPS guidance and adds the insights of the DuPont acquisition, plus the 2018 impact from the growth of FMC Ag Solutions and Lithium segments.","I will touch on some of these key assumptions in this model. We now expect cost synergies will be between $40 million and $80 million in 2018. There will be additional cost synergies to come in 2019 and beyond, but we will update you on the magnitude of those on our February 2018 earnings call.","We remain quite cautious in our assumptions as to earnings growth for the acquired business and have assumed a lower rate of revenue growth than was presented to us by the seller. We continue to believe this is appropriate until we own the business and can develop our own view of both near-term growth potential as well as waiting until we take a first look at how the new Ag markets might perform in 2018, but we are comfortable providing a forecast revenue growth for 2018 for the entire Ag Solutions segment in the 2% to 4% range, which equates to EBIT growth of $30 million to $60 million. We may update this estimate again in November, but we will certainly give a formal guidance assumption on the February earnings call. You may have noticed we did not include an estimate for revenue synergies. We expect to give our first estimate in the February 2018.","FMC has begun the process of divesting the portfolio of products required by the European Commission remedies which was announced last week. We expect the impact of this to be about $10 million to $15 million of earnings in 2018.","Next is the growth of our Lithium segment. By looking at our projections for Q3 and the implied Q4 earnings from running our Phase 1 expansion at full capacity, you get a good starting point for 2018. Taking into account seasonal production, cost and prices, we believe that earnings growth of $40 million to $50 million is appropriate for Lithium for 2018. This model shows significant earnings growth in both businesses in 2018, but we are still at an early stage in the forecasting process.","In summary, we feel very good about where FMC is today. Our current Ag Solutions business delivered a solid Q2 and we're set to deliver a strong second half driven by Latin America and Asia. Lithium had a very strong quarter and is on track to deliver higher earnings in the second half of the year as the new hydroxide units commence full commercial operations. We continue to receive very positive feedback from our customers, shareholders, and employees, on the announced transactions with DuPont, which remains on track.","Thank you for your attention. And we will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can jump back in the queue. And the first question will come from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I had a lithium question for Tom if I could. You mentioned customers looking for longer contracts. Obviously, you're going to have quite a bit more capacity. Can you talk about how the pool of customers is changing as the lithium market evolves how broadening has the customer list become? Has it gone beyond just cathode producers can you give us some sense of those discussions?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah, Robert. Happy to. So, first off, we're watching the whole value chain at this point. I think, we've mentioned in the past that we're targeting specific battery types and cathode types, where we see the bulk of the growth in the pure EVs, which are going to use the bulk of the lithium and have the highest performance requirements for the lithium. As we do that, the different auto manufacturers as they launch their new EV lines are in various stages of setting up their supply chain. So there are cases where we're selling via contract to cathode manufacturers in China, there are cases where we're selling to battery manufacturers and there are cases where we're selling to OEMs on contracts and we'll continue to evolve to find the most advantageous position in each.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And if I might follow up on the Ag. Is there any risk of some pull forward in Latin America, obviously the year-on-year comps looked quite strong, should we expect maybe there is going to be a payback in the second half there?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","No \u2013 we, it's a very clean quarter. As I said we are selling online with the demand and we are expecting a \u2013 we have a very large part of the orders in hand. We are expecting a very strong Q3, Q4. We are very certain that there is nothing which came in Q2, which was a pull forward from Q3, Q4.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Pierre.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Just given your comments about the North American crop protection market and inventories and in the context of the leverage that US distributors have over some or most chemical producers. What actions if any, can you take to alleviate their efforts to meet annual sales incentive levels, later on in the year, therefore reducing the risk of an inventory build at year-end, and potentially driving an overhang into 2018? Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah, Chris. It's Mark, it's a good point. We are working obviously with our customers very closely on where the sales will occur and at what level and those are based into our forecast. So we are predicting that we will be drawing down inventory levels, yet at the same time we built our programs so that our customers can be rewarded for the quality of the technology they buy from FMC.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And just a quick follow-up, just based on the previous guidance range, you indicated that you'd already locked-in, I think it's roughly half of your sales as of late Spring for the LatAm market in the second half, but can you just give us an update on your LatAm outlook by country. Obviously, it seems like there is some [dispersing] trends there including Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico and just any comments you have on your core emerging market trends in terms of pricing in LatAm and Asia. Thank you.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","That's a lot of questions there.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sorry about that.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Let me start off with Brazil. Yeah, last time we spoke, I indicated that we had about 50% of the orders in hand. Today, that number is north of 65%, most encouragingly it's higher than that in the north of Brazil. So by year, Mato Grosso sugarcane is pretty much on track, slightly less than 65% in the South, but that's kind of normal for us. So we feel very, very confident about where we are in terms of the orders on hand to deliver the type of second half we've said.","Around the rest of the region, Argentina, we talked about Argentina given our new direct access model, we are very, very bullish on Argentina for the second half. We got more sales people on the ground. We see continued expansion of weed resistance, and our pre-emergent herbicides are doing well and obviously, we are looking forward to the DuPont portfolio coming through. Mexico, Mexico has had a tough time this year, not only with currency devaluation, but weather conditions. However, we have a portfolio that is spread very much into the niche crops, so berries, fruit and vegetables. So we expect to see a good second half in Mexico as we end the year.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Let me use that question to make a comment very specific about Brazil because it has been in the center of the discussions from many of our competitors. I just want to reinsure everybody that 60% less inventory of the FMC product in the channel, 6-0, since the peak at the end of 2015. An organization which is now half of the size of what it was at the end of 2014, is allowing us to be highly competitive and to look at a very solid demand for our products.","So, as many of our competitors, we have concerns for the North American market, but I would say Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Brazil for us, we are feeling much better where the company is, and we believe we have taken our pain over the last two years, it's been painful to announce some of the quarterly earnings, when we were working on this, but I think we're very strongly positioned and believe it's going to show well in Q3 and Q4 this year.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Aziza Gazieva - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. It's Aziza on for Frank. I just was wondering, if you guys could elaborate a bit on that positive customer feedback you alluded to regarding the transaction? Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. I think like in any market, customers like to have the choice of companies, which are proposing a different portfolio technologies and product and today we've met actually as late as last week with our largest customer and there is a very positive reaction to see FMC expanding into a company with a broader portfolio, broader technologies. And, Mark, do you want to add to that?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No. I think the only thing I would add to that Pierre is, you're talking about two significant companies coming together in terms of the portfolios with well respected people with good customer relations, so our customers recognize that, they see us as truly a fit Tier-1 company which is going to give them a lot of optionality, so from a customer perspective, they're going to get new technologies from the pipeline that we have and they get full market access. So, it's generally being seen very positively.","Aziza Gazieva - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice...","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Hi, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","...quarter there. Hey, in terms of your outlook for 2018, I appreciate the update there. When you think about some of the puts and takes, the synergies and the Ag Solutions EBIT growth, where do you see some upside and where are you a little bit worried potentially as we head into 2018?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I would say, the only worries we have is not linked to the transaction, it's always today we believe in many places the Ag market has bottomed out, has bottomed. And we see a cycle potentially slowly coming back to \u2013 going back to growth. So, if we are always very careful when we do forecasts, it is not linked to the transaction, it is linked to the market. We want to be sure that its evolving in the right \u2013 into the right direction, which we believe it is. The transaction we feel very comfortable, there is no, not a line we have in the forecast, which is of concern to us.","The two lines as you can guess, where we are very careful, because we are still working on them are the year one synergies, we said $40 million to $80 million goes all the way from supply chain to commercial and back office. And the growth where we don't want to push a number, which is much higher than the 2% to 4%, because we want to see a bit what we can do once we have the portfolio. So, those still need to be worked on, but I would say the numbers we are giving in this forecast do not create any concern for us, nor do we have any operational concern at this stage.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. And then it does sound like your Lithium expansion plans are going well, you've got long-term contracts for, it sounds like the bulk of the capacity that you're going to expand to. So, when you think about spinning or starting the spin process in 2Q, are there any variables that we need to consider to see whether that's been where we'll go as planned?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think today, when we look at the spin, we would be very surprised, if it would not happen in the second half of 2018. We don't see anything which could derail that, but we want to make sure we have finalized all of the discussions with the government in Argentina. We want to make sure we have completely detailed our capital spend and project expansion. And we believe a 2Q announcement of the exact timing for an H2 2018 is very likely.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. Thank you very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from Citi. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, in North America in the past, you've commented on some sales into the channel versus sales on the farm. Just wondering if you have any color about the second quarter, how that progressed?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. What we call product on the ground is roughly flat with last year in Q2. We had expected it and hoped it would be a little higher than that, but it hasn't turned out that way, especially given the weather conditions we've seen in parts of the U.S. So, it's slightly lower than we thought, but flat on the ground at this point is not a bad place to be.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then on lithium, with regards to the Phase 2 of the hydroxide expansion, what specific final data points do you need to lock in, in order to pull the trigger and start construction? Is it just customer contracts, is it logistics, site location just can you walk us through what are the key things we should be thinking about going into that? Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I think, we have no doubt or little doubt that we will be able to contract all of this capacity ahead. I think, the decision Tom and the team have to make is around locations. We have three units and we have to analyze the markets and our global supply chain to decide where each of those units will be. China and North America being two potential locations, but we are looking at all of the options. So, that's the main question which we have to decide on. Tom?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah. The only thing that I would add to that Pierre is that we are duplicating the engineering design. So, whether we put it in China or North America, it's a tactical decision. It's easy to execute.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO. Please go ahead.","Fahad Tariq - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi, this is Fahad on for Joel. I just had a question on the DuPont cost synergies. So, the previous estimate I believe was $30 million to $40 million and now it's been increased to $40 million to $80 million. So what, was there something that came about that allowed you to have more confidence in the synergy target and any color on why that range was increased?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. So, it is simply as a \u2013 as we've said, it's a very different type of synergies. What we are doing is we are receiving an organization from DuPont, and then we are calculating versus the theoretical model which has a $475 million EBITDA. How much resources we will really need to add compared to what we have at FMC. So the only reason for which the number has increased versus the previous version is as we get closer to November 1st, DuPont has more and more freedom to reveal to us the organization we are getting and consequently we are capable of better defining what we need to add to our current structure to operate that business.","So, that's why it is not definitive, we're still working with DuPont. By the time we get to a \u2013 to November, we should have a much closer view on exactly the structure we're getting. We still have some questions around commercial supply chain and back office and we're working on that, but it's purely because we're getting more information as we go.","Fahad Tariq - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","As a follow-up, so post 2018 is there potential for the synergies to go up once the service agreements with DuPont kind of go in some of that function comes in-house with your own employees. Maybe some color on past 2018?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. Certainly, so what we're going to have to do is \u2013 we're going to have over the next year and a half to put in place an SAP system which allows us to operate the entire companies, move out of the TSA. Ultimately, if you look into the back-end of 2019, we will be operating at a lower cost than we will be operating in 2018. Now, there are going to be phase where we are going to have to decide how and when we have resources to be ready to move out of the TSA. So it is not going to be a straight line, but definitely as you think about operating cost when we get out of the TSA with the new SAP system operating with our people, it will be at a lower cost than what we'll have in 2018 and early 2019.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","All right. Good morning guys and congratulations on another good quarter.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","I wanted to follow-up on the comment that I think Pierre you made, I wanted to make sure I heard it right. When you talked about Latin American crop protection business, you mentioned that inventory levels were still high for market participants, but not necessarily for you. So I just want to understand that that it was a comment related kind of to the market overall, but not specifically to your position in Latin America given how much you've drawn down your inventories?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes, Dmitry. So what \u2013 here is the way that we look at it. We believe the performance companies will deliver in the future will be more linked to the actions they have taken in the last two years in the market. There is no doubt that overall, there is inventory in the channel, but inventory depends very much upon the companies. Some have taken like us, some very serious actions since the end of the 2015. We believe we have a very low level of inventory of our products in the market in Brazil and Latin America. Some have taken less, less actions and we'll have to deal with it in the next two years. So, we're pretty comfortable that's why we're forecasting significant growth in Latin America and Brazil in the second half. Other companies, we believe, will have to take the actions, they need to take to get to the same place.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","That's helpful, Pierre. And then a follow-up question on lithium, not just you, but you specifically have been surprising on the upside in terms of profitability and profit dollars as well as margins for the several quarters going back. So, my question is, is this more a function for you of how quickly you're converting to hydroxide. Is it a function of price increases being more than you've originally thought about or is perhaps volume doing a little bit better although it doesn't look like this quarter at least. Can you give us sort of a source of these repeated and consistent positive surprises on lithium profitability?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Sure. I would say if you look in the last put yourself in 2016 getting into early 2017, I think we got more price leverage than we were expecting. So, pricing was better, pricing increase and pricing options was better than what we were expecting, that was driving the better performance. Also a faster move to a mix containing more lithium hydroxide was also a bit faster than what we thought.","That drove the better performance as it happened at the end of 2016, beginning of 2017. The new change is purely because our expansion in China for lithium hydroxide is growing exceptionally well and fast. Customers are qualifying the product very fast and our two units on stream operating very well. So we didn't have the expected troubleshooting, you always have to do when you start a plant and everything went a bit smoother than we were expecting.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Great. I hope this continues. Thank you very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Pierre, I want to go back to your first look at 2018 slide. You were assuming 2% to 4% revenue growth for the combined Ag Solution business. Is that sort of a forecast that the market is going to recover or is that more product specific where you think the combined entity can grow above the market?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","So here is the way we are doing it and once again, it's early but we wanted to give you guys a sense. We are \u2013 it's pretty much, if you think about it the EBIT growth is pretty much in line with the kind of earnings growth our core business is currently doing. So we are looking at a market which is the same as current, maybe a little bit better than what it is today and a portfolio of products which is similar to what we have today with the new product base and new formulations. The upside to be very clear is the portfolio of DuPont coming at us. We know very well that there is opportunities with molecule like Rynaxypyr and very interestingly Cyazypyr, which could boost up that number. If it is still performing, the way I mean look at DuPont performance, it was pretty strong this quarter. So, but we are not assuming that until we see the portfolio.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Then a follow-up on Brazil. On the last call you talked about how you actually had the need to build inventory for sale to take advantage of your low inventory position. Is that still the case and then also what's your currency assumption in Brazil, I know early in the year you were using a forward curve of about BRL3.50 to the $1, we're back at about BRL3.13 now, so that would seem to be potential upside from a currency perspective?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yeah. So, in terms of the inventory, we are still building up inventory. It might be a little bit lower and maybe more defined, because we have very strong visibility on what is required for growth in H2. We have more clarity today in demand and which product and the mix than we had in a long time. So, we're able to have an inventory buildup, which we're still building up inventory in maybe more and a more defined way. From a currency standpoint, Paul do you want to \u2013 the forward look is what?","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Yeah. The spot rate today of BRL3.15, we essentially look more at the forward rate Don than we do the current spot rate, the current forward rate is in that BRL3.30 to BRL3.40 range, it's really been pretty consistent throughout this forecasting period and relatively benign for us. The reason we use the forward curve frankly is because once we make the sale, we then hedge it to the collection period which is on a forward rate. And that's the point and the rate at which we recognize the revenue and therefore the profit on that sale. So, I would describe FX today as relatively benign, relatively stable throughout this year both in terms of actual currency in Brazil and also our assumptions.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","The difficulty we are facing in Brazil, in Brazil today and you've seen we're not the only one, many companies have been addressing that is, you talk about upside the difficulty you have when you have a stability of currency below what was the forward curve a few months ago, is you get price pressure.","So, basically the potential downside we used to have in previous quarters, looking forward for 2017 which was on currency. It's as Paul said, is becoming almost nothing on the FX side, but you see it more on the pricing side. So, you've to move from a downward risk on currency toward a downward risk on price. That's where, if you look on a look forward now, the currency impact is almost nothing in the second half, but we are looking for a full year with a overall price decrease close to 2%, which I think is about the same range our competitors are seeing.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. What is the revenue and margin assumption behind that $475 million EBITDA estimate from the acquired products from DuPont in 2017, and what does that reflect on a year-over-year change versus 2016?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","The revenue we are \u2013 we have on the numbers for $475 million was slightly over $1.4 billion and $475 million of EBITDA.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","Yeah. The EBIT margin on the 2017 numbers was about 28% EBIT margin was our assumption. And if you just back out, and that includes purchase price accounting, and that is different to what it would have been under DuPont's ownership because we have that extra slug of depreciation hitting us as a result of the accounting rules for acquisitions. And it's broadly \u2013 to your question it's broadly consistent with what the business saw in 2016.","Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","And with respect to the forward sales in Brazil for the second half of this year that 60% or 65%, you have already locked up for the second half of this year, are those sales actual...?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","We couldn't get the last part you said. Are those sales?","Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Are they \u2013 are those transactions that you can recognize as revenue, or are these expressions of interest? I'm trying to assess whether that is, those volumes are really secured for the second half of this year or do you run the risk of a competitor undermining you?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","No. Those are firm orders that we have with our customers, distributors and co-ops throughout Brazil. So, no they're firm.","Paul W. Graves - FMC Corp.","And just to tune that point the revenue recognition is when a product is shipped and risk transfers to the customer. So, we will recognize that revenue after shipping takes place, right.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think, we have not said in a long time but we have a solid certainty around the Brazil sales and what we have in the books today and what we have to deliver. But, as Paul said, the revenue recognition is a different thing. We have to ship the product to get the revenue recognized. We are not of course \u2013 yet except for the month of August, we're not yet in this period of time for Q3, Q4.","Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Very good. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","You next question will come from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC","Good morning, thank you. You mentioned that other companies may still take action to correct their crop protection inventory in Latin America. Could this impact your business in a negative way?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Well, yes. I \u2013 if I may say, I wish everybody would have been a bit more aggressive and we would have a better situation where we would have more clarity. The competition is always more intense when people have a high level of inventory for which they need to take actions. But you know that's the way you do business and all of this will clear up in the next one to two years. So, yes, it has an impact, but no more than what you see right now or you'll see in Q3 and Q4.","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","What I would say though is, just as a point on that, not all inventory is created equal and I think if you'd look at what many of our competitors have talked about the category of product, largely in areas particularly in Brazil, where we FMC are not major players. And so, it isn't necessarily, I know there are lot of concerns of \u2013 as I think Steve just mentioned undercutting price, and concerns with regard to substitution it is not that simple. And so, we are not particularly concerned about direct substitution of inventory in the channel to our product in perhaps the way some of you guys are inferring.","Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC","Thank you very much. On lithium, thank you for providing your initial estimate for lithium growth in 2018. You also mentioned that you expect lithium prices to continue growing in 2018. Does your initial estimate of $40 million to $50 million EBIT growth include such potential price increases?","Thomas Schneberger - FMC Corp.","Yeah. So what we're seeing right now is a tight market. We do expect pricing to be, having upward pressure going into next year, but it's still a little early to call just how much we will see. So that estimate really takes into account prices essentially a little bit more than offsetting inflation and it reflects the run rate at full volume from our expansion.","Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC","Great. Thank you.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Just \u2013 I just want to make sure we give clarity. We wanted to give an overview of the business for 2018 for lithium, but please wait until we get to the firm guidance to have more precision than this $40 million to $50 million. Plus $5 million or minus $5 million today will depend upon what we see in pricing and mix. So we will give much more color and precise number when we get early at the February call in 2018, but directionally just give you a sense what we are expecting.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Lawrence Alexander from Jefferies.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Lawrence. How are you?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Good. Good. Thanks.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","I noticed the cash flow from operations outlook for the full year is now $350 million to $450 million, that's up I think $130 million at the midpoint since the first quarter. I was just wondering what just some color on that, how you're going to attribute the large increase?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. We're happy to. It's essentially receivables \u2013 collection of receivables we have. We're performing well. We're performing well in Brazil we're performing well around the world and we have a lot more confidence today that the reduction in receivables in Brazil that we've been looking to drive will actually occur. So it is almost entirely driven by a more positive outlook on our side as to what we think the receivable collection performance will be. You'll notice we were ahead in the first-half on cash flow and we expect that trend to continue in the second half.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just one other question. You mentioned that poor weather conditions in Europe have kind of limited sales from a growing season. Is there a chance for inventory build in that region. If I recall correctly, a company two years or three years ago one of the initial catalysts for the inventory build in North America was a poor growing season, and then you realized there was kind of a big build up in the inventory. I was wondering if something similar can unfold in a different region?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. I don't think so for the following reason. Europe is 27 countries. So, you got a lot of different dynamics going on, even when you have a certain type of weather condition. So, I don't think you're going to see broad based inventory build in Europe. You may see some country based inventory, but it won't be big enough to derail a whole region like we saw in Brazil for instance.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Just to add to what Mark said, it's a very important comment, when you think about inventory level. You see much more challenge around inventory in the channel, when you have markets concentrated with very large customers in very large countries North America or Brazil. You see way less of an impact around inventory when you have a more fragmented market with multiple countries and regions like you see in Asia or in Europe.","Operator","And then your next question will come from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Just wanted to get your thoughts around the crop in the U.S. and how that sets up for chemistry demand in 2018 and I know it's still a bit early, but just wanted to know your thoughts there? And then on top of that, given the weakness in insecticides in the U.S. have seen any increased book pressure so far this season and how that could drive or what your view is on insecticide demand as we look at 2018 crop season?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. Brett. Today is early you're right to think about where we go into the next season. Obviously soy is doing well in the U.S. corn under a little more pressure, but for us that's good, obviously with a major position in pre-emergent herbicides and we are seeing good business in our post herbicides as well. So, the increase of soy is good for us. Weather conditions we'll see over the next few weeks, how things develop. With regards to bug pressure, everybody says every three years to five years, you should have a good bug run, well we're due one, we've been three years without anything. So we certainly have inventory out there available for in case there are issues with bugs. So, we'll see how we go in the next, again the next month will be very telling.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then, looking at South America, you talked about sugarcane fundamentals being stronger in Brazil, but do you see any risk looking out over the next season given the decline in sugar prices here more recently or at least compared to where we were at the beginning of the year. And yeah I know again a little bit early and yeah ethanol prices have been supported by ongoing lifts in gas taxes. But just wondering your thoughts given weaker sugar prices?","Mark A. Douglas - FMC Corp.","Yeah. The sugar prices are weaker but you got to remember where they came from, they came from $9, $10 up to $21, $22 they're down at $14, $15. So, they are off the peak, but they are still a profitable business for a lot of our growers. In Brazil we're seeing constant planting now, so our month-to-month sales are very consistent with our forecast. So, we feel very good about where the sugar business is right now.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Just a question on Latin America, one of the large competitors in the space reported very strong growth in acreage for Intacta , any thoughts on how that impacts your legacy products or molecules acquired from DuPont, i.e. Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Yes. I think it's always something we're watching of course because of Rynaxypyr now. There are going to be some growth in acreage for Intacta, but it is very important to understand that Rynaxypyr is not a Brazil soybean story. We believe that the usage of Rynaxypyr on soybean and we have not seen all the numbers, but our market intelligence make us believe that, Rynaxypyr on soybean is about mid-single-digit percent of the portfolio we acquired from DuPont. So it is a small part, so it's going to have some impact. But it's very minimum. I mean if you think about Rynaxypyr growth opportunities in major part of the market just for example in Asia I would believe that Rynaxypyr is 50% sold in Asia.","So we're watching, we're looking, there might some little down pressure on usage of Rynaxypyr on soybean in Brazil. But we don't think it will be much and it is a very small part of the portfolio we acquired.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful, thanks. And just, can you just give us some thoughts on your margin targets in Ag, you were down year-on-year and I think in the past you had said that you'd want to get those above the mid-teens level. Any thoughts on what your projections are for margins longer term in Ag, thanks?","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","I think for the second half, we know we're going to be in the 20% range. We also know we're acquiring a portfolio of product which has posted plus in the 28% and so it's about 30% to 40%. So, the math would tell that you're going to bring \u2013 you're going to bring fairly quickly your EBIT margin in the 23% to 26% range.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks.","Pierre R. Brondeau - FMC Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","That's all the time we have for today. This concludes the FMC Corporation second quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. Thank you."]}}
