My name is Shirley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David R. Radulski","Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast in XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. And we posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement. On our call this evening, you'll hear from Mike Mcgavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer our opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations who will review their segment results and market conditions, and we'll open it up to questions. Among those also available for questions are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer; and Stephen Robb, our Controller.","Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date in which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I turn it over to Mike Mcgavick.","Michael S. Mcgavick","Good evening. We're pleased to report that 2012 was a year of progress across XL and our fourth quarter continued that momentum. A year ago, we committed to expand margins and we were able to do so due to a combination of price increases, greater underwriting vigor and being more disciplined about our spending, while also benefiting from a benign year as with respect to non-CAT large losses.","We also said we would buy back shares. We estimated that we would buy back about $400 million worth and maybe more if the year progressed better than we expected. In the end, we bought back about $500 million in shares that we associate with our 2012 performance, $402 million during the year itself and another $98 million in January, a delay made necessary by the uncertainty around the losses caused by Superstorm Sandy.","And in connection with buying back our shares, I would observe that this level could go higher in 2013 if the year plays out as we expect. It is not our goal to expand our capital buffer but rather to keep it level. As we enter 2013, we intend to keep grinding away at what we must do to keep our progress going. As mentioned, we know from what we've heard so far in the earnings season, it is clear that 2012 was, in many ways, a light large loss year for the industry. These kinds of years come and go. What we feel best about is that with the tighter management processes we had been driving home these past several years, if 2013 were to be to an above-average year for large losses for the industry, we will perform much better than we have in the past.","So let me share some other results from the fourth quarter. Of course, the most notable event was Sandy, one of the top 3 insured storm losses in history and devastating to many on the East Coast. XL's current loss estimate of $355 million is in line with what we provided in our December release and we think is a continuing example of solid risk management and underwriting.","Greg and Jamie will provide more detail in a moment. But looking beyond Sandy, it is pleasing to us that our underwriting operations on an ex-CAT, ex-PYD basis continued to trend in the right direction.","Our Insurance segment delivered a 96.5 ex-CAT, ex-PYD combined ratio for the quarter. This segment was about breakeven for the year on the same basis, even after the very challenging quarter one results. But as we told you before, we won't be satisfied with our underwriting in this segment until we are regularly delivering a combined ratio of around 90%. The trend is in the right direction and we are pleased with the momentum.","Reinsurance, even after taking the brunt of our Sandy losses, had a combined ratio of 104.4% for the quarter and 96.9% for the full year on an all-in basis. We are very pleased by these underwriting results.","Turning to reserves. As you know, every second and fourth quarter, we make a deep examination -- someone just said I got the number wrong, 86.9% was the full year combined on Reinsurance. Thank you. We are very pleased, as I said, by those results. Turning to reserves, as you know, every second and fourth quarter, we make a deep examination of all of our reserves. And for the fourth quarter of 2012, this resulted in $98 million in releases.","As for our booked value, our fully diluted tangible booked value per share was $33.35 at year end. This was up 1.6% in the quarter and 18% higher than where we began 2012. The 2 largest contributors to this growth were gains in our investment portfolio, mark-to-market and net income.","A couple of last areas of comment. First, with respect to ROEs, and second with respect to pricing. As for ROEs, I would say our all-in 6.2% operating ROE for 2012 was not where we want it to be. But it is certainly an indicator of improvement, built upon an increasingly solid foundation. To be clear, driving a better ROE is best achieved by expanding our core operating margins. No other action makes a comparable difference. This grinding work will not stop. And as we get our operating earnings moving in the right direction, the goalpost we will focus on more and more is the ROE we produce. We really need to get back to double digits. And we are very driven to do so, even in this low interest rate environment, should it persist. In this connection, there is one thing you should know, and that is we are focused on getting to double-digit ROEs on an x AOCI basis, given that mark-to-market fluctuations, currently positive about $1.3 billion in our fixed income portfolio, could obviously turn the other way. As a result, we won't focus on these fluctuations and we'll focus on x AOCI ROEs in our drive toward double-digit performance.","Second, on the pricing environment. This is the first quarter in which I feel that those of us who operate insurance businesses on the whole are finally getting it. You can see that rate is starting to grow year-on-year. We have been expecting this, because in these interest rate environments, the rate levels that are being priced into these risks have not made sense. So it is really good to be hearing the kinds of commentary I've heard across the market about rate and about underwriting discipline overall, particularly on the primary side. This makes sense to us, as we have been in a long time willing to walk away from business that was not adequately priced and have been pushing rate across our lines of business. But let's be clear, rate levels are not yet where they should be and we will not change our approach. But I do feel strongly there's now a bit more tailwind to our efforts than there has been in the past.","2012 was a solid year of continued progress. We certainly are not done making this a better company. It is not yet the XL we dream of, but I can confidently say we are prouder of the company every day.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.","Peter R. Porrino","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. As Mike mentioned, our fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by Sandy. Catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the fourth quarter were $352 million, which is composed of Sandy and some modest positive reserve developments from other 2012 catastrophes.","Our CAT losses in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $195 million. For the full year, our CAT losses were $464 million compared to $761 million in 2011.","Despite Sandy's impact, we generated fourth quarter operating income of $39 million or $0.13 per share compared to an operating loss of $80 million or $0.25 per share last year. For the full year, we reported operating profit of $614 million or $1.98 per share compared to $89 million or $0.28 per share in 2011.","Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $81 million for the fourth quarter and $651 million for the full year.","Our accident year, ex-CAT, Property & Casualty  combined ratio improved by 9.8 percentage points in the quarter and 4.8 points for the full year, a nice illustration of Mike's earlier comments regarding XL's margin improvement.","Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a favorable $98 million or 6.4 loss ratio points and is up from $68 million in the prior year quarter. This reflects favorable development of $43 million and $55 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively, resulting from our fourth quarter detailed ground-up reserve review.","For Insurance, positive movements came from Professional, Specialty businesses, partially offset by reserve strengthening in our Excess & Surplus lines business.","In the Reinsurance segment, the favorable movements were predominant from our short-tail lines with contributions from our U.S. Casualty book.","Our operating expenses for the fourth quarter were down 7.2% versus the prior year quarter and down 6.2% compared to the third quarter of 2012. The decrease from last year was largely due to the timing of costs associated with our strategic initiatives. The decrease from Q3 2012 was due to changes in variable compensation due to Sandy.","Our Investment Portfolio delivered total returns of 1% in the quarter and 6.7% for the year. A positive mark-to-market of $72 million for the quarter was driven by tightening credit spreads, partially offset by a marginal increase in interest rates. We had a positive mark-to-market of $987 million for the year.","Our P&C fixed income duration increased by 0.3 years to 3.1 years since the end of the third quarter due to lower cash holdings and an extension in our agency mortgage-backed portfolio due to a slowing in prepayment projections. However, we continue to manage the P&C portfolio approximately a year short of the corresponding liabilities it supports.","The life fixed income portfolio duration marginally increased by 0.1 years to 8.8 years. At $169 million net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was 12% below last year due primarily to lower reinvestment rates.","The $3 million increase in our P&C net investment income from Q3 2012 was primarily due to a small positive adjustment on our inflation protected portfolios this quarter versus a negative adjustment last quarter.","We expect net investment income will remain under pressure, given the low interest rates. The P&C gross book yield at the end of December was 2.9%. We estimate that approximately $3.5 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 3.1% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months compared to average new money rate in Q4 on our P&C portfolio of 1.9%.","Our net income from Investment affiliates was $32 million compared to a loss of $24 million last year. We experienced more constructive markets this quarter compared to challenging markets in 2011.","Net realized gains on investments in the quarter were $11 million. And net realized gains for the full year were $14 million compared to net realized losses of $188 million in 2011.","Last quarter, I discussed nonrecurring beneficial tax items that had impacted operating income. This quarter, there was a $24.5 million tax benefit arising from the release of valuation allowances held against capital loss carryforwards that we utilized in the quarter. This had no impact on operating income. Our full year tax rate on operating income, excluding nonrecurring items, was approximately 11.5%.","We continue to act on the compelling economics of buying back our ordinary shares. As Mike discussed, during the fourth quarter, we bought back 2.1 million ordinary shares at an average price of $24.78. For all of 2012, we bought back 18.3 million ordinary shares at an average price of $21.99. And in January 2013, following our Sandy loss estimate release, we bought back an additional 3.8 million shares at an average cost of $25.94. This leaves $250 million available -- remaining available for buybacks under the current program.","And finally, for those of you who might have missed it back in December, S&P revised their outlook from stable to positive.","I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Pete, and good evening. So I'll cover the results for this segment, discuss Superstorm Sandy and finish remarks on recent market conditions.","Beginning with the results, Insurance segment combined ratio for the quarter was 106.6%, reflecting the adverse impact of Sandy, which contributed 14 points to the loss ratio, $138.7 million in losses, $11.8 million in reinstatement premiums.","Our underwriting loss is always disappointing. This is a 9.6 point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2011, which was also impacted by CAT losses, namely the Thailand floods and development from prior quarter CATs.","On an accident year basis, excluding CATs, the combined ratio for the quarter was 96.5% or 8.6 points better than the prior year quarter. Once again, our current accident quarter loss ratio is contributing to most of this improvement. For the fourth quarter, the accident loss ratio, ex-CAT, was 66.8% or 5.1 points better than prior year quarter, driven by favorable loss experienced in our international and North American property books as well as a lower current accident year loss ratios in the aerospace and international primary Casualty.","The expense ratio in the quarter improved by 3.3 points, 2.4 points driven by flat operating expenses relative to growing net earned premiums and 0.9 points of improvement in the acquisition ratio.","Given the variability of quarterly results, the best indicator of our improvement in 2012 is the reduction in our accident year ex-CAT loss ratio. For the full year of 2012, we experienced a 66.6% loss ratio, which is a 6.4% improvement over last year and this is our best full year performance since 2007.","Insurance gross premiums written grew by $161 million or 13.9% in the quarter and $468 million or 9.7% for the full year when normalized for foreign exchange and long-term agreements. Both the quarter and full year growth is attributable to the numerous additive and corrective plans we had put in place over the last 12 to 18 months. We are realizing planned growth in many of our new businesses, in particular, North American construction, E&S and Political Risk.","In addition, new leadership has helped reinvigorate a number of our existing businesses. For example, our North American U.S. risk management team continues to build momentum in the marketplace and underwrote a unique nonrecurring policy of $17 million of gross written premium, contributing to the high growth rate in the quarter.","Also contributing was material rate increases in most of our North American Property & Casualty  lines as well as our U.S. professional book.","In the U.S. professional portfolio, we experienced growth from both increased rates as well as an increase in number of accounts that reached our pricing hurdles.","Turning to Sandy. The adjustment process continues to progress smoothly, and I am pleased with our claims and underwriting performance to date. As of the beginning of the week, we have received 641 loss notices and new claims have all but stopped. We have closed 84 claims with the resulting paid loss of just under $20 million. To date, we have only a few notices that are in dispute and just one has resulted in litigation.","Our gross loss estimate is $207 million and is split 80% property and 20% marine and fine art. The largest individual risk loss net of faculty of Reinsurance is $10 million, and this is indicative of an event with a relatively large number of small losses.","We have attached to our Property Catastrophe and Marine Reinsurance covers, so any adverse development would largely be absorbed in these Reinsurance protections. Our policy holdings are holding up well, and in particular, a strong underwriting of flood and contingent business interruption has served to keep our losses contained.","Finally, turning to recent market conditions. The fourth quarter was very much a continuation of what we saw in the second and third quarters, with positive rate indications in nearly all our businesses and an overall segment rate increase of just over 3%. Roughly half of the fourth quarter premium experienced rate increases this quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2011.","North America Property & Casualty continues to show the most strength, where rates increased by 5%. Our global Professional portfolio had another solid quarter with increases of over 3%, led by our U.S. Professional portfolio with a nearly 6% increase and a strong December of just under 9%.","International Professionals, 1 of only 2 businesses to experience downward rate pressure. As a result, our solicitor's gross premiums written were reduced by $28 million in response to aggressive competition, some of it from unrated carriers.  Our Specialty business were virtually flat, driven by a competitive aviation renewal.","And our International Property & Casualty book had the strongest quarter in years, albeit on low volume with rate increases exceeding 4%. Additionally, an early analysis of our international January 1 renewals, which represent nearly 1\/3 of the portfolio, shows rate and property up 3% compared to up 1% in 2012, and casualty up by 2% compared to down 2% last year.","While we are in a much better position for a pricing perspective heading into 2013 than we were a year ago, we remain convinced that further rate is needed broadly and in particular on long tail lines of business, given persistently low investment returns.","We have sacrificed top line in a number of areas where returns are not in an acceptable level and showed no signs of improving. We will maintain this discipline in 2013.","In summary, I think 2012 was a decent year for the Insurance segment, reflecting a great deal of hard work. But more importantly, I think it sets the stage for further improvement in 2013. And so far, from what we've seen in the last quarter and the early weeks of this year, we believe we can make further progress towards our ultimate goal of combined ratio of 90% or better, as underwriting diligence and expansion of margin continues to be our utmost priority.","And now to Jamie to discuss our Insurance results.","James H. Veghte","Thanks, Greg, and good evening. I'd like to cover 2 principal issues tonight, a review of our fourth quarter and full year results, and also some comments on our recent renewal season and market conditions.","The Reinsurance segment underwriting result was obviously heavily impacted by Sandy and produced a combined ratio of 104.4% and an underwriting loss of $22 million in the quarter.","CAT losses in the quarter, net of reinstatement premium, were $204 million with Sandy representing the vast majority of this amount. In addition, we had the benefit of $55 million of prior year releases in the quarter. Excluding both CAT losses and prior year releases, the segment had a very solid combined of 72.9%. This compares favorably to the 85.6% for the fourth quarter of 2011. Six points of this improvement relates to the property CAT book, which includes the benefits of a lower level of development on smaller current-year CAT events compared to 2011. We also had a 4.7% improvement in operating expenses, driven by reduced year end compensation accruals and an improvement of 2.5 points resulting from changes in business mix.","We remain very prudent around reserve releases on long tail lines, particularly for recent underwriting years. For the full year, this segment had a combined ratio of 86.9%, which compares to the 97.8% combined in 2011. This was impacted by catastrophe losses of $241 million and prior year reserve releases of $176 million compared to 2011, where CAT losses were $406 million and reserve releases $208 million. Excluding the impact of both CAT losses and prior year releases, we had a combined ratio of 83.1% compared to 85.7% in 2011.","Overall, we had a very solid year of underwriting results. We remain convinced that Sandy will be materially north of $20 billion to the industry and our own loss was within expectations, given the size of the industry loss.","Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $158 million, which compares to the $105 million written in the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase was driven principally by reinstatement premiums as a result of Sandy and new business opportunities at XL Re America.","We reentered the crop business on a primary basis. On a year-to-date basis, our gross written premiums were $2 billion, down 3% from 2011. You will recall that our gross written premiums were down significantly in earlier quarters this year as a result of the conversion of the Heartland Crop program from a primary program to Reinsurance assumed program in 2012. A more appropriate year-on-year comparison therefore would be on a net written basis, where we grew 9% to $1.88 billion for the year.","Turning to market conditions. Our year end renewal went largely as expected, although we did see some unexpected pockets of competitions in areas of the market and we reduced our position or retired from several large placements.","For U.S. CAT business, loss impacted programs saw rate increases in the 10% to 15% range, while loss-free programs were either flat or in some cases down, particularly for non-win driven programs.","Demand for capacity was broadly flat. There was more momentum for aggregate-type structures, and 2 large U.S. programs moved that format.","In the U.K., prices were down 5% on a risk-adjusted basis. And in Continental Europe, the reductions were 3% to 5%, with the exception of Italy, where we saw a double-digit increase as a result of the earthquakes last May. Again, for very large programs, there was plenty of capacity available once the pricing cleared the main lead markets.","On Specialty lines, the Marine market saw a very robust renewal as Sandy was the latest of the series of significant losses into that market. All indications suggests the Marine component of Sandy was as much as $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and the market reacted accordingly with significant price increases and coverage changes.","On the aviation side, the general airline book showed price reductions of 5% based on continued good experience, while the general aviation account was reasonably stable.","Turning to Casualty. Both the U.S. and international markets remain competitive. Reinsurers were again quite determined to retain their renewal accounts and most tried to increase their lines with limited success. There was some increase in seeding company retention levels, a pattern we have seen repeatedly for a number of years. We do take comfort from the continuing improvement in the pricing environment on the primary side and we do find opportunities to write selected business. But broadly, our posture in these markets remains highly defensive.","Finally, I'd like to highlight one operational note. During the quarter, we added Craig Wenzel, most recently from a leading investment bank, as Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. The convergent space and utilization of third-party capital in our underwriting activities is not new to XL. However, we see this trend becoming an ever increasing part of the capital landscape of the industry, and we are delighted to add Craig to lead our efforts in sourcing and structuring alternative capital to support our underwriting teams.","With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A.","David R. Radulski","Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mike, on the share buyback potential, I believe you mentioned more than $400 million is likely in 2013. Given your return on equity goals, where do you feel the capital base needs to be sized to? And how can the buyback get you there?","Michael S. Mcgavick","Yes, let me make, Jay, the first one. The first thing I would emphasize is that the capital leverage by virtue of buybacks is not the most powerful lever we have on producing acceptable ROEs. By far, the most powerful lever we have is on expanding our operating margins and we are moving nicely towards that objective. That's going to be our core focus.  That said, as I emphasized, it is not our goal to expand our capital buffer at this time. We'd like to keep it level. And if we are successful through the year in expanding our margins, to keep it level obviously, that would imply that we would need to buy back at a higher level than the $400 million we committed to early last year. I'm not ready to put a number around that. I think it's premature as we have a number of our capital management policies still to consider with the board. But just the logic of keeping it level would suggest that we would be looking to do more over the course of this year if it plays out as we expect. But our focus in driving the better ROE comes from expanded operating margins. That's what we're working toward, and we believe we can continue to deliver that in 2013.","Peter R. Porrino","Jay, this is Pete. Just one point of clarification on the way you asked the question. We view our buybacks in '12 as $500 million, right, because of timing difference from Sandy. And I think Mike's comment that he made in his prepared remarks was that was where we were starting from.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's an important clarification. Okay. And then on the Insurance segment, if we look at the ex-CAT, ex-prior development baseline, it went from 94.7% in 3Q, this is with the Insurance segment, to 96.3% in 4Q. Previously, it had been improving every quarter on a linked-quarter basis and this ticked up a bit. It'll be helpful to understand, does this reflect some onetime items or some noise, or should we expect that to continue to head back down in subsequent quarters?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Jay, it's Greg. I'd say one note at the high level is that given the nature of the business we're in, upper middle market and large corporate space, the quarter is always going to have some variability to it. So what I'd like you to do is focus on the accident year ex-CAT loss ratio, which is the real -- I think the real interesting piece. If you look at that, for the full year, our accident loss ratio ex-CAT was 66.6% and 6.5 points better than prior year. And I'd put that improvement into 4 categories. First, our traditional short-tail property lines performed better than prior year and account for about 2% of the full year improvement. So this is the result of a lot of hard work in re-underwriting the portfolio, particularly around driving rate, where we've had the highest rate increase in our North American property book, in terms of conditions as well. The second piece is around large property losses which account for roughly 3% of the improvement. And there, we used $10 million of the threshold for large losses. And in accident year 2011 we got $157 million of those large losses versus just $11 million in 2012.","Now this is a scenario where it's hard to attribute precisely between fortuity and scale. We are de-risking the international property portfolio, but it's really impossible to tell you precisely how much we have done that on scale and fortuity. The last 2 drivers are rate exceeding trend on the entire portfolio, and that's about 0.5 point, and change in business mix drive the other point. So year -- our full year over a full year, I had to attribute at least half better improvement to our underwriting actions. I know this is a subjective exercise. You can't put a pinpoint on it. So I just say any quarter-to-quarter there's going to be noise in it, but let's really focus on that full year to full year result because that's a little more of time particularly because we can't have lumpy books of business and activity in a particular quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And just to clarify, that 90% combined ratio target in the Insurance segment, that's on a calendar year including CATs and any prior-year development?","Gregory S. Hendrick","It wouldn't include prior-year development.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My first question, the expense ratio appears to have benefited from operating leverage. Is that a trend you believe will continue in 2013? I guess that's kind of a backdoor way of asking about the growth outlook as well.","Michael S. Mcgavick","Yes. So I would tell you that toward the end of the year and particularly in the fourth quarter, we did begin to see some lift from the relationship between expenses and top line for the first time. And that is because some of the investments that we've been making so heavily over the last couple of years are beginning to pay off. We expect that to be a more pronounced feature of how 2013 plays off. So I think you are seeing the initial signs of that. But as we think about expenses relative to growth next year, we think that should be a trend that does continue.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, in regards to the growth this quarter, I think higher retentions were cited in the press release. What type of a component was -- did that play in the growth?","Gregory S. Hendrick","For the year -- sorry, this is Greg. In Insurance segment, for the year, I'd break it roughly down new business both within existing businesses and in what I would call new operations, like construction and E&S, was about half the driver. Rate increases were about 1\/4 of the driver. And that increased retentions, a larger base of renewal -- retention are actually mix, depending upon which segments you're in, but over the whole book we are up a little bit. It was about 12% of that rest of that change. And the rest is a lot of other noise  that -- lots of them are small items.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, in regards -- there's lot of different names for this type of business, that convergence, I guess, initiative or -- do you expect to have that up and running by midyear? And any other kind of details around what the plans are for that segment with the new hire, Craig Wenzel?","James H. Veghte","I'm not sure how you define up and running by midyear. Craig has already joined us...","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess the announcement of side cars or whatever you guys are looking to do.","James H. Veghte","Well, we're not certain. And frankly, when we hire new underwriting teams, we don't push them to put business on the books because they've joined us. We've hired Craig because he's an expert in this area. And one of the things we want him to spend a lot of time on in the first 3 to 6 months of his tenure is to figure out where we fit into this environment and what the best products would be for us to go out in the market around it. So even if we don't have a structure in place by the end of the year, we won't consider this a failure. This is something that we are planning for in the long term. We think it's part of the capital landscape of this industry for a long time. And we will put structures in place when they are appropriately sized. And Craig, he got to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what the best way forward for us would be. So we don't have any current target date to put any structures in place.","Michael S. Mcgavick","The only thing I'd add into Jamie's exactly correct answer is that they can be -- they can come in to market pretty quickly. And it's not like we haven't been looking at these kinds of deals over the last several years, it's just that we've finally decided that we really did need to get into the space and wanted someone who is a market leader and thinking about it on our team as we did. So it could be that we don't do any next year. It could also be -- it could happen relatively quickly. It depends on how we feel about the specific opportunities that are advanced. And I really love the emphasis, we feel no -- under no pressure. We will do the right thing as they come along.","James H. Veghte","I do -- I'd add one thing, too. I do think we're ideal candidates to attract interested members of the investment community into the space. We've been in the property CAT business for 20 years now based on our origins with Mid Ocean Re. Our loss ratio is in the mid-40s. And I think there would be very, very few companies that could match that sort of track record.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to understand how are you thinking about CATs within your guidance of -- or within your target of the 90% accident year?","Michael S. Mcgavick","While we don't discuss it in precision publicly, we of course have an average CAT load that we developed based on the models and our recent experience. And that CAT load is built into the budget, and it's part of how we would expect -- when we say getting to a 90% combined, we think of that with the average CAT load as the core plug for what will happen in the year.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, good. That's how we actually model it. So 3-year, 5-year, 10-year average CAT load is between 7.5 to 10 points. So I mean, I guess I'll just -- my math would then mean that you're aiming accident year ex-CAT for the low 80s? Have to be, right?","Michael S. Mcgavick","Well, look, we write large accounts, large limit complex business. So you would expect that we would have the lumpiness that Greg expressed and that we would have meaningful CAT loads as a part of it. That's one of the reasons when we're talking about reinsurance, for example, we don't focus on ex-CAT numbers because we're in the business. And for large parts of our industrial business, that same is true. So yes, we would have meaningful CAT load in there, but we haven't chosen historically to get into the details of the CAT loads we view as competitive.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Okay, great. And the somewhat along the same lines, if you take today's -- or if you take the 2012 accident year, you're over 1,000 basis points away from the target. It seems that 100 basis points improvement is about $0.19 a share. So you just did $2 in earnings, $2 plus on the year. If you do another 1,000 basis points, that's another $2. That's $4 in earnings. Are you aiming better? Are you aiming for better than a 10 ROE? Or how do we think about it?","Michael S. Mcgavick","Well, I guess I look at it as steps along the journey. The reality is with the interest rates being where they are, those double-digit hurdle rates that used to look sort of like the least you would expect are getting very difficult to produce. So as I look at it in the near term, our fundamental objective is to get back to double digits. And once we're there, we'll see how far we can push it. But when you get to the kind of 90% combined, if you can run the 90% combined as we believe we can in our insurance operations, if Jamie and his team keep the kind of performance levels we've seen over the last several years on a blended basis, you get to the right kinds of returns. And remember that some of the capital that is now used surplus starts to get -- put to work through our growth over that same period. So you have to be able to kind of triangulate the growth, the declining combined ratios, stability in our expenses. When you get all those pieces in line is when it will produce the right kinds of ROEs.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then last one just on the same thing. It's just this trajectory, and we can see it coming through the numbers, I mean, it's happening. What is sort of the gating mechanism on speed at which you can achieve these targeted returns? I mean, I know you've broken out granularity in the business and stuff. So what's keeping it from happening, say, in 1 year's time versus 3 years' time aside from the weather being a bit of a wildcard?","Michael S. Mcgavick","I'll give you -- well, as long as we feel confident in our modeling around CAT loads over time, I feel very comfortable with ignoring the weather, if you will. Obviously, any insurer has to be thinking very seriously about the frequency of large events right now, and we are too. The good news is that most of the modeling organizations and certainly the additional work we do beyond what the modelers give us includes a real respect for recency. And I think that's the appropriate way to take into account what we're seeing. But as I think about the speed of improvement, we've seen over -- on a year-on-year basis, when you strip away all the noise, and I really like Greg's answer with regard to 1 quarter versus another. I don't look at it 1 quarter versus another. We love it when it keeps coming down. We don't expect it to come down every quarter. But if you put a ruler on over any 4-year period -- or any 4-quarter period, we expect to see real improvement. I personally have a view that it should accelerate. Why? Because we've been getting rate on rate. And that's the first time we've been able to say that in a long time. When you start seeing rate on rate year-over-year, you're going to get some improvement, especially as in many lines, we are certainly exceeding loss cost trends at this stage. That's very positive. The second thing is if you go back through the period in which we've had this more rigorous mentality around our underwriting operations, our fresh leadership in place, many of them are getting their second crack at their books of business on this renewal stretch. So you're going to get there first wave of impact because day by day last year we were improving the books through underwriting actions. That starts to compound itself. So these things should accelerate. I haven't established publicly, nor will I, any particular \"on this date, we will hit 90%\". But clearly, the trend is very positive and we believe momentum should accelerate if we remain focused, disciplined and grind it out.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, let me just add that this is really a question for me around rate adequacy. And Greg, you started kind of with that high-level look down. We do a top-down look at rate adequacy. When we run it through economic capital models and translate that back into a combined ratio, targets we get into that same 10% to 12% range -- 10% to 12% improvement range that you started with. We also measure it, although it's a building skill for us, we measure it from the bottom up as well in a number of our businesses. And a lot of that technology spend that we've talked about over the last 2 years is going towards making us better at building it from the bottom up, so account by account. But even that way coming up, it gets us into that same range of kind of 10% to 12%. How do we get there? How do we get to adequacy? It is a grind. It's not a fun word, but it is a grind. I believe that where the market pricing is going, we will get there in a couple of years in of itself, but we're not going to sit by here and contingently watch that happen. We're going to grind it and mix within businesses. So within a particular business where they're doing an exceptional return overall, winnowing out some of the parts of it that aren't performing well. And then we're mixing our business in total towards more profitable segments of the portfolio. So it's not just rate, it's rate and it's mix in both directions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on growth. That was pretty significant in the primary insurance operations this quarter. Did your new operations have some traction? And should we expect some sort of similar level of growth in the near future? Or were these some onetime items this quarter?","Michael S. Mcgavick","This is Mike. I'm going to turn it over to Greg. But to be clear, as he described in his introductory remarks, there were some pretty remarkable onetime experiences in this particular quarter like the one in risk management, the kind of one-off short-term contract that affected these numbers. But in general, should we expect to be growing and should those new operations be contributing? Yes. I don't think that will be the big defining moment. I think the rate beginning to accumulate, combined with some of our existing operations that have also been able to source some more attractively priced risk, I think that will be the main driver.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Vinay, at the risk of being redundant, always pointing you towards the full year rather than the individual quarter. Particularly though, to give you a little bit of color in the quarter, the normalized growth was just over 12%. About 1\/3 -- almost 40% of that was in new businesses coming online. We talked about, I talked about construction, E&S, political risk. About 1\/4 of it was in rate increases. And then there are just -- it's just the nature of the business we are in. They are quite often large transactions that can be lumpy, and so there are a whole number of moving parts that would take way too long to go into what makes up the rest of that particular movement in the quarter.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure, that's very helpful. The second is a numbers question. Within the Reinsurance segment, the operating expense ratio was really low. Should we be using the prior quarter's number as more as a baseline versus the current quarter?","Gregory S. Hendrick","There was a significant reduction this quarter principally around compensation, accruals, both in the annual cash plan and reductions versus 2011, in particular because some long-term incentives paid last year and didn't pay this year. As to whether we would use it as a normal run rate would really depend on where the bonus pools come out each year.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Right. So normally you would expect it to be higher than 10?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Slightly, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In terms of the last years of re-underwriting your commercial property book, do you have the right exposures you wanted to be in New York City commercial property now that Sandy happened? What are sort of the postmortems on this loss and your exposures?","Gregory S. Hendrick","So Josh, I mean, one high-level comment is always to be very careful both from a positive or negative standpoint to overreact to one event, right? It's -- you're looking at 1 point on a -- when you look at the CAT model in particular, you've got 1 point on a curve of 100,000 events. So you don't want to overreact one way or another. We are able to track our flood aggregates quite tightly. We have made a big push on that. So from the dimension of Sandy and flood in our exposure in New York City, I'm quite comfortable with those. In terms of the overall book, I don't -- we monitor across, not just nat cat but also across terrorism, earthquake -- I'm sorry, not just winds and flood but earthquake, terrorism. And all those things are well within our risk tolerances. So I think the mix of business we have there is strong, and I think the exposure levels we have are appropriate.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Let me try and ask this another way, which sounds completely different but really about the same thing. To what extent do you think that Hurricane Sandy will post rate increases to New York City commercial property and other lines of business as this storm is a storm with a payback?","Michael S. Mcgavick","So that's a different question. And there, I do think that Sandy was a very meaningful wake up call to exposures that are concentrated in these intensely urbanized areas. I thought our book performed -- first of all, it performed as we expected under such an event and performed well. And I think our underwriting teams had done a good job of thinking about our exposures, particularly in the flood and business continuation spaces, as Greg mentioned earlier. But I do think that there's going to be a number of rethought approaches to underwriting in the area. And I think we and our competitors are going to sort that out. Whether that will lead to wholesale price changes, I'm not so sure. I certainly think that it will lead to some reaction in the marketplace, and we're seeing that. I also think, to be clear, there are few lines of business that really made Sandy stand out, and I think you'll see very strong reactions to those. And I wouldn't be surprised, as the mayor and the governor have indicated, to see structural responses in the region that will also affect how one will approach rate over time. So to break that down a little bit, lines like fine art space [ph], those are going to get significant changes. And I bet there's differences in business practices that emerge as a result of the losses we saw. When you see the marine space, I imagine there will be differences in business practices and in structures than when those things are rebuilt than we saw before. So whether it leads to wholesale price changes, I don't think is exactly the right question. It will be what will be the changes in risk and how will we price those going forward. And I think that will require a lot of thought because it's going to -- it's not going to be a static game. It's going to be a moving game.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, it's been 3 months now I realized, probably right off Sandy there were no increases in terms of -- have these started to flow through? I mean, I don't know much about the artwork insurance market, but have you been able to reprice? Is this business going elsewhere if it's not meeting the price? What's been happening in the past 2 months?","Gregory S. Hendrick","So Josh, yes, in the property insurance market, this has definitely put a -- and particularly in the Northeast, put a floor under the pricing environment. It varies greatly by risk to risk and whether you're loss effective or not. In general, watching the market on property drive lower sublimits for flood, higher deductibles for flooding and some movement of coastal wind deductible. But this is in the large property space, right? These are large upper middle market or large corporate customers. Particularly, your question to fine art, a little early and not enough data points to make a strong standard point, but certainly anecdotally, from my conversation with the team, yes, we're getting rate. I think our team performed exceptionally well in Sandy, but we are getting rate there. I wouldn't want to put a lot of figures around it, but right now we're seeing more rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple questions. The first is I guess a year ago, you talked about an expense load that would impact your 2012 year. I'm wondering if you could talk about the -- are we talking about the investments really you are making. I'm wondering if you could talk about the level of those investments in '13 versus '12, if it would make it even more challenging or will it lighten up a little bit?","Michael S. Mcgavick","In fact, I almost did a run-on sentence in the prior question because this is the other piece you need to look to when you get to the ROEs we're talking about. It's not just what we can do on the underwriting side, but how the expenses now give us some operating leverage instead of being kind of a hill to climb every year. So I'll let Pete get into specifics but the short answer to your question, Jay, is the burden comes down because a bulk of this expansion has been made.","Peter R. Porrino","Yes, so Jay, what I'd say is we're not -- we're clearly not done in that space, but we do see a leveling off. And as I think about expenses for the next year, I see, I would call it normal expense growth that you would see, plus a little bit for some of the new business initiatives that Greg and Jamie have in mind. If I sort of look at in the big picture, I would see it in the low to mid-single-digit range, which certainly was less than what we told you we would do last year and what we actually did last year.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's really helpful. The other question is on the Life Re business. You've seen a number of transactions or certain companies have been able to greatly reduce or eliminate their exposure to run off businesses, Sun Life, Cigna. And the environment just seems to be getting better for those types of transactions. Is that something you could possibly do for your Life Re business?","Michael S. Mcgavick","Should I give you my phone number now? I mean, we have been actively open to proposals that could yield such an outcome for us. However, nothing has come forward that makes any sense. The book is performing as expected. And if it's a run off, it's a run off. So we'll just have to see what comes. But make no mistake, all on the call and any beyond, if you have a brilliant idea for that block of business and can do something more attractive than we can run it off, we're all ears.","Peter R. Porrino","Jay, this is Pete. Just a little amplification. I agree completely obviously with Mike. The other thing I would add is we do have conversations here from time to time. I would make 2 comments with a comparison. One, life reinsurance has got different set of obstacles to it than primary life business does. And the second one is our book, as you know, is based in Europe and that also has a complication to it.","Michael S. Mcgavick","So you can see how this works. I encourage all callers and then Pete says don't bother.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Greg and Mike, I'm just curious here. Greg, you mentioned that casualty pricing is up about 2%. And if I think about what the decline in interest rates have been over the last couple of years, I'm kind of struggling to understand why is casualty all of a sudden attractive? And why all the growth all of a sudden?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Well, Brian, so let me -- so the 2% was around international book, which I know it's sad somewhat to cheer plus 2%, but we've arrested a number of years of declining rates. I think if you're looking at the financial supplement, I'll let Pete and Steve add in here, part of the growth there is coming from lines of business in the casualty other for the year. I think it's about $200 million. The 3 biggest movers in there are the U.S. risk management business, which -- okay, it's casualty, but given the structured nature of that, I don't view it in the same way as being as hugely investment sensitive -- interest-rate sensitive as some of the excess casualty or the large limit casualty.  International upper middle market, which has a component of casualty and property to it, and our construction business, which has some workers' comp, some g\/l, but also some professional and property. And this is just a consistent thing. We've mapped those businesses by casualty class for a number of years based on the fact that when we started out with those, they were predominantly casualty. But that -- those 3 alone explain about 80% of that growth year-over-year. And, Steven, you want to add to that?","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then I wonder if you could kind of talk a little bit about you're seeing with respect to loss trend? Anything unusual going on?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Nothing unusual. For the full year of 2012, our 3% rate change maps to a blended overall loss trend of 1.8%. So not a large victory but a victory nonetheless. Generally speaking, short tail lines are ahead of trend, and long tail lines are trailing. And on a geographic basis, the U.S. book is getting rate ahead of trends, and the international book is lagging. You can -- always happy, and you'll take it when you're beating trend, but clearly that differential needs to keep growing.","Operator","The next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","We haven't talked at all about the lines of business that were considered challenging at the beginning of this year or described that way. Is it safe to infer that they're basically in line with the balance of the book now?","Michael S. Mcgavick","Yes, entirely. We don't think about them anymore. What we think about is that every part of our book has to perform well. And anywhere we're not getting the performance we need, we're going to put a lot of love and care and attention on it. And so we don't break it out internally anymore. It doesn't have any meaning. It's just kind of a thing of the past. But we do -- we can give you some numbers if you'd like, but I don't think it adds any insight to how we're performing.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, at the risk of open-door, but the business formerly in the challenged category, performed at an -- in the quarter ex-CAT loss ratio 96.6 -- combined, I'm sorry. Combined, 96.6 compared to 112.4 Q4 '11, and 96.5 for the remainder of the portfolio. For the full year, which I have always said is the more important one, the ex-CAT -- the accident ex-CAT combined ratio was 99.3 compared to 113 last year and 98.3 for the performing portfolios. So 5 of the 6 businesses experienced the fourth quarter accident ex-CAT improvements. And that's it, we're done breaking them out.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I don't remember if it was Peter or Greg that talked about adverse development on excess and surplus lines. I was hoping to get a little more detail on that.","Peter R. Porrino","Sure. Greg, do you want me to...","Michael S. Mcgavick","We have our Chief Reserving Actuary here, too, Susan Cross. She is the best to answer that question. Sue?","Susan L. Cross","Right. So the development that we experienced from the quarter on the excess and surplus line portfolio was $50 million. And that is concentrated in 2 specific portfolios, an apartment book and New York contractors. And that we've experienced more notices and a longer period of reporting than what we had previously assumed.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Let me add, you also heard me talk about growth in E&S, which I know it sounds somewhat contradictory, if you look at the $50 million. It is a completely different book. I think we've talked about this before that it's a brand-new management team. We have added expertise in railroad. We've added expertise in properties, something we didn't have before. We've completely re-underwritten to almost the point of extinction the 2 books that Susan mentioned. We've added auto capability and excess -- and umbrella capabilities as well. So that's a whole different book of business going forward, just to be clear why I note the growth in it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jamie, would it be possible just to understand how much of the low frequency of large losses impact the loss ratio in the Reinsurance segment in 4Q? And just one follow-up.","James H. Veghte","The delta from Q4 '12 to '11, roughly 13.5 point improvement, 6 if it was from the CAT. And the reason is that we assess our IBNR requirements for the benefit of the information on actual CAT activity through the year. During 2012, the level of smaller CAT events has been significantly lower than past years and lower than 2011, in particular. So we reduced the loss ratio for this business during the fourth quarter, even though it really was attributable to activity during the course of the year. In effect, it's a true-up based on the sort of that target pick relative to the actual.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So better to think about the full year kind of number as ...","James H. Veghte","Exactly. The New York CAT-loss ratio this year was 35%, last year was 71.6%.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, Pete, one question I was wondering. From what we've seen so far this quarter, we've seen AOCI marks have been mostly negative. So I was a bit surprised that you're bookmarked up in the quarter, and I realized it's hard to kind of speculate why yours zigged when everybody else zagged. Is there any granularity you can give us on why that -- what might have contributed to somewhat of an unexpected outcome?","James H. Veghte","Sure. I think our portfolio probably is a little bit different because of the European Life book that we have. I would say that probably contributed the vast majority of that surprise to you.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. And then you said or could you give us an idea of how much capital is supporting that Life Re business?","James H. Veghte","It's in the Fin Supp. We disclosed both the GAAP capital. And since last quarter, we also disclosed in essence to get into the statute -- the regulatory capital as well.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Last one, real quick. Satellite loss in the quarter, is there any -- do you know if we have exposure there or if you have exposure there?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Mike, we don't talk about individual losses. We do -- we are an active participant in the satellite market on the insurance side. We have roughly on average of 3% to 5% market share of a given launch. But we then buy reinsurance, protected it for about 50%. So that gives you hopefully enough color to put a box around it.","James H. Veghte","Mike, so you don't have to look it up. It's in the Fin Supp Page 22. It's about $2.2 billion of GAAP, net assets, and the regulatory would be about $1 billion.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Why do you think that the rate outside the U.S. has been so different than in the U.S.?","Michael S. Mcgavick","I think -- this is Mike. I think there are couple of factors that affect us internationally, and particularly in Europe. Number one is culturally, the insurance buying process there has a larger expectation of continuity than we would see in the U.S. market, where there is much more responsiveness to fundamental economics. So there's just a cultural difference that I think makes achieving rate a more difficult task in the European market. I think the second thing you have to look to, and this is an area where there's opportunity for us, is that Europe is under tremendous pressure. So if you're a risk manager in Europe, you are working like the devil to try and lower your cost of your operations to your company because the economy there is providing such a bleak and difficult outlook to you. And this means that's what's really important for us is to work with those risk managers. And we're often the lead on these programs. So we're in the position best able to work with them. Not so much to gain rate but gain rate per risk. So try to restructure programs so that they can actually lower their cost, which may yield the result for us that looks like decline in premium, but may actually be better structured in our own eyes in terms of the rates per risk that we're taking on.","But the 2 characteristics that I would cite are the pressures they're under economically over there, combined with the kind of the continuity culture that drives the renewal process.","With that, I'm going to turn over to Greg for a more specific answer.","Gregory S. Hendrick","I'd only add one thing to Mike's answers, which is quite often again, we're in the large corporate, upper middle market space. Most of the business is quite often what is referred to as trophy accounts. So in the market, they are big-name clients that everyone's -- that carry large premiums relative to whatever else is bought and sold in the marketplace and the competing insurers want to have on their roster of insureds. So that's another dynamic where you have a fewer number of insurers to draw from. And the large ones where we are particularly specialists in get quite competitive with the local carriers.","Michael S. Mcgavick","That's one of the reasons we called out the progress we're making in terms of early indicators on rate this year. It's a small sample size relative to the book because we're really pressing our folks. And we feel they've done a -- given those difficulties that we've described, we feel they're doing a really nice job, and we're standing behind them 100%.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Unrelated question. There's been a lot of talk that the securities market is sort of absolutely here to stay in the property CAT business, [indiscernible] financial issues the CAT bought. Do you think that this is -- I guess what's your opinion on whether or not this is a sign that profitability is somewhat capped in that business now?","James H. Veghte","I don't know whether it would be capped. I certainly think like any business, the law of supply and demand are going to have an impact on things. And there is a tremendous amount of capacity available on that market, both traditional and nontraditional. So I think by definition, there's liable to be some impact on rate levels. But I do believe that third-party capital is going to be a component of this business for quite a long time. The level at which it participates in the market will depend probably on interest rate levels and other opportunities that these sources of capital have invested.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Do you see this as kind of a fundamental change in the market or not?","James H. Veghte","I beg your pardon?","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Do you see this as sort of competition just from another source as opposed to a real change in how the market dynamic is working?","James H. Veghte","Yes, I mean, we think it represents about 15% of the market now. That's probably going to ebb and flow over time. I think the days of automatic startup pure equity-related entities after major losses may be different. Next time you might see ramping up of third-party capital that can participate directly into the market rather than that. But it is liable to go up and down over time, depending on the broader investment environment.","Michael S. Mcgavick","This is Mike. I'd add a couple of other thoughts. I certainly think that where you suddenly, to get into a harder market, it would take the top off of that move because you'd have people -- in current conditions, you'd have people flooding in. But you have to remember, part of this is the tremendous pressure these managers are under to find new sources of opportunity. The rest of the investment world just looks so bleak. So that's one piece that we don't know how long that piece lasts.","And another piece that we think about around here is, it's one thing to have it happen in times like these. But if you ever got into a big set of losses, I'd be curious to see how many folks are really in for it 100% of the time when big losses are over and over. So as long as it kind of bounces along like it is, I think what Jamie said holds true. But there's a lot of volatility that could come into that market, and we'll see how it performs after that. That's why I think the fundamental traditional reinsurance market is going to continue to have its place. It's just going to have this additional activity that will be a part of the market episodically, and that's fine, and we intend to participate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Just hoping to clarify some of the -- a couple of earlier things I'm still a little confused on. So on the expenses, Pete, I just was looking at the overall full year P&C expense ratio. And in 2010, it was 31. In 2011 it was 31. In 2012 it was supposed to go up and it was still 31. So I guess my question is, is 31 just the right rate? Or was this year's 31 under what you would've planned, and this is going to be higher than that going forward?","Peter R. Porrino","So I would say, 31 is what we planned for this year. I'd say the expectation is, as Mike and Greg talked about, is that it is going to go down. It's going to go down because of the operating leverage that we are putting in place at the company. Our rate of -- obviously our rate of expenses are going to grow I think pretty significantly, less than our business is going to grow down the road. You will see that accelerate with time.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it, great. And then on the capital buffer question, maybe I'm oversimplifying it, but the simplest way to look at capital buffer being steady is to say you'll buy back earnings minus dividend?","Michael S. Mcgavick","We'd never put it in exactly those terms, but that is -- that would be the simplest idea. However, you have to remember growth. As we grow, some of the capital is consumed by that growth.","Peter R. Porrino","I think we've said -- Ian, this is Pete. I think in the past we've said that it depends on your mix of business. But certainly you can easily get to where 40% of your growth in business as a capital charge.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it. And then just my last one, Peter, the affiliate income this quarter is about $31 million. I'm just curious, do you consider that a normal quarter, a really strong quarter? I'm just trying to get some sort of sense of where run rate is for those businesses?","Peter R. Porrino","We would put that slightly above our expected run rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So we talked about -- I think, Greg, you mentioned growth in U.S. casualty is from the risk management, upper middle market in construction. I was curious, is this for you guys more of a cyclical story, so competitors raising pricing and pulling back and creating these opportunities, or are these some of the strategic growth initiatives from a couple of years ago? And if that's the case, are these businesses for you guys structurally attractive? Sort of remind us sort of how do you think about them?","Gregory S. Hendrick","These are certainly strategically important businesses to us. And the one you picked, U.S., the U.S. risk management for the primary casualty business. I mean, this is a great product to cross sell from our existing customer base and also to attract new customers, and then we can then cross sell remaining products to them. Construction, E&S, primary casualty, political risk, inland marine, those are all businesses we've talked about in the last 2 years. They're all very well-planned out and really very strategic for us. I do think like any other underwriter, I'm always fond of a market dislocation. I wouldn't call the U.S. risk management space that you particularly observed completely dislocated, but there certainly is some movement around in that area. We're looking at it closely. We won't do anything rash. Where we have an opportunity, we'll take advantage of it. It does put a little bit of lumpiness into the premium figures because they can be large gross and premium transactions. So I'm optimistic, but I wouldn't want to convey it to you as a raging dislocation.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's an interesting color. Jamie, I was waiting for the follow-up. One final question -- maybe there'll be others, but on convergence, you mentioned the point that there were 2 large programs places aggregates[indiscernible]. From a distance, that feels like a big move by the seeding carriers to try to put traditional reinsurers at a bit more level playing field with collateralized players. Is that one of the primary drivers of this, or am I just imagining sort of too much[indiscernible]?","Peter R. Porrino","No, I don't really think so. I think there has been such a frequency of CAT events over the last couple of years that they're trying to protect themselves against that, rather than play one part of the market against another.","Gregory S. Hendrick","And, Josh, I'd just add, this is Greg. I'd just -- from XL insurance perspective, we're going to be looking at that same trade-off of currents and aggregate for ourselves to -- for our own protection. I think it's just a good risk management principle to follow, to consider the kind of coverage.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right, and obviously you are not just a reinsurer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Most of it, asked and answered, but one thing is the question on D&O. I feel like a year ago, there was maybe more chatter about kind of more claim activity as a follow-through from the financial crisis. And I suppose there has been this LIBOR issue, but I'm not hearing that from this conversation or in the financials. And it sounds like you're growing on the other side of the equation. So is there still claim activity that come from the financial crisis? Or are you not seeing it, it is hitting others? Or how is that body of risk developing?","Gregory S. Hendrick","So there's a number of pieces in there, and I'll give you a high level, and then let Susan, who oversees the reserving if she wants to add anything in particular. Let me start with LIBOR, which I heard you mention in there. LIBOR continues to be an emerging topic. I know it for myself and probably for you as you asked the question, it's unsatisfying to say 9 months after we start talking about it that the original news coverage arose that it's an emerging topic, but that is the reality of it. We don't know how many institutions didn't follow the guidelines. We don't know the exact culpability of the particular insurers. And we don't have a full feel yet for how it's going to break between what's exposed to U.S. versus international legal standards. As a reminder, the standard D&O coverage for public companies excludes regulatory fines and penalties, Side A responds only if a company cannot indemnify any individual director or officer. And we have a good strong spread of business between Side A, D&O and E&O for financial institutions. We believe that any LIBOR exposure would be covered within our current reserving levels. If you're wanting me to step back now and say some of the other older events, let me turn it over to Susan because she spent more time in that area thinking about those reserves.","Susan L. Cross","Sure. Randy, I would just say that the reserves that we have established for the subprime and credit crisis events really are holding up very well. And some of the older claims are reaching that level of maturity that actually in Q4, for the first time, we actually released a portion of reserves from the 2007 year related to the subprime event. So we're very comfortable with the reserves that we have established. Those claims are developing kind of much to be expected, if not more favorably. And we did take some action in Q4 in that regard.","Gregory S. Hendrick","And I think I've heard in there as well around where we see the market. And certainly we're observing, on the whole, that there is a reduction in class action activity. But there is an increase in some of the M&A-related, what I would call, legal expense, which really is really hitting primarily layers. So when we talk about rate increases, we're seeing that 9% we had in December in the U.S. professional, it's a very different number for -- much higher for the primary book of business and a lot lower for the excess book of business. So you're seeing the reality of the shift at least in the last few years from less big cases -- less big numbers to kind of smaller claims or eating away at the lower primary layers.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","If I was going to kind of bottom line it, at least for XL, because I know you can't speak to how other firms are managing claims and setting reserves, it sounds like you are slowly kind of chewing through the exposure from the financial crisis, just working its way into the numbers. It seems like we're going to hear a lot more about it if I thought back 1 year or 2, and it's kind of disappearing in. And so is that a fair statement for XL?","Michael S. Mcgavick","Yes. I think it's the right way to think about it. But remember, this is just a very slow developing set of claims and activities. And so it'll, as you said, bleed in over a long period of time. But our view of it is that the environment for professional is actually getting better, both in terms of what's going on in the claims side and in terms of what's going on in rate. And that gives us a lot of good feeling about the future for this line of business.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ryan Byrnes from Langen McAlenney.","Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney","I just have one last one left over. In the property-casualty net investment income, I think last quarter it was a little lower than expected. I think there were some onetime items due to some tips in RMBS. But it was -- in the fourth quarter, it was I guess equally as maybe a little bit lower than expected. I just wanted to see if there were any onetime items in there.","Peter R. Porrino","I'm sorry, the fourth quarter -- so this fourth quarter of 2012?","Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney","Yes, versus third quarter of '12 in a net investment income.","Peter R. Porrino","Yes, so that one I would say the fourth quarter '12 we would say is more indicative of a go-forward run rate than the third quarter was. There were some -- we talked about it on the call, some reasonably large adjustments negative for some -- for our tip securities. This quarter, they were a very small positive. This quarter, they were a very small positive, right? And so if you're thinking about going forward, I think Q4 is a better starting point, of course, taking into account what we've disclosed as the $3.5 billion leaving the portfolio and being reinvested in that a much lower yield.","Operator","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.","Peter R. Porrino","This is Pete. Just one clarification for an earlier question that came up on our insurance combined ratio targets. One thing, I -- just one clarification that might have been obvious to everybody but me. But when we talked about that 90%, we're talking about that as fully developed. So it doesn't include PYD for past accident years, okay? But if we do what we believe we do, which is be very prudent in the way that we set our reserves, okay, you need to let that develop out to open it.","Michael S. Mcgavick","So with that -- this is Mike. I just want to thank everybody again for taking the time on this call. I know it's getting late in the evening here in the New York area. But I just want to observe that this was a very positive year for XL. It's a real turning of the corner for us, operating this book of business. We feel very good about the insight we've gained, momentum we've gained, but we're very humbled. We know this is a very hard business. There's a lot of small things done every day by 4,000 people around the world that produced this improvement, and that can produce the future improvements that we expect. And while we're not yet the XL we dreamed of, we can see where it is, and we feel very excited to get there. And we'll work with the kind of urgency you have a right to expect in the coming year.","Thank you very much for your time.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines."],"22840":["XL Group Ltd (NYSE:XL) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David Radulski - Director, IR","Mike McGavick - CEO","Pete Porrino - CFO","Paul Brand - Chief Underwriting Officer","Greg Hendrick - Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations","Analysts","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Brian Meredith - UBS","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Meyer Shields - KBW","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny","Ryan Tunis - Credit Suisse","Randy Binner - FBR","Ryan Byrnes - Janney","Operator","Welcome to our conference call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","David Radulski","Thank you Shirley and welcome the XL Group Limited's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.XLGroup.com. We posted to our of website several documents, including our earnings press release, this afternoon and a press release this morning regarding our realigned P&C operating model. You'll also find there our quarterly financial supplement and presentation slides we'll refer to in our call. On our call today Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer, Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Mike will make some comments on our realigned P&C operating model. Then we'll open it up for questions. ","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. And a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made. And we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. ","Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our website and in the earnings release included as an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing third quarter 2016 results. With that, I'd turn it over to Mike McGavick. ","Mike McGavick","Good evening and thank you for joining our call. Tonight I'll share some highlights from the quarterly results. Pete will discuss the financials. And then Paul and Greg will go through the insurance and reinsurance segments respective. And then I'll come back to make a few comments on our realigned P&C operating model and some related role changes which we announced this morning. We will then open it up for questions. ","As I commented in the results press release, this is the second quarter of solid progress and seeing the power of the business that we're building emerge in the numbers. I see five solid trends that demonstrate how we're doing the right things and especially the right things given the difficult market conditions in which we operate. First, as Paul will detail, our submissions have gone up both in quantity and in the variety of risks we're asked to look at. This means our trading partners like doing business with us and want to do more. This is a reflection of our successful combination. ","Second, our underwriters are doing the really tough work. And it is hard for them to find adequately priced risk. This quarter our reinsurance book was the driver of some growth in a somewhat bottoming pricing environment. And our insurance book, when you take out the noise created by underwriting actions, also showed modest growth year over year. So our underwriters are doing the right stuff. But you only see modest growth as a result of their efforts and even these greater submissions, because it is so tough to find risk that is appropriately priced. That is exactly what a good underwriting company does in times like these. ","Third, despite multiple years of pricing deterioration, our loss ratio continues to improve year over year. Now, I know it ticked up a bit in the third quarter relative to the second. But with a book like ours, we do not find this meaningful. Paul can get into that with a little more color. But when you look at it year over year we see significant and sustained improvement. ","Fourth, our expenses continue to decline, as we have said they would which taken together with our underwriting actions is producing our overall improved combined ratio. And then fifth, we continue to repurchase shares in line with what we told you we would do and I'd say with some opportunistic flair. These are the five things you should be expecting us to do, given market conditions. And our numbers bear it out. ","So turning to these results. Excluding the Catlin integration costs of $55 million, operating earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64 and operating ROE, excluding unrealized gains and losses, was 6.6% for the quarter. Our P&C combined ratio in the quarter of 93.1% was an improvement of 2.2 points from quarter three a year ago. That's where the expense and loss ratio improvements are coming through.","Our P&C top-line growth of 2% year over year was largely driven by reinsurance where, as I mentioned, we're finding a few more opportunities. But insurance, when you take out the noise, also showed underlying growth of 2% in the quarter. So we see this as good progress that we can continue. ","Before I turn it over to Pete, two other items of note. A comment on the recent hurricanes. And a few thoughts on our innovation efforts. First, Hurricane Nicole while not financially significant, obviously was near direct hit to Bermuda. Ad when you are a Bermuda-based Company, this of course makes it very personal. Happily our people fared well and the Company had minimal disruption and the Island and its people once again demonstrated their tremendous resilience.","With respect to Hurricane Matthew, it is early in the process. To give some meaning the that, you can understand that this is a difficult claims environment with regard to wind versus flood. Moreover for us, it is even more complicated because as a large commercial property underwriter there may well be some pinpoint losses covered by commercial flood insurance added to what we're observing in reinsurance. But with what we've seen so far and with both sources of loss in mind, we'd estimate a range of between $100 million and $2 million of loss -- and $200 million of loss. And although it is early, there is nothing that we've seen that is giving us any surprise. We will make a pre-announcement as things clarify further. ","Then as to innovation. I want to emphasize this because quite remarkable when you consider all of the other things going on, these difficult and intense operational objectives of ours. First, as we'll talk about later, we had news today about Paul Brand and the new role he will be taking in leading our innovation effort. He'll have a small team, some of which is already recruited, to push us forward faster. I think in retrospect this will be seen as a very important moment in the history of our Company. Second, our XL innovate efforts continue to bear more and more fruit. You'll see more and more announcements about the new innovations we're pushing into the market and new investments we're making. ","Finally, then there is our relationship with Oxbotica, a leader in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence which has taken off. And we're actively at work with them in some very exciting new projects teaching us about risks in these new autonomous systems, the Internet of Things and how we can think about potentially using dynamic pricing. We see our innovation efforts as maturing, not just in the many citations for productions Introduced which we've always enjoyed, not just in the many new pricing models at work in the Company, but even in these even more fundamental and potentially revolutionary ways.","We're proud of the way our underwriters are working our way through this market. We're excited about our progress and the way these trends indicate that more progress is at hand. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete. ","Pete Porrino","Thanks Mike and good evening. Mike shared with you the improvement in our operating net income per share versus the same quarter last year. We achieved this even with significantly higher catastrophe losses in the third quarter than we had in the same quarter a year ago. Our natural catastrophe losses net of reinstatement premiums for the third quarter totaled $97 million or 4.1 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $31 million or 1.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. The 2.2 point improvement in our P&C combined ratio versus the same quarter last year was driven by improvements in the operating expense ratio. And Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail. ","As David mentioned, we provided several slides this quarter in addition to our normal materials. These slides are a response to the numerous requests from investors and analysts that we provide further clarity of our view of our ongoing business. Slide 5 details the improvement in the third quarter 2016 earnings per share compared to last year. Slide 6 pictorially shows what we disclosed in our June 8-K on expenses. ","If you could turn to slide 7, we provide a normalized view of our nine-month operating ROE excluding net unrealized investment gains that includes adjustments to reported results for timing differences and for naturally varying elements of our results. We start with our operating ROE excluding net unrealized investment gains. The first adjustment is to simply exclude integration costs which are nonrecurring. The next adjustment is to annualize our preferred dividends, most of which are incurred in the first and third quarters.","The next three adjustments use the Street's consensus view at the beginning of 2016 for key areas of volatility. We have chosen to normalize using the Street's consensus view to avoid making qualitative adjustments and to use information produced by the investment community. This is not an endorsement of the Street's consensus views. We simply obtain the Street's consensus for each column for the full year, multiplied it by 75% and then subtracted our actual nine-month result and then tax-affected it. ","The adjustment to prior-year development has been included to reflect that we conduct in-depth reviews of our reserves only twice each year. And as a result our prior-year development does not emerge equally by quarter. The next two adjustments to our affiliate assets and catastrophes are an attempt to normalize for naturally volatile parts of our operations. With these adjustments, our annualized ROE for the first three quarters of 2016 would be 8.6%. I know this slide has limitations, but I hope you'll find it responsive. ","Operating expenses improved compared to both the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2015 as our ongoing integration and synergy benefits take hold. Our estimates for operating expense levels for the rest of this year and next year remain in line with those provided in our 8-K filed in June, except for an estimated additional $10 million in one-time integration costs in the fourth quarter of this year due to the change in our insurance operating model. As is our normal practice during the first and third quarters our reserving process is based on a review of our actual versus expected losses. Our semiannual full actual review will be included in next quarter's results. ","Prior-year net development in the third quarter was a favorable $54 million or 2.3 loss ratio points for the quarter, compared to net favorable development of $28 million or 1.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $23 million in the insurance segment and $31 million in the reinsurance segment. As detailed in our financial supplement, our estimated operating tax rate exclusive of discrete impacts has declined to 8.5% reflecting the geographic distribution of our underwriting profits. Fully diluted book value per share grew by 1.6% in the third quarter and by 9% in the nine months ended September 30. ","Turning to the investment portfolio and as usual my comments will exclude the life funds withheld assets. Net investment income was $171 million compared to $179 million for the prior-year third quarter and $176 million in the second quarter which as I mentioned last quarter was somewhat elevated for a few nonrecurring factors. Net investment income will continue to remain under pressure given the current low interest rate environment and from lower cash flow as a result of our share repurchase program.","We have approximately $3.5 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the third quarter our average new money rate was 1.9%. At the end of September the gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio was 2.3% and the duration of the total investment portfolio remained at 3.3 years. ","Total affiliate income was $25 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior-year third quarter. All categories of affiliate holdings contributed positive earnings this quarter, although the absolute returns from our hedge fund portfolio remain disappointing. Despite that, we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk-adjusted returns over time. Unrealized net gains were $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The total return on our investments was 0.7% for the quarter in original currency. ","And with respect to capital management, we continued to execute share buybacks during the third quarter. During the quarter we repurchased 6.6 million shares for $222 million at an average price of $33.61 per share, leaving $594 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. For the nine months we have purchased 26.2 million shares for $905 million at an average price of $34.54. As I've noted before, this rate of buybacks represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April as well as an acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and expect to continue share buybacks at a more modest rate for the rest of the year.","Now I'll turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results. ","Paul Brand","Thanks, Pete. This evening I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management. First the results. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.3% compared to 97.2% in Q3 2015 and 96.4% last quarter. ","Higher cat experience of $71 million, of which $28 million is related to prior quarter cats, compared to $7 million in Q3 2015 was more than offset by prior-year reserve releases of $23 million, by material improvements in the underwriting expense ratio of 2 points and a reduction in the accident year ex-cat loss ratio of 1 point. On an accident quarter ex-cat basis the combined ratio was 93.3% compared to 96.3% in Q3 2015. If we look at the first three quarters, we reported an accident year ex-cat combined ratio of 93.6% compared to 95.3% in 2015. ","For Q3 we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.4% compared to 13.2% in Q3 2015 and 13.7% reported last quarter. This continues to be in line with the guidance we provided in Q1. This slight increase in acquisition ratio is more than offset by a Q3 operating expense ratio of 18.3% which was 2.2 points lower than Q3 2015 and by a net accident year ex-cat loss ratio of 61.7% which was 1 point lower than Q3 2015 and is the result of the reunderwriting work we started last year. Pricing was slightly better at minus 1.3% for the quarter and minus 2.6% for the full year. ","Our casualty lines were up 1%. Our specialty businesses were largely flat, with the improvement in our accident and health lines offset by continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines. Our professional businesses were down 2%. And our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%, once again driven by energy and North American property.","Insurances gross premiums written in Q3 were down by 2% or $47 million on a reported basis year over year. And when we normalize for foreign exchange, down less than 1% in the quarter. However, when you also consider the portfolio of [indiscernible] activities that started in 2015 where decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses, we continue to see growth in the 3% range for the business we like on a year-to-date basis. This underlying growth demonstrates that whilst the market remains difficult, our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction into finding new profitable opportunities.","As Mike mentioned, we continue to see plenty of new business opportunities. Our submission flow is up 8% and our quote ratio is up 5% with our top brokers. So we're seeing more business that we like. However, our conversion rates are down nearly 4%, clearly reflecting our underwriting discipline given the market. ","For the insurance segment, seeded premiums written in the quarter were $538 million compared to $536 million in Q3 2015. This represents 25% of GPW compared to 24.3% in Q3 2015. As mentioned previously, the seeded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance program and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing. And as a result, the written session ratios can and will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. ","As mentioned in the previous quarter, it is essential that we react to top-line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter we selectively exited another 15 positions for a total of nearly 90 positions so far this year, as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across the segment. While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflected in the quarter, additional savings will continue to flow through in subsequent quarters along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway. ","In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continue to grow the underlying book. And made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And as we finalize our business plans for 2017, we fully expect this momentum to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus. ","And now to Greg to discuss the reinsurance results. ","Greg Hendrick","Thanks, Paul. Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results. The reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 86.5% compared with 91.2% for the third quarter of last year. The results of the quarter experienced favorable prior-year development, lower accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio and an improved expense ratio. Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $31 million compared to $35 million a year ago.","As Pete noted, the third quarter is not a full valuation quarter and reserve releases were driven by properties classes of business. In particular, our loss from last year's Tianjin explosion reduced by $7 million. And estimates for a number of small catastrophe events were lower. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios. ","The reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 54.9% which compares to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by the Tianjin event last year, offset predominantly by a handful of medium-sized non-cat losses, as well as a smaller impact from a change in mix of business and market conditions.","Catastrophe losses totaled $26 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared to 23 in the third quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter resulted from a number of small events as well as developments from the Texas hail storms in the second quarter. Offsetting these events, we reduced our estimates of the Fort McMurray fires and Japan earthquake from last quarter. ","Expense ratio decreased 3.9 points to 32.1% in the third quarter compared to 36% for the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies continue to earn through. Further, we saw a 1 point drop in our acquisition expense ratio, as the impact from purchase accounting continues to diminish. ","Turning to top line. Gross written premium for the quarter was $566 million, up from $459 million in the third quarter of 2015 with the increase driven by new business and share increases. As we have discussed in prior quarters, XL Catlin has received strong support from our clients and brokers. We're pleased to see that support show up in the top line. This growth was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we non-renewed or reduced shares on nearly $60 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms. On a year-to-date basis for the combined portfolio we have grown just over 7% after adjusting for foreign exchange and multiple-year premiums. ","Shifting to market conditions, we found the pricing environment challenging but rate decreases continue to decelerate in most lines and regions. And as noted last quarter, we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business. During the quarter rates across the segment were down approximately 2%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 4% this quarter and 5% for the year to date, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015.","The remainder of the property security book, rates were down 2.5%. And our casualty business renewed flat over last year. The remainder of our classes were flat to down low single digit. U.S. short-tail and global casualty treaty placements continue to struggle if terms and conditions were aggressively pushed at renewal. ","In summary, the third quarter results were respectable for the reinsurance segment. As the market reaches a bottom in many classes we're well positioned to succeed, as our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job growing profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. I'll now turn it back to Mike. ","Mike McGavick","Thanks, Greg. As you saw this morning, we announced a realignment of our P&C operating model. And I want to quickly walk you through this news. If you go back to when we brought the two companies together, we combined XL and Catlin into a classically matrixed insurance organization to take advantage of the best of both prior operating models. And we knew that when the time was right we'd take a step back to adjust for what we were learning about the organization and to be able to even better respond to the marketplace.","Much of this now announced realignment started with observations from Paul Band and Kelly Lyles earlier this year. And on top of their minds was to have a model that accelerated and deepened our innovation successes and responded better to the market by streamlining decision-making and getting the business as close to the customer as possible. So as to innovation, Paul will be taking on the new role as Director of Accelerate, the new internal innovation team. I'm extraordinarily excited to see what they will produce. ","Then there are other changes to the operating model itself. The most obvious of which is that we're bringing together insurance and reinsurance into one P&C organization under Greg Hendrick's leadership. We will, of course, maintain all of the appropriate governance and separation required between the insurance and reinsurance operations. But we feel that by working together at a high level under the same span of control we can harness the power of that adjacency for our customers' benefit.","Solutions are clearly blending. And we want to be in a position to lead these developments on our clients' behalf. Having led insurance and reinsurance and having been instrumental in developing our long-standing strategy, Greg is clearly ideally suited for this new role. ","Then another key learning for us has been the instrumental role country and territorial leadership plays for us around the world. You'll see that in the new model, our P&C business groups are supported by four key capabilities, one of which is client and country management. And Kelly Lyles, who as you know is currently our Chief Regional Officer for Insurance, will become the Chief Executive Client and Country Management who will be responsible for our global broker relationships and for ensuring that we have strong leadership in our key geographies. Kelly will report directly to me and to Greg and will continue to be a member of our Group Leadership Team. You can find a much more detailed breakdown of the new structure and the names of who will lead within it in what we released this morning. ","We firmly believe that this realignment will create a more efficient, responsive and profitable business. While the announcement is new, this is something we have been contemplating for some time. Although there are people impacts, they will be very limited among a handful of senior positions. We will still have some people, who we're really excited about, move on as there just aren't as many roles in the new model. We're proud to have worked with these people and we wish them l the very best. ","One more topic. You would have seen an 8-K this afternoon that I'm going to be selling some shares. And I can understand that this could be misinterpreted in two important ways. First, that I'm somehow less committed to my job. Or second, that I believe this is somehow a good price at which to be selling. The opposite is the case in both respects. More than two years ago I decided with my family that my commitment to XL was open-ended, that this wasn't going to be just some turnaround gig but a mission far greater and longer than that.","As a result, I made some broader financial plans, the last part of which was to sell some shares. Happily for XL, but not so happily for my personal plans, before I acted on selling, the XL Catlin combination talks heated up. This is the first time since that I have felt comfortable taking this long delayed action. ","That said, I fully expect to be kicking myself next year over the price I will have to accept. But I am simply past the point where I can wait, given what I put in motion two long years ago. And I want to emphasize that even after these sales, XL shares will remain our family's largest single asset by far, as it should be. With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A. ","David Radulski","Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. First question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. ","Kai Pan","First, congrats and best wishes to both Paul and Greg for your new roles. My first question is on the core loss ratio in both insurance and reinsurance segments. Could you quantify any sort of large non-cat losses during the quarter? How did they compare year over year? And if you stepping back, where do you want these core loss ratio in your segment going to be in order to achieve like double-digit ROE for the entire organization? And how do you get there? ","Paul Brand","This is Paul. Certainly in this quarter we saw slightly higher large losses and that accounts for the slight deterioration in loss ratio as you look sort of quarter to quarter between quarter two and quarter three. Now, we're not overly concerned about that. We're not seeing a pattern. As we look at the sort of underlying development of the book at the more normal losses, that was very favorable. So we're seeing year-on-year improvement, but just a few slightly larger losses this quarter. ","Greg Hendrick","And for reinsurance I'd point you back to -- what I wanted to do is share a little data with you from the last five years. When we look back five years, granted it's a mix of XL and then XL Catlin. Because we've talked about, we've put the loss ratios all in the same level for the combined book. I think it's a relevant set of numbers. I think the mix is not that different through that time period. ","And we'd observe for Q3 anywhere from 49% and 58% for an accident year ex-cat loss ratio with a 54% average, right around 54% and a bit where we're this quarter. So I think we're in line. Those are driven by reinsurances, not a heavily attrition driven loss ratio. It's a number of small, mid and sometimes large losses. I think we had a little bit more this quarter than we would normally expect, but nothing outsized. And I believe strongly that the new portfolio is diversified reinsurance and able to withstand more of that activity. ","Mike McGavick","And Kai, first thanks for your gracious comments towards Paul and Greg. I'm really excited about their new roles as well. You also asked sort of taken as a whole, does this mean anything relative to our ambition to be delivering double-digit ROEs and how would you get there. A couple of comments. Number one, I mentioned these five trends. The idea that we're getting more flow from our partners and we're even seeing more business that we'd like to write. But at this point in the market find it difficult to actually write more. So that flow is a very good sign of our position in the marketplace today. ","The second thing is, we're finding some growth. As I mentioned for this quarter, in essence the overall was 2%. If you then went back and normalized for some of the reunderwriting activities in insurance, we actually had growth there that was positive. And then third, I talked about the fact that the loss ratio year over year, the underlying loss ratio has declined. And while there has been some higher large loss activity in this year which the market's been talking about, we've been talking about, we've been largely, not entirely but largely able to absorb that as we've gone along which is a sign of the greater resilience of this book of business.","Fourth, I talked about expenses and the fact that we're meeting those aggressive targets that we have laid out to the Street. And we expect to continue to do so. Fifth, of course I talked about capital management which has been very significant in this year. And continues to improve the E against which we work. ","If I take those five together, that is where some of the progress toward this objective comes from. But there's two additional things that come into play next year that isn't evident this year. Number one, we will have worked most of those larger reunderwriting actions through the book and they will no longer have the same negative impact on our loss ratio that they continues to have today. We're always doing a little bit of reunderwriting, but those actions we took in 2015 were a very significant dimension. And we finally get them largely through the book of business and they won't have that same negative loss ratio drag. ","Second, we also will be away from the negative top-line drag that those activities have created. And I would hope that then next year we'll actually see the growth that our underwriters are able to find come through into the numbers. Those are two more accelerants that are added to those five trends as we get into 2017. I know you want me to conclude that with some table-pounding forecast. I'm not going to do that.","Our budget is still in the works. The Board has not yet adopted it. But I like what those trends imply about our ability to continue to expand margins. And as we finalize the budget, I'll have more to say about what that yields in totality. But it's clearly trends that work in favor of what we've said we will do. ","Kai Pan","And then follow-up on the capital management. You said in the past that this year would do $950 million at least. You had done more than $900 million which implies only $50 million. Are you going to do only $50 million for the fourth quarter? Looking into 2017, will they fall back to the $175 million per quarter run rate going forward? Thanks. ","Mike McGavick","You've hit two of the questions we were most expecting. So well done. First of all, we will likely exceed modestly what we've talked about so far. So it won't just reduce to kind of $50 million. It will moderate, but it will clearly exceed that for the balance of the year. ","With respect to next year, it's a bit premature, right? We haven't adopted the budget, as I mentioned a moment ago. And that work finalizes in early December in work with the Board. And that's why historically, as you know, we have commented and given some directional intent around both share repurchases and around expenses at that end-of-year call kind of three months from now. That's still when we'll give you more guidance. Now, on expenses, there's no more guidance to give.","We've already talked about the expense levels we're going to achieve and we're going to achieve them. The only direction that could change is if somehow we forecast a lot lower revenue, then we could probably drive them even lower. I don't at this point expect that. ","Second, with respect to share repurchases, a couple of thoughts. One, there's nothing going on that would indicate we would do any less than we originally intended to do last year. I would find it very hard to imagine the circumstance where it would be lower than our initial guidance. And obviously we continue to feel that this -- that XL is fundamentally under-priced. And as a result we've been more opportunistic this year as we've had opportunities to do so. I would like to think that somewhere between those two is, I would think, where we might come out. It's a bit premature to say. I'm still bullish on how share repurchases fit into the entire story. We'll give more precise directional observations when it comes to the end-of-year call. ","Pete Porrino","Kai, it's Pete. As we think about the actuals for the year, I can tell you that through October we're at $950 million. So from the $905 million to the $950 million was for the month of October. I think that's sort of a reasonable run rate for the rest of the year. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. ","Josh Shanker","So thinking about where things are right now, you talked about that next year there would be no more impact from the reunderwriting. Are there things you can say right now that you know that you could not be doing in this quarter as a standalone Company? That there's evidence today for an investor that this merger has worked? Can you recount in some ways improvements that you can see that are here right now? Is that reasonable? ","Mike McGavick","Yes, Josh, let me comment on a couple things. And let me start at the highest level. Given their history and given their scale, there is no way that the expense savings that have been achieved to date and will be achieved by the end of 2017 could possibly have taken place without the combination. And given how the soft market playbook works, as it were, expenses become more and more important as the soft market grinds on. So that is the first and most obvious and tangible benefit to shareholders. ","Second, we did not expect as this combination was created that the pricing environment would become so dire, especially in specialty lines. That took us off guard. There is, again, no way that the prior separate institutions could have fought through with the success that they're having in creating, again, when you clean out the reunderwriting effects some modest growth. That wouldn't have happened. Each franchise would have been weaker.","You wouldn't have seen this lift in submissions. The opportunity to see more and to try and pick your way through this market was greatly enhanced by the combination that we have made. And I know and I say this every call, you have lots of contacts in the broker community, the market community, you know that that's true. And we go to all of our meetings and we hear it time and time again.","A part of how we've been able to achieve that in a way that doesn't lose underwriting control is we've been able to up our relationships with existing clients with proven track records. That couldn't have been possible for each company independently before because it was only through bringing the firms together that we had both the greater capital base and the greater diversified capital base for those counter-parties to trust our continuing growth with them. So in each of those cases, Josh, we're talking about things that were made possible by the combination. ","Josh Shanker","Can I interrupt you for one second? There's an irony there, that even if you had anticipated the soft specialty market you still should have done the deal because the combination of the two companies is allowing you to resist the trend. ","Mike McGavick","Precisely. ","Josh Shanker","Is that right? ","Mike McGavick","That's exactly right. ","Josh Shanker","Okay. Continue. I just wanted to make sure that I understood your point. ","Mike McGavick","Each enterprise separately would have been weaker and more at the mercy of this difficult market had the combination not taken place and would have had more difficult expense challenges with less scale with which to address them. So from my -- you caught me right toward the end.","By the way, that diversified balance sheet gave rise to a greater opportunity for capital management as well than independently I think you would have seen from either company. Moreover, we're able to better absorb patterns of larger losses, as we have seen this year. In every one of those respects, this firm is performing better than the separate companies would have performed in the same market conditions. We didn't foresee it. We didn't do it because we saw it coming. We did it because we thought it was the right thing to do. Greg has an expression that I quite like. ","Since this is a largely U.S. audience I can use it. I find it difficult to recreate around the world. From an underwriting talent point of view which was the key objective to aggregate that talent and to put it to work for our clients and for our shareholders, we've really got a lineup like the 1927 Yankees. This is the most powerful collection of the specialty and market-leading thinkers that you could gather, but it's like we've assembled that talent and then there was a players strike, that is the equivalent.","They can't do everything they could do because the market conditions are what they are. And in the end, maintaining our discipline in this market which the various statistics that Paul walked you through is exactly what they should be doing. And I can't tell you how grateful I am for the work they're doing, because they do it in miserable conditions. Over and over and over you get told, well, we'd love you but you just didn't match this crazy price someone else gave you. And then they've got to go do it again and do it again. It's hard danged work. And they're doing an excellent job of it. Greg, you've got some--. ","Greg Hendrick","Josh, because I think at the top you asked for some specific observations. One is, we're seeing opportunity we would not have seen as independent firms in the reinsurance. And I'll let Paul talk to the insurance side. We just wouldn't have seen as large participations with clients that don't go out to the broad market. You see it coming through in our Q3 growth.","I want to make sure I point out. Remember, reinsurance is a lumpy, lumpy business. So that's not to say that the growth we had in the third quarter is now embedded in there going forward. That's not the case. We do see more and more of that. You'll see that coming through in this quarter. ","We've gotten more focused on client management. We're seeing more business from the clients we like and know than we used to do in the past when we were perhaps not quite as structured about it as independent firms. I think Mike touched on the diversification point. You don't see it in the fin sub, but If I look just at the other line in reinsurance, in the fin sub, you'll see a pretty good set of growth there. That's because XL wasn't in credit and surety. XL Catlin had built a good business around that. And Catlin wasn't in health reinsurance. And we were in health reinsurance at XL. So as you bring these two books together, they're just a much better, diversified more stable pot of business. ","Paul Brand","Just to add on to what Greg said, I think the client proposition is very much stronger together than it would have been separate. And we're really working in that area to build out on that. Another area is we just lead more business. I think being at that top table as you're getting into the difficult conversations about how to retain business and how to win business, we're in a much better position to be able to increase our share on the business that we like than people who are further down, particularly in the subscription markets. So I think it's absolutely clearly created value. ","Josh Shanker","As you guys prepare your budgets for the coming year and think about 2018, the industry itself, how much of an ROE headwind is the industry going to face in 2017 versus 2016 and whatnot? Do you have a budget for where you think trends are going? ","Mike McGavick","Well, I'd only comment a little bit on the general pricing condition trend, because I think that's the one that we -- when we face two headwinds, all of us together. We face a soft market headwind together. And that can be variable according to any particular mix of business. But that is a common across-the-board theme. And we face this interest rate environment in common together which puts so much more demand on the underwriting result. So both of those, I don't see huge change coming in either one. You never know. But there's nothing that's happened that would forecast that. ","So let me walk through kind of the pricing environments and our attitude toward it across the two books. In reinsurance, as Greg said, we've seen a bottoming out. If you've been following the news out of [indiscernible] for example, where this a lot of reinsurance contracts being discussed, you're seeing a clear change in attitude from the market side of the equation. And you're seeing a lots more pushback in terms and conditions. You're seeing no more, that's enough. You're just seeing a different attitude in very public display. And I think that's very encouraging and I would carry that further to the large commercial marketplace. ","We look at global program type business, we even saw one of the leaders of one of the buyer associations in Germany publicly say that the conversation had to become more balanced in the interest of our carriers. When they start saying that, a community that usually is talking you down all the time, that just tells you there's something new and different going on in the marketplace. I don't think it portends a turn, but it is a change that is clearly going to moderate the downward pressure in some areas. ","Now, there's some like energy, aviation, where it's just hard to understand what's going on. So I do believe that all competitors face that pressure in common. I don't know exactly how to translate that to an ROE headwind because it differs by how the companies respond to it. For us, we've been cutting back writings in those lines where competition has gotten ridiculous. We don't have a broad one size fits all attitude. We have a lot of sophistication in how we do pricing. And we're able to be very clear with our clients kind of where it just becomes something we can't do. So we do that client by client in conversation. ","But if we look at aviation, if we look at energy, if we look at some of the marine areas, those are clearly areas where we're going to have less writings because our underwriters are at a point where they can't tolerate what's going on. There are other pockets where we can grow. And so I can't make -- I can't translate it to an industry effect. I can tell you what we're doing. And so far, as you see by the improvement in the loss ratio year over year on a sustained basis, we're seeing that strategy play out to our benefit. ","We're fighting off these headwinds which were present last year and accelerated at the beginning of this year. I feel okay about that. I really can't put myself in the other shoes because I don't know how their mix of activity and repurchasing and all that. I just know what our trends are. I can't speak to theirs. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. You may ask your question. ","Brian Meredith","Mike, a couple questions here for you. First one, with respect to the reorganization that's gone on and some of the displaced people that you mentioned, are they client-facing? Is there a risk that there could potentially be some lost business here as a result of the reorg? ","Mike McGavick","No, I see that as very unlikely. Look, in our insurance operations which is where -- if the reinsurance operating model is essentially the same, you take that out, you replace Greg and move on. There's a lot of stability there, a lot of history there. But on the insurance operations which is where the meat of this is, we're really talking about at the very top level a few people and at the next level a couple handfuls. And they aren't -- while they are market-facing in the sense that they have presence in the marketplace, they are not the people conducting daily transactional business. ","And in fact, one of the primes of why we made this change and how it works is the daily transaction level is practically unaffected. So tomorrow they're working for the same people. They are answering -- it's just -- but what there is, is there's a simplified referral process, in essence. There's less hands with different points of views injecting themselves into that process. That should speed up decision-making and make it simpler, both for our people and for the market to know where to go when there's a little bit of hair on the risk, as it were. And that -- in a soft market that comes up more, frankly.","So having that simplified should accelerate how we make decisions and should have a positive impact in the eyes of our brokering community and partners. So we're already seeing greater submissions. This could enable us to work faster and better and maybe even see that stimulated more. ","The final bit is that country management piece. In essence if you stepped back, we had put in a pretty heavy regional structure. This lightens that regional structure some, but it empowers more that country level management, because that's where we saw the real lift. That's where we saw that work with the relationships. And so those people that were -- we were actually seeing some growth because of them. For example, in LatAm, two operations there in Mexico City and in Brazil, I happen to have been in both offices over the last few weeks. They're off a small base, but they're winning awards for their responsiveness in the marketplace.","And we're seeing kind of 80% type growth rates off those small bases because of this newer local presence. That we've enhanced by this and taken off some of the upstream requirements so we can make decisions faster. So no. I'm sorry for the long answer, but this is really important to us. No, we don't expect that at all. ","Brian Meredith","Just a quick kind of numbers question here for Paul. Paul, I think last quarter you said that seeded ratio for the insurance would be 33% to 34%. That would basically imply that you're going to have a pretty high session rate in the fourth quarter. Is that still true? ","Paul Brand","I think it's actually likely to come in marginally less than that, I think, for the fourth quarter. ","Brian Meredith","Okay. ","Paul Brand","It's going to start with 30% but it won't be as low as 33%. ","Operator","Our next question comes in Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Jay Cohen","A couple of questions. You referred to the drag you're seeing this year or the impact you're seeing on the loss ratio because of some of the reunderwriting activities which are still working through the book. I'm wondering if you can put a range around that, how much is it hurting the loss ratio this year? And then secondly, with the restructuring and some of the personnel departures that you'll have, is there sort of an expense benefit that will come through, even if it's modest? ","Mike McGavick","So let me start with the last one first. No, these kinds of redesigns were anticipated as we were putting our expenses together. So it was a little bit different than we expected. It was a little bit more top heavy. That's the reason for the $10 million extra in integration cost in the quarter. But in general it was in direction -- in furtherance of our savings objectives. It doesn't add to it.","The second, with respect to a range on the drag, I'm looking at Susan Cross who is sitting across from me, our Chief Reserving Actuary. I think a proper range for that would be something like a little bit more than 0.5 point, something in that range. ","Jay Cohen","And that's for the whole Company or is that just the insurance segment? ","Mike McGavick","That would be for the insurance segment. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask you question. ","Paul Newsome","I was hoping you might be able to sort of dumb this down for me and make sure I know how to think about this. This is really a question that refers to Kai's questions about getting to a double-digit ROE. As I look at your Company, it looks like the reinsurance business has a really very good combined ratio. The insurance business is maybe a little bit of improvement, but really dramatically not more -- the low 90%s is really a pretty solid combined ratio for that business.","So that seems to leave only two more levers. And I'm excluding investment income because it is what it is. That's your corporate expense and the operating levers that you use to get you to an ROE. And it seems like those are the two pieces that if you're actually going to get to a really solid double-digit ROE are what you have to pull to achieve that. Is that right? ","Mike McGavick","Paul, I don't know if I -- I certainly would never dumb something down because everybody on this call is damn smart. I walked through those five trends, all of which are meant to address the belief we have, the absolute belief we have, that we can continue to expand margins in our insurance operation. And I mentioned two accelerants that come into play more next year that were not present this year. ","So we'll get a fuller benefit of the growth that our underwriters are able to create. And we'll get less of a drag, as was just discussed, on the loss ratio due to that reunderwriting activity. So those are meant to directly address that we believe the insurance combined ratio can improve from here and that we can fight our way through the obvious negative effects of the pricing environment. So first that. ","Second, we have been very aggressive on the E side of things through our share repurchases in this year. As Pete mentioned, we're already at $950 million. And I think the way anyone reasonably listening to him would say and that's going to go up. And as I answered Kai, we see something certainly better than our of initial expectation for this year and perhaps up to what we did do this year. So you're talking about a couple of levers that move things meaningfully in the equation it is you're trying to solve for. And we're starting from what is, as Pete laboriously described in great detail, what is something like a normalized [indiscernible].","And we'll see what the fourth quarter, ex-Matthew of course, produces. So we see the -- so if you were looking at it from our shoes, if you believed that the combined ratio in insurance could continue to come down, if you believe that overall expenses including corporate expenses would continue to come down at the levels that we have described before and if you believed you could get a modest bit of growth into that more efficient model, you would say to yourself that's within range, exactly how more to describe that. ","I've told you I'm not going to pound the table today. I haven't finished the budget. Pete's got a couple thoughts to add. But we're getting there. And we're pretty pleased with our progress. I don't know what else to tell you. ","Paul Newsome","I guess what the answer it seems to be is that it's about the insurance operation, it's about corporate expenses, but it's not so much about operating leverage to make that-- ","Pete Porrino","So Paul, this is Pete. Let me just a couple things. And again, we're not -- this is clearly not going to be walk to a 10% ROE. The numbers that we put out in that slide were for the nine months. And everyone knows that we had not a very good first quarter. And so the run rate of last two quarters are certainly better than the average for the three quarters. ","The second thing is, I wouldn't just think about the corporate expenses. The way we think about it is, we need to do better on, I will call it, the loss ratio and commission ratio together with the technical ratio. And then we look at the overall expenses, if you look at what we said we were going to do it's about a $70 million improvement year on year. So that's 0.7% right there. And then since our expenses are in essence locked at this point in time, you talk about leverage, it's ultimate leverage.","So for every $1 of premium, extra premium that we write, one minus the technical ratio falls to the bottom line. So I do think that there are levers there. But again, this is not to try and walk you to a 10%. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Your line is open. You may ask your question. ","Amit Kumar","Two quick questions, the first question is on the level of reserve releases in the quarter. I noticed that reinsurances was higher than insurance. Could you just add some more sort of thought as to where did that release come from and if there was anything impacting the release numbers this quarter? ","Greg Hendrick","It's Greg Hendrick. In the reinsurance the quarter's a very what I would call mechanical process. It's very property driven. It's responding to what we've actually observed on the ground in the quarter. There isn't -- absent any bad news that we would react to quickly on the casualty side, it's really a property driven quarter.","As I pointed out, there was the take-down on Taijin which we felt was prudent given the way the losses are being paid out. And a handful of other catastrophes that were proving to be -- have more reserves than he needed as losses got paid and we got towards closure. There wasn't -- to me it was same as every quarter I've done for the last 15 or 20 years here at XL with the reinsurance book. ","Pete Porrino","And then Amit, this is Pete. The only thing I would add at the beginning of your question, reinsurance is almost always has historically a higher reserve release than insurance. So this again was not a surprise this quarter. ","Amit Kumar","The other question I had was just based on the level of, I guess, growth in the reinsurance. And I know you talked about the budget still being in the pipeline. Should we expect, I guess, a different level of outward reinsurance for 2017? How should we think about that? ","Paul Brand","We're clearly trying to optimize the reinsurance program, putting a lot of thought into that at the moment as we speak. I would not anticipate a remarkably changed seeded ratio as today. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. You may ask your question. ","Meyer Shields","Pete, one quick question for you. I think today you reiterated your guidance for operating expenses based on the June 8-K. Does that take into account the foreign exchange shift that we saw, I guess, right after the Brexit vote? ","Pete Porrino","Right. So just to put that in perspective, it's a great question, Mayer. So the third quarter benefit was slightly under $10 million. So really not much of a number there. It looks like if the exchange rates hold up it will be slightly more than that in the fourth quarter. And if you look at where our expenses are running, you would see if you sort of normalize a fourth quarter, you would probably see us coming at sort of more towards the bottom of that range rather than the midpoint of the range. The difference there would be the FX benefit. ","Meyer Shields","Okay. And the same, I assume, would apply in 2017, assuming no changes from here? ","Pete Porrino","Yes. ","Meyer Shields","Okay. Second question, you've talked a lot about submission activity. And I'm wondering whether, if you look at your business mix now or maybe look forward a year when the reunderwriting is done, is there a greater or lesser exposure to what we call these large losses? ","Paul Brand","We're not looking to particularly enhance the exposure to the large losses. If anything, I would imagine that it might marginally reduce. The book is becoming more diversified as we've pushed it together. So yes and I think that we're constantly trying to look at the portfolio and think about how can we, using data and analytics to essentially have better insights on likely places for margins. That's tending to not sort of lead to vast increased lines. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question. ","Ian Gutterman","I guess to start, an easy one, Pete. You said with the tax rate was in operating for the year. What was it for the quarter? It seemed like it was pretty low. ","Pete Porrino","Let me open it up and get that for you. It was a little low. It also had the impact of the discrete items in there as well. Just give me one sec. So the quarter was -- I got that right here. I actually don't have it right in front of me, Ian. I'll get it to you in a minute. ","Ian Gutterman","Okay. I guess for Greg. I guess I'm having a little bit of, what's the word, dissonance, I guess, right, about the reinsurance growth rate. On one hand, you guys talk about how tough the market is which obviously makes it a difficult period to grow.","On the other hand, you talk about the new business model and the opportunity it's giving you to grow. I'm just struggling to understand what's good growth versus what's growth I should be skeptical about. I know you talked about it some earlier. Is there any more detail you can give us about what's driving such strong growth, not just in the quarter, but really for the year? And maybe specific examples or lines of business or as opposed to me just saying, it's big growth in reinsurance, it must be at 100? ","Greg Hendrick","Sure, Ian. Look, there isn't one market, first of all. Not everything in the reinsurance market is at a very low return level. You've seen cat experiences in a couple of countries around the year and in last year and you're seeing rates respond to that. You're seeing casualty in general starting to flatten out and really renew same again year over year.","There isn't one big bad market out there. The general tone of it across it is not great, but there is pockets of opportunities. I would say the folks on the ground have been going really hard at making sure they find those, focusing on the clients that we know because we trade with them already in other areas. I think that's the biggest thing is regards to who we're going after and the business there. ","The growth rate's going to be lumpy. It was 23% in the quarter on gross written. It's 7% for the year when you adjust for FX and multi-year. So there's just -- it's never -- we're not growing at 23% on a per annum basis. That's not going to happen. ","But we did have a couple of opportunities. In this quarter, one of them was to expand an existing relationship we had with a credit customer, another couple were around motor or auto covers which have a slightly higher combined ratio but also a lower volatility and less downside to them. They came up, they were offered to us. ","We believe because of our new presence in the marketplace and we took advantage of them. There may not be any of them in the fourth quarter. We're trying hard to find them all the time and do it the right way. But they don't always come up in that same quarter-to quarter fashion. ","Ian Gutterman","Got it. Maybe one follow-up on that part, is obviously the part I struggle and I'm guessing most of us on the call struggle with, is how to model the benefit of that. It's not like it's a short tail so I should improve my accident year because there's a positive mix and because you said some of the stuff is longer. You said less volatility. Should I be able to see the cat lower in in the reinsurance segment come down a little bit? Not that I can see your [indiscernible], but if I could see it, it would be better? If I could see your budget, I guess, where would I see an improvement? Would it be the absolute combined? The cat loads? The capital allocated? What are sort of the metrics, I guess? ","Greg Hendrick","As I think about it, Ian, I think you're not seeing a huge amount of improvement in reinsurance. What we're able to do by piecing these opportunities together is we're able to maintain the margin that we have today. That's really how I think about it. In the particular example I gave you, our credit book runs at a -- it's a lower loss ratio business than the average. The motor's a little bit high. When you blend them together, you're coming back to this. That's why I cited the last five years of third quarter accident year ex-cat, you're in that 50% to 58%. We're at 54%. ","We're basically counteracting kind of what's tough market, some tough pricing by blending in these new pieces. I wouldn't point you to there's going to be a dramatic improvement in accident ex-cat [indiscernible]. If the market turns and we have a lot of opportunity to lift and get that kind of growth in a major way, you would start to see a lower -- I would believe, a lower accident year ex-cat loss ratio -- I'm sorry, accident year ex-cat combined ratio on the expense side. This is really -- it's piece by piece. You don't have my budget. No one's approved it yet. So we're still working on it. ","Ian Gutterman","Fair enough Mike, can you just, again, I know you talked about this earlier too. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the innovation initiative? What I mean by that, it's a little bit of a similar question. How do we measure whether that's successful or not? Is it -- what's sort of the tangible deliverable, other than press releases about things you're doing? Is it we're going to -- is it if something comes along that's the next ASI? And is a big win in the portfolio or is it something that translates into better growth and margins in the core underwriting businesses? How do we evaluate whether this initiative is doing well? ","Mike McGavick","Let me give you -- to be honest, over time we're going to work on many more metrics around this. So given that it's still, I wouldn't call it early days but relatively early. I think it's -- I think you're right to ask. We need to give more thought to exactly how to present it to you. Let me give you some examples. ","First of all, yes, to your first question, are we always hunting for more ASIs? Sure. We don't make a lot of those kinds of bets, but in those bets we get a couple of benefits. Number one, we get, we believe, attractively priced reinsurance opportunities. Because of the strategic relationship we're able to negotiate differently on the terms of reinsurance. And we find that a very attractive method to, in this difficult market, add to our reinsurance writings. And then you get the potential.","That kind of -- that tends to lessen the risk of whatever investment might be associated. And then you get the potential upside if the investment proves wise as well. So we like both of those. We don't take a lot -- we're not a spread shooter. We're very targeted on things that are related to things we have expertise or things that we want to learn about and we get that benefit. ","The second thing we get is we get eyes on, hands dirty experience with some of these new and potentially disruptive insurance models. We get to learn how the technology works. We get to learn whether it works. We get to learn whether the promised innovation is real. And we get to think about what application that might have for our businesses. And because of the way we negotiate these, in some cases we have even rights to increase our ownership or to use technology. There's different elements of how we negotiate each one of these. So that's a second benefit we get. ","The third one relates to our pricing insight. We have been actively and I'd say somewhat quietly, building models to gain pricing advantages. We all know that when you are an early adopter in modeling, you get a double lift. You not only get the benefit of your model, assuming it's right and ours have been uncannily effective, but you also get the benefit that those things that you turn away for reasons that others aren't able to analyze can actually lead to some adverse business building for them. So we get a twofer out of that. ","I'm not ready to talk about it. Others like to talk about this a lot. We actually kind of enjoy the quiet effectiveness. We have a number of these models up, running and adhered to across XL. And over the coming years I think it would be right to put some metrics around that for you to understand better. So there you get loss ratio lift. And we have a meaningful portion of the book now getting that lift from that activity. ","And then fourth, we also where we innovate, we get to invent markets where we're lonely in our competition which is rare in our space. But I'll give you an explicit example. You heard me talk about it before, but it's worth mentioning. That's new energy risk where we built an MGA MGU, created an entirely new product for it. We're the first to market in it.","We had much less cost to building that out because the brokers didn't have expertise to contribute. It wound up in a weaker position in the transaction and therefore extracted less fees. And in the end we're now writing about $75 million of that. And at this stage, I'm touching all the wood I can find, there's been no losses on that business. And it is growing. In fact, we're working on some adjacent products that we're hoping shortly to be rolling out. ","Whenever you're able to do something like that, you do so with less of this crazy competitive environment that we've all been talking about. You're doing it -- you have a lead position. You're able to run ahead. That's where I think what Paul is taking on, what we're doing with Oxbotica, all of that, that fits in that category. XL innovate, a part of what they do is what I talked about first, but a part of what they do is this too, where they are entirely reinventing a business model and leading out with a new product that we think is very hard to imitate. We run with -- obviously people try, but they can't because they haven't spent the several years deep into the science which we do. ","So that's why the Oxbotica relationship is one I call out specifically because it is teaching us things that we know are coming and that we believe we can lead because of our deep understanding of the science behind it in creating the insurance products that people are going to need. That kind of thing really gives us a differential lift in the marketplace. So yes, you're right. It's tough to measure externally, particularly at this point. I brought it up because it is now at a maturing point.","And we believe we will need to get in front of you and give much more definition to this, a way for you to think about it. But I think that those who are not -- we aren't the only one doing some of these things. I think we're doing it with a coherence and a practicality that is starting to show up in our numbers. And I'm looking forward to talking about that in greater depth in the future, Ian. ","Pete Porrino","Ian, on the first question, again, the operating tax expense for the quarter excluding discretes was 4.7%. ","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. ","Ryan Tunis","I just had one that I was hoping you could help us with. I'm not even actually sure if you can. In the reinsurance segment, I guess over the past couple of years there's been that fairly large accident year true-up in the fourth quarter, I guess associated with a lighter catastrophe year.","Can we say, I guess, when you layer on Matthew and all the cats we've had year to date, I mean, is there any way you can definitively say that we shouldn't expect that true-up at this point, just based on what we've seen year to date? Any help, I guess, just in thinking about the fourth quarter, that would be helpful. Thank you. ","Greg Hendrick","I'll do my best. Unfortunately the reality of this is always experience will dictate in the fourth quarter what's going to happen. I go back again over the last five years, we've seen roughly speaking about on average across those five years, an 8 point improvement in the fourth quarter accident year ex-cat combined -- loss ratio relative to the first three quarters. Why am I talking about accident year ex-cat when you're citing cats? It's because as I said last quarter, our non-large cat losses, so those small attritional cats, are recorded as accident year ex-cat in our numbers. ","Those are to reflect the fact that there's seasonality in the exposures and that as a reinsurer there's a lag in information. We're usually behind as you get these events reported and particularly on your pro rata proportion treaties that you're getting information quite often in arrears. What it will be this quarter, I don't know. Because we'll have to look at what the quarter activity is and see how that exposure goes. But that's what the history has yielded in the past. ","Ryan Tunis","I guess just one follow-up would just be on the Hanjin bankruptcy. And I guess anything that you guys know there or in terms of your exposure or how you're thinking about that at this point. Thanks. ","Paul Brand","We don't normally give details on specific losses. To be clear, there is some exposure. It is developing. People are talking about some essentially loss of use exposure to containers which have been mislocated. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question. ","Randy Binner","I just had a cleanup question real quick. This kind of goes back to what Meyer was asking. On the integration expense schedule, I guess, that was laid out in the 8-K earlier in the year, you outlined how FX changes could kind of affect how that comes in. But is there anything else that could materially kind of throw that off? We have kind of a level of expense a little bit lower than what we saw in the third quarter and the fourth and the first going into 2017 and then really dropping in the second. What could change, what could accelerate that, what could push it out at this point? Because to me it seems the sum of all these comments, it's kind of in the bag. ","Pete Porrino","This is Pete, Randy. The biggest variable there would be variable compensation, other than the FX. We're getting into the fourth quarter and we'll see how that quarter develops. But I would say that is by far the biggest uncertainty that we would have around expenses for the rest of this year. And then that would also hold true for next year as well. ","Randy Binner","These integration -- if it's comp based, so that wouldn't affect the first half 2017 expenses as much as it would the fourth quarter, right? ","Pete Porrino","Right. So I was talking about fourth quarter. I'm not talking about integration expense. The integration expenses are really independent of that and I thought you were talking about the entire expense load--","Randy Binner","No, I'm thinking more of just -- sorry, the Catlin integration expenses because those start to wind down. They kind of go away in 2017. That helps the rest of the earnings profile go higher. I'm just trying to figure out what could throw that off. ","Pete Porrino","I'm sorry. I misunderstood the question. There is not a lot, other than if for some reason you did something more intense around people, where you would have people impacts which we're not expecting. Other than that, I don't see a lot of volatility to that number. ","Randy Binner","And a bigger people move would probably be in reaction to a revenue change which you're not seeing right now? ","Mike McGavick","Right. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Ryan Byrnes with Janney. You may ask your question. ","Ryan Byrnes","Just had one question. If I look at your presentation, one of the biggest kind of deltas from the sell side to actual numbers this year has been affiliate income. And if I look kind of the past six or seven quarters since you guys sold ASI, it's kind of averaged around $20 million. And again, this quarter came in at $25 million. I guess I'm not looking for a run rate going forward, but is this $20 million to $25 million, does that seem right what we've had the last six quarters post ASI? Or is there something else that I'm missing there? ","Pete Porrino","I think we did lay out in the slides, we did lay out sort of to give you the last eight quarters which would give you a good average to work on. I think we would hope that we could do a little bit better than the numbers that you threw out. But that really is dependent on -- the biggest variable there are the investment affiliates -- not the investment, the manager affiliates that we have that -- whose returns are really dependent on how they do on performance fees. That will have a lot of variability to it. But we do hope that we will do a little bit better than those numbers. ","Operator","Thank you. At this time I'll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks. ","Mike McGavick","Great. Just very briefly. Today was an exciting day to announce the changes with respect to Paul and Greg and to start streamlining and making this place work even better. We're really excited about these changes. But I want to put it in a little more context. In a speech I remember from 2012, we talked about innovation and how you go about getting innovation in an existing industry.","And we emphasized that you had to be willing to take your best minds and take them out of P&L process and put them on innovation or else you weren't going to get there. And the example I used them of a decision we felt very heroic about and very good about was taking Greg Hendrick out of his highly profitable job running our cat book in Bermuda and putting him on the strategy for the Company, the reinvention of this Company. We felt that was a great decision then and it has led to subsequent successes that give us great confidence in his role as the leader of all of P&C. ","And you see us taking that playbook out again with respect to Paul and the opportunity to take one of the sharpest underwriting minds any of us have ever met and set him loose on bringing these maturing activities to greater impact throughout our book of business and into the future.","When we have a confident and great set of hands like Greg to lead the resulting P&C operation and a mind like Paul's set loose on innovation, we see this as a day we will remember in future years as one of those moments when XL really took on the next level of opportunity. It's an exciting day for us. We look forward to the future. Thank you very much for the quality of the questions on the call. And good night. ","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David Radulski","Thank you, Shirley. And welcome to XL Group's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement.","Please note that we have now new information to provide you regarding our proposed acquisition of Catlin Group. Public information regarding that transaction, including the offer announcement, press release and investor presentation, is posted on our corporate website and to our transaction specific website, xl.transactionannouncement.com.","As noted in the offer announcement, U.K. Takeover Code does not apply to Catlin as it is a premium domicile company. However, due to provisions with respect to the U.K. Takeover Code and Catlin\u2019s bylaws, the parties have agreed to certain matters regarding an application of the U.K. Takeover Code to the potential transaction. As you may have encountered with other M&A transaction, this put significant constraints on the party\u2019s statements which we hope you can understand.","On our call this evening, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who\u2019ll offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and John Welch, our Acting Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements, including those with respect to XL and a proposed transaction of Catlin.","These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 8-K, the factors identified in the investor presentation, as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Mike McGavick","Good evening and thank you for joining our call. As you are all well aware, it\u2019s been a noteworthy few weeks for us and with more news just last week regarding further consolidation, a really interesting time for the market as well.","I'm sure you will have some further questions regarding the Catlin acquisition during Q&A. And I will just say here at the top of the call that, well, our planning for the integration with Catlin continues and is on track. We have no further information on this subject to provide at the time. As David has noted, the focus of this call is XL's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results.","2014 was a strong year for the company, continued the harder and progress we have been delivering and positioning us incredibly well for our exciting next chapter. Starting with our P&C results, our combined ratio of 88.2% was our strongest performance in more than 15 years and a significant improvement from the 92.5% achieved in 2013.","Our P&C loss ratio improved 5 points from 2013 to 57%. It is a particular note that even in this difficult market our gross premiums written grew 5% year-over-year to $7.8 billion.","We achieved the total underwriting profit of $676 million, a 50% increase over the prior year and for the second year in a row we achieved a double-digit ROE, 11.2% for the full year, excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments.","Results in the quarter itself were equally as positive. Our ROE in the quarter was 13.7% on the same basis, the quarter combined ratio of 84.5% and loss ratio of 52.3% were also among the best quarterly results in the last 15 years. Underwriting profit in the quarter was $219 million, which was a 116% increase over Q4 2013.","Now, of course, like most of the industry, we were helped by an extremely low catastrophe year. But that does not diminish our -- at all, our overall sense of the enormous progress achieved since we put this current strategy in place.","For example, we all know that in the last few years this end of the year call has been filled not only with our share of cat losses, but other large loss activity that has brought down our full year results.","Now we know that both positive and negative for duty will have its -- also always have its place in this business, but we believe are better balanced, better underwritten and better position book, as you will hear from Pete and Greg is shining through.","From a segment perspective, we are proud of what our underwriters achieved in the year, while a tough Reinsurance market conditions persist, our Reinsurance segment contributed an underwriting profit of $451 million for the year and a 73.3% combined ratio.","Year-over-year, gross written premium did decreased, but we continue to be disciplined and feel that the results speak for themselves in terms of our willingness to chase -- to not chase terms that fall outside of our approach. John Welch, our acting Head of Reinsurance will have more to say on the segments results in a moment.","Turning to Insurance, Greg has at least one more call with us as Head of the Insurance segment and so we won\u2019t overly seeing his presence just yet. But looking at the full year, one maybe does get a sense of the great progress he and his Insurance colleagues have made.","The Insurance segments combined ratio of 94.4%, loss ratio of 63.2% and underwriting profit of $225 million are all the best results in these metrics since 2007. We have more work to do, but we like the progress, particular the continued improvement of the ex-cat accident year combined ratio, which was 95.2% in the year or a 0.5% better than the same result in 2013.","Lastly, and especially for our XL colleagues listening to the call, I want to make particular note of our innovation drive and we have -- how we have grown our impact on the market through this focus.","According to at least one public tally we issued 31 new product announcements in 2014. That's a 35% year-over-year increase in new product announcements compared to 2013. And one of them, our North America Construction team's Public\/Private Partnership Coverage recently received an innovation award for business insurance. We have great momentum in creatively addressing risks. This vital work must continue to accelerate.","In sum, we are very pleased with these results and with the progress we have made during these past few years. The continuing strength of Reinsurance, the tangible improvement in Insurance, the second year of achieving a double-digit ROE and some of the best financial results we have achieved in 15 years. We\u2019ve worked hard to get to this point. We expect this progress to continue and couldn\u2019t be more excited about what is on the horizon.","With that, I will turn it to Pete.","Pete Porrino","Thanks, Mike and good evening. Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $294 million, or a $1.12 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $287 million or $1 per share in 2013.","Operating net income for the full year was approximately a $1 billion or $3.68 per share. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $140 million or $0.53 per share on a fully diluted basis and $188 million, or $0.69 per share for the full year.","As we\u2019ve previously discussed, our net income is impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivative that transfers the economics of the assets, backing our life Reinsurance transaction. But that derivative movement is completely offset by investment income, realized gains and losses and the change in the unrealized position of our portfolio and does not impact our net book value, operating income or comprehensive income.","We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. As European interest rates have continued to fall, we have recorded a derivative loss, offset by a book value gain associated with an increase in the market value of the underlying assets.","Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter of 84.5%, was 8.8 points lower than the same quarter last year and the full year\u2019s 88.2% was 4.3 points lower than the prior year. Our accident year combined ratio for the quarter of 91.4% was lower by 5.9 points, while the full year\u2019s 92.6% was lower by 4.7 points.","This improvement was largely driven by lower levels of catastrophe losses and the impacts from our underwriting actions that Greg and John will discuss further. For the quarter, our natural catastrophe losses totaled $32 million, which was split $18 million and $14 million between our Insurance and Reinsurance segment.","By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2013 totaled $94 million. For the full year 2014, natural catastrophe losses were $113 million compared to $317 million in 2013.","Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $97 million, compared to $61 million for the same quarter in 2013. This reflects favorable development of $35 million and $62 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, resulting from our fourth quarter detailed ground-up reserve review.","For all of 2014, development was a net favorable $255 million or 4.5 loss ratio points, a slight decrease compared to $290 million or 4.9 loss ratio points for 2013. Consistent with previous indications, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and performance-based compensation, operating expenses for the year were 4.5% higher than in 2013.","During the quarter, operating expenses were up 13.3%, compared to the same quarter last year. However, this was almost entirely due to the impact of our favorable results on our various compensation plans. We continue to focus on balancing cost efficiency with continued investments in our infrastructure, underwriting teams and strategic opportunities.","As is been the case throughout the year, our increased use of Reinsurance will continue to impact the reported operating expense ratio as ceding commissions, which cover all expenses are generally reported on the acquisition expense line. For 2015, excluding the impact of the Catlin transaction, we estimate that our operating expenses will grow by a percentage in the low single digits.","Turning to investment performance, at a $172 million net investment income on the portfolio was $68 million below the same quarter last year primarily due to the Life transaction. The gross book yield in the portfolio at the end of December was 2.7%. When compared with the average Q4 new money rate of 1.7%, we expect that net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we've approximately $3 billion of assets with book yields of 3% rolling off over the next 12 months.","Net income from investment fund and investment manager affiliates was $21 million for the quarter, down $56 million from an exceptional prior year quarter. The XL property and casualty investment portfolio returned 1% for the quarter and 4.8% for the year. The mark-to-market for the quarter was $94 million, including net realized gains of $13 million, driven primarily by sales of equities. This compares to net realized gains of $12 million in Q4 2013.","Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $1.1 billion of the end of the fourth quarter. The duration of our fixed income portfolio remained at 3.8 years. Effective tax rate on net income available to ordinary shareholders for the full year was 34% and for the fourth quarter was 21.5%. These rates are higher than prior year due to the impact of the loss recognized on the life reinsurance transaction and subsequent net loss on the related derivative, both of which have little or no tax benefit.","On an operating basis, our effective tax rate for the full year was 12% and for the fourth quarter was 10%. With respect to capital management during the fourth quarter, we purchased 5.2 million shares for $175 million at an average price of $33.82 per share. For the year, we purchased and consolidated total of 24.7 million shares for $800 million at an average price of $32.40 per share, leaving $267.6 million available for purchase under our previously announced share buyback program.","While we continue to see share buyback as a valuable capital management tool, we pulled our purchases at the end of November and in the completion of our proposed acquisition of Catlin Group.","I will now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Greg Hendrick","Thanks, Pete and good evening. Today, I will cover results for the segment, provide some color on our progress during the year and finish with remarks on current market conditions.","Starting with the results, 2014 was Insurance\u2019s segment most profitable years since 2007, generating nearly $100 million more underwriting profit than last year. The accident year combined ratio was 96.9%, compared to 99.4% in 2013. And this year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by the accident ex-CAT cat loss ratio of 63.9%, which was 2 full points better than prior year.","The fourth quarter marked our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability, with the segment producing a calendar quarter combined ratio of 93.8%, compared to 96.7% in the same quarter last year and an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 63.5%, which is 2 points better than prior year.","The results also benefited from another quarter of favorable CAT activity, which contributed 0.5 point to the improvement. This is mostly offset by slightly lower prior year development, even though we recognized $35 million of prior year releases.","The underwriting expense ratio was 31.9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a deterioration of 0.4 points from prior year, mainly due to an increase in variable compensation. Excluding variable pay, the underwriting expense ratio actually improved by more than 2 points in the quarter versus prior year and by 0.4 points on a full year basis.","As mentioned previously, the actions we've taken to shift towards quarter should increase the number of our businesses and to store the comparisons of our acquisition and operating expense ratio to prior year. This quarter shares have increased ceding commission income, reducing our acquisition ratio by 2.6 points in the quarter but net earned premiums probably contributing to a 3 point higher operating expense ratio.","Insurance gross premiums written grew by $432 million or 8% for the full year and $195 million or 15% in the quarter, when adjusted for foreign exchange movement. While approximate one third of the growth in the quarter was driven by a few large transactions and timing, the general trajectory reflects the continued build-out in many of our businesses. Roughly, half of our growth was led by our North American Construction, Global Risk Management, Marine, International, Financial Lines businesses.","In addition to these lines, we also have material growth in our E&S, Cyber, Political Risk and Crisis Management teams. With the exception of our international Onshore Energy and Lloyd\u2019s middle market books, which we shrank as a result of underwriting changes due to underperformance. Only the Surety business was down materially relative to prior year quarter and this book was up nearly 50% for the full year. While markets are increasingly competitive for many of our businesses, we continue to see increased submission flow and a higher growth ratio reflecting our positive momentum in a large commercial marketplace.","Shifting to ongoing progress, as mentioned earlier, we experienced a two-point improvement in our accident year ex-CAT loss ratio relative to 2013 despite experiencing a 25% increase in large short-tail losses in 2014. Our ability to improve our overall accident year ex-CAT loss ratio while absorbing increased large losses is evidence of the improving profitability of our underlying book.","This improvement is a result of our ongoing focus on an improved mix of business and continued execution of underwriting actions. For the full year, nearly 60% of our gross premium is better than or within five points of our target combined ratio. Of the remaining 40%, roughly half is in line that we continue to build out such as Crisis Management, Political Risk, International Financial Lines. As these businesses are still in growth mode, there is an expense drag which impacts the return while the businesses get to scale.","With regards to remaining 20% or so, it\u2019s no longer that entire business is below target. Rather, it\u2019s certain portfolios within these businesses that we continue to focus our re-underwriting efforts. In addition, our rigorous process of identifying, implementing and measuring our underwriting action again yielded a one-point improvement in our segment loss ratio during 2014.","Regarding talent, this quarter we appointed Greg Bangs to lead our Global Crime business. Donna Nadeau was promoted Chief Underwriting Officer in North America. And we added June Dwyer to our distribution network team. In addition to these deployments, we continued the expansion of our underwriting talent.","We strengthened our Cyber business. International Financial lines expanded its merger and acquisition business. Aerospace expanded its capability in China. And we continue to make investments in Brazil with the addition of several new team members across multiple businesses. For the year, we increased our underwriting workforce by nearly 10% as we continue to build our businesses around the world.","Turning to market conditions, we saw a continued slowing in rate across more lines of business as the overall rate change to the segment was down only 1% in the fourth quarter and up 0.5% on a year-to-date basis. That said, two-thirds of our businesses ended the year with positive rate.","In the fourth quarter, our international P&C business achieved rate in excess of 1% with only our Lloyd's middle-market businesses in red figures. Our North American and Professional businesses were both down just under 1%, driven by 5% reduction in North American property and continued softening in U.S. excess D&O. ","Our specialty business continue to be more severely impacted with an overall rate decrease of two points, largely reflecting continued competitive conditions for Marine and Offshore Energy, as well as disappointing Aviation market, which was broadly flat. Finally, while we once again benefited from a relatively quiet catastrophe quarter and year, 2014 was a solid year.","We continue to remix our businesses, growing higher margin businesses capitalized on reinsurance efficiency and as Mike noted, boosted our innovation efforts, paying in 2015 despite pricing headwinds, we're as well positioned as we've ever been for continued success.","And now to John to discuss reinsurance results.","John Welch","Thanks Greg and good evening. I\u2019d like to cover two principal issues tonight, review of our Q4 and full-year results and also some comments on recent renewal season and market conditions. With respect to the fourth quarter, we had a combined ratio of 61.2% producing and an underwriting profit of $156 million. This compares favorably to the combined ratio of 85.1% and an underwriting profit of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.","During the quarter, we had the benefit of prior year releases of $62 million and catastrophe losses of $14 million, net of reinstatement premiums. The major contributors to the CAT activity in the quarter were development on September floods in India and Hurricane Odile. Q4 2013 included a prior year release of $21 million and catastrophe losses of $71 million net of reinstatement premiums.","With respect to the year-over-year movement in favorable PYD, it is worth noting that Q4 reflects the semiannual reserve review for XL Re America and that Q4 2013 reflected an unusual strengthening of $31 million for Spanish surety losses. Excluding the impact of prior year releases and CAT losses, the segment produced a combined ratio of 73% which compares to the 73.6% in Q4 of 2013.","Turning to topline in the quarter, gross written premiums were $158 million or 3.9% decrease over Q4 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by non-renewal activity in our U.S. casualty treaty book and FX impacts partially offset by growth in international casualty treaty, property facultative, U.S. property treaty and crop. For 2014, the segment produced an outstanding combined ratio of 73.3% and an underwriting profit of $451 million which compares the 81.4% combined ratio and underwriting profit of $325 million in 2013.","This result was impacted by catastrophe losses of $45 million in prior year reserve releases of $155 million compared to 2013 where we had CAT losses of $198 million and reserve releases of $188 million. Excluding the impact of both CAT losses and prior year releases, we had a combined ratio of 79.8% compared to 80.6% in 2013. Our year-to-date gross written premium was down 5.7% to $1.8 billion as we continue to manage our way through very competitive trading conditions.","Turning to market conditions, given another light year for cap loss activity and continued growth in reinsurance capacity for these risks, we experienced another competitive January 1 renewal season. Rates adjusted down 7.5% to 15% on the U.S. CAT book and we\u2019re down 6% to 15% for the international CAT book.","In addition to price, we saw terms and conditions loosen to some degree. Specifically, there was pressure on hourly clauses and reinstatement provisions. Within the U.S. CAT book, this pressure resulted in some incremental increases in coverage and the amount was minor across the book and is captured in the risk-adjusted rate decreases.","Outside the U.S., the vast majority of renewals saw no loosening with respect to these terms. From a structural perspective, there was increased interest in multiyear contracts, expanded geographic scope and placements with aggregate features. With respect to long tail and specialty markets, the environment is extremely competitive and pressure remains on both reinsurance pricing and terms and conditions.","This continues to be true commission structures on proportional placements. In addition, we saw slight deterioration loss ratios for long tail lines as rate increases fell short of loss trend. We continue to navigate our way cautiously through this phase of the market and our trading with long-standing clients with proven track records.","Despite the difficult market conditions, our underwriting teams maintain their discipline and did an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities. Our long-standing trading relationships allowed us to write a January 1 portfolio that was largely in line with our expectations from both the mix and profitability perspective.","With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A.","David Radulski","And Shirley, you can open the line for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.","Brian Meredith","Yeah, evening. A couple of questions here for you. The first one, you talked about continuing to make infrastructure investments in the organization. Wonder if you could elaborate what are those investments right now? And does the proposed acquisition cost you took kind of slow down on any of those at this point?","Mike McGavick","This is Mike, Brian. First of all, we still do have some technology platform stuff that we\u2019re building out. We have one underlying platform around our financial close systems that we call enterprise enablement, EE, and that is well underway. And I think that most of the functionality wraps up in the next year. And that one will be useful whether there is an integration or not.","The second with respect to underwriters, we have been building out a global underwriting platform for certain of our businesses that have common processes. That's one where there could -- the integration could have an impact on how we choose to proceed on those, and those issues are not yet resolved. So there could be changes in some of what's forecasted depending on choices that are made by the integration teams in the next weeks and months.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thanks. And then the second question, Mike I am just curious, how are you right now mitigating any kind of distraction with the new organization is with respect to this pending acquisition?","Mike McGavick","Well, we've all bought really huge whips. I mean, look, the reality is, this is a very difficult time for our colleagues at XL and for our hope to be colleagues at Catlin. It\u2019s distracting, it\u2019s confusing, this is people's livelihoods, and we take that very, very seriously. At the same time, we know very well that our colleagues know that we made a commitment to our Board about the plan for 2015 and we continue to work to deliver it.","And if there is one thing that I've never had any doubt about it, it\u2019s about the work I think and the intelligence of our colleagues. They both see the importance of the commitments they make and they carry those into the marketplace. And I think when going to their intelligence a little bit, it's hard not to observe that. If you have a two companies coming together, you\u2019re probably going to want to make sure you put your best foot forward. And that includes staying focused and delivering.","So people are in the sense really showing us that they have the ability to perform under difficult circumstances, that's an important credential that they are advertising to us into their future colleagues. So as I travel around and meet with our colleagues, you have that underlying sensibilities, but you also have the real sense of commitment and the devotion to going forward with the firm, and that works together I think to keep everybody focused.","I would add one more thing too, having these other transactions recently announced kind of both affirms our strategy very clearly that was a nice thing. But I think it also causes all of our colleagues to say, ghee, you know there's something really exciting going on right where I work right now and rest of the market seems to be in some turmoil too. So all of a sudden, I think you're more focused on what you can do to help your existing employer and the future employer that\u2019s been created. So I think that all works together to create a group of very focused and dedicated people.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead with your question.","Josh Shanker","Thank you. Good evening, everyone. I was hoping there might be a possibility of getting a little more granular on the operating expenses, which are obviously elevated compared to a year ago, but not so much compared to last quarter. What's comp related, what\u2019s infrastructure related, and what would we think would probably go away in the future?","Mike McGavick","I am going to start and then pass it over to Pete. And I promise Pete I won\u2019t give the whole answer. The most important thing I'd say is as the year ended, we want to kind of spot on to what we said we would do for the year. And we said that ex-FX and comp related movements that we would be right around mid-single digits, I think we came out almost spot on 5.","So I feel very good that as we try very hard to do that we did what we said we would do. But I think that -- and that of course always did include these other strategic investments. As I said earlier, it's too early to tell exactly how those wall shake out. But when I step back, you heard Greg referenced the fact that there continues to be an expense drag on building out those newer lines of business that we think are embodied the important remixing of lowering our overall combined and loss ratios.","And that's one of the expense tracks that we think we can cheer right away through our combination with Catlin. Just as I've talked before about the fact that similarly when it comes to the expense of their, this is Catlin\u2019s building out of a global platform that we can rationalize a lot of expense there. So it's not just in the sort of what you're spending on tech categories that we can get synergies, those are meaningful. It is also more about the fundamental nature of the strategies of the two companies and how they fit together.","Pete Porrino","Sure. So Josh just -- and yes, Mike, you did leave me a piece, so thank you for that. Of the expenses in the quarter, so I would think about call it ballpark $40 million compared to last year would have been the variable compensation increase, okay, so just to give you a magnitude there.","And then on your question about the strategic expenses, I think the best way I could take you through the numbers a little bit. And we said this before, if you look at our corporate expense line and again this is not how we manage the expenses a couple, we manage them in total. But if you look at the corporate expense line, we said in the past that approximately a third to 40% of that number is what we call the strategic initiatives and the rest would be an allocation of corporate that we don't allocate to the businesses.","As you look at that 33% to 40% number, Mike talked about a couple of those initiatives that in place -- that are in place and the one that he mentioned on EE, as he said that one we are hoping to start to -- we are delivering, we\u2019ve already started delivering the benefits of that. We will continue that through 2015. And at that point in time, we would expect that the spending on that would go down pretty significantly.","Josh Shanker","Okay. That\u2019s a great answer. And one question for Mike. If you look out, you said on the call and you said in the press release, these are some of the best results we\u2019ve seen excel in 15 years and that\u2019s true. Interest rates are low here. One argument would be that because interests are low everyone is buttoned up and is playing bowl, and that\u2019s created a very healthy environment for PMC. The other argument would be that these are trough results and when interest rates go up, you will see ROEs rise for XL and the industry. Where do these results fit in the view of where you think results will be for X on the industry two, three years from now in a mortgage rate normal environment?","Mike McGavick","That\u2019s a really interesting question. And I am sure as heck I knew the answer. But I will give you a couple of perspectives. Number one, several years ago when Greg and others and we're all working on the strategy, we could see that this interest rate environment was going to be persistent. We have in-house committee of various disciplines that does interest rate forecasting and they have been consistently along with the rest of world saying this is not some temporary phenomenon, this is going to take a long time to resolve.","And so we made a very aggressive decision back then that we were going to focus on that in essence the action in your loss ratio and everything else too, but really, really focus on delivering a great underwriting results as the driver of results. And our progress has of course had to come from that because we\u2019ve been mixing toward a lower investment return for a long time and it continues. So I think much of the market has adopted that same discipline to various degrees.","At the same time, especially with what's going on in the reinsurance sector, we see a tremendous amount of capital being brought to bear. So that has a countervailing effect on discipline out there, because especially just imagine you talk some group and they are giving you a billion of capital put to work. You want to put it to work somehow. And so they're trying to outwit the market, outwitting a market we would submit is always a very, very difficult thing, especially if you don\u2019t have the kinds of long-term relationships and capabilities that a firm like XL and others bring to bear.","So as I look at it, I do think obviously, when we get to the inflection point and assuming we do start to see some rise in interest rates and the contribution thereby to the earnings, I think you\u2019re coming off of such a disciplined period. I do not expect that all of the sudden everyone will go crazy. If fact, far from it, I think, discipline and underwriting is going to run on, because that\u2019s how people are used to working now and they're getting a lot of reward for working that way.","And I don't expect it will suddenly change on a dime because somehow there's some interest-rate based cash flow coming on. So I'm hopeful that this discipline will be retained and there will be something we can build on. As proud as we are of these results, we\u2019re completely mindful that only in these last couple of years that we\u2019re beating our cost of capital.","This is a solid return and in the spectrum of things going on a really positive development, but by no means is where we think ourselves or the industry should be performing, especially as interest rates normalize. So I would hope that discipline will last beyond what required in the first place.","Josh Shanker","Thank you for the extended answer. And good luck on the integration or hopefully the closing of the deal with Catlin.","Mike McGavick","Thank you very much, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Cliff Gallant with Nomura. You may ask your question.","Cliff Gallant","Great. Thank you. And Mike, condolences to Seahawks, I assume you would run the bowl.","Mike McGavick","This would have been a great question. I was so happy that they decided not to hold the Super Bowl this year.","Cliff Gallant","Two questions. One, you mentioned some pretty good growth in your cyber markets and you are adding to the team there. Just wondering, when you go into a new market like how is it that you can -- seems like it will be easy to grow, but there is a lot of risk you\u2019re taking on and how do you limit the risk, how do you know what you're getting into?","Mike McGavick","I\u2019m going to ask Greg to expand, but the simple answer is low limits and a broad dispersion of clients.","Greg Hendrick","That would be the whole answer. No, we\u2019ve been added for -- this will be the fourth year in existence and the third, second -- two and a half years are really going in a much bigger way at it. Mike is absolutely right, we keep our limits very low both on a gross basis, normal maximum there is $10 million and we buy quota share protection take that down to $5 million, so very small limits.","As you probably know, it\u2019s also -- I\u2019m proud of the work the team does. I'm proud of the both the underwriting they do and the services they provide their clients, but it is a fairly scaled down product. There isn\u2019t broad disruption there. There isn\u2019t broad physical damage. It\u2019s effectively a breach and how they get our clients, customers back up on their credit agreement and back restored to health.","So from that perspective, we also stay away from in general kind of the big-box retailers and some of the other larger exposures in that space. So it\u2019s a combination of low limits, good spread, good expertise to help clients and a big good broad industry distribution.","Cliff Gallant","Okay. Thank you. One other question I had is, we -- and thank you for the discussion over January 1 renewals, but notably, the talk with Catlin was happening over the renewal period. To what degree do you think that affected? How your renewals without much of an impact on what your volumes will look like this year?","Mike McGavick","My view is no, but I ask John to elaborate.","John Welch","That is the correct answer. We saw no impact of the leak with the announcement.","Cliff Gallant","Okay. Listening to your overview of where pricing was it, although it sounded it would be reasonable of us to expect that your Reinsurance volumes this year will be down. It sounded something like 5% to 10% or so?","Mike McGavick","We don't actually and never have gotten into specifics of the renewal season in terms of the size of portfolio or how we allocated our capital. But I can say that the pricing environment was difficult. But we've always got a couple of things going on as well. So how exactly that will shakeout by the time all the renewals finish out. But too early to tell, but I'm feeling that the group did a very nice job of handling some really difficult conditions.","Cliff Gallant","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Stirling with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Josh Stirling","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the call. So, Mike, you made difficult for us as we all want to ask some forward-looking questions, but you don\u2019t want to talk about the deal? So I\u2019m going to try to stay big picture. I\u2019m thinking about your future capital leverage, your capital levers and operating leverage and reinsurance strategies, and I\u2019m trying to build my model for the next few years and I\u2019m wondering if you give us some bit more conceptual sense that how you think is likely to change? Even if only directionally we really love to get a better handle of what kind of strategy you think you are going to pursue on out of reinsurance spend? And then big picture, if there are actually meaningful opportunities for basically capital leverage from either diversification or sort of the capital benefit from using Lloyd's unique platform?","Mike McGavick","Yeah. You\u2019ve really excited the number of the things we're looking at very hard. I can\u2019t help you too much with the models at this stage, because we\u2019re still building ours, but I would give you a few thoughts in terms of detail now as opposed to headlines.","I give you a few thoughts, one, you observe correctly that Lloyd is a very efficient platform. I think there are -- it sufficient in terms of capital, it\u2019s difficult in terms of expense, so it's a double-edged sword. And you can find that amongst the mix of businesses we have that there are things that would be better or worse in that environment and our view of the way they have been -- I'd say it simply, Catlin has always needed to and been more efficient that its capital use and we\u2019ve admired that in them.","And when we see how Lloyd's used and think about our products, we're looking for the right mix to take advantage of that capital framework and the right mix to move away from that expense very much. So there is all kinds of really interesting optimization exercises going on.","You can say the same thing from a diversification point of view. Sometimes its product specification but sometimes its geographic diversification and we\u2019re going to have a much bigger spread of geographic dispersion through which to work with and a whole set of different legal entity structures, which also have efficiency that can be gained as those are optimized.","So I think what you're hearing is, we have a whole bunch of new tools available, the way the whole thing comes together. And I think I know that both teams are entering their work very mindful of what they can do to make sure that the very most efficient platform comes out the backend.","And I can only tell you that from a personal point of view as I\u2019ve -- as we get deeper into the detail, I get more excited about the possibilities. There are many of these things that had no bearing on how we price the deal or the kinds of returns that we have promised the marketplace.","Josh Stirling","Okay. Great. Thank you. And just, I think, it\u2019s a question for Pete, its very numbers question and I apologies if you have addressed this earlier and I somehow missed it. But I wondered if you could walk us through some of the math behind this quarter's paid to incurred ratio and you guys disclose this to your credit, but it\u2019s an awfully higher number and you\u2019re growing in the numbers way above one.","I\u2019m wondering if there is something unique going on with your seeding strategy or remixing or something that\u2019s leading it not have to fund the same level of reserves as you have in the past or whether maybe this is just like some one-time, this is due to some one-time factors that benefited the quarter?","Pete Porrino","So Josh, this is Pete. Let me address that. So there were two drivers for the high paid to incurred in the current quarter. So you're exactly right, your analysis is spot on. One was an exceptionally low level of incurred losses in the Reinsurance segment, as John talked about. And the second was a higher level of paid losses in the Insurance segment.","And so what we give you in the financial supplement is the total, but if you broke them out you would see those individual segments and we\u2019re happy to provide that if you like it.","The low-level of incurred losses in Reinsurance reflects a lack of both the attritional and lodge natural peril catastrophe losses in 2014, as well as the favorable PYD that we booked in the quarter.","And on the Insurance side, the high level of paid losses, they reflects really more than a one quarter's worth of paid losses that we use. We process more of our cash receipts near the month end and we talked about the finance infrastructure projects, Mike mentioned it.","As this comes online, right, as we\u2019ve been taking about this, this is now coming online and it\u2019s improved our ability to process elements of our close, closer to the period end. So in realty there is more than three months in that -- in this quarter paid losses and those two comprise the entire difference taking those two out, its right about 100%.","Josh Stirling","Got it. Thank you, thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask your question.","Paul Newsome","Good evening and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about currency and we\u2019ve seen a lot of companies with some pretty big currency impacts on their book value. Did I miss it or didn\u2019t look like there was much of an impact for you folks?","Pete Porrino","No, there wasn\u2019t that much. I mean if you look at what our exposed currency, we manage our currencies conservatively. We have a natural hedge on our legal -- this is Pete. We have a natural hedge on our legal entities that would be denominated in other currencies. We\u2019ve got a very strict rule on how much risk we will take on those balance sheets, right. And so at the end, the only currencies that we expect to flow through would be the retained earnings at the legal entities that would be in currencies denominated in other than U.S. dollars. And for us, it just was not that big of a transaction. So we do have an active hedge program, where we have a mandatory amount of VaR that we\u2019ll allow.","Paul Newsome","Interesting. I have a certainly different question. In some of the European countries, the interest rates have gotten extremely low, and in some cases the government rates are actually negative. I think most companies I would imagine you are the same since we tried to back liabilities in those current -- those currencies in those areas in assets that are in the same country. What do you do now that in some areas there is essentially no return on the available assets?","Pete Porrino","All right. So Paul, this is Pete. I\u2019ll take it again because it\u2019s a continuation of the comment about natural hedge that we have. And so yes indeed, when we are in locations where the reserves are in a currency, we are likely to have the assets in those same currencies. And clearly investing in euro and Swiss franc asset today is challenging given that there are negative yields going out, six years on the bonds and 12 years on the Swiss francs. Given our ALM matching approach, we invest in those portfolios quite a while ago and we expected reinvestment amounts over the next 12 months is only about $380 million.","So we don't see this as a huge headwind in the near-term. So far we've mostly avoided buying bonds of negative yields. We've been able to invest incorporates, covered bonds and other high-quality ABS as well as European government agency paper, all of which pay a credit spread. So it generates some positive yield. But it will be an increasing -- increasingly different difficult challenge if this negative yield environment is sustained. Right, so at 12\/31, the average book yield of our yield portfolio was 1.7% and the average market yield of our benchmark in euros is probably 0.4%.","And so over time, you would expect those two numbers to converge. But as I talked about we will maintain our current matching philosophy. We are not in the business of taking unhedged FX Risk. We\u2019ll maintain our overall investment strategy discipline, not stretch the yield. The last thing I\u2019d say is as a result of the life transaction, we are in a different place where we are a lot less sensitive than we used to be, right, given the sale of our European block of business there.","Mike McGavick","Yeah, Paul, I would just add a couple of thought. First I\u2019d underscore the last point Pete made that transaction continues to really look like one of the really good achievements of the year, and this is another case of why. The second thing I would observe is in a variety of the international forums that I've been in particularly with my banking friends lately, the impact of interest rates on insurance business models is getting more and more attention than the central banking system. And I'm hopeful that they will start to take into account that impact as well as the other stimulative impact that they see, and come to more balanced solutions over time.","Paul Newsome","Great. Thanks and condolences on the Super Bowl.","Mike McGavick","Thanks.","Pete Porrino","That\u2019s too.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question.","Randy Binner","Hey good evening. Thank you I have a couple this is -- just first one is just following up on what Brian Meredith was asking on and as far as the workforce is concerned, I think Mike touched on it. But I think I am going to ask it more exclusively and that is with your transaction and the other large merger out there. It seems to me that there might be excess supply of labor in a lot of your key markets. And so, is that something that when you are doing your ongoing talent searches that you are feeling now already in the market?","Mike McGavick","Well. I think right now, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to judge the marketplace right now on some snapshot basis because with our two workforces working toward coming together, I don't think this is going to be a -- we are not going to have a unaffected view of how the labor markets working. We will not have as many people. I think that reaching out to us as we\u2019ve had recently until the dust settles somewhat because they know that there is uncertainty.","I think the larger point to me is that there, I think that while there is always going to be a really meaningful competition for talent in our sector because great underwriters and underwriting leadership, great actuarial talent, these folks are hard to find. And when you find them, you try to get them in your organization and keep them as long as you can. And so, I don't think that piece of it will change even if there was dramatically more integration across the sector because the really great talent really isn\u2019t in oversupply.","The second thing, I would say though is it does I think change the mentality of the workforce going through integration. If you thought your situation was the only difficult situation around. And therefore, it became tempting to go to some other organization and feel safer, I don't think that mentality is going to be very much in play right now. It\u2019s going to be difficult to go somewhere, where you're safe from all of this because I think it's going to take a while to play out.","And again, I don't want to overstate it, but I think it makes our people very mindful of the great opportunity we are creating at XL and [Cal] [ph]. And I think when those two firm -- when these two firms come together, it's just going to be a real powerhouse in the large complex risk space. And in a world where risk solutions are becoming more and more complex, where risk mutates more rapidly, being a part of the firm that is doing the really creative hard work of making sure our clients are well protected, I can\u2019t imagine a place I'd rather be as an underwriter and that's exactly what we are trying to create.","And so, I just think I can only comment kind of the -- on the impact of our own colleagues. But I think they are going to really want to be a part of it and I\u2019m going to be excited. I know Steven is to create as many opportunities for that kind of wonderful opportunity as we can.","Randy Binner","All right. Great. Thanks. And just one other follow-up and this is from what I think, Paul Newsome was just talking about. We ended up getting the book yield and the new money yield on your European or foreign book. But can you just provide the similar percentages for the overall book, or I guess the domestic book, however, you would communicate it?","Mike McGavick","We\u2019ve done well. You\u2019ve got Pete reaching for a file. So he is looking for a number.","Pete Porrino","No. I think it\u2019s in the -- yeah, it was -- I covered in the script. Let me just go back and cover it again. So, we had 3% -- and so we had that new money rate of 1.7% and our average book yield was 2.7%.","Randy Binner","2.7%. Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Good evening. One basic question. Just wanted to make sure I understand it. When you\u2019ve got dramatic foreign exchange changes, does that itself produce some of the reserve development that you reported in the quarter, or are those two categories completely distinct?","Sarah Street","No.","Pete Porrino","Meyer, could you repeat the question? I couldn\u2019t hear it.","Meyer Shields","Yeah. Let me try again, I am sorry, I am having phone call for awhile. When -- I don\u2019t know, the euro weakens dramatically against the dollar? Does that translate -- does that produce reserve development, when your euro liabilities now require few dollars to fund them?","Sarah Street","No. It would not. So the FX movements will go to the currency translation line and that would not be reported as part of the prior year development.","Meyer Shields","Okay.","Pete Porrino","So, Meyer, so if you look at our income statement and you saw the FX in the income statement, that would be large portion of it, would be the re-denomination of those liabilities.","Meyer Shields","Okay. No. That\u2019s perfect. I just want to make sure that I understood that. We haven\u2019t talked about Berkshire Hathaway in awhile? But now that\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway specialty has gotten sort of settled? Are they are more relevant competitive for us than they were a year ago than anything to concern you?","Mike McGavick","No. I\u2019ve -- we have expected anything that that crowd puts its line to, we expect them to do well. We certainly notice them a bit more. But I can\u2019t say that that they have a history of being really disciplined underwriters. So I don\u2019t think there is anything other than another competitor, on one hand that\u2019s going to grow and influence overtime, but at the same time, what I expect will be a continuing consolidation of other players. So it\u2019s kind of one hand on the other hand, but in the end I don\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t seen any real distortion in the marketplace because of their presence.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Fantastic. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Ryan Byrnes with Janney Capital. You may ask your question.","Ryan Byrnes","Great. Yeah. Thanks. Good evening, everybody. Just wanted to touch, I think, Greg\u2019s comment earlier on the Insurance segment. I think you guys stated that there were -- large losses were 25% higher than last year and obviously, last year there was a lot of volatility in the underlying loss ratio, but we didn\u2019t see it this year? So I was just wondering, if you could help us, give us a little bit more color on what kind of impact it did had this year on a percentage basis and see what the -- why those losses persisted and can you get Reinsurance coverage more favorably heading into next year?","Greg Hendrick","Sure, Ryan. It\u2019s Greg Hendrick. So from a dollar perspective, when we look at large losses, we are looking at over $10 million for property and energy. Last year we had, at the end of the accident year, so the end of the 12 months as reported, we had $110 million or about 2.6 plus ratio points. So \u201914 we had $132 million or 3.3 points. So 0.7 higher loss ratio impact from large losses, but we still improved our accident year cat by 2 points.","That\u2019s quite simple. All that hard work I have been talking about of re-mixing, re-underwriting and really gaining a much more profit underlying portfolio, there isn\u2019t any one, two or three things I\u2019ve point you on the one that I\u2019ve reiterated in the past.","So for us when I look at the losses, I don\u2019t see anything that could give me trouble about, what we underwrote, how we underwrote it, the line size and so I feel like, we are -- there is great amount of volatility. If I gave you the last five years in terms of count, we have had 27,267 at the end of the 12-month accident year period. So quite a bumpy up and down that is part of the volatility we might turn -- talked about earlier.","On reinsurance, we did put in place an arrogant risk protection at May 1. That has -- we have contributed number of these losses against there got deductible, so from here for the remainder of that treaty period we will have a lot less volatility, where we had experienced more loss in the first part of next year.","As far as May 1 goes, we will see when we get there about the Reinsurance purchasing. As things are at the moment, we don\u2019t expect any problems with our reinsurance treaty renewals.","Ryan Byrnes","Great. That\u2019s great color. Thank you. And then my last question is, were there any one-time Catlin expenses in the fourth quarter and I guess, should we anticipate any go-forward?","Pete Porrino","Hey, Ryan. It\u2019s Pete. There was diminish amount is approximately $2 million of Catlin expenses in the quarter and really, I think, we are unable to give you much guidance for what we are going to see in the future, I apologies.","Ryan Byrnes","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. You may ask your question.","Ian Gutterman","Hi. Thank you. Pete, I have -- I notice something about your Reinsurance segment in Q4 last year, as I didn\u2019t notice this until today? But sequentially the accident year was about 10 points better than the first three quarters and the same thing happened last year and the same thing in 2012, before that that never happened. Is there some seasonality in Q4 in your Reinsurance accident year, or are you doing true-ups on your pick and that\u2019s been to your benefits in the past two years or is there some reason in Q4s a lot better than the rest of the year?","Mike McGavick","So, yes, I will let John talk about that. There was some seasonality there.","Ian Gutterman","Sure. Okay.","John Welch","But essentially, the process is to take a look at the accident year in the fourth quarter and revert to actual reported activity. And so what you're seeing in the last few years is the actual CAT activity running much better than expected. I\u2019d called attritional CAT activity running much better than expected and then that's brought into the actuarial methods and essentially there's a release across the year for that activity.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. Okay. So for that -- so I shouldn\u2019t necessarily build that it for next year unless a sense of being like a CAT year again?","John Welch","Right. And just to give you a sense, for the fourth quarter, the impact of that activity was about 8.2 points.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. Thank you. And then on the incentive comp, was there a bigger impact on Reinsurance proportionally than insurance? It looked like there was a bigger increase in the Reinsurance expense ratio year-over-year than the Insurance increase?","Mike McGavick","Yeah. Proportionally, there would be. I mean, the way we work our incentive comp is highly aligned to localized results and clearly the Reinsurance results were genuinely outstanding.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. Okay. And then my last one on the Insurance segment on pricing. As you've grown, I assume to some extent, the new business carries, a new business country with it, a, are you able to -- on renewal, essentially get it back to sort of a necessary long-term price or you still in the process of that and how much is that impacted by the overall pressure on rates? I guess, I wonder, is there sort of another mix benefits to rates beyond just sort of the headline number as you renew new business?","Mike McGavick","Let me start then I\u2019m going to pass it to Greg. This is Mike. The one thing I observed is when you set up a new team you often get what I would call honeymoon pricing at the start. The market is excited to have that team with your firm and they have a lot of relationships that they are leveraging and you can get some surprising, good pricing at the outset of the new team being stood up. So the penalty, as it were is less than you might think.","Ian Gutterman","Okay.","Mike McGavick","Ordinary new business activity. But, Greg, you want to comment on the rest of it.","Greg Hendrick","Sure. Yeah. I\u2019d say a couple of things. One is I think I have touched upon in the past. Quite often, it\u2019s the case that this is not new business to the underwriters at XL. Either we\u2019ve seen it in prior durations at XL, or the underwriters have seen it in their prior lines and other operations. So these aren\u2019t particularly in their large commercial space. These aren\u2019t brand new unknown risk to us that we are trying to price for you, as opposed to what you are trying to underwrite new home or new car on your small business.","The second one is the interesting piece of data. I have heard others comment on this on their call. We\u2019ve made a great effort over the last three years to build up our ability to capture rate adequacy in the Insurance segment. And without fail, as we\u2019ve build this process and strengthen it, new business prices are better than renewal business. I\u2019ve heard others comment on that conundrum because in your question, I get the same inference which is, it must be worse and it just -- the data doesn\u2019t seem do it. Now that maybe that you don\u2019t know as much about the new business as you do the renewal, but I just want to give that point of data to you that there is a stronger price adequacy based on our pricing tools for new versus renewal.","The last thing is I don\u2019t think you should be modeling any kind of return on renewals going forward. There is so many moving parts in an insurance book. You are constantly in a good year. We\u2019re at 85% to 87% retention ratio. So we\u2019re refilling 13%, 15%, 20% of the book anyway. So you\u2019re constantly having new and there\u2019s just too many moving parts to tell you that you are going to get an improvement for that one when the current new business renews.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. Makes sense. Thank you for that helpful answer.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne, Agee. You may ask you question.","Dan Farrell","Hi and good evening. Just a question on growth and insurance, I know you said that there were some large accounts added to the growth. But I was hoping you could give us little more detail within the segments. What types of lines are driving casualty growth? What types of lines are driving other insurance growth?","Greg Hendrick","Sure, Dan. So let me break it down into three parts. Your first one is the large or timing that I referred to in my comments. Couple of those are in the Global Risk Management business or U.S. Risk Management business where we have big gross written premiums where we\u2019re writing a policy over insurance captive and they\u2019re retaining a large part of the risk. So we\u2019re proud to be successful there in a couple of instances in the quarter.","Our North American Construction team has had some strong growth as well. There was some premium associated with the retrospective Worker's Comp. which is not a big part of our insurance book but we do have some of it. There\u2019s a little bit there. And the rest of it was a companion that I won\u2019t bore you with a miscellaneous kind of timings and accruals and true-ups that goes on in the normal course of business with insurance.","In terms of the second piece, which is we\u2019re growing in businesses, I touched on Construction. Crisis Management had a great quarter as well. International Financial Lines is another area where we grew strongly. And if I turn over to geography, Brazil, we had a really strong quarter in Brazil across a number of different lines of business that is really paying off in our investments down there. So those are the pieces of the growth year-over-year.","Dan Farrell","Okay, great. And then just another sort of numbers question on reinsurance purchase in that gross, I realize it\u2019s hard for you to comment on what\u2019s going to happen forward with your purchase. But if we look at the quarterly seasonality, you obviously did a lot of purchase in 2Q and then the retention jumps back up in 3Q and 4Q. Is that the right seasonality on a quarterly basis to think about as it just happened to be? What products are you reinsuring in that particular given quarter?","Greg Hendrick","We should have a less seasonality on a normal -- as we reach normal run rate. This is standalone XL commentary now. Standalone run rate for reinsurance suited those jumps up and down or when we had certain quota shares renewing in the professional and we\u2019ve talked a bit about this one in July to join for our casualty. And so what you see there is the effect of the changes that hit the books then and changes that suited -- I\u2019m sorry, net to gross retention ratio.","Dan Farrell","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I will turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Mike McGavick","This is Mike. I guess, three quick things, number one, our colleagues who often check in on these calls. I just want to say that we in the leadership group and certainly the board as well are deeply appreciative of the hard work that produces extraordinary results. And it\u2019s really an exciting time for the firm and exciting time going forward. We know very well that's an anxious time as well. And I promise you we are working very, very hard to get answers to people as quickly as we can and we will keep at it.","Second, to the analyst community, I just want to observe that this transaction clearly was surprising to some people and some side as a whole new strategy and other things. And I just want to thank the community for the open-mindedness you\u2019ve shown to this transaction. I think it has a lot to say for it and there is a lot we can\u2019t yet say about it. That\u2019s been frustrating for everyone but I\u2019ve appreciated the open-minded approach that\u2019s been taken. And third, addressed to my beloved Seahawks, I love them even more. They handled the loss with class was pretty cool. Anyway thank you very much for your time.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines."],"22714":["XL Group (NYSE:XL) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 30, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David R.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David R. Radulski","Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We post to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement.","On our call this evening, you'll hear from Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions.","Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Michael S. McGavick","Good evening. Tonight, we are pleased to share with you XL's third quarter 2013 results, a quarter in which we grew our book value per share, increase gross premiums written, continued to see the benefits of an improving Insurance segment and had another solid Reinsurance result. At the same time, as we'll discuss this quarter and this year to date, remind us that XL is a work in progress, and tonight, we have both work and progress to talk about.","The progress we have made is substantial. We want to give you a thorough update on what we had seen year-to-date and why these results continue to bolster our confidence. Equally, we want to describe our current work and why we are confident that we will reach our goals of an attractive ROE driven by much improved combined ratio in our Insurance segment. And we believe we are on our way there at a faster clip than this quarter might indicate.","So first, a few thoughts on the quarter itself. While I opened with a list of positives from the quarter, and should add to that list a positive prior year development, you would also have seen from our release that we experienced a degree of CAT and individual loss activity that contributed to a higher quarterly accident year loss ratio in both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Given our diverse lines of business and the complex risk we write, one or more businesses will be expected to from time to time produce unusual levels of loss as we saw in this quarter. When this happens, there are a few series of questions we ask. Is this an unusual event or indicative of a trend? Do we have the right leaders in place? Are the underwriters taking the kinds of risk we want? And are they in line with that business' strategy and the group's strategy? In our review this quarter, in the main, we like the answers to these questions. These losses do not change our views. In fact, it is helpful to provide some additional perspective. This quarter reminds me a little bit of the fourth quarter of 2011, another quarter where we had collection of sizable losses that impacted our results. In that quarter, our reviews of the loss-making businesses indicated a number of needs for improvement that caused a huge amount of revised work. Not so this time. And in that quarter, we reported a 108% combined ratio. This quarter, with a similar set of issues, we made an underwriting profit. Today is remarkably different, and it is a direct result of the progress we are making. So we like the underlying trend of where we are year-to-date. We are on track.","So the specifics. The Insurance segment's year-to-date accident year combined ratio ex-CAT of 96.1% and the loss ratio ex-CAT of 65.6% are the best results on the same basis since 2007. Reinsurance generated a combined ratio of 80.1%, ahead of the 80.5% at the same period last year. And our year-to-date overall P&C combined ratio of 92.2% is a 0.5 point better than at the same time a year ago. Greg and Jamie will talk in more detail about these segment results in a moment.","Now about our continuing work. Our efforts to remix our businesses, our underwriting actions, our investments and talents and technology and our drive for rate are the reasons for our greater resilience.","Starts with business mix. It is a significant reason that we are now more resilient in such quarters. To give you some indication of the benefits of this remixing of our businesses, we are now able to rely on a far broader set of profitable and improving businesses. For example, more than 70% of our insurance businesses are now showing better loss ratios through 9 months than in the same period a year ago. We believe that mix will continue to improve as we invest in higher return businesses and this will be accelerated by the capital allocation process embedded in our 2014 budgeting.","Another important driver of our improving performance is our relentless effort to have the right underwriting talent and give them the tool they need to succeed. For example, our global underwriting platforms and enhanced data systems will increasingly allow our teams to determine where the best and most profitable opportunities lie. And we expect the operating leverage lift from these investments to continue to earn out over the immediate future.","Of course, market conditions drive improvement as well. And while we are not relying on rate to drive our loss ratio goals, we are pleased that our rate achievement is exceeding loss cost trends. Broadly, the third quarter was very much in line with what we've been seeing: positive pricing trends outpacing claims trends in most of our businesses and an overall insurance rate increase of 3.4%.","Lastly, we are very pleased that our progress continues to be noticed by external audiences, including today's announcement that S&P has upgraded our financial strength rating to A+, at the same time affirming our ERM opinion of strong. Also, this week, our issuer credit rating was put on positive outlook by A.M. Best.","So as I said at the beginning, and as we have shared with you before, as we keep working to meet our goals, our progress is confirmed by our substantial year-to-year improvement.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to detail our financial results.","Peter R. Porrino","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating net income for the third quarter was $155 million or $0.53 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $188 million in 2012 or $0.61 per share.","Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $136 million or $0.47 per share. Annualized operating return on ordinary shareholders' equity, excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments, were 6.8% for the quarter and 9.6% for the year-to-date. And fully diluted tangible book value per ordinary share increased in the quarter by 1.6% to $32.06 at September 30. Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 95% or 2.8 points higher than the same quarter last year, while our accident year combined ratio was 100.1%, higher by 5.4 points. These increases were mostly due to higher natural catastrophe losses in the quarter. These included a series of hailstorms in Germany in late 2013 for $59 million, which is consistent with our pre-announcement, Hurricane Ingrid in Mexico and flooding in Colorado and Toronto.","For the quarter, our natural catastrophe losses totaled $85 million or 5.5 loss ratio points, which was stood approximately $16 million and $69 million between our Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively.","By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2012 totaled $32 million or 2.4 loss ratio points. Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $79 million or 5.1 loss ratio points compared to $37 million and 2.5 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2012. This reflects favorable development of $3 million and $76 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. As we have outlined on previous earnings calls, the third quarter is what we refer to as an actual versus expected quarter for our entire Insurance segment and our U.S. Reinsurance business.","Our operating expenses were marginally higher than the prior year quarter and the second quarter of 2013, largely due to added headcount from a selected expansion in the Insurance segment business and increased infrastructure costs, partially offset by ongoing efficiency efforts and lower variable compensation accruals. As we've indicated in the past, we continue to expect that overall operating expense levels for 2013 will be modestly higher than 2012, but at levels which show continued improvement in overall operating expense leverage.","Turning to investment performance. Our investment portfolio delivered a positive total return of 1% in the quarter. We had a positive mark-to-market of $113 million as spread narrowing was partially offset by small interest rate increases on our key currency jurisdictions. Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $800 million at the end of the third quarter.","Our P&C fixed income duration decreased by 0.1 years to 3.6 years. Net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was $166 million, matching the prior year quarter. As a reminder, there were a number of unusual items in the net investment income in the prior year quarter that drove it lower. The P&C gross book yield at the end of September was 2.7%. We estimate that approximately $3.4 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 3% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months compared to the average new money rate in Q3 on our P&C portfolio of 2.1%. The P&C new money rate increased by 50 basis points this quarter compared to Q2 due to principally higher rates. However, net investment income remains under pressure but the recent increase in yields, if sustained, will help to offset the impact of these maturities and paydowns.","Our net income from investment affiliates was $15 million, up $6 million in the prior year quarter. Target returns and private investments were modest, challenged by the volatile capital markets while we had a solid quarter from our investment managers, including a partial sale of one of our stakes. We also had positive returns from our other strategic affiliates. As a reminder, we report these items on either a 1- or 3-month lag basis.","During the quarter, we have lowered our effective tax rate for the year 2 percentage points to approximately 10% on operating income. This is based on the year-to-date and estimated distributions of profit and losses to jurisdictions within our global network of companies for the remainder of the year.","With respect to capital management, we continue to execute on our share buyback program. And during the third quarter, we purchased 4.8 million shares for $150 million in an average price of $31.03 per share, as we continue to view such purchases as an effective use of surplus capital. At the end of the quarter, $425 million remained available for purchase under our previously announced $850 million share buyback program.","I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Pete, and good evening. Tonight, I'll cover the results for the segment, give a brief update on talent and finish with some insight on our continued progress.","Beginning with the results. On an accident quarter basis, excluding CATs, our combined ratio of 97.8% was 3.1 points higher than the prior year, driven by the accident quarter ex-CAT loss ratio of 68%, which is 5.4 points higher than prior year quarter. This was driven by 2 large losses and some smaller losses impacting our aerospace and marine businesses, though this activity was offset by improvements of 1.5 points in our operating leverage and a 0.5 point in acquisition expenses.","We look at the results over a longer horizon, which we believe is the appropriate way to view our portfolio, we see strong evidence of our progress. Our year-to-date accident year ex-CAT combined ratio was 96.1% or 3.2 points better than the same period in 2012. The loss ratio improved by nearly 1 point, driven by better loss experienced at 70% of our businesses. And as Mike mentioned, 96.1% is the best 9-month accident year ex-CAT combined ratio for the segment in more than 5 years.","Insurance gross premiums written grew by $101 million or 9% in the quarter and by $424 million or 11% year-to-date. Growth was particularly strong in North America where premiums grew 15% in the quarter and 23% year-to-date. In the quarter, our North American Construction, Property, Primary and Excess Casualty business experienced the largest percentage growth. Our international P&C and professional books each grew roughly 8% in the quarter and year-to-date.","Turning to talent. We continue to strengthen our teams throughout the segment. In this quarter, we recruited Denise Balan to lead our crisis management team in the U.S. We added Jeff Abramson to head up trade receivable insurance, which is part of our Political Risk & Trade Credit business. And Thierry Daucourt joined as Chief Operating Officer for International P&C, just to name a few.","Over the past 2 years, we've replaced 1\/3 of our business leaders while adding 61 underwriters, and we're now seeing this enhanced underwriting capability reflected in the profitable growth of a majority of our businesses.","Let's dig deeper on our progress. The North American business group had a combined ratio of 87% on a year-to-date basis, with all but one business improving by 5 points or more year-over-year. North American Construction, a new business just 3 years ago, is now a profitable $200 million gross premium written business in 2013. And several of the underwriting actions we have taken over the past 12 to 24 months, terminating unprofitable programs, increasing rates, reducing line sizes and optimizing business mix continue to earn through.","Across this segment, we are pulling on 4 levers to improve our combined ratio: mix of business, underwriting actions, operating leverage and rate. In terms of business mix, building a more profitable portfolio can be achieved in 2 dimensions. First, you can shift your gross portfolio to more profitable lines. Our high and medium-return businesses grew $365 million or 12% year-to-date, while the lower-margin businesses grew just $47 million or 6%. The small growth in the lower-margin businesses is attributed to being in the middle of the re-underwriting process. Effectively, we are finishing the reduction of the underperforming parts of the book and are partway through growing the more profitable segments. And we continually evaluate this mix, including the build-out of new businesses, which are growing 21% year-to-date.","The other dimension is ceded reinsurance. And here, we are benefiting from the improved terms and conditions that Jamie has noted in past quarters. Ceding commissions on pro rata premiums continue to improve, and year-to-date, we ceded $81 million more premium on quota share placements. Here, we also benefit from decreasing excessive loss rates on short-tail lines. Our underwriting talent attracts reinsurers who are looking to align themselves with the best underwriters, and we see this continuing into 2014 and beyond. Underwriting actions are part of any well-run underwriting operation. We've delivered a roughly 1 point loss ratio improvement year-to-date in 2013 from a number of underwriting actions across the segment, and we have identified and are executing on another set of actions for the fourth quarter and into 2014. We continue to demonstrate improved operating leverage with a 2 point lower expense ratio year-to-date.","While this rate of improvement may slow, as Mike noted, we continue to have investments coming to fruition that will further improve our underwriting efficiency.","On rate, year-to-date, we've delivered rates 1.5 points above trend. And while we see short-tail lines in North America slowing, our diversified portfolio allows us to benefit from rate increases in medium and longer-tail lines in other geographies. 82% of our Insurance businesses achieved positive rate in the quarter, 77% of our businesses achieved rate in excess of loss trends and 75% achieved rate-on-rate. Our International P&C books showed the most strength, with rate increases of 6%. Our North American P&C businesses had another solid quarter, with rate increases of 4%. Global Professional had rate increases of 3%, led by our continued push for rate in our U.S. portfolio, and our Specialty businesses were essentially flat in the quarter.","How these levers will drive our improvement will be influenced by market conditions, but we see rate and operational leverage each contributing roughly 20% of the needed improvement and portfolio mix and underwriting actions each delivering approximately 30% of the lift.","Finally, having just returned from large industry gatherings over the past month, I can tell you that the excitement and support for XL for both our clients and brokers is as strong as ever and evident in our growth. Of course, you can verify our momentum with the market. This momentum, coupled with the continued improvement in our underwriting profits, only increases our confidence in achieving our longer-term goal. The urgency is there. And with a team we have in place, we are committed to achieving a combined ratio of 90% or better.","And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.","James H. Veghte","Thank you, Greg, and good evening. XL Re had a very good quarter from a calendar year perspective with a combined ratio of 85.4%, producing an underwriting profit of $65 million. This compares to a combined ratio of 86% in the third quarter of 2012.","Our result was positively impacted by $76 million of prior year reserve releases, which compares to $35.7 million a year ago. Excluding the impact of both prior year reserve releases and CAT losses, the segment had a combined ratio of 86.8%, which compares to the 88% achieved in the third quarter of 2012.","With respect to the reserve releases, we benefited from a significant increase in releases from our international operations of $39 million compared to $19 million a year ago. Overall, we would again stress our prudent reserving philosophy. Our releases were concentrated on short-tail lines, with 70% coming from our property and marine portfolios. Our accident year combined was 102.4% compared to 93.4% in the third quarter of 2012. While disappointing, this was specifically driven by catastrophe losses, none of which were outsized given our market presence in the impacted geographies. The most significant losses impacting the quarter were the German hailstorms for $42.6 million, the floods in Mexico driven by Hurricane Ingrid for $10 million and further development of $8.8 million from the flooding in Calgary earlier this year, all net of reinstatement premiums.","Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $350 million, a 16% reduction from the third quarter of last year. The reductions were largely driven by reduced crop premiums from our North American operations. You will recall, 2012 was our last year of involvement in the Heartland Crop program. And the year-on-year drop in written premium from this cancellation was $45 million, which accounts for 2\/3 of the overall reduction. The remainder comes principally from a $21 million reduction in our Latin American portfolio due to competitive market conditions.","On a year-to-date basis, the segment has generated an outstanding combined ratio of 80.1%, just about identical to the 80.5% in 2012. Excluding the impact of prior year releases and CAT losses, our combined ratio was 83%, which compares favorably to the 86.6% generated a year ago. With respect to the top line, our gross year-to-date premiums has reduced by 6.5% to $1.73 billion, with Heartland representing almost 50% of the drop. The remainder results from a combination of competitive market conditions and client retention, themes we have discussed regularly in the past.","Turning to market conditions. We spoke of our midyear renewals on last quarter's call and I would again describe them as satisfactory. We have attended a number of industry conferences over the last 6 weeks, and there's considerable speculation about the coming renewal season in the property CAT space with abundant capacity available from traditional and nontraditional sources and what appears to be a benign Atlantic hurricane season potentially having some downward pressure on U.S. pricing. With the level of catastrophe activity in Europe through the spring and summer, we see no compelling reason for reductions in that market.","Going into renewals. We are positioned well to deal with the market environment however it plays out. We have a terrific book of business, a world-class stable of underwriters and deep relationships with our customers and brokers. For example, 60% of the premiums in our U.S. CAT portfolio comes from seeding companies we began doing business with in our first year of operations over 20 years ago. It's a heavily syndicated market, and while no one can say with certainty what year end will bring, I am confident we will emerge with a very attractive portfolio of business.","On the long-tail side, you'll notice in our financial supplement an increase in written premium this quarter over a year ago. While market conditions remain very competitive in this area, we did write a significant new account in North America for $7 million. The rest of the increase was due to timing differences and the booking of premium and increase shares, again in our North American business unit. Nevertheless, we remain broadly concerned about the apparent disconnect between an improving rate environment and the insurance sector and very competitive terms and conditions being offered in the Reinsurance market.","With that, I'll return to David for Q&A.","David R. Radulski","And Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is the second quarter in a row where we've had some issues in the Insurance segment. This quarter, it was some attrition -- some elevated attritional losses, last quarter was adjusting a loss pick. So I'm just trying to get a sense of, do we think we have those issues out of the way? Or is there anything else that causes you any concern on the horizon?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Jay. It's Greg. As we discussed last quarter, we increased the loss picks in a few businesses, and therefore, we had 2-quarter earned impact in the second quarter. So we normalize for that change, right? Our first and second quarter accident year ex-CAT loss ratios were virtually identical at 64.5%. So for me, the third quarter is the first quarter this year where we had some noise, right? Let me discuss some of the drivers. I noted that we had 2 losses above our large loss threshold of $10 million, as well as loss activity in our aerospace and marine businesses, right? In marine, we have and continued to underwrite in the competitive market and I'm not surprised to see loss activity, and this was essentially in our Holland cargo lines this quarter. As Mike said, we look at the leadership, underwriting and strategy when we have a higher loss ratio quarter. And in marine, we've recently changed the dealership and have confidence in our underwriting go-forward strategy for the business. On the aerospace side, it's been a very strong performer for us over the past few years and this quarter is purely an aberration with regard to loss frequency. The particular portfolio where the business came from is running in the low- to mid-50s. This was just an unfortunate quarter tick-up in loss frequency. We have not observed anything in the losses, the underwriting and it challenges our ability to continue to make money in aerospace.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So overall, within Insurance, you're still committed to that 90% normalized combined ratio, probably not 2014 but maybe in '15?","Gregory S. Hendrick","I won't commit to the time but absolutely committed to that goal.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then for Pete, on investment income, it actually ticked up on a linked quarter basis, $148 million. That was better than we thought. Were there any onetimers in there? Or should we be thinking about that now as a run rate before we adjust for the higher yielding securities coming off the book?","Peter R. Porrino","No, there wasn't -- Jay, it's Pete. There wasn't anything in the quarter that at all moved that investment income around. Very, very much a runway.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then the net income from investment affiliates, $5 million this quarter, down pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter, as well as year-over-year. What was the driver there?","Peter R. Porrino","I wouldn't say that there's any specific driver. You're going to get a lot of movement quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter. I mean, we look at this one, it's a little similar to where we look at Insurance, right? We look at this on a -- probably on a year basis, annual basis. And on that, we're very happy with the returns that we've been seeing.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If you were to think about a normalized return level on that asset base, what would it be and what would that imply on net income?","Peter R. Porrino","Yes, we would say -- let's call it 8%.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On an asset base of...","Peter R. Porrino","On the asset base of -- depending on which one you want. So we have 2 or 3 different asset bases that we could use, right? Do you want the old? Do you want the -- which one do want, Jay?","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I'm looking at the investment affiliates, so I guess it would be the sum of the alternative funds plus the private investment fund affiliates.","Peter R. Porrino","Right. So we have, in the affiliates, right, we've got about $1.4 billion invested in that. That would include the strategic affiliates, right? So if you back that out, it's about $1.2 billion, right? And we disclosed in the financial supplement and I know you haven't had a lot of time to go through it, we disclosed what the return's on that. And if you go back and look over the year, I think you'd find it to be pretty healthy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, first one for Jamie. Jamie, just curious, how much of your 1:1 CAT renewals is Europe or international versus the U.S.?","James H. Veghte","I don't have the precise breakdown, Brian, but I will tell you virtually 100% of the European CAT renewals are 1:1. I mean, it's a very heavily concentrated 1:1 business.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And that's the one you said you should expect that pricing is going to be pretty stable, maybe up a little bit given the CAT activity?","James H. Veghte","Certainly, the impacted program should be up. I don't know what the overall market will do, but my expectation is that will have an overall flat risk-adjusted.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I'm just curious on the increase in the pro rata on the insurance book. What impact is that having on your combined ratio? Seeing it was 50, 100 basis point in the expense ratio, is there any way we can quantify that? And is it...","James H. Veghte","It would be roughly 50 basis points in '13 year-to-date on the expense ratio.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then basically, the same with respect to the other ratios?","James H. Veghte","Yes.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just last one, just curious, you lost a fairly senior person recently. It was announced in your North America business. Do you expect any potential top line impact from that loss?","Michael S. McGavick","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to go back and ask a few more questions, following up on Jay's. If you look at 2012 versus 2011, the company reported about 650 basis points of margin improvement on the Insurance business ex-CATs and x development. So far, 2, 3 quarters, if we look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, your loss ratio is up by about 1.8% compared to the year-ago period. You're continuing to get rate increases, I assume, and this is spread over 12 months. Do you think that it's possible you're a little aggressive initially in booking 2012?","Gregory S. Hendrick","So Josh, let me walk you through the trailing 12-month figures that I have and maybe we need to true them up a bit. When I look at -- I find that this longer time period is really necessary for us, so I'm thrilled that you're bringing it up. If you go back to the financial supplement, the trailing 12 months ending September 30, I have an accident year ex-CAT combined ratio of 104.8% in 2010, 100.8% in 2011 and 96.5% in 2013. And look at the loss ratio, I've got 74%, 67.9% and 66.1%.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","[indiscernible] obviously, you're right. That's right. Yes, yes.","Gregory S. Hendrick","So it's -- we like that trend that we see from '10 -- from '10 to '11 to '12 to '13. But I can't forecast where it would be in '14, but I like the way that looks.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, I mean, you might have an idea. I mean, you've rewritten probably 50% of the business, is going to be earning through in 2014. Do you have some sense there?","Michael S. McGavick","Right. this is Mike. We've made it a point and we're going to have to continue to make it a point not to forecast what's going to happen. Generally, in the first quarter next year, we'll try to give you some view of how we're thinking about buybacks, some view of expenses because we know those are harder for anyone else to figure out. But I just -- but on terms of loss ratios and combined ratios, we just don't forecast that. But I will tell you, the trends that Greg just described of essentially a 4-point improvement year-over-year, 2 years in a row, 4 points each year, is the kind of progress we expect. Whether that will be the exact amount of lift, as you get closer to your target, each point becomes a bit more of a scramble. But we're awfully pleased with our progress the momentum it gives us.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Did you have a sense of what you think you're getting in terms of rate right now, compared with loss costs?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, as Greg mentioned a moment ago, we're getting about 1 point to 1.5 point better in rate than we are observing in loss costs.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And that goes to reinsurance also?","James H. Veghte","We don't measure things the same way. We measure rate adequacy overall. And clearly, our rate adequacy level in the entire portfolio has come down, principally because of downward pressure in the CAT market.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's not your fault.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Greg, I wondered if I could follow up a bit more and get a bit more color on some of the reunderwriting actions you guys are doing. I think, one of the things you said in the intro remarks was that something like 30% of your businesses are still performing below target. A couple of questions there are, if these are newer businesses, among the things you've been investing in or if they're older ones? And sort of what are some examples of the things you guys are doing today and the sort of year-end and into '14 in this businesses on the underwriting initiative side? And wondering when some of these things really started?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure. Josh, let me step back and give you -- as I look at the portfolio today and factor in the rate and the underwriting actions you're asking about that we've completed and playing. I view the portfolio in 3 parts: the business that's performing at target, the business that's within 5% of target, and the business more than 5% away from target. Over the last 12 to 18 months, we've moved the percentage of the book that's at target from 25% to 50%. So I would say, we're seeing the actions come through already.","Just that middle part is about the same, at that, business within 5% of target is at 30%. And what's happening there, of course, is businesses are moving out of that into above target and coming up from well away from target.","And the businesses that are more than 5% from our target have shrunk from 40% to about 20%. It's important to remember that in that book, in the piece is our new businesses that are coming online, because they're going to be expense drags for the first year as they get up online.","The underwriting actions, we'd have to spend -- we have to spend half an hour going through all of them. It's the actuarial team and the underwriting teams have them, but the effect will fall in that category I talked about: there's pricing; there's tiering by industry, by geography; there's in -- limit management; there's attachment and deductible management; and just a whole host of them that move across the book and drive that results. So they're coming in already and they're going to keep coming, because that's the relentless exercise you have to do to be an excellent underwriting operation.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I don't want to simplify the work of sort of real people who specialize in this, but for all of our benefits, would you characterize them sort of execution on a lot of sort of detailed fronts that all of which have to perform? Or are there still sort of major levers which you guys are pulling, where we can look at this as, perhaps, sort of simpler to bank on going forward?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, this is Mike. The simple stuff was done a while ago. I mean, the reality is with the book improving at the rate it's improving, we're down to a whole bunch of little decisions, whether it has to do with limit strategy, reinsurance strategy, particular classes that we identify with some kind of a temperature, that kind of thing. And as a result, we believe that we're down to a narrower box of business that we can really get at that granular level and just keep driving it out of our system.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Well, keep up -- we'll keep waiting for all the hard work to pay out.","Michael S. McGavick","I appreciate that and I understand the view at the same time, when I look it year-over-year-over-year, I'm very excited about the rate of progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is, do you have a number for the higher losses in the primary Insurance segment that negatively impact the quarter?","Gregory S. Hendrick","So Vinay, so on the aerospace and marine piece, it's roughly $14 million for marine, $16 million for aerospace, and that's the main chunks on those pieces. The other 2 large losses, as you know, we don't talk about large losses because they'd be, in our industry, events that reflect a specific insurance.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure, that's helpful. The second question is on -- could you give us an update on the 4 lines of business last quarter where you trued up the losses, please?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, I can. They're -- everything is unchanged, both those ones that we trued up and the rest of the book, other than this activity we talked about, are unchanged from last quarter.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So just to or restate this, this quarter was really noise from large loss activity and it's got nothing to do with what happened the last quarter, correct?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Correct.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And just a numbers question here. The tax rate you released to 10% for year to date. Should we expect the 10% also for the fourth quarter? Plus, what's a normalized tax rate sort of looking into next year?","Peter R. Porrino","So Vinay, it's Pete. The -- on the tax rates, we went into this year planning about a 12% tax rate and, as I said in my comments, we took that down to 10% when we looked at where the taxes were. Well, the gains and losses were coming in, in our jurisdiction by jurisdiction and that included looking to Q4.","I don't see anything different in Q4 versus what happened to date. It is hard to tell because it will depend somewhat on loss activity. But, no, I don't expect anything different. So I would, if I was trying to help you think through that, I don't know why we've moved it from 10%, but then again, I don't think 10% is the run rate on a sort of beginning-of-the-year basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, Mike, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned recent upgrades by the rating agencies. Just curious if those upgrades would impact the rating agencies or XL's views of excess capital levels or maybe other things?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, so let me -- why don't we cover 2 things really quick. Number one, our view of the capital levels required, and then let me ask Greg and Jamie to both comment on the way in which this may trade some additional opportunities for us, which were -- first of all, you have to know that given all that we've been through since the time of these downgrades, this is an incredibly gratifying day for us. And we feel an enormous validation of the hard work of thousands of people around the world. So I hope all the XL colleagues who are listening in right now are feeling especially proud of all the effort of these past years.","In terms of capital, the fact is that the -- we derive our capital from an absolute level of buffer that we want to maintain, and then we add to that absolute level an additional buffer, if you will, that is driven by what we would call qualitative factors. Among the qualitative factors that we use to evaluate the right level of buffer to the buffer would be where our rating is. And so having our rating improve will likely cause us to reduce, somewhat, that buffer to the buffer. I wouldn't, however, start cashing checks from share repurchase increases. We've been helpfully repurchasing shares throughout the year, as Pete indicated, and I don't think it's the kind of number that would have a meaningful impact on repurchases. Of course, we'll give more color on repurchase for '14 when we get there. But it's a positive but it's not a huge number as we look at it initially. The board, of course, makes that judgment ultimately, based on our advice, and we won't have a chance to discuss that with -- until we discuss the budget in December. So that's how we look at the capital bit. Jamie?","James H. Veghte","Yes, I mean, think broadly, it's certainly going to help us as we trade. It's an endorsement of the strength of our balance sheet, and all of our partners will recognize that. I think specifically, however, it is certainly going to help us in long-tail lines where there are certain ceding companies that will not trade, historically, with reinsurers rated below certain levels. And I think that will certainly add some opportunities for us.","Gregory S. Hendrick","On the Insurance side, it's a little less rating-agency sensitive than on the Reinsurance side. But it should help marginally on our international book. That's where it would get the most attention to it, under international T&C [ph] book but it is on the mark.","Michael S. McGavick","And I would also, Mike, just to make sure we're clear, S&P actually increased the rating from an A to an A+ on the FSR rating. A.M. Best was a change in outlook to a positive outlook on the issuer credit rating. So just to be clear, we have an outlook change from A.M. Best. We have an actual rating change from S&P.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. Very helpful. Lastly, for Greg, I believe the answer is no from your remarks so far. But -- so would you say, how much of the kind of higher attritional losses emanated from kind of the business lines you had previously classified in the past as challenged. I know we don't use that term anymore.","Gregory S. Hendrick","None.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess, first for Jamie, I guess, for our model, can you talk about the Heartland premiums that were in the fourth quarter of 2012?","James H. Veghte","I believe the year-to-date number for the fourth quarter was $60 million. The vast majority of it was captured in the first 3 quarters of 2012, I believe $58 million part of the $60 million.","Peter R. Porrino","Jay, this is Pete. We can come back to separately if those numbers are not exactly right.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, check them out. If they're not, obviously, you'll let me know. But it sounds like you should have a big distorting factor in the fourth quarter. I guess then, maybe, a -- excuse me?","James H. Veghte","That would certainly will not.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Question I guess, for Mike. As you look at the business now, obviously, your margin towards a higher ROE, based on where you're heading, based on where interest rates are, where you see the market, would you be disappointed if you don't see a double-digit ROE in 2015?","Michael S. McGavick","Jay, that's such a clever way to ask me to forecast. But I may go out on a limb and say yes. I would be disappointed.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So one question I had, I guess, was we've kind of talked about these large losses. But maybe, asking it this way, excluding those items, if you just look at like rate-driven margin expansion, what did that look like in the third quarter?","Gregory S. Hendrick","The rate-driven margin expansion for the Insurance segment would be about 1%. That 1.5 point rate above trend times the loss ratio gives you about a 1% lift.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then as far as that crop business, I mean, do you expect to replace that premium with either other crop business or other Reinsurance business?","James H. Veghte","Well, we have. I think we've mentioned, Mike, on previous calls, we began a new relationship this year with an agency in California called Global Agriculture. In the third quarter, we booked $11.4 million of premium from them. We would expect, on an annualized basis, that could be in the mid-30s.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Great. And then, I guess, one question, I think, I don't know if I got this exactly right but on property CAT reinsurance, it sounded like there's a bit of a disconnect there between kind of the reinsurance, insurance markets and what trends are on the pricing side. What -- if you see that, first off, do you expect to grow that business at 1 1, particularly in North America?","James H. Veghte","Well, we certainly have room to grow from a risk-management perspective. You will have seen our limited profile in the Q up from the second quarter. Whether we grow or not depends entirely on the trading environment at year-end. I mean, we are not top line driven. We never have been. We anticipate and ended up with a very attractive-looking portfolio but we'll grow it if the terms and conditions are right. I don't know what more else to say. It's a hugely syndicated market. And we'll just have to see what the trading environment looks like at year-end.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And what -- is the trade-off more about kind of filling that space with -- filling your quota for that business or in the absolute return or the kind of blended return of the portfolio. Because, I guess, you can imagine a scenario where pricing is not great, margins are not great but from a risk-management and risk-adjusted perspective, you still see value in writing that business? How do you think about that?","James H. Veghte","I'd say a couple of things. One is we've been very consistent with the way we measure rate adequacy, which I mentioned a few questions ago. Even with the reductions at midyear, our U.S. CAT portfolio is at about 100% rate adequacy. So if we see business at those levels, we'll certainly look to write it. There are other geographies that are not as well rated and significant reductions there will probably cause us to reduce our position in those markets. And finally, we've never taken the view that we will write very inexpensive business in some geographies simply because it's there and it's the only business that you can write in those territories. If it's really cheap, we just pass on it.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it and then just last one, I guess. To the extent that, that proportion of business falls down, where would you most likely be predisposed to deploy that capital, I guess, within Reinsurance into Insurance and, maybe for Mike and Pete, back into buybacks?","Michael S. McGavick","No, it's really a question of opportunity. As we look across the book, one of the advantages we have is the many product lines we're in, the many geographies we're in. And we see a number of profitable opportunities across the globe that where we can grow in put money to work. At the same time, we do have return hurdles in mind, and when those return hurdles can't be met by continuing to put money behind businesses , we put it -- while we maintain the buffers I described, we then turn it to share repurchases. So that's kind of 3-step process, has been as long as I've been here and we'll go through that entire process.","And then I should just be clear, that could be opportunity in Reinsurance, it could be an opportunity in Insurance. It just depends on what we see out there. Clearly right now if you were to bet on where it might go to work, I would say it would be more likely these days to go to work in the Insurance book, given broadly what we're seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I'm struggling with how to ask this. But can you help us understand what it is that you did not see that would have suggested that there was, maybe, a deeper problem with the attritional losses?","Michael S. McGavick","Meyer, you're either in a speaker phone or we couldn't hear that very well. Could we do that one more time?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, I'm happy to. I'm not sure it made sense the first time anyway. Can you talk about what it was that you didn't see that had you seen it, would have suggested that there's actually, maybe, a more fundamental problem in the attritional losses that you saw in the quarter?","Michael S. McGavick","I mean, that's the point I was making in the opening that Greg has reinforced. We do have a process. Any time we see this kind of -- an unusual level of loss activity, we've gone through that process. In our view, in these cases, there was nothing we couldn't have foreseen that we hadn't foreseen, that would have changed this outcome. It's a matter of being in this business, and these particular clients at this particular point in time, and has -- doesn't change our view of our mix of business. So our business is going forward.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I can't remember if it was Greg, but somebody said that there's 1.5 point gap between current rate increases and loss cost trends. Are those current loss cost trends like what we're seeing right now or sort of anticipated long-term rates?","Gregory S. Hendrick","They're over the long-term, but they are -- the loss cost trends hold true this quarter. That is a quarterly figure. So it's -- we don't twist them around violently quarter-to-quarter but it's the most recent quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the levers that you used when you mentioned in your remarks that you didn't need rate to get to your profit goals. And if that's so, just expand upon exactly what that -- if we didn't have rate tomorrow, what would you do to get there?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, just to be clear, Paul, we keep doing what we're doing. We don't count on rate. The plan from the beginning didn't count on rate. Obviously, if you get a lot of rate, it changes how things work and you get even more benefit from the actions you're taking. But between our reunderwriting and between our remixing towards more profitable lines of business, either because we're adding lines of business that we find to be lower combined ratio historically, or because we are increasing or growing in lines of business that we have produced historical differences. I'm going to give you 2 examples: crisis management, we're building out a very nice business right now. Right now, it's a negative drag but we expect it to be a very substantial contributor to our 90-degree goal -- or 90% combined ratio goal. At the same time we're growing very nicely and have been for a couple of years in North American property where we're achieving an excellent result. So that's an example of a new line of activity and there's an example of an existing business we're putting more capital behind it in order to increase.","As we -- that causes a remixing of the books of business towards greater profitability, and we are also going to see, as I mentioned, continuing lift from operational investments that are being harvested. When you add those together, none of those are dependent on rate. They're about our own actions and completely within our own control.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. I'm keeping the fate. My second question is completely unrelated and should be a softball. Any thoughts on this new accounting that we're coming down the pike from: the SP [ph] and the ISAP.","Peter R. Porrino","So Paul, I'd say I understand the technical merit of some of the proposed changes that they're talking about, particularly around the discounting reserves. But I'm really concerned that these types of changes are going to have a pretty significant implementation cost and have the potential to add quite a bit of volatility and comparability as you start with our reported results.","The other thing I'd say is, we've always been really supportive of the creation of a single global accounting standard. And we're pretty disappointed that the global accounting policy makers couldn't come together here and come up with a single view. And knowing that, that single view is not coming about in the near term, we don't see any reason to significantly change an approach that seems to be well understood by the users of the financial info.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman with BAM.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","I guess, my first is for Jamie on the Reinsurance accident year. The 87 [ph] is obviously a little better year-over-year, but it's few points worse than the first half. I'm not quite sure which one to benchmark it against, but was there anything unusual in this quarter versus the first half?","James H. Veghte","Yes, we had a couple large losses. We had $2 million from the property loss from the Quebec train crash. Like train crash, we had a $6 million warehouse fire loss in France and $5 million loss from the Asiana air crash.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it. Okay. And then to Greg, I guess, the large losses, it's been sort of a frequent theme over the years, right, some quarters, very good, some quarters poor. But it seems like your volatility in large losses is greater than what I would consider your peers'. And I get some of that is a type of lines you write. But is other things you could be proactive about to manage that respectively? Meaning, do you need or have you reviewed whether you think your line sizes are too big or were you play in a syndicated? Or maybe you should buy more per risk reinsurance to manage it? Or are there things you can do and, I mean, there are, obviously, other things you can do. I guess, the equation is why have you chosen not to do those things?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, this is Mike. Let me start, this is much more about who we are and how we're designed. When you look at a lot of our peers, many of them have very large blocks of kind of low-volatility business and we don't have that. We're all about volatility around here. So that does make us a bit different.","At the same time, there are a lot of things we can do and we have been doing them and that's exactly the news and I make such a big fuss over the difference between the fourth quarter of '11 and the impact of the same kind of activity today. Then, it was a 108 combined. Today, we still made an underwriting profit. That is because we have been doing the very kinds of things that you just described. You could ask, \"Are we there yet?\" And until we're running pretty regularly these 90 combines, the answer is no. And so, is there more we can do? We're doing those things. And I think that they are showing their effectiveness by the fact that on this trailing 12-month basis, we continue to see such a dramatic improvement in the performance of the book.","Gregory S. Hendrick","And I view it in -- so on the profit side, when are you going to get the profit pool bigger? The split I use before of at target, near target and away from target, we need to get that to about 70 20 10, right? That will help create a bigger profit pool to buffer against this. But as Mike noted, we've grown our property premium in North America dramatically the past couple of years, but we kept our CAT retentions flat in dollar terms and we bought a little bit lower down the risk cover. We've reduced our excess cows in that line by about 15%. We've reduced our professional net lines in some areas pretty measurably. So we are doing those things. It is a constant analysis of trying to balance how much profit I have in the portfolio and how much I'm willing to let anyone set a risk move against it.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","That's very helpful color, actually. If can ask one more? The other way I looked at it, Greg, is if I take the average of the last 6 quarters, excluding the tough Q1 of a year ago, it's right around the 96 and even looking the last 3 quarters of last year versus the first 3 of this year are about the same. So it seems like we're kind of stuck at this 96, and so, how do we get from 96 to 90? I guess, the presumption of the question is I'd thought there'd be a little bit more gradual improvement, rather than sort of being in this 96 range for 6 straight quarters if I smear that out.","Gregory S. Hendrick","So I would say, there is an unusually, an unusually good quarter in Q3 '12, right, which is driving this the quarter-over-quarter different, where we had our lowest loss ratio in a few years. So there's a little bit of that. There's unusually good quarter that happened in the midst of that strength. But I'd tell you, I'd take it back to that trailing 12 months, the '11, '12, '13 where we're 104, 100.8 and 96.5, and that is what we -- that's what we're observing that we're seeing it move through. I just don't -- I'm afraid I just don't spend a lot of time analyzing quarter-to-quarter.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Okay, I guess, what I was really doing is taking the 100 [ph] play of last year and stripping out the first quarter, because that was a tough one, and seeing if you do those back 3 quarters, it's more like 1 point than 4 points. And a good chunk of that seems to be expense ratio improvement, which is fair, which is a fair way to get there. I don't care if you get there through loss or expense but...","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, I mean, look, I got to be clear. Again, when we look at it and the way we look at it, you can see why we're as excited as we are. At the same time, if you ask your question in a different way, would we like the loss ratio to be improving more quickly? The answer is yes. Do we think that the right actions are in place to cause that? We do, and that is the source of our confidence. So I appreciate what you're saying but that's the way we look at it.","Operator","Our final question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Just 2 quick questions. Just going back to Ian's question, the traditional losses in Q3 2012, was that number sort of 0? Is that what you were implying when you said -- I'm not talking about the crop losses but was that component 0?","Michael S. McGavick","There was only one significant loss in the third quarter a year ago and it was modest, Ian. So the answer essentially is yes.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Okay. Because I was trying to do an apples-to-apples comparison. That's helpful. I guess the only other question I have is a quick one is, do you have any exposure to the Spanish surety bond issue?","James H. Veghte","Yes, it's Jamie here. We have some in the Reinsurance segment. We took $6.3 million in incurred losses in this quarter. We have total up of about $11 million. We've done an analysis to the portfolio and we believe if everything went to hell, we have less than $20 million of additional exposure in the entire portfolio, all accident years.","Gregory S. Hendrick","And the answer for Insurance is no.","Operator","And at this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, I just want to thank everybody for their thorough questioning. As I said before, while we remain a work in progress and we can see areas where we still need to do more work. And in a sense, even when you get there, you work to stay there. But the rate of progress, we are very pleased by. This business today, we feel very complimented by the results over at S&P and I know our people really feel good about that recognition. And we are determined to drive it to the bottom line, and we're looking forward to next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group Ltd Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Earnings Call. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Abbe Goldstein of XL's Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you. Welcome to XL Group's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at xlgroup.com. We've posted to our Web site several documents, including our earnings press release, our quarterly financial statements and presentation slides we will refer to on the call.","On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL's CEO, will offer opening remarks; Steve Robb, our CFO, will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, President of P&C, who will review the Insurance and Reinsurance segment results and market conditions. We will then open-up the call for questions.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statements in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, operating net income, operating ROE measures that are based on operating net income and fully diluted tangible book value per share. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our Web site and the earnings release included as an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing our fourth quarter 2017 results.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.","Michael McGavick","Good evening, and thank you for joining our call to discuss XL's fourth quarter and full-year 2017. First, I will start by giving you my perspective on the quarter and the year end, and why we feel positive about where we\u2019re going, particularly with the market conditions that we\u2019re seeing. Then Steve will provide more information on the results, and Greg will discuss our P&C operations. And then, of course, we'll take your questions.","2017 and to a good degree the fourth quarter on its own were obviously characterized by severe natural catastrophes, and our results reflect these severe losses. That said, we feel quite positive about what\u2019s ahead across four important dimensions. First, the fact that we came through these events was surplus capital enabling us to compete forward in the market. Second, what the 2017 ex-cat results say about the future contribution of underwriting income to the operating earnings.","Third, the many signs of our growing market leadership. And finally, fourth and perhaps most important, what we learn from the market through these events and how it aligns with the strategic journey we have been on especially in terms of the pricing now available in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace.","First, in terms of capital. Going into 2017, we carried a significant capital buffer, which served this purpose and allowed us to absorb these significant losses. As we start 2018, we continue to have a solid capital position as measured by our internal regulatory and rating agency models. And as we said on our last call, we did pause our buyback program following the third quarter cats.","We have no immediate plans to resume it, though we will continue to evaluate this as the year and the markets develop. This decision serves several purposes including building and even greater buffer and keeping capital flexibility to respond to the still developing market opportunities.","Second, the underlying year. On an ex cat basis, we feel good about the otherwise tough year. For example, both the fourth quarter and the full-year insurance accident year ex cat combined ratio and loss ratio were better than in the prior year periods. And their accident year ex cat P&C combined ratio was 90.2% for 2017, just better than we were a year ago in this challenging market. Our reinsurance accident year ex cat combined ratio increased year-over-year in line with planned mix changes as Greg will discuss. Taken together, these are good underlying ex cat results.","Third, in terms of market relevance, the relationships with our clients and our broker partners have remained steadfast without exception. For the fourth quarter, P&C GWP grew by 18% over fourth quarter 2016. For 2017, our GWP of $14.8 billion is an 8% increase over 2016, and we continue to see more risks and select the risk we want. Forexample, insurance submissions were up 5% across the board in 2017, when adjusting for the underwriting actions we took during the year. At the same time, our bound percentage decreased as we continued to exercise pricing discipline. This trend continued in the fourth quarter and we saw no change to our momentum at January 1.","There are two other indicators of our stronger market position. We hear consistent feedback that we are at the early and firm edge of pushing for appropriate pricing. Our reputation for technical and non-reactionary pricing serves us very well here. We also think it is a reflection of having a very flat organization with localized leadership deeply expert in their individual markets. This mix -- this makes us respected, knowledgeable, and fast.","And the second indicator is the continuing awards we are receiving demonstrating our leadership and client excellence and in product development. For example, for the second straight year, highest customer satisfaction among large commercial insurers in North America from J.D. Power, number one in the London market as measured by Gracechurch, and first place in and Advisen's Innovation Index amongst other recognitions.","Finally, fourth and most importantly, the several aspects regarding the cats and the market's reaction to them. As for our own reinsurance protections, there are always learnings from every active storm season about the effectiveness of one's protections and we've acted wherever we saw opportunities for improvement. We also observed from the market's response to these events how to reshape our earnings engine to the current opportunities.","The strategic flexibility to do so comes from the long journey we have been on to diversify our earnings both by product and geography. At this point in that journey, it is clear that reducing meaningfully our volatility in the cat space, while maintaining and monetizing in new ways the market position and high-quality customer base we've built these many years is the right thing to do.","We have been doing this through our ceded programs in both traditional reinsurance and even more so with long-standing alternative capital partners. You'll see from our actions in the fourth quarter and at 1\/1 that we\u2019ve made good strides and we're not done. To be blunt, the more efficient cost of capital has allowed us to do so on quite attractive terms.","At the same time, the rate reaction in the market validates the greater emphasis we have been placing on the primary marketplace and on Lloyd's. While Greg will discuss rate further in a moment, having coming through the first round of renewals, we're seeing more or less what we said we expected would occur in our Q3 call broadly improving conditions of around 3.5% rate gain in insurance and around 5% reinsurance overall with loss affected accounts seeing double-digit strengthening.","A couple of points on this are worth emphasizing here. First, it\u2019s early in this process. At this point, we've only seen the January renewals which are important, but don't fully reflect current conditions. For example, there were multiyear contracts in place that haven't yet been touched and renewals which occurred early in Q4 before storm effects were fully known. There's still a lot of premium to come, including the bulk of the loss affected accounts which will give us more information and more opportunities.","Second, as I said, we believe this is the start of the slow turn, while each line will react differently, but the aggregate should continue to point toward more consistent and more sustainable rate levels. This broader market turn across most property, casualty, and specialty classes fit well with our diversified product offering.","And three, in a market transition like this as mentioned a moment ago, we feel that our flat organizational structure works to our advantage. Our underwriters get the message quickly and that flows directly to our clients and brokers quickly. We've seen evidence that as other organizations underwriting action begin to match their tough words at the top, the market overall strengthens its determination to be paid fairly for the risk that we assume.","In sum, as regards to rate -- as regards rate, it is early but we like what we are seeing that matches us well and allows us to accelerate our strategic journey as we shift our profit engine into higher gear. So all in, a tough year. We learned a great deal and we're taking action to make changes where we think it's needed. But it was also a year where our colleagues and clients remain steadfast and where we produced a solid underlying result albeit overshadowed by the significant catastrophe losses.","As we look at our industry, we feel we are very well positioned for what comes next.","With that, I will turn it over to Steve.","Stephen Robb","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. We\u2019ve expanded our earnings presentation again this quarter as part of our ongoing effort to enhance disclosures. Financial results in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2017 were impacted by significant catastrophes. But excluding these events, we are pleased with the further progress we saw in our growing and diversified underlying operations and the continued strength of our balance sheet.","Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $29 million compared to $305 million in the same period last year or $0.11 and $1.12 per fully diluted share, respectively. For the same period, operating earnings were $116 million compared to $128 million or $0.45 compared to $0.47 per fully diluted share.","Earnings in the quarter were primarily driven by fourth quarter net catastrophe losses as previously disclosed. These impacts were partially offset by lower operating expenses and higher net investment income. Net income was also impacted by $101 million one-time tax charge related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset as a result of the reduced U.S corporate income tax rate enacted as a part of U.S tax reform.","Operating ROE, excluding AOCI and integration costs, was negative 4.8% for 2017 compared to positive 6.2% for 2016. While catastrophe losses in the second half of year clearly impacted overall returns we believe that earnings in the first half of the year signaled a growing earnings power we can deliver.","Turning to the fourth quarter catastrophes. Consistent with our preannouncement, our total pre-tax net catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter were $315 million or 11.5 loss ratio points, resulting primarily from wildfires in California. We\u2019ve provided detailed breakdown of the gross and net cat losses in the fourth quarter and the full-year on Slide 9 in our earnings presentation.","The breakdown of net cat losses by segment in the quarter was approximately 63% insurance and 37% reinsurance. Overall, for the full-year, our net catastrophe losses were approximately $2 billion stood almost evenly between insurance and reinsurance. And the break down by the year -- break down for the year by geography was approximately 55% related to mainland U.S., 33% in the Caribbean, and 12% related to other international events.","The fourth quarter is a ground up valuation quarter for us, as it relates to prior year development or PYD. We had favorable PYD of $54 million in the fourth quarter or 2 loss ratio points compared to favorable development of $106 million or 4.3 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2016. This reflects favorable development of $11 million from the insurance segment and $43 million from the reinsurance segment.","Development in the quarter was primarily driven by releases in North American insurance and reinsurance casualty, partially offset by additional strengthening in international professional and London wholesale property. For the full-year, development was favorable $148 million, split $42 million from insurance and $106 million from reinsurance or 1.4 loss ratio points compared to $302 million or 3.1 loss ratio points in the prior year. It's worth noting that 2017 includes adverse development related to the Ogden rate change in the U.K.","As Mike noted, we continue to take a thoughtful look at our overall risk return profile and specifically our ceded reinsurance program. While we remain confident in our general strategy and the programs core components, there are always lessons to be learned and we've taken meaningful steps to enhance our protections which Greg will detail and which reduced our pro forma catastrophe exposures as illustrated on Slides 15 and 16.","We believe these reductions at exposures are aligned with the market conditions we're seeing in early 2018. Overall, we anticipate lower worldwide aggregate exposures in 2018 compared to '17 on both an absolute basis and relative to our capital position. Throughout the year, we will continue to refine our coverages balancing protection in economics.","Operating expenses were $407 million in the quarter, a 21% or $110 million favorable comparison to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by the absence of integration costs during the current quarter compared to $59 million in the prior year and the reduction to the variable compensation costs associated with the catastrophe losses in the quarter.","For the full-year of 2017 operating expenses excluding integration costs were $1.68 billion, which were below the low end of our previous guidance due to primarily to the impact of catastrophe losses on variable compensation. For 2018, we expect operating expenses to be in the range of $1.75 million to $1.85 billion. This of course is at normalized variable compensation levels and will not have any integration costs.","It's expected that any increase in expenses will be a fraction of business growth, thereby continuing to drive operating expense leverage. During the quarter, we recognized income tax charges of $77 million. This charge was largely driven by the $101 million one-time DTA right down I mentioned earlier. Also included in the tax charge was the remaining tax benefit that relates to our third quarter losses.","As I mentioned in our last earnings call, the net tax benefit associated with the third quarter cat losses must be recognized over the second half of 2017 and not exclusively in the third quarter. Our operating effective tax rate excluding discrete items was negative .5% for the quarter, a negative .7% for the year and those compared to 16.6% in the prior year quarter and 10.7% in the prior year.","Looking ahead based on our preliminary assessment and consistent with our previous disclosure, we do not currently expect U.S tax reform to have a material impact on our average global effective tax rate.","Turning to investment portfolio and as usual my comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income was $186 million compared to $161 million in the prior year fourth quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher reinvestment rates in the quarter, from active sector rotation and portfolio management activities.","During the fourth quarter, our average new money rate was 2.3% compared to 2% in the fourth quarter of last year and 2.6% in the third quarter of this year. The new money rate continue to be positively influenced by targeted rebalancing of the fixed income portfolio. The gross book yield of fixed income portfolio remain stable quarter-over-quarter at 2.6% and the duration of the total investment portfolio decreased marginally to 3.6 years due to an increase in cash and short-term investments.","Net income from affiliates was $15 million for the quarter compared to $48 billion for the prior quarter, primarily due to lower hedge fund performance. As we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, our hedge fund portfolio is less correlated to equity markets as we've typically taken while only equity risk. On a more passive basis and other parts of our investment portfolio, the fourth quarter of 2016 also benefited from a one-time rebalancing gain.","Net unrealized gains were $565 million at the end of the quarter and the total mark-to-market return from the investment portfolio was .5% for the quarter and original currency, and 3.4% for the full-year.","Turning to capital. On Slides 13 and 14, we described our capital management structure and adequacy. On our last earnings call, we announced that we\u2019ve suspended our share buybacks for the fourth quarter. We continue to have $529 million of common shares available for repurchase under our authorization.","Mike noted earlier, we do not plans to repurchase shares in the near-term. We will continue to evaluate the levels and uses of our surplus capital as the year and markets develop. Our significant surplus buffering '17 provide a resiliency to our capital position. We continue to manage our risk in alignment with our related capital, so as to be in a position to execute on overall strategy in all markets.","Overall capital levels are viewed through a number of lenses, some of which are publicly available including recent reports from the rating agencies as well as our group regulatory position with the BMA. Our capital adequacy remain solid and redundant to all of our key external measure and constraints, including rating agencies regulatory and internal capital model levels.","At December 31, 2017 our debt leverage comprised of our senior debt was a 11.4% and our financial leverage was 32%. The majority of our financial leverage consists of securities with loss absorbency features, such as mandatory or optional coupon deferrals, and all of our financial leverage qualifies as regulatory capital. We have ample flexibility to reduce this leverage during the upcoming year through a combination of operating earnings as well as active asset and liability management.","With that, I will turn the call over to Greg and look forward to your questions.","Gregory Hendrick","Thanks, Steve. So I will start with our underlying results, discuss catastrophe losses, summarize our ceded reinsurance program, touching on our market presence and finish with some comments on market conditions, including some insights on our January 1 renewals.","Starting with the underlying results, as you can see on Page 8 of our presentation, the insurance segments accident quarter ex cat combined ratio was 91.7% compared to 90.3% in the fourth quarter of last year and 91.6% or 93.3% on a year-to-date basis. Insurance segment produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio 61.2% which compares to 61.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 in line with the full-year comparison\/","For about the quarter and the year, lower large loss activity in 2017, and underwriting actions helped to offset rate decreases and higher loss cost trends in a couple of previously discussed lines. For the quarter, the expense ratio was 30.5% compared to 30.4 in the fourth quarter of 2016 driven by 1.5 point increase in acquisition costs, offset by 1.4 reduction in operating expenses. The increase in acquisition costs is largely related to prior period Commission adjustments and a change in mix of business.","The reduction in operating expense is attributable to a reduction in annual incentive-based compensation. On a year-to-date basis, the expense ratio decreased 1.3 points to 30.6%. In reinsurance, the segment produced an accident quarter ex cat combined ratio of 85.4% compared with 81.9% last year an 87.7% compared to 85.2% on a year-to-date basis.","The reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex cat loss ratio of 53.9% which compares to 49.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Roughly two-thirds of this increase is driven by change in business mix, resulting in more proportional business which carries a higher accident year ex cat loss ratio and lower loss volatility relative to excess of loss reinsurance. The expense ratio decreased nearly one full point of 31.4% in the fourth quarter. With the decrease driven primarily by the reduction in incentive-based compensation previously mentioned.","Shifting to the catastrophes. The northern and southern California wildfires, the most noble events in the quarter. And while our aggregate net cat losses from Harvey, Irma, and Maria remains largely unchanged. Our Insurance segment losses increased and we\u2019re almost entirely offset by decreases in our reinsurance segment. Our claims colleagues have done a great job of working with clients and brokers to settle claims as quickly and fairly as possible. And while industry loss estimates do not impact our reserves, we are pleased to see industry loss estimates for these tragic events settle in the range we initially indicated.","Page 9, of our presentation shows the full-year 2017 cat losses and they told just the $2 billion on a net basis. This was our highest year for net catastrophe basis. This was our highest year for net catastrophe losses in the last 12. On the right side of the Page, we provide a graph of historical cat losses for XL Catlin. A reminder that these losses are as reported and non-adjusted for inflation, exposure change reporting thresholds or ceded reinsurance changes. Over the 12 year period, we've averaged $590 of catastrophe losses, with the median of $505 million.","Turning to our ceded protections, while our ceded program work largely as intended as we do every year we\u2019ve been mindful of the lessons learned and changing market conditions. Page 15 provides the summary of key outward protections for 2018. The changes made reflect both the current pricing environment and our journey to regain a lean position in the transfer of risk to alternative capital providers. Our underwriting capital management is a dynamic process that we\u2019ve all through the year as we establish inwards risk margins balanced against the lower cost of capital of many of our risk transfer partners.","I\u2019m going to touch on the catastrophe bond, catastrophe aggregate, specific property catastrophe treaty session, and net property quota share components of underwriting capital management.","First on the catastrophe bonds, we're one of the first issuers post the third quarter activity and we marginally reduced our total in-force limit, but expanded coverage for U.S Caribbean wind and convective storm. Second, we purchased more worldwide enterprise catastrophe aggregate and reduced insurance and reinsurance segment specific coverages. This structure provides us with the broadest coverage and protects our portfolio of net of any catastrophe bond recoveries.","Third via our ILS fund manager, New Ocean, we increased the session to an to alternative capital provider through specific proportional session of individual property catastrophe treaties. Fourth, we\u2019ve added a new net property quota share which covers our four core catastrophe exposed lines, property cat treaty, property treaty, large risk property insurance, and London wholesale property insurance classes.","This combined protection has been placed entirely with alternative capital providers and the initial placement at January 1 is the first of a number of sessions that will be decided as we determine the return profile of inward and outward risk activities. In total, we have in force over $3 billion of catastrophe limit sourced from alternative capital.","The impact of these changes and others is that we have more cover on a broader basis. Enhanced protection across more frequent parts of our catastrophe exposures and achieved a lower attachment point for nonpeak parallels. On Page 16, you will see our updated PML disclosures including pro forma PMLs as of January 1, 2018. We\u2019ve reduced our exposures across the curve but most meaningfully at lower probabilities where we are down 20% to 30%.","While these are on an occurrence basis, our worldwide aggregate exposure has decreased by similar amounts. As another perspective with the same events of 2017 to occur again, our net loss would have decreased approximately 20%. We will continue to adjust this position throughout the year.","Turning to our market presence. In the insurance segment on a year-to-date basis, gross written premiums were up 5% after adjusting for foreign exchange as we continue to be well positioned with our clients and brokers. Further, 2017 was another solid year for new and expanded products and services as we topped advisors annual pacesetter index for the second year in a row. In total, we introduced 26 new or enhanced products and services as innovation remains a key part of our culture and an everyday occurrence at XL Catlin.","Turning to reinsurance, on a year-to-date basis, gross written premiums increased 18% and by 7% after adjusting for one large quota share treaty, reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange. Finally, turning to market conditions, we're seeing evidence of broad and more sustainable rate improvements. In the insurance segment, pricing was up 1% in the fourth quarter which is the first increase since the fourth quarter of 2014 and down just 1% for the full-year.","Clearly the short tail lines responded with the largest increases, but more importantly we saw increases in most of our businesses including our Long Tail International Casualty and North American Excess Casualty businesses. In the reinsurance segment, rates were up less than 1% in the quarter and down less than 1% on a year-to-date basis.","Of more interest we\u2019ve summarized on Page 11 early January 2018 re-observations. In insurance, rate increases are churning in the plus 3% to 4% range across the entire segment. Loss impacted property business are driving the most rate with increases over 15%, followed by non-loss impacted property of 5% to 15%, casualty with rates up in the low single digits, and professional lines that range from flat to plus 2% generally with some larger increases on some of our international business.","In reinsurance, aggregate rate increases of approximately 4% to 5%, driven by a 6% rate increase in property catastrophe and 5% in property treaty and casualty lines of business. While these rate increases were earned in over time, this broad-based rate change is a clear benefit given our diversified portfolio. XL Catlin continues to be seen is driving change in the market and seeking to achieve appropriate and sustainable rate levels.","As market dynamics shift, we're grateful for the ongoing support of our clients and brokers as we to continue to see strong submission flow and have won many new accounts at the January 1 renewals. We remain optimistic that we can continue on this positive rate trajectory throughout the remainder of 2018. In summary, as we look at the full-year of 2017 and step back from the impact of the catastrophes, we're proud of our continued progress in the ex cat results. And with clear evidence of a changing market, we're leading this new space as our underwriting teams thought through -- renew their books and find new profitable opportunities by leveraging our broad product suite and global reach.","I will now turn it back to Abbe.","Abbe Goldstein","Thanks, Greg. Gabrielle, we are ready to open-up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good evening. So my first question is on your capital position. In your slide, you said if 2017 events were to repeat you still have enough capital cushion. Is that a repeat of the 2017? Is that -- is this -- what happened to losses or you consider the reduction of your losses because of the additional reinsurance with retro coverage?","Michael McGavick","So what we\u2019ve said was if 2017 were to happen again, our reinsurance structure would result in net losses that were less by 20%. We didn\u2019t say that if it happened again we would have any particular level of buffer thereafter. We do believe we have appropriate capital for the risks that we\u2019re taking on in 2017 so -- 2018, so I do believe that we're appropriately capitalized for the risks that gave rise to those losses. But our commentary around the reduction in overall impact was if the same events happen we would expect a result that was that much better.","Kai Pan","Okay. Additional on your capital position, you\u2019re paused buyback for now, but are you considering proactive buying back your debt to reduce your leverage levels?","Stephen Robb","We are certainly considering buying back our debt, but as we've said in the past, our surplus capital levels -- first we look at ways to deploying the business and then ways to address other elements, either they would be nonorganic elements, debt, or buying back shares. Certainly reducing overall leverage is something that is high on our priority list as a general sense, but I don't see it as being a necessity at this stage, Kai. ","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Then I have another question on the reinsurance segments. The premium rose very strong, almost double the net premiums. And so could you talk a little bit more about where the growth is coming from and specifically you have a -- you mentioned a multiyear, multiline treaty, how much that impact the year-over-year deterioration in core loss ratio in the reinsurance segment?","Gregory Hendrick","Sure. Kai, it's Greg. So I look at this on a full-year base. It's right over the quarter, the fourth quarter for reinsurance is a very small, and so on a full-year basis when you take out that large multiline quota share, and you take out reinstatement premiums and you take out foreign exchange, we grew about 7%, and that has generally come from the property treaty and property cat classes with a little bit coming from our Casualty Treaty portfolio. In terms of the impact from [indiscernible] cat loss ratio, it\u2019s about -- it's a little over a point in the year that we would -- that we\u2019ve fell as we indicated back at the beginning of the year, that would be the impact from that large multiline treaty.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Next we will hear from Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Joshua Shanker","Good evening everybody. I\u2019m pleased to see that you reduced your 100 exposure for PML in a major cat event, but I know it's the 1 and 250 exposure isn't really changed and given where pricing is right now and I know you especially go higher, why is this the right tolerance to -- for your equity holders to bear for a major disaster?","Gregory Hendrick","Right. Josh, it\u2019s Greg. So I think we thought about this across the entire curve, right. Not just at one single point on how to make these adjustments. As I noted in my comments, that we reduced slightly about 100 million part of 1.8 billion the category bonds, which is the key tail driver. We think our tail position is a reasonable one relative to our overall capital position and is appropriate, and we focused our efforts more on the more probable parts of the curve and use the tools that I\u2019ve already discussed on how to make those reduce in a meaningful way. In a reflection both of our capital change year-over-year which is about 10% and with the market opportunity in terms of the relative returns of inwards and outwards reinsurance. So it's not just a one point. Look at the thing, it is a look across the entire curve.","Michael McGavick","And, Josh, this is Mike. I would add it was always our intention to learn from what the market reaction was, how to best stack up our opportunities for risk and reward. We have seen the reaction in reinsurance to be less favorable to the total equation for us than the reaction on the primary side. So we\u2019re more excited to drive more of our opportunity for earnings into what's going on in the primary side and to share more of the risk on our reinsurance side, particularly in the cat affected lines that could be both insurance and reinsurance with alternative capital. So we see that as a furtherance of the strategy we\u2019ve been on for a long time and a particular set of pricing and opportunity conditions that allowed us to accelerate that strategy.","Joshua Shanker","If reinsurance cat pricing were to go up helpfully, how much of your equity are you willing to put at risk for a major disaster?","Michael McGavick","Again, Josh, each of these different markets that emerge we have a plan for. We had a plan for what would we do if retro pricing became the most attractive economic proposition. We had a plan for every alternative and we -- in this set of conditions have done as we described. We already had very substantial tail protections. We were quite proud of this structure that there had been an early focus in our advances and utilization of alternative capital through the cat bonds that we issued back two years ago. But as we look at the totality of the market reaction to these losses, we felt that taking a little bit off that top and buying more in the meat was going to be the better outcome for our shareholders and that\u2019s why we executed what you think.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. Well, good luck in the New Year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the capital buffer that you mentioned earlier. And I think you said something along the lines that you are actually thinking about increasing it and just if you could draw some line kind of follow that, that makes sense for you? And what that an impact would be?","Stephen Robb","Sure. Well, we maintain our capital obviously against the lenses that are relevant to us and we mentioned them regulatory rating agency, our internal capital models themselves. In addition, we keep as Mike has -- in the past has referred to it, buffered to that buffer. Such that not only are we within the capital compliant, but we have room above that to take losses and still be well above that position. We -- in 2017 took meaningful losses. So that buffer-to-buffer is less than it was before and we will take time during 2018 to rebuild that. The capital we have in place is appropriate and significant and appropriate for the business that we're writing but adding to that buffer-to-buffer so that we can continue with that level of conservatism is important to us. On top of that, as Greg has set and Mike reiterated this market is still developing. So deploying that capital in other ways is something that we look to do as we see what happens. So that's all we are really mentioning is that we\u2019ve paused the share buybacks, we will continue to grow that buffer. We have sufficient capital, we have a buffer to that, but we want that to reach a level that we've historically been comfortable with and we will be comfortable with again.","Paul Newsome","Okay. I may have misunderstood you. I was thinking just to make sure I got it right. But it's just rebuilding what you had before as opposed to the view that you need a larger buffer than used to have.","Stephen Robb","That\u2019s generally right. I mean we do set our buffer-to-buffer with our Board and on the margin we move it up and down depending on certain factors. But generally, yes, that's right.","Paul Newsome","Okay. And then, the second event with the new reinsurance changes, could you talk a little bit about what happened if you have second or third event, given that seems to be the bigger risk nowadays, most of all the events in a year.","Michael McGavick","Sure, Paul. The -- so first of all, let me -- I will come down the chain that I described earlier, right. So the coupons, our aggregate nature, some of them are not exhausted entirely in the first event. They -- what was left will be there to be used, the same principal applies to the catastrophe aggregate covers as well. So they would be ready to go, if they had not been exhausted. On our current insurance occurrence cover, in another secondary occurrence cover we bought across the whole enterprise those both have -- sorry, the insurance cover is a one reinstatement so there would be a coverage for a second event. And then the third piece of it would be the pro rata pieces and of course, those don\u2019t have reinstatements. They will continue to cover until the full limit of the contract is exhausted.","Paul Newsome","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question will come Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group. Your line is open.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good evening. One or two questions. The first question is going back to the discussion on risk management and obviously you gave some color the ceded reinsurance protection. I\u2019m curious, where you stood on I guess the discussion on buying a group-wide aggregate stop-loss cover?","Michael McGavick","Sure. First an aside, that was not something that we put into the press. That was something that guide in there from sources not of our own. I\u2019m quite frankly not pleased that it made there. The Reinsurance business has long existed on the principle of confidentiality, and trust and somewhere unfortunately that chain got broken. Having said that, we\u2019ve started to explore that structure of about -- of a notional billion dollar limit. On a cover the entire enterprise on its entire -- on a loss ratio basis. So in aggregate stop-loss ratio cover. We only place 10% of it. It's a cover that like many things we do we start out small make sure we understand the mechanics get reinsurance comfortable with it and then move forward as we potential expand if you like the way the economics work and how responding to certain events. But it's a entire enterprise-wide full cover but we only place 10% of that limit and again I can only stress enough that was not a news item that we saw to put out there.","Amit Kumar"," Got it. I won't tease further on that point. The second question and I will re-queue, if you look at the rate change discussion and I know there were some caveats associated with the pricing commentary and there are moving parts of it. If I -- if one were to ex out, I guess that the multiyear piece with the revised number would be modestly different or would that be meaningfully different than the numbers you\u2019ve given because they do seem to be lower than some of the other numbers we\u2019ve seen out there.","Gregory Hendrick","So I\u2019m going to -- so, I mean, yes, that\u2019s a great point. I will give you one caveat particularly on the insurance numbers, these are still very early days. The data, there is a lot more transactions, it takes a lot longer to pull them together. But directionally, I will start -- we start with reinsurance, that\u2019s where we have the most complete data set. The 5% for the segment would go up just a little bit less than a point. The property cat component of that would increase just over a full point from 6% to just over 7%, if you take away the multiyear accounts that are in there. So it's a small driver, but not a lot. On the insurance side, roughly speaking that 3.5% would increase to about 4%. That\u2019s across property and across a broad swap of business, right. So let me make sure I\u2019m really clear on that. The 3.5% for the segment covers the entire books of business, right. The property is up more if you had to take up -- probably take a way to guess what its up altogether somewhere in that 5% to 10% range would be what we'd be seeing on just the property component of our book.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That\u2019s actually very helpful. I will stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Gregory Hendrick","Thank you.","Michael McGavick","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Two, I think reasonably simple questions. First, given the rate increases that you're seeing, I guess, both in insurance and reinsurance, should the margin impact of those rate increases outpace the incremental cost of cat protection?","Gregory Hendrick","Meyer, yes, absolutely. We think particularly because if you think about some of the components like the cat bonds, where $1.6 billion and change part of a $1.7 billion and change, we\u2019re already in place. Roughly speaking, and this is all of subjective number but our analysis show that if you look across those major cat protections I described, it's about a 2% to 3% rate increase on just that ceded premium which of course is a fraction of what the entire portfolio. So, yes, we think there's leverage from the inwards rather to the outwards.","Meyer Shields","Okay, fantastic. And second, can we dig a little deeper into the reserve release numbers. I know it\u2019s -- we probably unfairly get used to a run rate of reserve releases and it was below that. And I was wondering if you can help us understand how we should think about that going forward?","Michael McGavick","Yes, this is Mike. I will start. Basically the most important thing to share is nothing has changed. I mean our processes internally and our belief in prudence especially in long tail lines are desired to have bad news travel faster. These remain fundamental tenets to how we said our reserves now I want to emphasize this quarter and future quarters will be done in the same way. Greg?","Gregory Hendrick","Sure. Yes, let me -- I want to share a few kind of detail points to give you some color about how we think about those and how we look at this. So across the group we have a large diversified reserve base and at any given time there are portfolios that needs strengthening, there's portfolios that are releasing and some of the underwritings with a lot of movement that\u2019s going on and obviously we\u2019re monitoring those developments all the time and making adjustments accordingly. If you look at our insurance reserves, let's look at some of the increases and decreases we\u2019ve had over the years. So in '15 we strengthened reserves and surety, our class we're no longer in on the insurance basis. New York contractors and smaller portfolios within our miscellaneous professional book. And there were significant releases in specialty driven by aerospace and political risk. Moving forward to '16, portions of professional miscellaneous and our international financial lines portfolio were strengthened, while property and casualty generally developed favorably. Last year in '17 the one in wholesale property portfolio, that delivered good returns for us for many years experience in that first development on a attritional losses on the 2015 to 2017 underwriting years. Also in the property line large energy loss activity during 2016 contributed some adverse development in 2017. In addition the IFL management portfolio required strengthening related to some large loss activity which we\u2019ve talked -- which is linked to trends we\u2019ve talked about on previous calls with large clients in U.S style litigation entering into Europe. But balancing this out, North American casualty and the other professional businesses contributed favorably in 2017, despite some large loss activity in recent accident years. In total, in insurance, it's really the magnitude of the property strengthening in 2017 that\u2019s driving the reduction in favorable PYD relative to the prior year. Given this development, we don\u2019t view this as a trend. We are watching the trends in international professional that we mentioned previously and re-underwriting our book accordingly. We look at that large loss activity in casualty in recent years as fortuitous rather than a trend at this stage. If I shift to reinsurance, while there is some reduction level of PYD since '15 and '16. The main driver is the casualty line, which is impacted by the Ogden discount rate change early in 2017. The net impact of this during 2017 was $63 million adverse. The casualty cross also impacted by some of the same large loss activity I mentioned earlier and much like our experience -- in the insurance plan, sorry. This serve to dampen the level of PYD overall in '17. So what we believe our reserving, as Mike said, we believe our reserving approach has served us well over the years as demonstrated by a favorable development. That said, it would be unrealistic to expect the same level of favorable development from the most recent accident years as we experienced from the very hard market years of the mid 2000, but we remain comfortable with our overall reserve position. Meyer, I hope that helps a little bit more color.","Meyer Shields","That was fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions here for you. The first one, I appreciate you gave us kind of a 2% to 3% increase in your cat protection. Is there any way you can give us some kind of guidance to this perspective on what the additional cost on your ceded is going to be from kind of lowering the volatility in your business? There is obviously additional costs associated with it?","Stephen Robb","Yes, I would -- the rate increase I\u2019ve given you, I would have to think about the ceded premium, I don\u2019t have that number in front, but let me see if I can get that for you, I will then come back to you. You\u2019re talking about the total \u2026","Brian Meredith","Yes, the total hour, does that -- so we can kind of measure what the impact on that\u2019s going to be? I imagine it's going to be higher?","Stephen Robb","Right. Let me look for that one.","Brian Meredith","Great.","Stephen Robb","One thing we\u2019ve commented in there as -- probably I have to get back to you another time, but the -- a lot of the reduction in risk is by reshaping as Mike and Greg said, and moving our coverages into the more meat of the portfolio. So the overall cost will be a cost to increase in our exposure will be as significant as you might think.","Brian Meredith","Okay, great. And then, a question on kind of book yield. Still -- current interest rate levels, any pressure on book yields still or is it going to be kind of 20 in the other way here on the investment portfolio -- fixed income portfolio?","Michael McGavick","Well, we\u2019ve been countering. We still have pressure, our money rate is below our book yield and the market yield on the portfolio. But we\u2019ve been countering that to a small degree by portfolio reallocations, but until the new money rate that I talk about regularly which for right now our market yield is 2.3, I know we give our new money rate, but that includes the rebalancing. Our market yield is about 2.3 and our book yield is about 2.6. We are still 30 basis points adrift of that. So that give you a sense across that line once we get 30 basis points better at roughly a five-year AA minus portfolio.","Brian Meredith","Got you. And the last just quick one here. I noticed your alternative funds kind of dropping during the course of the year. Is that something actively that you\u2019re doing reducing your alternative funds or is something else is going on there?","Michael McGavick","Yes, it is active. It's not a glass we're getting out of, but we have been shrinking the overall hedge fund portfolio both as a risk-adjusted measure and as you mentioned -- we mentioned in the last quarter as well as last year, a few crystallization of significant gains, and since they happened at times when cash was useful. We haven't redeployed them in the portfolio. So, yes, it's a shift. It's not getting out of that class, but it's a reduction in general.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Stephen Robb","Brian -- yes, Brian before you go, I\u2019ve got -- sorry, I wasn\u2019t able to put my hand on, let me how -- let me just -- a couple of reminders before I give you the punch line. One, as we said - as we\u2019ve all said on this call so far the outwards purchases a dynamic process. We don\u2019t just set in. Regrettably we\u2019re not a mono line company that can set a program in place at 1.1 and let her run and then come back to it again. We are constantly deciding on -- 30 to 40 businesses on the inward side and kind of returns coming there. And then reflecting on what the opportunities are received and try to make sure we make the right decisions on that balance. So this is not a given, that\u2019s what going to happen. But indicatively I would say around a 10% increase in ceded written premium would be an indication. But Brian just to be really quick, there's a lot of caveat to that, given the dynamic nature of what we do.","Brian Meredith","I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jay Cohen","Thank you. Couple of questions. On the investment income, would you be willing to give us a sense of what you think the quarterly run rate will be on investment income in '18?","Michael McGavick","Yes. I mean, I think the run rate we have this quarter is a good reflection of where we believe we are going in 2018.","Jay Cohen","Got that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, with the tax change in order to make sure that the lower U.S tax rate doesn't affect your overall results. Will you have to restructure some of the intercompany reinsurance arrangements or take other actions to make sure that doesn't happen?","Michael McGavick","This is Mike. To start to, yes, the short answer in fact. Our group began its work on that immediately with final passage and work throughout the Christmas holidays to go ahead and make some of those changes right away, so that we would be as well positioned to fulfill our commitments as possible.","Jay Cohen","Got it. Thanks, Mike.","Gregory Hendrick","Yes. And we have changed the U.S risk sharing with offshore entities meaningfully and will continue to evaluate how we shared that risk going forward.","Jay Cohen","[Indiscernible].","Michael McGavick","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","And with that, we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I will hand the conference back over to CEO Michael McGavick for closing remarks.","Michael McGavick","This is a -- this was a very important period of time for us. Obviously, with the events last year we felt that there was a lot to learn from them and we also felt that the market that would emerge would be absolutely crucial to how we would go forward and would be able to illustrate the value of the diversified platform we've been building, and our long-standing comfort with alternative capital developments and as it is happened the market that emerged was the one that we feel really matched to both that desire to accelerate, the use alternative capital and let the results from our increased participation on insurance and specialty -- on the primary insurance and specialty lines to really shine through. It seems to me that's exactly the year that\u2019s coming to being. So we\u2019re rather excited to put 2017 behind us and to work forward and it would be awful to end this call without thanking our people who have been doing extraordinary work to get this in place, both the kinds of things that was done by the tax group through the holiday and the kinds of things that we've been doing throughout the firm to position ourselves to fully allow our business model to shine in the market that has -- that is emerging. We are excited about 2018 as I presume you can gather from our comments. Thank you very much for your time tonight and we look forward to seeing you soon.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating and you may now disconnect."],"22716":["XL Group plc (NYSE:XL) Q1 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call May  2, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Dave Radulski - Director, Investor Relations","Mike McGavick - Chief Executive Officer","Pete Porrino - Chief Financial Officer","Greg Hendrick - Chief Executive, Insurance Operations","Jamie Veghte - Chief Executive, Reinsurance Operations","Sarah Street - Chief Investment Officer","Steve Robb - Controller","Susan Cross - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Actuary","Analysts","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Meyer Shields - KBW","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Randy Binner - FBR","Operator","Good afternoon.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Dave Radulski","Thank you, Shirley. And welcome to XL Group's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement and a presentation titled Sale & Retrocession of Life Reinsurance Business.","On our call this morning, you'll hear from Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, Chief Financial Officer; followed by Greg Hendrick; and Jamie Veghte, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Others with us today include our Chief Investment Officer, Sarah Street; and our Controller, Steve Robb.","Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.","Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Mike McGavick","Good morning and thank you for joining this call. If you will permit, I'd like to start with a quick personal note. This is a call I have been looking forward to for six years. We are very pleased on this call to be able to discuss the transaction we announced last night on our now largely exited Life Reinsurance businesses. I'm truly excited by the culmination of an effort that we started working on immediately after I was hired in 2008.","Here is how we are going to approach this call. We will get into the results from the quarter first, so you will hear from me, Pete, Jamie and Greg in the usual fashion. And then Pete and I will come back to discuss more fully the Life Re transaction as we want to them get into the details and give you plenty of time for your questions.","So with regard to the quarter, XL had a very good start to 2014, the solid results across both our core business segments and from our investment affiliates. In fact, across many total P&C metrics, this was one of the best quarters since the end of 2008. Our Insurance segment continued to improve and Reinsurance performed strongly in spite of the widely discussed tough market conditions.","Some of the results highlight. Excluding the first quarter of 2013, which we have noted in many ways was an outlier in terms of outperformance. Our total P&C combined ratio of 89.7%, our total underwriting profit of $145 million and our loss ratio of 58.9% are the best result since the fourth quarter of 2008. And once again we produced double-digit ROE of 10.4%, excluding unrealized gains on investments.","Contributing to the strong quarter was an Insurance segment underwriting profit of $45 million and an insurance accident year ex-cat combined ratio of 94.6%. Meanwhile, the 76.3% combined ratio for the Reinsurance segment is obviously a very strong result.","Now we do expect to see variations from quarter-to-quarter as we\u2019ve discussed many times with you. We are mindful and this was a relatively low cat quarter and we of course know from last year. The strong starts do not necessarily project the same kind of performance across the entire year. All of that said, we like these results and we really like the way this quarter positions us for the rest of 2014.","With that, I am going to turn it over to Pete for a quick rundown of the financials in the quarter. Greg and Jamie will have the segment highlights, and then Pete and I will return to get into the details of the Life transaction. Pete?","Pete Porrino","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Given all that we have to cover today, I\u2019ll make my remarks brief covering four items, reserve development, expenses, investment results and capital management.","Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $39 million or 2.7 loss ratio points, compared to $31 million or 2.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2013. This reflects favorable development from short tail property and catastrophe lines in this A versus E quarter of $8 million and $31 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Our semiannual full actuarial review will be reported on next quarter. Our reserve related note, we do intend to publish our global loss triangles next week.","Turning to expenses, you may have notice that in prior years our first quarter expenses historically tended to be lower than the annualized run rate. In the past that was largely due to the lag in spend for technology and other areas in the first quarter, followed by a catch-up over the rest of the year.","We are doing a better job of more evenly distributing our spending this year, so that while total expenses in Q1 2013 were 9% higher than Q1 a year ago that were virtually even with the most recent three quarters. And as we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, we expect our total full year 2014 operating expenses to be higher than 2013 by mid single digits on annualized basis.","Regarding investments, our investment portfolio delivered solid total returns of 1.8% in the quarter, P&C portfolio was 1.5% and the life portfolio of 3.2%. We had a positive mark-to-market of $302 million, with $236 million, and $66 million between P&C and Life.","Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $1 billion at the end of the first quarter, of which $800 million is in the P&C portfolio. This excludes the $365 million related to our held to maturity assets in the Life portfolio. And $162 million net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was 7.1% below the same quarter last year, due primarily again to lower reinvestment rates.","The P&C gross book yield at the end of March remained pretty much unchanged at 2.7%. We still have a gap between the yields and maturing assets, and where we are reinvesting which will keep downward pressure on net investment income.","Our investment and operating affiliates, all held in the P&C portfolio continue to produce strong results. Net income from investment affiliates was $60 million, up $10 million from the prior year quarter.","We also had good earnings from our investment manager affiliates, also held in the P&C portfolio, reflecting the strong fourth quarter of 2013, which produced healthy incentive fees for affiliate managers.","Now to capital management, during the quarter we continue to buyback our ordinary shares as we view such purchases as an effective use of surplus capital. Following the February Board of Directors meeting, we announced an increase in our ordinary dividend by 14% to $0.16 per share per quarter and the authorization of a new $1 billion share buyback program.","This authorization includes the approximately $200 million remaining under the previous program. In total, during the first three months of 2014 we purchased and canceled 5.8 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $30.19 for $175 million.","I will now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Greg Hendrick","Thanks, Pete, and good morning. Today, I'll cover results for the segment, give a brief update on talent, provide some color on our continuing improvement and finish remarks on current market conditions.","Beginning with the results, the Insurance segment produced a strong first quarter results with accident quarter ex-cat combined ratio of 94.6%, roughly 1 point higher than prior year. In fact, the first quarter of 2013 and 2014 are the two best accident quarter ex-cat results since 2007. The year-over-year change is expense ratio driven and the accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio was 63.5%, just 0.3 points above the prior year.","As we all know and in fact, the last two quarters of 2013 has showed, there is inherent variability in our portfolio. However, the portfolio is in a best shape yet to absorb this volatility through our continuous work to reduce gross limits, grow profitable and diversified businesses and optimize reinsurance protections. Combined with our significantly improved talent, we believe the first quarter results are more reflective of the improving underwriting trends in our Insurance portfolio than those from a year ago.","The underwriting expense ratio is 31% in the first quarter reflecting 0.7 point deterioration from the first quarter 2013, driven largely by certain non-recurring redundancy, recruitment and professional fees. More generally, our confidence in the improving results allows us to spend as Pete noted evenly through the year.","To shift towards quarter share treaties in certain business will distort the comparisons of our acquisition ratio, which improved by 2 points over the first quarter of last year and our operating expense ratio, which deteriorated by 2.7 points. For 2014, it is necessary to look at the total underwriting expense ratio when comparing the prior year.","Insurance gross premiums written grew by $55 million or 3.7% in the quarter when adjusted for foreign exchange movement and by over 5% on adjusted for large return premium on the multi-year account.","Growth was once again particularly strong in North America, but premiums grew by more than 10% with construction, excess casualty and property businesses contributing the largest growth.","New leadership in our International Financial Lines business also contributed along with growth in our cyber and crisis management portfolios. Our momentum continues to build as illustrated by our recent RIMS convention experience. We launched our new Global Kidnap and Ransom capability, and have hundreds of millions of clients and brokers eager to discuss how XL can help solve their risk management needs.","Moving on to talent, we continue to enhance our team throughout this segment. We promoted Joe Tocco, the Chief Executive our North American Property and Casualty Group, and also announced Ken Riegler, Head of Global Risk Management assume responsibility for North American Distribution.","In addition to Joe and Ken, we also added new talent to our International Financial Lines, marine and crisis management businesses, and recognized existing talent with several promotions. For the quarter we increased our underwriting force at 24 positions as we continue to build-out new and existing businesses.","Talent is one of the five wins Mike has discussed previously and we continue to pull out remaining four levers to improve our combined ratio. In particular, our mix continues to shift towards higher margin businesses. In the first quarter, well over half of our business performed better over 5 points of our target combined ratios. This compares only third of the book at the end of 2012.","Growth in some of our newer business such as North America Construction and Cyber and improvement in several other businesses such as Environment and International Financial Lines are contributing to this momentum. Further improvement is expected as 2013 and 2014 underwriting actions continue to earn growth.","On market conditions, we continue to see some slowing in rate, particularly in short tail and International Lines. Despite of increase in competition, the segment achieved an overall rate increase of 2.3% in line with Reinsurance.","In fact, 85% of our portfolio achieved positively in the quarter compared to 75% in the fourth quarter of last year. North American business continue to show the most strength with rate increases in the 5% range, although, on of our North American business had positive rate and rate on rate with only property, which has been widely discussed in the industry decreasing by just over 1%.","Our International P&C businesses achieved rate for the second straight year with rate increases over 2% for the quarter. Our Global Professional and Specialty businesses had rate increase in the 1% to 2% range, adversely impacted by the competitive aviation and U.S. D&O excess markets, respectively.","In closing, we are off to a solid start for the year as evidence by our first quarter results. Although, we benefit from another relatively quite catastrophe quarter, we believe these results are testament to the work has done on over the past 24 months to grow our higher margin businesses and make the hard decisions around portfolio that simply are not performing.","Now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance.","Jamie Veghte","Thank you, Greg and good morning. The Reinsurance segment got off to an excellent start in 2014 with the combined ratio of 76.3% and a resulting underwriting profit of $100 million for the quarter. We have the benefit of very quiet quarter of catastrophe activity but we are pleased with the performance across the portfolio, particularly in light of the competitive landscape.","Our reserve releases in the quarter were $30.5 million, compared to $21 million a year ago. On an accident year basis, the portfolio generated a combined ratio of 83.5%, which compares to the 79.9% produced in Q1 of 2013.","The deterioration in the accident year result resulted from the Malaysia Airlines loss where we have posted a $3.6 million loss net of reinstatement premiums, a slight increase on our acquisition ratio and nonrecurring premium items in 2013 of $5 million.","As respect to our reserve releases, our position on long tail business remains cautious, particular with respect to releases in recent underwriting years, a full 84% of this quarter\u2019s release were from short tail lines.","Turning to topline, gross written premiums in the quarter were $858 million, a 5% reduction from the first quarter of 2013. These reductions were largely driven by our international operations, with North America flat and Bermuda showing a slight increase due to new Lloyd\u2019s whole account business.","In the international portfolio, our gross written premium was $445 million, down from $520 million in the first quarter of 2013. In Europe, we faced difficult market conditions in property and dropped a very large motor quota share in the United Kingdom.","Latin America remains extremely challenging, particularly in the Brazilian market and our gross written premium dropped by 40% to $20 million in the quarter. So with respect to our top line and the market broadly, trading conditions are highly competitive.","Since the end of the quarter, the only significant renewal for XL at April, one was in the Japanese market. While pricing was down 10% to 15% and terms and conditions loosened, we are satisfied we have a portfolio that should generate attractive returns.","In fact, I would underscore that theme across our entire portfolio. We haven\u2019t seen trading conditions across the market as intensely competitive as this for quite a number of years. There will be winners and losers.","We bring a number of assets to the table, including a diversified portfolio across geography and class, a stable of excellent trading partners developed over two decades, a strong reserve position and a season team of underwriters who have generated excellent return to our shareholders over a number of years.","In short, while we anticipate continued headwinds in the sector, we enter it from a position of strength and anticipate continued strong performance. So overall we are very pleased with our bottom line results in the first quarter and we continue to successfully navigate our way through very challenging market conditions.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mike.","Mike McGavick","Thank you, Jim. As I said at the outset of the call, our news about our life reinsurance transaction is the culmination of six years of effort. We are working on exerting the life re businesses when the market turned against us in 2008. At that point, we placed few businesses into runoff and have ever since continued to entertain arbitrators to exit the businesses.","Last night, we announced that we a retroceding the vast majority of our life reinsurance reserves and we want to walk you through the transaction. I want to acknowledge upfront that transaction is a bit complex. And I think you will see that this complexity works substantially in favor of XL shareholders.","Before I get into too much detail, let me focus on the fundamental purpose of this transaction. We are a global property and casualty insurance and reinsurance underwriter that is what we do. Having this block of life re businesses to tend to and the risk that were introduced inherently into our business by them, distracts and detracts from our core mission. Getting these risks off of our minds and substantially off of our books inherently improves the businesses that our shareholders own.","Now let me walk you through six aspects of this transaction. First, I\u2019m going to walk you through what has changed in the environment and with XL that enables us to get to this announcement. Second, provide a brief description of the transaction itself. Third, I\u2019ll walk you through the aspects of the counterparty and what attracted us to them. Fourth, I\u2019ll give you description of the key protections for XL shareholders that are built in some transaction. Fifth, I'll turn to the right blocks that were not dealt with in this transaction and are retained by XL. And then lastly, I\u2019ll describe the implications of this transaction for capital management, going forward.","Then Pete will come back and add some additional detail. So in terms of the first aspect what has changed? First, it is observable there's a great deal of activity with respect to discontinued blocks of life insurance and reinsurance businesses. And you\u2019ve seen a number of deals already announced.","As I said, ours is a bit more complicated than many of those and hence has taken a bit longer to put together given the unique structure of our reinsurance arrangements with our clients. Second, it has also taken longer for the market to get comfortable with European assets especially elongated European assets, which is the central feature of the books we are dealing with in this transaction.","The final thing that has changed is the direct result of our own work, the improvement in our own property and casualty performance. Simply put, as our P&C ROEs have continued to climb the life block, which represents something like 20-ish percent of our capital and its mid-single digit percent returns becomes a greater and in the future potentially a still greater drag on our results.","We and the investors deserve to have our improving team see results shine through. So as I mentioned at the beginning that is the core purpose of the arrangement. So we can focus on what we do best. And before moving on to the next aspect, there is a third but more minor point to be made. It is obvious that our firm for variety of reasons carries a higher beta than many of our competitors.","It is observable in the market that life operations tend to attract a higher beta than those in P&C operations. And since our goal is to trade like our other well performing P&C brethren, anything that gives the market a reason to attach a higher beta to us is something we\u2019d like to deal with.","Moving to the second aspect of this deal, a description of the transaction itself. The first thing to note is whether it\u2019s a two-step transaction. A retrocession of $4.4 billion of XL Life Reinsurance reserves into an entity that has been sold. Said more simply, we are selling to our counterparty of vehicles so that they can then reinsure our risks.","The risks that are included in this reinsurance arrangement are the overwhelming majority of our European facing reinsurance risk. In the main, there are two large blocks of Life Re business. The single premium annuities that we have discussed with you many times and then a smaller block of European term life. To put it all in perspective that is $4.4 billion of the total of $4.8 billion in reserves we held for life reinsurance.","That brings us to the third aspect I want to describe a description of GreyCastle, our counterparts. The most important thing to note is that the counterparty is a collection of family offices and University endowments. While we had a number of interested parties to choose from, from traditional reinsurers to private equity and also some new life reinsurance start-ups.","We view GreyCastle as exactly the kind of counterparty that should want these risks because their main focus is preserving capital. We didn't want a counterparty that was going to do this as a leverage play or juice the assets. We wanted someone that was going to run it off and take the ordinary benefits of the runoff. So we feel we have exactly the right kind of counterparty.","That brings me to the fourth aspect I said I'd cover which is to walk through some of the obvious risk of the transaction and the way in which they are addressed. While our retrocession is not novel, what we're doing that we're doing it to an unrated vehicle is and I want to talk about that.","First of all and most importantly, this is a funds withheld reinsurance transaction. That means that we keep these assets on our books and in our accounts. What we transfer to GreyCastle is the management of these assets and their economic benefits. But should the counterparty not perform, we are able easily because they're still in our accounts to recapture these assets under a variety of scenarios.","This protects XL shareholders. So not letting these assets go is the ultimate protection in and of itself. One other thing I should note and Pete will describe in a moment, there is one minor inconvenience to holding these assets on our accounts and that is that there will be some accounting noise, nothing more than noise as respect to net income. Pete will get into the details of that in a second.","So I\u2019m sure this leaves you to wonder about what conditions could cause the retrocession agreement to be recaptured by us as obviously this would defeat the purpose of ceding them to someone else. There are essentially three main categories of failure that would lead to their recapture.","One, if failure of GreyCastle to be in regulatory compliance; two, a failure to satisfy collateral requirements and three, a failure to comply with the contractually described capital requirements. To give some perspective, since they have already paid us $570 million, none of these events are very attractive to GreyCastle as they would forsake the investment they have made.","And to give additional perspective, we have modeled a variety of scenarios they could give rise to a recapture and they are extreme events. They are for example beyond the consequences of the Lehman failure. Even when we modeled European defaults and the doubling of the longevity assumptions, GreyCastle would still be able to perform.","So you can see we do not expect to again control these assets and the good news is should these extreme events occur, we will have been paid $570 million for the transaction and XL shareholders will be that much better off in those conditions. We think this combination of funds was held in receiving the payment of $570 million gives us a terrific exit from the vast majority of the risks facing these blocks of business.","To bring up another worry, you might have somehow that GreyCastle would look to manage these assets in a riskier way to get a better return. The answer is they can. We have investment guidelines agreed to with them that are essentially an extension of our own guidelines we used to manage the portfolios today and we have agreements in place to allow us to monitor the activities and to ensure their compliance.","And then lastly you might wonder is there enough capital. Let me give you some perspective on the contractual capital requirements. The answer is that we have defined the capital standard that GreyCastle has agreed to maintain and that is the equivalent of the AA capital standard based on an S&P model. And further we have already required these counterparties to set aside additional moneys that they would commit to further capitalization should it be needed.","That brings me to the fifth aspect that I said I would describe and that is what\u2019s out of the deal and why did we keep it. Here there is a simple answer. The nature of the various blocks we are keeping are so different that we feel that it should be dealt with differently to and separately to acquire the best outcome. Simply put, the potentially best buyer for each block is different.","Since the transaction that we have now announced, includes the vast majority of reserves and the vast majority of the risks. We felt it was important to get this transaction done first. So what\u2019s left. There will remain about $400 million of life reinsurance reserves on our books. About $300 million in reserves are related to our U.S. term life reinsurance businesses and $100 million in a block of income protection business.","There is also about $30 million in another block that were run up very quickly in areas that we\u2019re talking about. So you can see the relative magnitude, $4.4 billion leaving and a residual of just $400 million in reserves left behind. And these blocks, while in -- being in loss recognition for some time now are behaving in a relatively benign way. Just to be clear now that we\u2019re done with this transaction, of course, we are open to dealing with these smaller blocks as well but we are also equally happy to run them off as a small part of XL that will not distract us from our overall objectives.","And that brings me to the sixth and final aspect that I said I would describe that is going forward to capital management. While the transaction itself does not release capital and we have suggested to the market, it would not in prior conversations. It does make the firm less risky.","This allows us to lower the buffer to the buffer that we carry and that we have discussed with you many times. This will result during the course of this year in us repurchasing an additional $300 million in share repurchases beyond the amount that we already contemplated for the year and that we have already described the magnitude of to you in our earlier calls.","So in sum, I hope you can see why we are so happy with this transaction. We\u2019re getting a quality counterpart. We have a transaction that protects XL shareholders and we are removing the vast majority of the remaining non-core elements of XL\u2019s businesses. This is a milestone for us in becoming a sharper and more focused and ultimately we believe more success for property and casualty insurers and reinsurers.","With that, I will turn it over to Pete who can then get into some of the more specific details on the economics and then we will open it up to questions either on the quarter or on this transaction.","Pete Porrino","Thanks Mike. I\u2019ll take you through three additional items related to the transaction. First a quick description of the structure and leading agency reactions; second, a walk through our calculation of our book value loss due to a transaction and finally as Mike mentioned as a result of some of the protections we built in, a discussion from an accounting perspective on how the transaction will impact the presentation of our results in the future.","Turning to Slide 5 which diagrams transaction structure. It is important to understand that this is a two-part deal. The subject wise businesses are first aggravated and then retroceded into XL Life Reinsurance Limited, which is then sold to GreyCastle. As you can see, we are retailing $5.5 billion of assets on a funds withheld basis. And this compares to the $4.4 billion of GAAP reserves currently held. You may have seen the press releases last night from A. M. Best, S&P and Fitch, all of whom have affirmed our ratings.","I think the best way to describe the book value charge of $585 million would be the start with what you are all most familiar with, our financial supplement, which at March 31 showed GAAP equity allocated to this business of $1.8 billion and by this business I mean the entire life segment.","Our debt amount approximately $1.2 billion is assigned to the business being sold today. I will get back to the $600 million we now assigned to this transaction in a second. Subtracting a small tax benefit in the $570 million in proceeds, results in the book value loss of $585 million. And as we\u2019ve noted, these numbers will changed from March 31 through the completion of the transaction, mostly due to the mark-to-market value of the underlying investment portfolio.","Getting back to the $600 million now allocated for the business and I will make two observations here. First, our estimate of the GAAP capital required for the remaining businesses is approximately $250 million. And second, the excess of this required amount was $350 million, mostly had to do with our method of funding to XXX reserves on our life term business in the United States.","Moving on to how our future reserves would be presented, please turn to Slide 6. First, the obligations assumed by GreyCastle under the retrocession will be collateralized by invested assets that will continue to be legally owned by XL. GreyCastle will direct the investment of these assets subject to a agreed upon investment guidelines and will receive all of the economics associated with the investments. Because of this, the retrocession contains an embedded derivative.","Accounting rules dictate that the movement in the value of the embedded derivative, which transfers the economics to GreyCastle is recorded through XL\u2019s net income. However, the changes in the fair value of the investments that are on our books that is economics we no longer have, are not recorded through net income. They are recorded in other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders equity.","There will be mismatch as you will have that embedded derivative mark-to-market through net income and the offset which is the market value gain or loss on the investment portfolio, not going through net income. This will not impact comprehensive income, operating income or book value. The important point here is that there is no economic impact whatsoever but it does create fluctuations in net income going forward.","I will turn to David to go to Q&A in a second. But I would just like to add that we are all really pleased we\u2019ve gotten to this point with the life business. We\u2019ve been pretty clear on our cause and other public communications. So you will all understand that this really was an accomplishment to get this done and we think a big step in the right direction. David?","David Radulski","Shirley, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Thank you and good morning. Lots to get through today. I was wondering with the sale of the life reinsurance business, taking into account the affect on earnings as well as book value and the increased share buyback, what do you think the effect is on a run rate return on equity for XL overall?","Mike McGavick","Jay, so the effect at first would be quite small because of course the gap between current P&C, ROEs and the now transacted ROEs is not done.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Hello.","Mike McGavick","Sorry, really technical difficulty there.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","You cut out for like the last 10 seconds. That was all.","Mike McGavick","Sorry about that. So to start over, the basic impact is very modest at first because the difference in the relative ROEs and P&C today, and the transacted business are not as big as we intend for them to be. So the impact grows over time. And of course the share repurchases has an additional benefit and those will occur over the course of the year. So it\u2019s starts off being pretty modest but it gets to some meaningful impact over the next couple of years and that\u2019s what we are shooting for. That\u2019s why this was such an important time to get this done from our point of view, Jay. You really wanted to do it. You didn\u2019t want it to be a drag on the total return of the firm, which we are positioned to create which we are starting to become. So it was just starting to pinch. It will pinch all the time.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","All right. So less of a -- the earnings dilution from the sale of life reinsurance business taking into account the impact of book value for share buybacks. You shouldn\u2019t see too much overall ROE erosion over the intermediate term?","Pete Porrino","","Jay, this is Pete. the other thing -- you used the term erosion. We don\u2019t believe that there is any erosion in ROE. We think that there is a very small, as Mike said, small pick up immediately\/","Jay Gelb - Barclays","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, Pete, on the $250 million of capitals that is being held back to support the remaining businesses, that seems rather large relative to the ongoing liabilities. Why is that and how long do you think it could take for that additional $250 million to get released?","Pete Porrino","So there are three pieces to the $250 million. And they are very good ups between the two of the businesses that we are retaining, the U.S. term and the income protection. And then also there is some amount there for the retrocession that is in places as a result of this transaction. I will tell you that our regulatory capital that will be holding on those is a number substantially less than $250 million. So that will not runoff and really if we -- we can talk a little bit later about the likelihood of any more transactions on the remaining businesses. But some of those would cause that to runoff pretty quickly.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Okay. And then last one, quick one, the effective tax rate going forward taking into account these transaction has been running around 11% overall on operating income. Is that still reasonable run rate or will that change?","Pete Porrino","That should not change.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie. You may ask your question.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Thanks and good morning and congrats on the quarter. Two quick question, maybe a big question for Greg. If you look at the AY ex-cat LR in insurance, it was flattish year-over-year, you were talking about competition and pricing. How should we think about I guess the improvement on a full year basis for 2014, if you factor in the increasingly challenging pricing environment in insurance?","Greg Hendrick","","So let me give you the comparison for me. We talk a lot about the second quarter and the first quarter last year, kind of averaging those out with some of the things we talked about then. It\u2019s about point better first quarter this year versus the average first and second quarter result last year. I\u2019m not going to project the future. This is a volatile business, things can happen.","I feel very good about what we built into it. We are a great matching trend and so we are good on that. We are not losing ground there. We\u2019ve got our discipline on our underwriting actions and we are going to continue to deliver some improvement there. And we\u2019ve build out a new business and the spread of business looks strong. So, I think we are positioned well but I\u2019m not going to forecast as for the rest of the year.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Okay. I guess, switching gears, just going back to the discussion on capital management. You mentioned it adds $300 million more than previously contemplated. I think on the last call, we had spend some time talking about buybacks versus operating earnings and how to sort of think about that metrics. Could you just sort of refresh that discussion keeping this number? Should we add that to what we might have previously contemplated or should we apportion accordingly? Thanks.","Mike McGavick","Well, a couple of things. First of all, what we said, when we talked about share repurchases before was that you look at last year, which was about $575 million as kind of a floor for what we might do in the coming year. And of course as Pete has already mentioned in this call, we did repurchase at a slightly higher rate than that would imply in the first quarter of $175 million. I wouldn't read too much into that. We think about a number of things when we are repurchasing. We are looking at our internal models of where the buffer to the buffer stands because we're trying to make sure that doesn\u2019t grow any more. So that can affect what we might buyback in the quarter. Similarly like any purchases or shares, we are looking at the economics of the transaction at a given time, as you would have in a reserve. During this quarter, there were -- there were times during the quarter when we were certainly trading below what we thought we ought to be trading and maybe we could argue we still are today.","So their economic aspects to what amount we might repurchase at any given time. So rather than focusing on the $175 million, I had focused on the guidance we\u2019ve already given you. Just as we don\u2019t emphasize, we want to focus on the guidance we\u2019ve given you on expense. When we say, take last year and add plus or minus low mid single digits, we mean take last year in entirety, add lows, kind of mid single digits and then develop that floor. That would be how we would do it. In this case, we would say take the $575 million you can round it to $600 million, if you want, divide it by 4, that\u2019s about where should expect the quarter. If conditions allow, we might buyback more but that\u2019s kind of how we are thinking about. And then to that, I would add $300 million. That\u2019s the real simple way of thinking about it.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. I will stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Mike McGavick","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. You may ask your question.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Hi. Good morning. So, first, just wanted to clarify the $250 million debt remains in capital, that I hear you say that would take a long-term to runoff and so we shouldn\u2019t be expecting that to be soon?","Mike McGavick","Vinay, so what I said was the three buckets that I allocated to, the one that would get would disappear the quickest would be, if we did a transaction in one of the remaining businesses.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Okay.","Greg Hendrick","And then as far as, the one point I guess I will make is this is an allocation of GAAP equity, right. It\u2019s not the regulatory capital, right. It is just an allocation of equity. So, I would encourage you not to spend too much time focusing on the allocation. The total GAAP equity enterprise is not changing.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","So, fair enough. So when you got rid off that piece, I mean I don\u2019t think that would free up any capital, would it?","Greg Hendrick","","I\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t quite understand it.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","So even you got rid of the last piece of your Life Reinsurance business that you have in your books, that would not really free up meaningful capital because you are getting diversification benefits to go ahead.","Greg Hendrick","Yeah. As we\u2019ve talked about diversification benefits in the past, if we continue to exit remaining businesses, it would be same thing that Mike has talked about before, right. I mean, there is a qualitative benefit they are getting out of these businesses. It\u2019s less quantitative than more qualitative.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Sure. That\u2019s helpful. And just the numbers question on the life reinsurance business. So just looking at the presentation, it seems that you are retaining about a $1 million worth of quarterly income and the rest is being seated away, correct? I mean, is that right?","Greg Hendrick","Approximately correct.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Okay.","Greg Hendrick","The vast majority of the profits of the business where and why is being sold.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Fair enough. Fair enough. And then finally on the primary insurance business, I just had a two sided question on that. This quarter, we had about a one-point benefit year-over-year. Do you think that\u2019s enough to get to your combined ratio target and the second point on that is the topline growth was about five points of this quarter? The expenses are growing mid single digits. Help me understand how we have expense ratio leverage in that environment? Thanks.","Greg Hendrick","Sure. Let me start with - it's Greg. Let me start with the second part. The first quarter had some lumpiness to it. I mentioned that return of premium. We are projecting that we will get back in line with the growth that we were trying to get to for this year. And we will control those expenses as we go through the year, if we do not see that growth materializes. It\u2019s clearly a delicate balance. We are not out there pushing underwriters into the market and trying to have them chase premiums, if the margins aren\u2019t there and so we are watching that incredibly closely, month-by-month, head-by-head. And so we will be on top of that.","In terms of the target, if I go back to the first part, I heard you, the one point of improvement relative to the average of the first two quarters of \u201913, we\u2019ve been pretty evoke and when I was going towards our targets when I heard Vinay, it\u2019s another step in the right direction. But we are still not there. We are still pushing hard for our 90% combined ratio target and I have talked at length about all the underlying actions, the portfolio construction, the rate has slowed a little bit. So it\u2019s one, not as strong tailwind but we are well on our way to getting towards that overall month.","Mike McGavick","","And this is Mike. Maybe I could add a couple of thoughts. One, from my perspective on top of the house, I do expect continuing operating leverage to be gained. And if the market were to some how turn even more competitive than it showed itself to be in the first quarter, it\u2019s a way to do so.","We would always make the judgment to, if we couldn\u2019t get into different segments, in different places around the world, if we couldn\u2019t get appropriate, we would be willing to slow down rate of growth, that\u2019s not a problem. But I am not holding Greg to account for a specific set of expenditures. I am holding Jamie account for the ratio that he has committed to produce.","So if there anything turned down in what we can profitably put on the books, we will manage down the expenses in order to gain the operating leverage that we have expected to achieve as a part of this year\u2019s plan. So I appreciate where you are coming from. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way this is going to play because we are in so many different businesses and so many different geographies that tend to be -- it\u2019s a profitable growth available to us. But if we went up in that situation, we will deliver the expansion leverage that we expect.","The second thing that I would point out, I think this is really important data of what Greg has already said. As you know, this is about portfolio management in the round. We are growing the more profitable businesses, we are shrinking the less profitable businesses, and that is producing an ability for our firm to manage these more difficult competitive conditions and still deliver improvement in the overall result. So this is directionally in line with where we are headed. But I think about the first quarter it demonstrates it.","While we are on an overall combined ratio about a point off of the very, very good in first quarter last year, let\u2019s remember that\u2019s mostly about the expense ratio which is because we spent more rapidly this year to even it out over the year rather than kind of the wait and see and then spend attitude that we\u2019ve had in the past. That\u2019s the reflection of our confidence in where we\u2019re going.","So if it\u2019s just that difference that pulls up above that the loss ratios are in line with that very exceptional quarter and we think on a more solid footing, that\u2019s why we are so excited. This does in fact set us up directionally for the results we do intend to deliver.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions. I guess first is, as you were putting this deal together, were you out of the market from a buyback standpoint at any point during the quarter?","Mike McGavick","No, we weren\u2019t. We had put 10b5-1 plan in place before this deal clarified, so that we could continue to transact in case something came of it.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then the second question is, the assets that still remain from the life reinsurance business, based on the market conditions you see out there today, would you describe those as easier to sell than what you have already announced?","Mike McGavick","So there is -- as we noted, there is two main blocks there, $300 million in U.S. term life reinsurance and about a $100 million in income protection blocks. And we don\u2019t see much of a market for income protection blocks right now. But, I always at this point pause and I advertise it\u2019s 1-800 Porrino if you are interested in it, feel free to get Peter call.","On the U.S. term re, which is the $300 million, the larger of the two blocks, I do think there is good signals in the market, but we have not been actively seeking to transact at this time because we wanted to get this larger and more complex arrangement behind us. With that done, again it\u2019s 1-800 Porrino. But as I said, these books are performing in a fairly -- in a way that doesn\u2019t worry, we would be happy to just wind it up. And maybe Pete you can try a little more color on that?","Pete Porrino","Yes. So, Jay, the other thing I would add in addition to the capital market is to -- just to give you a flavor of the books and what\u2019s going on. I mean, they are both in loss recognition and they have both been in since 2005. We take the income protection book since 2005 the total reserve changes -- the total reserve charges have been about $12 million, right. So, clearly insignificant. And then the large U.S. term bucket again since 2005, $39 million over an 8-year period. So, again very comfortable running these off.","The other thing I guess that I would say, as Mike talked about, the U.S. term business and the potential of a transaction. And I am changing my phone number by the way. But to give you perspective, if an opportunity came to offload that business, it\u2019s hard to imagine that we would do the transaction where we would incur a loss of, let\u2019s say, $50 million or more, it just wouldn\u2019t be worth it.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That\u2019s really good color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Thanks. Two questions I'm going to focus on the P&C side if I can. One, can you talk a little bit -- I guess this is a question for Pete about the section or the portion of the loss reserves that were not for short-tail lines, what accident years and lines of business you are seeing those and what trends have been driving the releases?","Mike McGavick","Yes. So I am just going to have Susan cover that real quickly.","Susan Cross","Right. So in terms of the prior year development the quarter as you mentioned it was the 31 million and is slightly driven by short-tail lines. In terms of by accident year within insurance that was primarily the 2012 accident year. And in reinsurance it was spread across the 2004 to the 2012 accident years. There was a modest amount of strengthening in 2013 that related to the German hailstorm losses, the cat losses in 2013.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay. Last quarter we talked a fair amount of an uptick in large losses. How did the first quarter play out, I know the general perception was that the weather was kind of bad?","Greg Hendrick","There was in insurance, there was nothing remarkable to the positive or the negative about the quarter in terms of large losses.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay. That was fine. Thank you.","Mike McGavick","And back on the reserves questions, remember Pete mentioned in his comments, but Global Loss Triangles come out next week, I am sure you all be waiting eagerly.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee. You may ask your question.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","Hi, and good morning. Just when looking at the capital that\u2019s supporting the P&C business, it still looks like you\u2019re going to be operating at a fairly conservative level. I was wondering if you could comment as your earnings power improves in P&C, how if any does that impact your view of the capital buffer as we go forward that\u2019s remaining?","Mike McGavick","Yes, that\u2019s an excellent observation. And clearly, our earnings strengthening, and I would also say us doing a better job as we have been working to do a better job in terms of managing the variability in earnings all the time. As we continue to do a both better job on both of those, I think the Board would agree with us that firm\u2019s risk decline further and that we would take into account. Now, remember we go through kind of a three part analysis. The first part of the analysis is how much capital is required for the primary buffer which is to the rating that we carry.","Then, we look is, are there opportunities to put it to work at a similarly profitable level for our shareholders are better. And then third, we look at what kind of buffer to the buffer should be carry and after we do all of that, we say how much can be return to our shareholders through repurchases or dividend or whatever method. And we look at other things at that time of course like where we are trading and all that kind of things.","So it\u2019s a fairly complex. You will note in there is can we put money to work. We\u2019ll always be looking for ways to grow the impact we make in the world at a profitable return to our shareholders. But still at this time, I would tell you that our -- when we do that, we tend to come back to repurchases as the best use of money that\u2019s left over. But your insight is right, as we have stronger and more robust earnings which we do expect to produce even in this environment, and as we see our ability to through portfolio structure and reinsurance all the tools to better mange the variability of the book, I think you are thinking about that way.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","That is very helpful. Then, just a quick question on your reinsurance purchase. You obviously purchased more reinsurance this quarter. I am wondering just what\u2019s your view going forward given the reinsurance market environment on the ability to maybe do some more reinsurance purchases to improve overall risk management, shape the returns with the portfolio, etcetera in the insurance business? Thanks.","Mike McGavick","If I could start with two introductory comments and then I will turn it over to Greg. One introductory comment is we look at these kinds of transactions through the alliance and partnerships. We believe everybody ought to know what they are doing and do the right thing and we are not looking to arbitrage the hot market is my point. We don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the right way to do business, but we want to understand what the other party gets out of it, we want to know what we get out of it, and then we will do the transaction. But at the end, the second introductory comment I will make is that you would have been in news as you\u2019re asking that question to look at the faces of my colleagues. Greg was smiling and Jamie was frowning just to be really quick. Greg?","Greg Hendrick","I think there is some more room to Mike\u2019s point. This is a long-term trading. We have been trading a lot of our reinsurance partners for many, many years, so this is not about chasing the hot money or putting to work new cares. I\u2019ll just use an example. We\u2019ve just recently wrapped up our May 1 property risk and property cat protections. We gave a good hard look at what our portfolio look like to make sure that we had the right protection for XL based on our own internal capital mine and we went out and peer benchmark ourselves on our net risk position. And we found that we could -- we\u2019re able to achieve this renewal a little bit lower risk attention. We purchased a little bit more limit on our international U.S. cat. We\u2019ve got some expanded coverages and we\u2019re able to add what\u2019s called a risk area cover that helps protect us in the middle kind of middleing size losses that might accumulate over a year. And we\u2019re able to do that within a very, very reasonable purchase relative to last year\u2019s payments. I think there is more to be had, but to Mike\u2019s starting point this is not about being egregious and taking advantage of our long-term partners.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ian Gutterman with BAM. You may ask your question.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Hi, good morning. I guess my first question is the 1-800 Porrino tagline, give us 15 minutes and we will sell you a company?","Mike McGavick","Ian, the only thing I would say is this one took a hell of a lot more than 15 minutes.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","At least it wasn\u2019t 15 years, so that\u2019s good. I would like to -- I guess the problem, Pete, is as soon as one thing gets wrapped up, we focus on the next thing so, but this one is hopefully a good thing. When I look at -- obviously there has been a lot of focus on how much book value you\u2019re going to lose in this transaction. But when I look at another part of your business, the operating affiliates business, it seems the book value there is substantially understated. And I was hoping you could give us some color on how to think about that. I guess I just did a couple quick things using your 10-K and some statutory filings. And the investment managers you had, I'm just focused on the operating affiliates, the investment manager operating affiliates were on the books at $62 million at year end and they earned $78 million last year. And I understand that might be over earning some maybe.","But the point is if you\u2019re earning more than book value, it\u2019s got to be worth a lot more than book value if we put a PE on earnings. And the strategic affiliates, it looks like ASI alone is maybe $150 million to $200 million of book value, and I look at the publicly traded peers in the Florida homeowners market are trading at north of 2 times book. So if I add those two together, it seems that arguably the operating affiliates are understated per book value by the same $578 million or maybe even more that the life reinsurance took a loss on. Am I in the right ballpark? Is there any other information you can give us to help us maybe give you some more credit for the value of those businesses?","Mike McGavick","Well, Ian, as always, a very thoughtful observation and the amount of homework you do shocks me sometimes. I think you know our numbers at least as well as we do sometimes. So your points are exactly accurate, right. So I am trying to add a little bit of color, but I don\u2019t have much more than what you said, because again you went through that in a fair amount of detail. But again as we break out sort of our investment affiliates, as you know we\u2019ve got three categories, the fund investment that we equity account for, our investment manager affiliates, and the insurance affiliates as you laid out. The fund affiliates, these are carried at the net asset value, so really fair value and what\u2019s on our balance sheet are probably pretty close.","For the investment manager affiliates and this is the top one, but I\u2019m trying to walk through it and then give you one specific piece of data. For the investment manager affiliates, we carry those at the end of this quarter with $89 million and just everybody knows what that mean, it\u2019s what we paid for our current stakes, plus our share in the earnings over the years net of the distributions that we\u2019ve received. And according to the equity accounting, we do not write up any of these even if we think that the fair value exceeds the current carrying value, right. So that\u2019s the accounting side of it. From the business side of it, this is a business we really like we\u2019ve been in a long time.","And asset management is a business characterized by strong cash flows and high return on capital. That\u2019s been our experience with our affiliate holdings. So just from numbers around the earnings power that you mentioned the one year, but I\u2019ll go back and I give you a five year view. The $220 million in operating earnings in this business right, the investment management business over the last five years, significant amount of money and again you compare that to what we\u2019re holding it at right now the 89. And again not apples and apples but it is indicative, right.","Now the $220 million includes some meaningful liquidity event realizations and let\u2019s call that sort of 25% have been capitalization event proceed as part of the $220 million, but still significant amount of money. And as we look at the business today, I\u2019d say it\u2019s sort of a mix of established firms, smaller companies in growth, the mix of businesses that look more like asset management companies and may have liquidity events and others that maybe cash generative but less franchise value.","And I now will talk about one company specifically because it is public, but it is hard to put some of the values on these stakes. We are long-term strategic holders of these assets. We\u2019ve got a great track record and we\u2019re very proud of it. The example I would take you to is the one thing that you didn\u2019t talk about is Polar Capital Holdings. It\u2019s publicly quoted in London, we own 7 million shares. We carry our stake at just under $16 million. What it\u2019s trading at these days, the market value of the holding is $23 million above the $16 million. So I can say that you can apply that ratio across the board, but it does give you some sense. Ian, I think you\u2019re exactly right.","And then on the insurance affiliates, new companies, America Strategic is by far the largest one that we have. We record it at book value. Our book value cost on that is something in the $160 million range. And you all know the markets as well as I do. I will disagree with anything you say, but clearly that is a really well-known company in a market that\u2019s getting good valuations right now. And so it\u2019s clearly is worth a multiple of what we carry it on. So I\u2019m sorry for the long-winded answer but it was a very good question.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","That\u2019s very helpful information. Again, I don't think you guys get enough credit for it. The only other follow-up I have is you mentioned, I forgot at the one part, I did forget to ask was you did mention at the book value on the investment managers changes by the earnings minus the distributions and it seems that those distributions are I guess, I would think of that as excess capital, right.","So I think when we think of your capital, we are used to thinking of maybe the insurance earnings. But can you give us a sense of how to think about what dividend capacity out of those? I don't know if there is such a thing as normal distributions but you see what I am getting at, right? Just how do we think about how much capital those things generate on an annual basis just from the distributions?","Mike McGavick","I\u2019m going to ask Sarah, if you don\u2019t mind, Ian, just give a little color on it.","Sarah Street","Hi Ian. Because asset management businesses are not heavily capital uses. The actual distributions of the earnings that we would see every year is relatively high, relative to the earnings that we actually booked through the P&L.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Okay, that is what I was guessing, so that is basically why the book value doesn't change very much?","Sarah Street","Correct.","Mike McGavick","Correct.","Sarah Street","And then it will also go down obviously from the sales. But yes -- no, we get god distributions in terms of dividends out of them every year.","Ian Gutterman - BAM","Got it. Great. Very helpful answers. Thanks guys. Congratulations.","Mike McGavick ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Can I get a little more color on the other reinsurance business that you wrote? It looks like that lifted a bit. I see the footnote but is there a piece of that business that is growing faster than others and what sort of margin are you writing that business at? Thanks.","Mike McGavick","Yeah. Mike, there are several components in it but far in a way the largest of what we described as other would be whole account quarter shares out of select Lloyd\u2019s syndicates. And this particular quarter we wrote one new one which drove the entire increase in the other category of business. The margins on it I think would be similar to a whole, a quota share on a multi line commercial carrier i.e. overtime certainly not as high as our property cat book but we\u2019ve had very, very steady returns on that business over a longer period of time.","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And I guess, I mean, you dovetailing off of that. I mean, how would the property GAAP book coming down a bit. And I\u2019m guessing just generally profitability in that book that you\u2019re keeping is probably a little bit lower now versus where you thought it might be at the beginning of the year. How should we think about the target 90 combined and what are -- maybe the answer is you\u2019ve also got higher combined ratio businesses also receiving a bit so maybe the mix is not changing all that much. But just trying to get some understanding for how we should about reinsurance as sort of a contributor toward that 90 goal? Thanks.","Mike McGavick ","Well, let\u2019s be clear, the 90 is really what Greg has been driving to. If reinsurance was to run at a consistent 90, there will be about a 5 point deterioration of what it is running?","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","No, right, but all-in, I guess, right. And all in, I mean, it is part of the company that also plans to get to a 90 combined.","Mike McGavick","Well, obviously, there is competition all over the place. The property cat business is still on a pro forma basis a very profitable business. And frankly, I still believe even with the pricing pressure on it, it is still driving the vast majority of returns in the reinsurance market right now. I\u2019ll tell you one thing, I'm very happy to be running a reinsurance business in the company like XL now where we have -- there are certainly challenges around running it and doing a platform business.","But we can focus on driving bottom-line profits, wherever the margins are right now. I'm not worried about expenses and so forth, while Greg continues to improve his portfolio business. I'd be much more concerned about the pricing environment if I was running a standalone medium-sized pure reinsurance company.","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question.","Randy Binner - FBR","Hey, thanks for staying on. Just a couple of follow-ups on the deal. I guess the first question is pretty high-level and that is there is been a lot of talk here about $300 million of additional buybacks for 2014. But I think, it is safe to say that when 2015 comes around, you kind of roll into a new set of expectations around leverage, earnings and whatever you would do their to figure out what the incremental buyback would be in 2015 in addition to the $300 million in 2014. Is that correct?","Mike McGavick","Well, we\u2019ll look at \u201915 as that year come upon us. We have a hack of a lot of work to do throughout the next three quarters. And we will see where we are when the smoke clears.","Randy Binner - FBR","Right. But just to clarify, the $300 million is not all we get out of this, I guess I would say is that it would be reevaluated every year.","Mike McGavick","I will say it differently from that. We constantly evaluate the buffer to the buffer in light of all the factors that have already been discussed in this call, including the fact that we no longer have this business and possibly maybe even exit some more we will see and unlikely side. And also how do we do in terms of building more robust earnings and dealing with the variability. We\u2019ve been showing from quarter-to-quarter. So, we\u2019ll take all that into account. We\u2019ll take a look at how XL is trading.","There is just a lot of variables that we\u2019re going to think about as we go into it and we have developed something of a tradition that at the beginning of the year we give you some perspective on how we\u2019re thinking about share repurchases. We\u2019ll do that at beginning of next year. And of course, we\u2019ll try to give you as effective as we can some -- the other thing we really give that could even be remotely called guidance around how we are handling expenses because those are in our control.","Randy Binner - FBR","All right. Understood. And then there has been a lot of interest on the call about maybe how you would get rid of the remaining run-off items. But I guess my question is more towards what kind of yield like investment yield or return can we expect on that and the cash inflow? My expectation when modeling this out is that you can generate some positive income from those two pieces and so any color you can give on that would be helpful?","Pete Porrino","Yeah. This is Pete. I would just say that we -- when we run our models, we\u2019ve done in pretty simply and you can look at what our new money rate is, we are not assuming. When we look at that economics of these deals, we don\u2019t assume that we are going to reinvest those at the ROE of the rest of the business, right. It isn\u2019t that we need that capital in order to write that business, right. And so we are looking at a reasonably low yield with the cash proceeds that we get.","Randy Binner - FBR","What is your new money yield right now? ","Pete Porrino","1.9% I think that overall mix of the business for P&C.","Randy Binner - FBR","Okay. So you reinvest cash proceeds at that -- at the book yield basically?","Mike McGavick ","I mean, yes, basically I\u2019ll say that is true. I mean, we\u2019re not doing anything different with those proceed. I would say that they are more allocated to capital. They\u2019re no longer backing specific liabilities and so they would go at the capital and therefore, they make it a higher percentage of some of our riskier investments, but that is a level of detail we really don\u2019t get into.","Randy Binner - FBR","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remark.","Mike McGavick","Yeah. This is Mike. Couple of things, first of all, again, this was a day we really looked forward to around here and we\u2019re very pleased to have this moment, and I want to, because I know, I\u2019ll have a lot of XL colleagues on the call as well. I want to single out a couple of their colleagues who deserve special recognition for this coming to fruition. On my staff, of course, the Pete and Kirstin Gould, who is our Chief Counsel have been extraordinarily busy and involved in the transaction. ","But representing them as on the point for the whole things has been Steve Robb and Arabella Ramage and they have just done outstanding work and I just want to single them out now.","Sometime, the night, I imagine the teams and people that have been involve with those will probably celebrate a moment in time then they will get back to work and bring it to an actual close. What more than anything, I want to thank all of our XL colleagues. They have been doing great work day and day out to continue to improve the overall business, which is a big part of why we chose to do this. We are able to do this.","And that work continues. It is hard work improving a P&C business from where we started to where we are and to where we need to go. And that\u2019s the principle work that this firms engaged and we\u2019re back to work everyday to achieve our objective on behalf of our shareholders.","So I thank everybody for their continued effort and particularly, Steve and Arabella for their exceptional work in this particular exercise and we look forward to nearly delivery for our shareholder especially in light of the better firm we\u2019ve now created. Thank you very much. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. At this time you may disconnect your lines."],"22715":["XL Group plc (NYSE:XL) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call February  5, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Michael S. McGavick - CEO","Peter R.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David R. Radulski","Thank you, Shirley. Welcome to XL Group's fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement.","On our call this evening, you'll hear from Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions.","Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only for the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Michael S. McGavick","Good evening. Tonight, we are pleased to share with you XL's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. 2013 was a good year for XL with many important metrics demonstrating our continuing year-over-year improvement. As regards to fourth quarter itself, our assessment is a bit more mixed.","While we like a lot of what occurred including the strong performance in many of our businesses, we did see large loss activity in the fourth quarter as occurred in the third diminish the result. More on the fourth quarter in a moment, but overall we feel good about the year now in the books and very good about how we are positioned for 2014 and for the future.","I'll start with some highlights of the year. Our operating return on equity, ex unrealized gains and losses, increased to 12.5% for the fourth quarter and to 10.2% for the full year. Our overall P&C combined ratio improved by close to 4 points versus 2012. Total P&C gross premiums written increased for the fourth straight year as we continue to implement our plans for each of our businesses. For the fifth consecutive year we grew our tangible book value per share delivering increased value to our shareholders. These are solid indicators of our progress.","From a segment perspective, we also saw good practice. For example, Reinsurance delivered a very strong 81.4% combined ratio for the year and an underwriting profit for the eight consecutive year, and suffice it to say in the midst of tough market conditions and international CAT activity in the quarter which Jamie will discuss more later in the call, we are very proud of what our Reinsurance colleagues produced for the year.","In Insurance, 2013 marks the first year since 2009 in which the Insurance segment delivered an underwriting profit. The segment's total combined ratio of 97.1% is the best result in five years. The segment's accident year combined ratio of 96.7% and the loss ratio of 65.9% are also the best performance in these metrics since 2007.","Now as I noted at the opening of my remarks, there was a contrary note on the fourth quarter, as you've seen in our release. In the fourth quarter as in the third quarter, we experienced mutual losses; in this quarter mainly in our North America property book that affected the Insurance action quarter combined and loss ratios.","As you know, these metrics are the focus of much of our attention and the slowing of our progress here does temper on our overall assessment, though only a bit. It is tempered by the fact that the 96.7 insurance accident year, ex combined ratio we delivered in the fourth quarter is no where we wanted or expected to be at this point. But as we have reviewed the second half of the year, we find this level of loss activity to be an aberration when viewed against our full year performance.","For example, for the full year 2013, the combined ratio for our North American property book on the same accident year, ex CAT basis, was 74.3% and the combined ratio for North American P&C was at 91%, continuing their march to our overall target. The fact is that the property group experienced one bad quarter and essentially a year's worth of large losses in the fourth quarter which capped on an otherwise strong year. This isn't going to cause us to change our plans.","As we continue to remix our portfolio, very much a work in progress, we will be even better able to absorb losses like this as they might come and we can see where this balancing effort is already at play. For example, throughout the year we grew our highest margin insurance businesses by over 10% while reducing our lowest margin businesses by 4%, further improving our mix. And to continue the trend we've reported last quarter, year-to-date 70% of insurance businesses had improved loss ratios versus the prior year on an accident year ex CAT basis.","Even in Reinsurance we are seeing the same effect. While we had a degree of CAT losses in our international book in the quarter, the Bermuda reinsurance business produced a combined ratio of 26.2%. And when you look at it from the top of the house, like we do, the total mix of all of our insurance businesses is moving us in the direction we want with a total P&C accident year ex CAT combined ratio of 92% for the 2013 year.","So already we are seeing the effect of a diversified portfolio and more books of business that are producing profit for the enterprise as a whole. We expect benefits from this to only increase as our remixing produces a higher number of margin expanding and less correlated businesses. This will reduce the impact of these outlier quarters.","Turning back to the financials for a moment, and Pete will have more detail on this in his section, we were helped by the strong performance of risk assets in both the fourth quarter and throughout the year, leading to significant earnings from our investment affiliates. In fact both the P&C and Life investment portfolio strongly outperformed their benchmarks during the year helping to dampen the impact of rising interest rates.","As we continue to gain traction from New Ocean, our joint venture with Stone Point Capital, in the end we are consistently looking to our progress over time and from this perspective, we saw a lot of what we like in 2013; a continuing success for Reinsurance, the first underwriting profit for the Insurance segment in four years, the achievement of a double-digit net ROE, it is the direct accumulation of the various actions we have taken to build a solid and strengthening foundation.","It is because we are seeing profitable contributions from an increasing number of businesses and other sources, it is because of our continued prudence in reserving and overall, it is the product of the right and consistent behaviors we've been working towards, over time we expect this progress to continue in 2014.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.","Peter R. Porrino","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $287 million or $1 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $39 million in 2012 or $0.13 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $943 million or $3.23 per share. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $1 million or $1.05 per share for the quarter and $1.06 billion or $2.63 for the full year.","Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 93.3%, 12.6 points lower than the same quarter last year while our accident year combined ratio for the quarter was 97.3% lower by 14.9 points. These improvements were due to lower natural catastrophe losses and the impacts of our underwriting accidents that Greg and Jamie will discuss further.","For the quarter, our natural catastrophe losses totaled $94 million or 6.3 loss ratio points which stood $24 million and $70 million between our Insurance and Reinsurance segments.","By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2012 totaled $352 million or 23.3 loss ratio points, due primarily to the impact of Storm Sandy. For the full year, natural catastrophe losses were $317 million compared to $464 million in 2012.","Prior year development in the quarter was a net favorable $61 million or 4 loss ratio points compared to $98 million or 6.4 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2012. This reflects favorable development of $40 million in Insurance and $21 million in Reinsurance resulting from our fourth quarter detailed ground-up reserve review. Greg and Jamie will cover this in more detail in their comments.","Our operating expenses for the quarter were higher than Q4 2012, largely due to added headcount from expansion in the Insurance segment during the year and lower variable compensation in the prior year quarter due to Storm Sandy partially offset by ongoing efficiency efforts.","Overall, fourth quarter expenses were comparable with the third quarter of 2013. Our Insurance operating expense ratio in the quarter was up from the prior year quarter due to the timing of distribution of expenses between corporate and segment initiatives as well as a change in the buying of proportion of reinsurance in the Insurance segment.","Our purchase of increased quota share reinsurance, particularly in the U.S. professional business line, lowered net written and earned premium in the quarter resulting in approximately 0.5 percentage point increase in the insurance operating expense ratio in the quarter, more offset by the inverse impact on the acquisition expense ratio.","Consistent with our previous disclosures, full year operating expenses for 2013 were 3.3% higher than the prior year, allowing us to improve the company's overall operating expense leverage while continuing our investments in strategic and infrastructure projects.","Our operating tax expense was $4.9 million for the fourth quarter and $77.2 million for the full year. Our full year 2013 tax rate on operating income was approximately 7.6%. This was lower than the 10% tax rate through the first nine months of 2013 as we continue to benefit from the distribution of profits and losses across our global platform, in particular lower levels of catastrophe losses in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.","Turning to investment performance, our investment portfolio delivered a positive total return of 0.6% in the quarter and 0.8% for the year as credit spread tightening, equities and alternative fund gains more than offset the negative effects of higher risk-free rates. We had a negative mark-to-market of $47 million in Q4 and $685 million for the full year 2013. Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $741 million at the end of the fourth quarter.","Our P&C fixed income duration remained unchanged at 3.6 years and remained short, our neutral duration. Net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was $169 million matching the prior year quarter. P&C net investment income in the prior year quarter was reduced primarily by accelerated premium amortization on our Agency MBS holdings due to lower government rates in an environment of ongoing quantitative leasing at that time.","Prepayments on our mortgage holdings continue to create some net investment income volatility. We experienced slower prepayments in our agency mortgage portfolio in Q4 2013, which increased net investment income as the book yields on that portfolio is greater than current new money rates. The P&C gross book yield at the end of December was 2.7%.","We estimate that approximately $3.2 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 2.8% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months. This compares to our average new money rate on our P&C portfolio in Q4 of 2%. We expect net investment income to remain under pressure of the increases in government bond yields that we saw in the second half of 2013, it's the same throughout 2014, we'll have to offset the impact of maturities and paydowns.","Net income from investment affiliates in Q4 was $78 million, up $46 million from the prior year quarter. The returns for alternative funds which we all know as the hedge fund portfolio were very strong in the quarter at $49 million with strong results of $23 million in the quarter from our investment manager affiliates augmented the increase.","Net income from investment affiliates for the full year was $272 million in 2013 compared to $87 million in 2012. The overall rate of return on our alternatives portfolio including the non-equity portion was 12.2% in the year. While we do not view this as a long-term run rate, these types of non-correlated returns represent an important part of our overall investment strategy and continues the growth in book value.","Net realized gains on investments were $12 million in the quarter and $88 million for the full year. This compared to net realized gains of $11 million in Q4 2012 and net realized gains of $14 million for the full year 2012. These figures include a total OTTI charge in 2013 of $16 million down from $81 million in 2012.","With respect to capital management, during the quarter we issued $300 million of 2.3% five-year senior notes and $300 million of 5.25% 30-year senior notes. The net proceeds from the sale of these notes were intended to be used for the repayment at maturity of the outstanding $600 million 5.25% senior notes due in September 2014.","We continue to execute on our share buyback program and during the fourth quarter, we purchased 4.9 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $30.85 per share. For the full year, the company repurchased 22.5 million shares for $673 million at an average price of $29.86. This amount included the $98 million repurchased in January 2013 that was delayed from 2012 because of Storm Sandy. At the end of the quarter $275 million remained available for purchase under our previously announced $850 million share buyback program. We continue to view such purchases as an effective use of surplus capital.","I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Pete. Good evening. Today, I'll cover the fourth quarter and full year results for the segment, provide insight on our continued progress and finish with an update on pricing.","Beginning with the results, our calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.7% was nearly 10 points better than the fourth quarter of 2012 which was adversely impacted by Storm Sandy. On an accident quarter basis, excluding CATs, our combined ratio of 98.2% was 1.7 points higher than the prior year, driven entirely by our expense ratio which Pete detailed in his comments.","The accident quarter ex CAT ratio of 66.7% was essentially flat relative to the prior year quarter and better by 1.3 points relative to the third quarter of this year. Adverse large loss experience of almost $80 million in our North American property and global energy books offset the favorable experience we saw in the remainder of the portfolio.","To offer perspective, the North America property business experienced its worst quarter since the first quarter of 2011 and its second worst quarter in over seven years. In fact, a number of these property losses emerged very late in December and led to our worst month since 2001. Despite this quarterly outcome, the team still delivered a full year accident year loss ratio of 54%, its best since 2009.","When you exclude the two property books, the fourth quarter accident quarter ex CAT loss actually improved by more than 7 points compared to prior year and 3 points for the full year, reflecting several of the underwriting actions we have taken over past 12 to 24 months.","As Pete noted, the segment released 40 million of prior year reserves. The primary driver's a positive movement from our aerospace and excess casualty portfolios as well as prior year catastrophes, partially offset by strengthening in our U.S. professional portfolio.","Insurance gross premiums written were down by $68 million or 5% in the quarter driven almost entirely by our previously advised underwriting decision to non-renew our small solicitor schemes in the UK and Ireland.","Turing to full year results which we view as the best way to measure our progress, we demonstrated continued improvement with an accident year ex CAT combined ratio of 96.7% or 1.8 points better than 2012, our best result in more than five years. All metrics include the expense ratio by 0.8 points, the loss ratio by 0.7 points and the acquisition ratio by 0.4 points.","For the year, gross premiums written were up by $356 million or 7%. Growth was particularly strong in North America where premiums grew 17% for the year with Construction, Property, Primary and Excess Casualty businesses experiencing the largest growth. We shrunk our Lloyd's middle market programs, solicitors and aerospace writings for the year. These businesses all faced difficult market conditions and we had no hesitation to shrink our top line or target pricing that couldn't be achieved.","Shifting to progress, we continue pulling on four levers to improve our combined ratio; mix of business, underwriting actions, operating leverage and rate. In terms of business mix, we made measurable progress in shifting our portfolio to more profitable lines. As Mike noted, during 2013 we grew our high and medium return businesses by 10% and reduced our lowest return businesses by 4%. And we continue to successfully build out new businesses.","In 2013, our North America construction team delivered $200 million of gross premiums and producing underwriting profit in their third year of operation. And we have more new businesses in flight as crisis management, political risk and surety grew 32% to $100 million of gross premiums written this year.","Regards to underwriting actions, we delivered roughly 1 point of loss ratio improvement in 2013 from a number of initiatives across the segment, and we continuously identify and execute on new actions as we view our portfolio. For example, in response to difficult loss experience in our international property and casualty middle market property book, we reduced long sizes for additional treaty and specialty reinsurance and of course pushed increased rate on accounts as needed. With treaty reinsurance fully in place and half the portfolio remain in the first quarter, these improvements will be felt quickly.","We continue to demonstrate improved operating leverage with nearly 4 points of operating expense ratio improvement in 2013 as net interim premium grew by 9% whereas expenses grew by less than 4%. Improvements on our operating as well as ongoing investments in infrastructure are beginning to bear fruit that will further improve our gross operating leverage. Combined with reduced acquisition cost, we believe we will see further improvement in our total expense ratio.","On rate, we once again achieved rate increases that exceeded trend in the quarter and a full year price increase was 3.1% versus 2.7% in 2012. While we see some slowing, particularly in North America and short tail lines, our diversified portfolio allows us the benefit from rate increases in medium and longer tail lines in all geographies.","In the fourth quarter, all of our businesses in our international P&C operation have positive rate in excess of loss trend as well as rate on rate. Our North American and professional businesses both had rate increases over 3%, offset by our specialty business which was down 2%, driven entirely by a very competitive aviation renewal. For the segment, 75% of our portfolio achieved positive rate in the quarter.","In closing 2013 was another step forward for the insurance segment with our best full year underwriting profits since 2007. While this validates the actions we've been taking over the past two years, there is no mistake that we have much to do in 2014. Given our talented team and determination, we believe we are positioned to make even more progress towards our ultimate goal combined ratio of 90% or better.","Now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance.","Jamie H. Veghte","Thank you, Greg. Good evening. I'd like to cover two principal issues tonight; a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and also some comments on our recent renewal season and market conditions.","As Mike mentioned, 2013 marked our eighth consecutive year of underwriting profits with the segment producing an outstanding combined ratio of 81.4% which compares to the 86.9% combined in 2012. This result was impacted by catastrophe losses of $198 million and prior year reserve releases of about $188 million compared to 2012 where we had CAT losses of $241 million and reserve releases of $176 million.","Excluding the impact of both CAT losses and prior year releases, we had a combined ratio of 80.6% compared to 83.1% in 2012. Our year-to-date gross written premium were down 5.7% to $1.9 billion as we continue to manage our way through very competitive trading conditions.","With respect to the fourth quarter, we had a combined ratio of 85.1% producing an underwriting profit of $66.2 million. This compares favorably to the combined of 104.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012, though that particular quarter was obviously heavily impacted by Storm Sandy.","During the quarter, we had the benefit of prior year releases of $21 million and CAT losses of $71 million net of reinstatement premiums. The major contributors to the CAT activity in the quarter were typhoons (indiscernible) and Haiyan and deterioration from storms Manuel and Ingrid in Mexico and the German hailstorms from prior quarters this year. Excluding the impact of prior year releases and CAT losses, the segment produced a combined ratio of 73.6% which compared to 72.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Turning to top line in the quarter; gross written premiums were $165 million, a 4.4% increase over the fourth quarter last year. The increase came from our North American crop facility, increased renewal on timing issues on our U.S. A&H book and new international casualty business.","With respect to the prior year releases, you will note the magnitude of the releases are significantly below last year; $21 million compared to the $55 million a year ago. Virtually all of this reduction, $30.6 million, was due to deterioration in the quarter from the Tramel One surety loss in Spain.","You will recall this loss was mentioned in our last earnings call during Q&A with the phrase I used was, if everything went to hell we would have less than $20 million of additional exposure beyond the $11 million we posted through the third quarter. I was obviously wrong.","The deterioration exceeded our expectations in this quarter and resulted from several factors including more clarity around the potential numbers of claimants from our ceding companies and refinement of the potential impact of statutory interest on the underlying settlements. Given the ruling from the Spanish Supreme Court on this matter was not rendered until late in the third quarter, perhaps it's not surprising that our initial assessment was wrong. Nevertheless, I am embarrassed by the error. We always seek to give you what we know and be as candid as we can on these calls. I think you will note our track record in this regard has been pretty good, but in this case I got it wrong.","Turning to market conditions. You have no doubt heard on a number of earnings calls this quarter how competitive the recent renewal season was. Given the substantial amount of capacity in the CAT market, prices not surprisingly adjusted down 15% to 20% on the U.S. business and 5% to 15% in the international market, though loss impacted geographies such as Germany and Canada had more stable trading conditions.","In addition to price, we saw terms and conditions loosen. There was pressure on hourly causes, reinstatement provisions, increased use of multiyear contracts, expanded geographic scope and more replacements with aggregate features although the market did successfully resist some of these coverage expansions.","Given these challenges, I'm more than pleased with the steadfast result of our underwriting teams and the resulting portfolio. We continue to monitor rate adequacy on this portfolio in the same fashion we have for over a decade. And the profile of the book indicates we expect to generate a very satisfactory return.","In addition, we spent a good deal of time developing strategies for our individual trading partners prior to the renewal season. There is no question the market operates less and less on a pure syndication basis and we see some catastrophe placements akin to the vertical marketing environment we've seen in the aviation market for years. That is preferred reinsurers with long relationships and lead capacity get better signings and in some cases differential pricing on individual placements.","Our status as a first tier market in this environment was confirmed during the CAT renewal season. While not a perfect barometer, our signings relative to authorizations actually improved on the Bermuda CAT book from 87% a year ago to 89% in this renewal season. While the strength of relationships is something universally claimed by reinsurers as a core advantage, there is no doubt in my mind our performance during this renewals validated XL re-status with our producers and customer base.","With respect to long tail and specialty markets, the theme remains the same, I've been reporting for quite some time. Other than pockets of the market and select opportunities, the environment is extremely competitive and pressure remains on both reinsurance pricing and terms and conditions. This is particularly true with commission structures on proportionate placements. We continue to navigate our way cautiously through this phase of the market and our trading with long-standing clients with proven track records.","Finally, I would like to highlight one operational note. You would recall we announced the hiring of Chris McKeown as the CEO of our joint venture with Stone Point New Ocean Capital Management. Chris was up and running, deploying capital, burning renewals, launched two funds and attracted two significant new investors for the funds. We are very pleased with the reception this venture has received from the market and look forward to its continued build out and development.","With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A.","Shirley, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Michael Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Hi. Thanks. First question on the operating expense ratio kicking up this quarter. It sounds like you guys are confident there'll be improvement next year, but why is that given market conditions appear to be more competitive and top line growth is apparently slowing a bit?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start off and turn it over to Peter. First of all, even with the uptick in the year which Pete likely had both the timing aspects and also aspects related to our reinsurance placements and the like, in the end what we forecast for the year came in at the low end of the range that we forecasted here. So, I'm very pleased with the way we control expenses and continue to gain operating leverage. We continue to expect to be able to achieve both in these lines that we've been remixing towards and I continue to be confident that that will outstrip our expenses. But this is the time of year when we try to give you some perspective on how we look at expenses for the coming year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.","Peter R. Porrino","Yes, Mike, as you well know there's two basic factors into that ratio; the premiums earned and then what the actual expenses are. And I'll let Greg and Jamie go through premiums. Well, obviously we don't forecast premium activity. When I think about losses \u2013 when I think about expenses, I'd say our expectation for next year would be sort of normal expense growth that you would expect and then a little bit more for some of the new business initiatives that both Greg and Jamie had in mind. As I think about it sort of in total, I'd have a mid single digit number in mind. I mean certainly \u2013 again depending on our premium growth, we would expect that you would see some continuing benefit of operating leverage there.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, Mike, it's Greg. Look, I'm not going to forecast premium growth, I'd just point to what I've said in the past that a number of our businesses whether it's in programs, we talked about the solicitor scheme which is a block of business that all renews in October 1, the same date our primary casualty, our large property, I can go on, they are very lumpy businesses. To do it quarter-to-quarter growth, I know this quarter was down flat when you adjust for that solicitor's program. It is very lumpy and you're not going to have smooth gross. I'd point you back to the year where we did a pretty good job of growing into that upper single digits in the year 10% over the past couple of years.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","That's helpful. I guess lastly, on some of the large non-CAT losses, I think you guys said it was mainly North America primarily in December. Anything there you think \u2013 you'd like to quantify for us or name?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, we don't talk about specific insurance, so I won't get into that. I quantified in the remarks the $80 million delta year-over-year. We had three losses that were over 10 million and then \u2013 kind of what I would call midsized, the collection of midsized losses contributing as well.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Jay Adam Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. I guess if you look at 2013, looking at your buybacks and dividends, it seems to be a little less than your operating earnings. Can you talk about what that relationship might look like in 2014, especially with the stock pulling back and trading notably below book value?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, so I'll start again and pass it to Pete, but Jay I appreciate the question and the observation. In total, the year came in strong and with more than $1 billion on net income for the year, obviously that was a bit more than the 575 we repurchased and the dividends combined. And that is not our goal, as you know. Our goal in essence is to not have a buffering to our rating agency capital and our regulated capital growth. So we are taking that in mind as we go before the Board in February and set the program for this year. But I'll ask Pete to get a little more granular about that.","Peter R. Porrino","Sure. I'll just cover (indiscernible) so when we do our share repurchase authorization. Typically we do that every year. We'll do that in the February Board meeting, so you will likely see an announcement that comes out after that. And I would say, Jay, as your comments are clearly not lost in us with our stock ticking down relative to build value. Certainly with the progress that we're making in the business, we feel really good about where this is going down the road and trading at 80% of full value doesn't feel very good. And the only thing I would add would be and consistent with what we said in some other prior years is we think about buybacks. You look at the 575, it's sort of from the baseline. You can never predict the future but our hopes will be that certainly (indiscernible) very well could see a number above that.","Jay Adam Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Pete. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask you question.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","Thank you. With regard to the underlying insurance combined ratio of 97 to 98 for the past three quarters, I know that target is still 90% and I was just thinking perhaps you can give us an update in terms of when you think that might be feasible?","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike. We've never forecasted a specific landing on that in terms of plan. We note that we were making very significant progress. I do think as I noted in my comments, the last talk [ph] of this year didn't add the momentum we expected, but when we went back with them \u2013 we do this on an extremely granular basis, we basically said \u2013 but this is an average. We are not going to change how we're handing this book given how we put those losses in the context of everything we are doing. And we believe that as that kind of unusual activity normalizes which we fully expect it will, we're going to see the benefits of the increasing profitability of the portfolio. And as that starts to kick in, I think the progress towards where we're going fundamentally reignites. Greg, you might want to add something.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, let me talk about the trajectory that we're on kind of some of the parts of the business I'm excited about and just reiterate the lever that we're pulling on. As I look at where we've been the last two years, I like the path we're on. Over the last three years, right, we always try and steer you to the annual route and the quarter-by-quarter. We've seen accident year ex CAT combined ratio improve from 112% in 2011 to 98.5% in 2012 to 96.7% last year, so our best year since 2007. And as I said in my remarks, we produced our first calendar year underwriting profit since 2009 which is a testament to what we've been working on underneath as well as prudent reserving. Is this where I'd like us to be? Absolutely not. We are on the right path and with the right team. We talked to you about where I'm excited. I see strong momentum across North America in P&C, particularly our risk management, excess casualty, construction and property businesses. As I noted in my remarks, we continue to successfully build out crisis management, political risk, surety and also inland marine, lines where both the industry and our leaders have demonstrated superior returns in past years. Also, during the year, we brought in new leadership in our marine, international and professional businesses two books that caused us somewhat earlier in '13. And our specialty business had a stellar calendar year result, in fact far better than the profitability goal for the year. Finally, I'd say as I discussed we are executing on our levers of improvement. Rates are ahead of trends for the segment. We continue to identify on the right actions to execute on those plans quickly and we're improving our mix both in the business and across the portfolio. If I put those three together, the trajectory where I'm excited and how we've been disciplined, I'm sure we're going to be able to deliver improved results over time.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","All right, thank you for that. And then on the reinsurance side with rates coming in, I'm just trying to calibrate what we should expect the impact to be on the underlying combined ratio going forward?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, certainly rates were off, Jay. We don't forecast combined ratios. Obviously the reinsurance book is much more volatile than an insurance book, but I think it's fair to say with the CAT market coming off substantially as it did and the CAT portfolio representing now well north of 25% of our book of business, it would not be unreasonable to expect an uptick.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then last one for Pete, what's the best effective tax rate to use for modeling?","Peter R. Porrino","So, I would have preferred you probably worded that slightly differently. So what we said in the past is that we've been looking at a 10% to 12% effective tax rate if you look at it over a number of years that's what you would see. As I said in Q3, the first nine months had indicated that we were doing better than 12% and so the nine-month number that we use was 10. And again, as I said we had again things in the right place (indiscernible) with the effective tax went up for the same \u2013 opposite reasons. I can't give you a number per se but the potential 12 range is pretty much where we've been coming at recently.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. I wanted to get some color on the professional lines both in the Insurance segment \u2013 especially in the Insurance segment but also Reinsurance. Specifically grossed in that, looks like you guys are buying a whole lot more Reinsurance, can you talk about why that is, the trends you're seeing? You had some issues there in the second quarter where you took your picks higher, maybe you can update us on the progress as well?","Michael S. McGavick","I'm going to turn it to Greg but I just want to emphasize. I saw the unsolicited offer by one of our leading reinsurers as in incredible validation of the talent of our team and I was pleased with the transaction. I think it lowers risk and it certainly have a very important point in time and I really expect in the end that both we and our reinsurers will benefit from this transaction. But Greg, would you please\u2026","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure, Mike. Let me review kind of the \u2013 if I can get at your question, Greg, some of the underlying dynamics of that book, how we kind of got the decision to purchase a quota share and how we look at the portfolio going forward. So, as a reminder, our Hartford team has built a well diversified portfolio over the last decade and the recognized market leader for public D&O. That seems known for solving the more difficult risks, often in the primary layer through a combination of coverage, structure and price. In the past few years, we've seen security class action lawsuits continue to slow but regulatory investigations and M&A related losses have picked up. These types of claims tend to occur with a higher frequency and a lower severity and develop at a faster pace. As you noted, Greg, we've been watching this closely and you are right, we did increase our loss ratio for 2013 during the second quarter and we also discussed the corrective actions we have been taking as well as significant rate changes that are put in place starting at the end of 2012. Over the past few years, we've protected that book with a per risk excess to loss with a sizable retention. This protection just wasn't responding to loss activity we've been experiencing and this led us to consider other reinsurance protections. At the same time if you were looking at that efficacy of that purchase, as Mike noted, one of our long time reinsurers approached us on an unsolicited basis and offered attractive quota share terms. This allowed us to place the 50% quota share of our Hartford professional line on an enforced new and renewal basis. The treaty is diversified across the panel of top reinsurers and almost all of them have reinsured this portfolio in the past either with the same firm or the same individual underwriter at a different firm. Looking forward, we remain very bullish about this book for 2014 and beyond and anticipate a return to sub 90% combined ratio for the calendar year matching our 2013 accident year performance. It is rewarding that our view of the possibility is shared by our reinsurers and we believe this will be a mutually profitable relationship. As always, we remain fully committed to achieving our targeted underlying margins on a gross basis and are not changing our underlying appetite or integrity due to treaty reinsurance arrangements. In summary, given the terms and conditions available in our reinsurance market and occupancy activity we observed in 2013 \u2013 shares a prudent approach to protect our 2014 underwriting year.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Very thorough, I can see exactly what you did. Just from an accounting perspective going forward, how should we be thinking about that? I don't know if it's a question for Peter or somebody else, just premiums and then other parts line as the quota share comes through just so we can get our models correct?","Peter R. Porrino","Sure. This is Peter. Certainly our premiums ceded in that line of business are going to go up materially net premiums written and our net premiums earning would go down materially not on the same time. For example, in this quarter we only had just under $30 million of and a much bigger number of written. When you get down and look at the ratios that reduction in the net premiums earned will impact for example our insurance operating expense ratio, right. There is no offset dollars but there is a big offset in the denominator. So the numerator stays the same, the expenses and the denominator changes materially, the premium. On the commissions and brokerage, on the acquisition expense ratio, you have an offset in the dollars. So the commission, the ceding commission that we receive from the reinsurers goes against that line. And so it's to an extent that the ceding commission is above our acquisition cost ratio, you will see in essence a negative acquisition cost for that business more than offsetting the reduction in the premium range.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Great. And last this is a go-forward contract only, right, a quota share for current business being written, this doesn't cover previous accident years at all?","Michael S. McGavick","It doesn't cover previous accidents, it covered the book at November 1, but not back to '12 and prior accident years.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley","Okay, perfect. Thanks for the color guys.","Michael S. McGavick","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG","Thank you. Good evening, everyone. When you look at your overall business, you went through a bunch of changes looking at businesses that you thought were under earning or potential unattractive, if you look back on 2013, what percentage of your businesses are earning an attractive return on equity, what percentage aren't? And can you give us some guidance on what that goal is today on allocated capital?","Michael S. McGavick","The allocated capital will be a little bit more difficult. Let me tell you what I think about where we're headed. This is, from my perspective, when you try to look at where the book \u2013 what part of our book is in the performing versus improvement, if you will, you got to step back and it's more than just last 12 months of performance, right. We look at our longer time of results, then we blend it in with the future concepts that we can deliver in the future. As I look at it from a far, one thing to note is we're not talking about whole businesses here, we're talking about sub portfolios that reached the business. And so as I aggregate those out and look and blend that historical with the future of forward-looking, we're looking at roughly 20% of our portfolio needing to improve returns to a more acceptable level as we come out of '13 into '14.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG","And that's based on normalized loss adjusted basis?","Michael S. McGavick","That is a very substantial change from where we started in '10.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG","I would agree. But those businesses that you're talking about are not because of one-off losses and unusual. That's on a run rate basis, you're saying?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, we're looking through those. When you get these \u2013 you have to make a lot of decisions about whether can recur, whether we should buy down or that should change your strategy. Now, we've been through all those assessments and we're comfortable with where we are. But that's really about is when we look at the business side on an ongoing basis and the trends we see on them. And as you might guess when we have something that's underperforming that's where a lot of love [ph] goes. That's where you tend to see leadership changes and we're very driven to get it right. We'll never be where all of them \u2013 well, maybe we'll have that from time to time but generally speaking, there will always be something that's a little down. It's a cyclical business and there's a bunch of sub cycles that we're dealing with. But I'd have to tell you that as we enter '14, this is a confident bunch and one that is very committed to take the actions necessary to continue to expand our margins.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG","How should I think of the allocated capital involved versus the unallocated capital?","Peter R. Porrino","I'm sorry, Josh. We were having a hard time following the question. Could you repeat?","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG","Sorry. So I assume that your ROE on applied capital is higher than we were actually achieving because there's plenty of capital in the business that isn't being allocated. That would be a correct assumption I would think yes?","Michael S. McGavick","The bottom line is we look at it both ways. So we're well aware of what the required capital is in our business and then we also look on a total allocation of capital, and we run it through our models, internal model basis. And then we do go back too and allocate all the capital because in the end it's a total return for the business. So we look at it on all three of those basis, not just the one view you're describing.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG","Well, I'm just saying that if you could get your \u2013 the rating agencies on board and get your capital to where you think it ought to be, how much better would your returns be today than they are?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, (indiscernible) has been mentioned there to look at it. I do believe that \u2013 let me give you three pieces. This is a great question and a gift to our focus on improving the ROE which we are well aware is kind of the next generation of jump for us. The core of improving our ROE is improving these operating results. That is the heart of the matter. That's why we put so much focus on giving you all this color commentary around accident year ex CAT results. So that is the heart of the matter for this business. That's the thing we're most focused on. At the same time, you're right in observing that we have because we haven't been delivering at the level we would like. On the operating side, we have been carrying more capital because we believe that until we get \u2013 than we should be. And so we are driven to start seeing that kind of buffer come down over time as the business results go up. So those are two pieces you can think of as a motion and you've already heard Pete say that when we think about that in capital repurchase terms, we're talking about what we bought back last year as something of a minimum. We don't want to forerun our Board. We talked about it in several ways but that's how we think about it. And then there's a third piece that you have to keep in mind is as we said before, when you get the P&C businesses continuing to move on the trajectory they are moving, over time the life block becomes a bigger and bigger driver on the ROE because \u2013 you can do the math on what's it returning right now given its capital and earnings and it's very clear that that's a drive right now relative to where the book is headed. And that it's magnified over time as the P&C operations improve. So those are the three blocks that we're thinking about and then we have nice additional potential benefits from the nice block of affiliated investments that we built and everything else. So that's how we're thinking about it. We continue to believe we can drive the ROE to consistently better levers and those are the levers we're thinking now.","Peter R. Porrino","Josh, the only thing I would add is that that majority is allocated in that calculation.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG","That's a very good answer, I appreciate it. And just one suggestion to you and Mr. Radulski there. I think you guys could benefit from giving us eight quarters of information on severe non-CAT losses if we had the numbers. I know you give us the delta but I think it would be a benefit to your disclosure.","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, I appreciate that. We will look at that hard because I really do think \u2013 he gets the benefit of looking over long periods of time and that's why we're able to make judgments about whether to react or not react or how severely to react to what we see and that's why you're hearing probably \u2013 and maybe I hear you saying that you find us a little more common. He might be (indiscernible)","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess I want to go back to the severe non-CAT losses and I can understand how an analysis would suggest that there's been a flaw in the underwriting, but having ascertained whether the rates are appropriate or the frequency of severe losses?","Michael S. McGavick","So I'll start on that. I'm going to guess that Greg will want to add some more color. But we do a number of exercises to try to satisfy our expected losses in different buckets size of loss. And then we add that altogether and so roughly in a given year based on history and we have long data sets in books. We can analyze what's the rough expected number of each kinds of losses relative to the rates we've been charging because that's the moving target, an improving one over the last few years as you know in property but that is slowing as everybody has commented on. And then we kind of engineer what we think with all those pieces in motion, we would forecast for the next year. And obviously you see because we're dealing with specific losses and generally speaking large lines out there. Then you go back and you see how do you feel about the pattern that emerges. Right now, I'm really pretty pleased with what I see and the discipline of these underwriters in several respects. First of all, beginning several years ago and I realized I'm going to turn to Greg because I'm about to steal his thunder, but we really changed a lot of our limit strategy, we changed reinsurance. We just made so many changes that got us out of some of the really spiky losses that we were seeing. And so in that regard, I'm very pleased with where the portfolio stands. Then to go back when you have a spiky quarter like this, you try to put it in your longer term context to try and understand. And when we went through the numbers in-depth on a quarterly basis and interesting in this case a month ago, just cause it turned out that one month really packed the wallet, you just saw this \u2013 it just stood out so prominently over time that you realize you could buy down this spike that you'll be doing a good service to your shareholders because you would have to buy it down with giveaway expected profit from our point of view. So instead rather expect the normal and react only if future quarters change our view of what's normal. I'd note a couple of other things and turn it over to Greg because I know Greg will want to get into the detail on this, but \u2013 it's already a dead end to the earnings season and unlike say the third quarter, I mean it was clearly a noisy fourth quarter in terms of additional losses we saw by reinsurers, we've seen it come in, in our other markets and that's another indicator that we would take heart from. But Greg, I'm sorry\u2026","Gregory S. Hendrick","That's all right, Mike. A little bit about where we've been, the actions Mike referred to in our international book we've been putting out, is in the combination of '12 and '13, right. So there is international limits on CAT are lower. We've been executing on a strategy and we were very successful, may not be the best review but we're very efficient at removing our poor performing lower tier business. At the same time in our international, we've been generating some new business in less volatile industries like healthcare and real estate. So that's one piece of our international. On North America we just had some really good results and I'm very pleased with where we've been. We've been reducing sub limits along the way. In fact on one of the losses we had, it had reduced our share by 50% because we're worried about the business interruption exposure and so we're proactively getting after the book. I touched a little bit on the international middle market property. In terms of specifically on the frequency, in the two big large property books which is in our North America property and our international property, our large plan frequency was in line with what we expect. It was just the severity as we've already talked about a few times. It was higher on a few of the claims that really drove a lot of this action. I don't see anything in the culmination of all the activity we've been at and the frequency being or find what we'd expect that makes us thinking of anything other than a strong book in our property. One last thought, rate adequacy; in North America I think we're near or at rate adequacy. Clearly on the international book and we've talked about this on numerous times in the past, we've got some more work to do to get that book closer to full rate adequacy.","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike. And I know we're timing this topic hard and I appreciate that not all of you may be as deeply interested in it as we are, but obviously we view these calls as our job is to represent to you as best as we can and as accurate as we can what we are feeling about the book and where we see it going. That's the job we have. And so we thought a lot about this because we know it could stick up and be a subject to questions and we were afraid that that could in essence misinformed because we know enough about this book to not believe that's where it's headed. Does it mean we know the future, we could be wrong, but we don't think this is a lesson of the strength of the book that's emerging and that's why we're spending so much time on it. Let me give you one more thought about that. We had emphasized several times that our goal is to get to 90 combined and we've also emphasized that we'll do that as a fully developed target. And one of the reasons that we emphasize that so much is in our prudent approach when we are studying reserves. When you get a bunch of large losses right at the end of the quarter, you're getting your earliest perspective on those losses. Can you book prudently in accordance with your earliest view? But I would point that even in property, a short tier line over the last three years, we've released $100 million in PYD. So that prudence has a benefit that comes to the firm over time. And while that may not happen in the future, we are in a business and lots of things can happen. That approach of the business we think holds up well for our shareholders even if it doesn't always express the accident year in the way we really believe it's performing \u2013 to perform.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.","Okay, that was very helpful. As a quick follow-up, Greg, you mentioned that there was some adverse development in U.S. professional liability and I was hoping you could sort of ballpark for us or talk about what's going on there?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure, absolutely. For the year in our Hartford or U.S. based professional book, for the full year we had adverse about $110 million. It's across multiple accident years but it's focused primarily on the 2009 to 2011 accident years. It's generally speaking a reduction and the need for reserves to be held against large events. I'll take to you about the offset by an increase in the higher frequency loss \u2013 the very losses I referred. And as a trend, we observe both in our second quarter and fourth quarter reserve units. For perspective on that, the 2009, 2011 accident year for that book had 2.1 billion of net earned premiums, so these are small loss ratio changes affectively representing that shift. We're seeing lower events that we're able to reduce the portion of the reserves that we allocate there, but we're increasing on those kind of higher frequency, lower severity claims. And from me anyway because -- and something we've been on for about 18 months now.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thanks. The next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask you question.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank","Yes. Thanks. A couple of quick questions here. First, Mike and Greg, you mentioned that pricing up about 3.1% in excess of trend, what is trend running and I'm just curious Mike what are your thoughts on kind of the outlook for lost trends your going for at professional liability because you kind of talked about that?","Gregory S. Hendrick","So for the segment and the way we look at tends here on the short tier lines, you look at trend as zero because we will pick up that exposure trend increase in the base that writes the premium. So we would blend out across the segment. We're just under 2% or 1.8% trend for the segment in '13. From where I sit at the moment, I don't see us with any significant change in that moving over time. You asked about professional, I'm just trying to fit the number here and it looks like it's about a little over 2% for our global professional business.","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike. There's no seismic change out there on what's going on in right now. Remember that we're not a terribly large writer of guaranteed customer comp, so that's one of the ones that you see out there with a lot of noise because of what's going on in the health care system. We do see the big Supreme Court cases that everybody's waiting on and class action and stuff like that, which will be a positive on the trend although quickly point out that I don't care what the Supreme Court decides on that, in the end I don't see managements and boards getting less accountable over time. I see it as more accountability whatever the mechanism is. So I in the end can't pick out any trend that I'm profoundly worried about as we sit here right now. Those can emerge, you never know, but nothing sticks out. And as a result, the blended rate that we're getting, I'm very pleased by it. And then when I break it down and look at the different books of business and their difference performance, I get even more optimistic. For example, the rate in this last quarter was pulled down some by what we saw in terms of our specialty book of business and which was actually below \u2013 a downward rate pressure on that block mainly related to what's going on in aerospace kind of environment there. But when I look at the combined ratio that that business is delivering, it's terrific on an all-in basis on a calendar year basis, it's just terrific. And you know our competitors and our clients can see that because we're dealing with a lot of that being priced centered out of life, there's an awful lot of transparency to that performance. So, we're going to expect some downward pressure there but we are in a very good position to deal with that. So when I kind of break it down and then I say, well, that's a 3.1 versus 1.9 on a rate versus trend but I have that negative impact on a good chunk of our block good performance, we're getting the rate that we need it. We're under pressure. There might be some \u2013 for the pressure all day long and I'm willing to shed business from (indiscernible). I like the way the book kind of adds up as a whole.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank","Great. And then just one quick one for Pete. I mean you guys are talking about how the Life business has continued to be a drag here. Any updates and thoughts on kind of what the market is \u2013 potentially do something with the Life business?","Michael S. McGavick","There's nothing to share at this time. We have said continuously that that's not a business we seem to be in. It's in runoff and we're open to ideas and when ideas come in then believe me, we\u2026","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Any good ideas lately?","Michael S. McGavick","You're always wondering what's going to come in the door.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask you question.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","A lot of M&A and M&A type question but I'd like to be kind of big picture. I personally think we're going to see sort of a natural increase in M&A given the market softening, but you folks have obviously been asked and talked with this stuff and I want to ask how would XL handle when someone approaches management with any sort of offer. I'm interested in sort of the procedures, does the Board get involved early in the process or is it later? How do you look at hurdle rates for M&A and has that changed any time recently?","Michael S. McGavick","I'll start with the second question first because it's the easiest one. There's been no change in how we view it, the hurdle rates, for acquisitions we might make. We're looking for things that \u2013 when we evaluate ideas and we see ideas flowing increasingly across the business, we tend to focus on things that will either build out a geography or a product or something like that in terms of how we're building this more diversified book of business. So I'm really \u2013 we haven't changed in our attitude towards what kinds of returns we would expect or what kind of strategic advantage we'd expect to gain. We have tendered over time but we've always said this is not a rule but rather kind of a guideline in our mind. We tendered towards things that would be on the smaller side because we don't want our culture disrupted. We think we have a fantastic and strengthening underwriting culture and we're only interested in adding things that are consistent with that or that are small enough that it gets us by our culture and made like us and doesn't change how we operate. And what hurdle rate we would entertain, it's not going to improve the business. We tend not to be interested. So it's pretty straightforward. In terms of how we would react as things come toward us, look, a couple of notes. We choose to operate in an extremely transparent way with our Board and that's the way we would react to anything that happened in the ecosystem that we thought they should know about. I would tell you that I generally agree with your observation that the preconditions for M&A are higher all the time. I think that you've missed what I think will be one of the biggest drivers whenever and that is what I think are going to be the increased demands of the regulators and the less efficient use of capital that will create and I think that will also be another cause of increased potential to M&A. But in the end the way this management will respond to things that come at it whether ideas for us or people who might have other visions for our future is the way you would expect us to look at it. What is in the long-term interest of our shareholders and how do we achieve the best result for our shareholders. And I can assure you that there's nobody at this table and I'm referring to the management table that's I'm sitting at that will analyze that from a personal point of view or even from shareholders point of view.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Kind of what I expected. And separately \u2013 I apologize, this is definitely a question someone wanted me to ask which was in the life insurance book, is there some structural issues in terms of where the book arrived that makes it more or less challenging to spin it off? Is has been sort of easily carved out of your rest of the book or is it on the same paper intertwines sort of from a legal entity perspective with the rest of the book and I probably should have known this already, but \u2013 so I apologize if it's a stupid question but it's my question.","Peter R. Porrino","Hi, Paul. It's Pete. It's definitely not a stupid question. Let me put that into two segments. The first one is the nature of the business which we've spoken about on prior calls where the bulk of the asset to liabilities is in the premium annuity blocks that is written in Europe, most of it is written in the UK. There's a fair amount of it as well written in Ireland. That is a reinsurance block, not a primary block that is a much more typical transaction than most of them, not all of the ones that you have seen so far around the world. That's the first part of that answer. The second part of your question on the legal entities, it would be difficult to do a legal entity sale that would remove us from the primary responsibility of those policies. Okay, so any transaction that would happen would likely have some reinsurance element assigned to it.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Got it, interesting. Thank you. That was interesting and appreciate it. Great quarter.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. You may ask your question.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.","Hi. For the professional liability reinsurance treaty, could you remind us about the size of the treaty? You said there's a 50% quota share on that, correct?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, that's correct, 50%.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.","Right, and what is the size \u2013 what are the dollars or the premium that you'll be saving because of that?","Peter R. Porrino","Vinay, this is Pete. We've never disclosed \u2013 since we've told the percentage, right, we've never disclosed specifically to that \u2013 what that book of business is. And so I gave you the number for the treaty, you would certainly have the number for that book on a direct basis but we just never disclose that.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay. Just curious if we should take down our net premiums on the next quarter substantially and it maybe by about $300 million to $400 million or is that too high a number?","Peter R. Porrino","Vinay, I don't quite know how to answer that. That's a pretty narrow range. We just don't forecast the premium. That rate is not out of the ballpark but I can't get more scientific than that.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.","Sure, fair enough. The second question just a follow-up on the large property losses, so fourth quarter was about 80 million, third quarter was about 30 million, so we add these two up, there's about a 110 million. So is it the right way to look at the 20, 30 numbers, 30 accurate and the combined ratio was 96.7. So take away 2.5 points from large CAT losses and is that the right way to look at it? And Mike has this changed your view to excel the ability to get to a 90% combined ratio by '15?","Michael S. McGavick","I'll start with your last question, no. Greg.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Vinay, those are deltas year-over-year. I'd say 2012 was a very good year, 2013 was not as strong in property and so I still think it's somewhere in between those two numbers and similarly happened what you have in 2.5 points, but it's a very subjective thing. You got to go back and look over time. As you go back over time, you see \u2013 that is the outcome on the property book. You're going to have very, very good years and you're going to have some tougher years, so it's hard to give you \u2013 it's not a straight line business like a small commercial or a homeowners' book, but you frame the delta from one year to the next. I'd like to think we're a lot closer to a 12 but being prudent\u2026","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie Research. You may ask you question.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Hi. Very quickly one follow-up on the 110 million development, was that for the quarter or was that for 2013? And do you have the number for 2\/4\/2013? I'm talking about the professional book which you mentioned?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes that 110 was for the full year. The majority of it was in the fourth quarter. What had transpired in the second quarter was still the level of reduction that we took in the large event portion of the reserves was offset almost identically with the increase in the attritional. So this is the quarter where we \u2013 after we got another six months. We took a full hard look at it in our semiannual reserve review that we've changed the attrition loss ratio reserves much more than the class release.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it, that's helpful. And then I guess the only other question would be was there any adjustment to NV1 and NV2?","Jamie H. Veghte","Hi, it's Jamie. Let's cover Littleton in 2011 was driven by the deterioration in one large program. We had our full limits reserved up, so none there. On the 2010 again one program had a $500 million increase in the round up loss. We had a $7 million line on that program. The impact from the quarter was $2 million.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. Thanks for the answers and congrats on the results.","Michael S. McGavick","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Bobman with Capital Returns. You may ask you question.","Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns","Yes, I feel as a shareholder, I shouldn't be last in line, but I think I'll discuss that with Mr. Radulski at some other time. I have two questions. This solicitor's reinsure that is fond of your D&O book also now employs a large professional liability team also that came from another Hartford company and I was wondering so we don't face the same fate, did you get additional protections that the same fate with that other professional liability team doesn't happen to ours?","Michael S. McGavick","We were so focused on your beat down on Radulski. I'm sorry, Ron, can you help us with that last bit.","Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns","Sure. So this solicited reinsurer that is fond of our D&O book and that KPU and he's reinsuring that he isn't taking I guess a lead position or the only position in reinsuring the professional labiality D&O book for you, also hired a whole team of people from other Hartford-based company a few years ago. And so I was just wondering so we don't face a similar fate, I'm curious whether you got any sort of supplemental protections that the [XL D&O team doesn't make its way to this reinsurer?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Let me speak solely to what our relationship is with the team at Hartford. They've been with us\u2026","Michael S. McGavick","Our team at Hartford\u2026","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, our team at Hartford Connecticut that writes our U.S. public D&O book they've been with us for over a decade. We have a long-term relationship with them and in fact we have just renewed it for another \u2013 basically it's never green and we just reset the contract starting January 1, 2014. We are incredibly happy with them. They are incredibly happy to be here and I'm not at all worried about the similar situation that all the other folks happening to us.","Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns","Okay, thanks for that. A question for Jamie, just so I understand so this hell in the hand basket increase, is the incremental 30 that you took in the Q4 of '13, is that the hell in the basket scenario or candidly does the 30 not relate to that worst-case target and things could get worst is my parting event?","Michael S. McGavick","Obviously after last quarter, I'm never going to give absolute. I would say that there's a fair amount of complexity to the claim. If there was to be further development I think it would be around the interest component of the claim. Basically the interest rate charge is 4% from the date of judgment, allotment of funds into the development project until they made a claim with the insurer. If the settlement is within two years of that claim, interest is 6% in that interim period. If the settlement goes beyond two years, the interest goes all the way up to 26%. We've taken very conservative assumptions around the rapidity of the settlements from our clients but frankly as a reinsurer we have less control over that than our clients and we've obviously as always done a prudent job of making the judgment and putting the reserves up.","Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns","Sure. Two related follow-ups. What years do these relate to as far as I guess reinsurance treaty years? And then can you in any way extrapolate to what this new sort of industry's loss from this problem then? Thanks.","Michael S. McGavick","I think it was from the early 2003, 2004, 2005. There aren't a large number of ceding companies involved in this and I've heard numbers of $1 billion.","Ronald Bobman - Capital Returns","Okay. Thanks. Good quarter and best of luck.","Michael S. McGavick","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ryan Byrnes with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask you question.","Ryan Byrnes - Janney Montgomery Scott","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one question. As we try to calculate the Life's drag on the ROE, how should we try to allocate the affiliated returns and also alternative returns?","Peter R. Porrino","This is Pete. None of them would go towards that Life business. They're all on the P&C side.","Ryan Byrnes - Janney Montgomery Scott","Great. That's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford & Bernstein. You may ask you question.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Hi guys. Thanks for fitting me in and you guys get a gold star for sticking through all the questions. So two quick questions really, big picture. I think maybe they're either for Mike or Jamie. There's a lot going on in reinsurance today. You made some comments about rate still being adequate in property CAT. You guys obviously have visibility to practically every market in the reinsurance business. You've got your New Ocean Re in the third party side and you're doing long tail, short tail property CAT, and you're buying reinsurance. So thinking about all the things that go into the mix, I'm wondering I guess, first, if you have a sense of how long pricing pressure could continue before rates are no longer adequate for traditional reinsurers, and if you could go past that point, given that some of the new entrants have lower cost of capital? Second, I'll give you my other question just so we can in the essence of time \u2013 your point on the casualty reinsurance deal you guys did sounds like, Mike, that could have been a great move. But at the same time, it sort of sounds like it's a sign of a competitive market if you're getting unsolicited bids for quota shares for your professional book. The question would be, are we seeing the pricing pressure that began in property CAT, are we seeing that gravitate to other longer tail lines, either because incumbent reinsurers are feeling pressure to drive the top line or whether actually you're seeing the new entrants, the new capital sources decide to want to play in longer tail lines where they can get some stability, don't have to take the risk in property CAT. Thanks so much.","Jamie H. Veghte","On the long tail question, I think Greg's purchase of this business although it is with very strong reinsurer and so forth kind of validates what I've been saying for quite a long time and that is I believe the reinsurance market on long tail lines has been weaker than the insurance market for several years. And I think that continues. As far as the CAT market goes, we look at it the same way we have for a long, long time. We use rate agency capital to denominator in the calculation. We believe we're still at a fairly attractive rate adequacy levels on the U.S. portfolio. I do not expect the midyear renewals to endure the same sort of cuts that we had at 1\/1. My guess is if we see another round like that either it's June and July or 1\/1 next year, we will take appropriate actions because the hurdle rates will be less than ideal for us. You'll recall we talked about reaction to the Japanese market over the years prior to the 2011 quake, we've reduced our aggregates by 65% over the course of the prior 10 years. So we're not afraid to reduce the book. And my guess is if we have another 20% down in the U.S., you'll see not only us but a lot of the major leads start to cut their books back as it will kind of walk over the edge I think.","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike. I would point to a couple of other thoughts as well. The more I learned this last renewal season, it actually made me a little more comfortable not a little more frightened and here's why? While there was a great deal in our frenzy of activity going on, generally speaking it wasn't so much what the alternative capital guys were pricing at, it was the frenzy among the existing players not to lose share in reaction to the projection of what those guys were going to do and they were a bit more disciplined than I think some are thinking. Some are thinking that the alternative guys just came in and whacked the market. No, what happened was the traditional players were so focused on keeping those shares that they got engaged in their own little frenzy. So I don't feel the alternative guys and I certainly know \u2013 I don't expect our alternative guys are going to be somehow irrational. I think they have a different set of costs, I understand. They have two different appetites and they'll play that card. But based on what I saw, I'm a little more sequined than I think I've heard some of our competitors' comments and I particularly like the way that Jamie's team dealt with this. They were very firm on the condition side, they really focused their capital on reasonable treaties. They said no when things got irrational. And we've been cutting back on the long tail quite for a long time because of what Jamie has described in concentrating our capital where believe there's not only the return is the best but the relationships are the most longstanding and the most likely to endure. So I understand why everybody 's hairs on fire given all the press reports but based on what I saw in terms of the performance of our own book and I like the way our guys are able to handle it and I think that's because we been effective and trust in partners for a very long time .","Peter R. Porrino","That's really helpful, Mike, Jamie. Thank you guys. Good luck.","Michael S. McGavick","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ian Gutterman with BAM. You may ask your question.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Hi. Thanks for keeping the line open. On the North America property, can we get a little more color on the size of that book as a percent of your total insurance property book, just to help understand what 80 million means and to put that into some context?","Michael S. McGavick","Ian, I'm going to ask Greg to do that. But before we get to that I should point out one thing that hasn't been mentioned in the flurry of words on this. Interestingly while the losses originate are assigned to our North American books, many of the losses internationally make sure they were in international locations but rolled up to programs that were written in North America which is kind of interesting because the international book generally or the international portfolio of property risk is where we've seen weaker performance over the couple of quarters. So, it may have showed up in North America but where it originated isn't unfamiliar to us.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure. On a net earned premium basis, the global property book is about 12.5%, the North American book is about 7%.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Got it. And can you give us any sense of what 80 million is versus budget or \u2013 last year it was low, but maybe a five-year average large loss number? Is there anything we can do relative?","Michael S. McGavick","No, this is not something we have practiced disclosure. I did hear a request for more views over time and as we work through how to do that, we'll see if we can find a way to give some color to that. But I don't want to get too close because it could get into information that could help those we compete with. So we'll try and think of a way to give you a little more color around that.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Understood. I understand the challenge.","Michael S. McGavick","We're getting near the end (indiscernible)\u2026","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Can I squeeze one last, on professional lines, the quota shares? I just want to understand better, Pete, the economics and how we'll see it play through. And I know this has been asked, but if I can push a little more. So obviously, you're going to have less dollars or premium. That means you're giving away profitable loss dollars, so that hurts income. As you said, it hurts the G&A ratio, so that hurts income. You get help from income from the ceding commission. Net-net, how do we see the benefits to you play out in this? Is this neutral, positive or negative to dollars of income? And if it's negative, is it made up for in less capital? How are we going to actually see the benefit? Because my concern is, if you just do it simplistically, is this actually, if you don't think it through all the way, it seems like it actually hurts earnings, not helps. And intuitively, it seems like it must help, if it's a good deal.","Peter R. Porrino","Right, so Ian this is Peter. I'll start and then Greg can add more color. So the easiest one is the capital release, right. I mean this is very clear a de-risking action. As far as the underwriting results go, that depends on what loss ratio you're going to pick and we're not going to get into specifics as to the size of the override, but it was significant and it was significant enough that I'll be honest, when we measured the trade economically, it did not take us a really long time to evaluate that.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Understood. When I try to model based on what I had heard, I got it being \u2013 maybe it's not that great per dollars of income in the numerator. So it would seem the impact comes more from increased share repurchase. Is that a reasonable way to think about it?","Peter R. Porrino","Well, I hadn't talked about share repurchases, so this is a one-year transition that we have. So depending on how the economics play out we may or may not renew it. I don't think that that would probably be the type of transaction that you would then do a share repurchase on the back of.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Got it. I'll follow up later. Thank you.","Peter R. Porrino","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.","Michael S. McGavick","Listen, we're going to jump through a bit here and we're always happy to stay and answer the questions. This is important to us. We know that through these calls, we're communicating to many audience not just those who analyze us but also terribly important to our shareholders and of course our colleagues who are often on the line. And paying attention to those colleagues, I want to say this is a good way to end the year. We're making good progress, keep it up. We're going to make good rational decisions and we're not going to overreact. We think this is an improving book of business. We've communicated effectively why it is that we have that confidence.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David Radulski","Thank you, Shirley. Welcome to our conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlcatlin.com and www.xlgroup.com. We have posted to our website several documents including our press release and quarterly financial supplement.","On our call today Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks, Pete Porinno, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team, and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we will open it up for questions.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain of the matters we will discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations all of which involve risk and uncertainty and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements speak only as the date of which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement also new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I will turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Mike McGavick","Good evening. Thank you for joining our call. We have been eager to have this discussion regarding our Q3 results as this is the quarter where the underlying fundamentals of our newly combined business continues to prove themselves, but obviously the miss to estimates could create a different impression. In some ways that there is difficulty in modeling our progress is understandable.","We know that everyone is trying to get a handle on the future earnings potential of XL Catlin and there was so much going that it is tough to do. You can see evidence of this in the very wide spread of analyst expectation. In my now 30 XL earnings calls, this is the fifth widest spread of estimates and before that we are larger surrounded major external events like Hurricane Sandy, so our view of tonight's job is simple, be as clear as we can about how the business is performing and where there are opportunities to clarify items that we think are prone to miss estimation, we will try and help.","Let me start with that overall idea. The business itself is performing as expected or better and we are incredibly excited by the additional opportunities we are seeing and the fundamental strength of this new company.","Let us look at some fundamentals. In the third quarter XL Catlin produced a P&C combined ratio of 95.3% and our accident year combined ratio was 96.3%. This was a relatively light CAT quarter, and offsetting that, we did experience the Tianjin explosion. With respect to Tianjin, it is noticeable that our level of losses relative to our market share came in as we expected.","Both companies came into this transaction with admired underwriting cultures. Tianjin was another proof point that the discipline remains once the companies are combined.","With regard to the top-line, we produced $2.6 billion in gross written premium versus $2.8 billion in the same quarter a year ago, when compared on historical basis and adjusted for FX, so let's consider the top-line a bit further.","First, many had modeled some drop in business due to overlap and alike. We certainly did in modeling the transaction pre acquisition, but in fact that is less than 1% of the business that has been lost is due to merger impacts. We are delighted with this result.","Second, market conditions remained difficult. Despite these conditions, we are seeing more opportunities to write business than ever before. This is because our brokers and our clients have seen the benefits of our new position in the marketplace and our working eagerly to find more to do it together.","Our meetings at the Reinsurance, Rendez-Vous, CIAB, FERMA, Baden-Baden and now at PCI, all affirmed again very high broker and clients report for this transaction. I know that many of the analysts and investors on this call have their own market contacts to that which they can collaborate what we are saying.","As we complete the upcoming 1:1 renewal cycle, we have been through the entire renewal book with the merger either in mind or in place. In fact, you could argue with the pre-Christmas week of the proposal deal last year, some 1:1 renewals are already market tested as well and the retention levels are staying at historical norms. This too is incredibly gratifying.","Third, we are doing a good job of walking away from business where appropriate. There has been much talk of pricing pressures for example in the specialty insurance and the overall reinsurance marketplace. While Paul Brand and Greg Hendrick will give more detail in a moment, let me offer two proof points of our continuing discipline.","Our overall top-line and insurance adjusted for FX is slightly up, but that masks our adjustment to our mix of business according to profitable opportunity. For example, it is well known that in the energy sector where we are leading writer is going through a rough patch, rates are off around 10%.","Because we are even more cautious, our writings are down 26% in the energy segment in this quarter. On the other hand, we like our opportunities in political risk and crisis management, taking together premiums there are up 23% year-over- year. In other words, we are continuing to remix the books according to profitable opportunity.","Turning to Reinsurance, while the business there is a lumpier quarter to quarter, as you will hear more from Greg in a moment, consider that on a year-to-date basis, adjusted for FX, Reinsurance is down about 5% overall, given the rate environment that makes sense. We also know that in North America casualty, where we are especially concerned, we have reduced our writings by 11% year-to-date.","We are bottom-line underwriters. In this regard, there is no change. Even with Tianjin, in the quarter we produced a P&C underwriting profit of $114 million and both segments were profitable.","Of course, it is foremost the capabilities of our people that make all of this possible. Here too are few important thoughts. Over the next several weeks, we will finish our second and last round of employee consultations in London. It is now true that the vast majority of our colleagues who have been or will be affected by this transaction already know their personal outcome, but they are leaving the firm now or in the future.","The speed with which we have acted has been a critical factor and keeping voluntary turnover of key people well below our pre-deal forecast and only modestly above prior-year levels. During this quarter, there were wonderful reminders of our colleagues' ability to stay focused on clients. For example, the recent Gracechurch survey confirmed our leading position across underwriting claims and overall reputation in the London market. A recent U.S. broker survey also showed us our leading our peers in claims service.","In Singapore, we were recently recognized as Aon's Asia innovator of the year. Given all that is going on, this is a remarkable set of external validations of our people and their capabilities and Management is very proud to be their colleagues.","Turning to the last of the transaction related variables and that is expensive savings. We have already raised our estimated savings from $200 million to $300 million on a runway basis to $250 million on a run rate basis. We are ahead of schedule in the synergy savings, with $54 million saved year-to-date. The savings increments needed for 2016 are already built into our budgets and that $250 million will be attained.","Taking together, considering the top-line retained and the fact that we are mostly through a complete renewal cycle, considering the remixing of the book to offset the difficult market conditions, considering the retention levels of our people and their award-winning continuing focus on client, given what that says in total about the reaction of brokers, clients and colleagues, and given that savings continue to meet our commitments, our view is that once the 2016 activities become incorporated into our budget, we will view next year as much more of a business year as usual, just a bit heavy on the continuous improvement activities than in a normal year.","Having said all that, what else is going on in the quarter and where might this misalignment to estimates have most occurred? There are few things to consider here. The first is PYD. If you look at the consensus for what we were estimated to release and what we are in fact announcing is big delta, but as you know we have a long-established with quarters one and three being in A versus E quarter and our deep dives in quarters two and four to really get at our last picks. That is why we mentioned in our last call and maybe we did not say it strongly enough that we would not expect to see any releases from the legacy Catlin book during this third quarter and in fact there were not any.","In the spirit of giving information when this estimation is possible, I would say to be mindful that we are still in the process of harmonizing the two legacy books to common reserving principles. You can see how that process could have some dampening impact on future PYD. We do not know that to be true yet as the work is still being done, but you can see how a process like this might alter what you would naturally estimate simply looking at past experience of the firms respectively.","Second, I mentioned that the vast majority of our colleagues already know or will know shortly any effect on their job due to the transaction. While speed is critical to reducing anxiety and confusion for our colleagues, it also means that we are moving faster through our estimates of integration expenses, so integration related expenses were $55 million in the quarter, higher than the number we had guided you toward on our last call.","We believe that there is real benefit of speeding this process, so we will continue to move as fast as possible and we remain ambitious about growing these synergies over time. That said in the spirit of giving you clarity where we can as it is proven difficult to give you an accurate estimate of these costs, we will post the integration related expense number for the fourth quarter to our website ahead of the fourth quarter call.","Then third, the affiliate income portion of our investment portfolio is near zero, due to the recent financial market volatility. The bulk of the impact coming in the hedge fund managed portion of our investments. Offsetting these was a one-time positive benefit impact. Net of these four items, the estimate variance is more than explained.","In the end, the fundamentals of our business are proving to be strong. Our integration is increasingly shifting to business as usual and we are continuing to see new opportunities which did not come our way before. As we look at the quarter in total, we are excited.","We will continue to believe that we are on track to deliver double-digit expansion in EPS and meaningful lift in ROE.","With that, I will turn it over to Pete.","Pete Porinno","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. We have been a combined company for only five months. As such, this represents our first full quarter of consolidated results.","Operating net income for the third quarter was $71 million or $0.23 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $187 million in 2014 or $0.70 per share.","As we indicated during our previous calls, we have excluded direct transaction cost from operating income, but included integration costs. During the third quarter, we incurred $1 million in Catlin deal-related transaction costs and $55 million in integration costs. As Mike noted, this is higher than we forecast you to on last quarter's call as we have moved faster than expected on all elements of our integration plan.","We expect that by the end of the year, we will have provided the vast majority of our colleges with clarity on their position with the company going forward and we will have identified our major systems and infrastructure design changes. From that point, we are truly in business as usual mode on all fronts.","We continue to expect that the relationship of one-time integration costs, the run rate synergies will remain as we previously estimated at 125%. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $27 million or $0.09 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $72 million or $0.27 per share in 2014.","As we had previously noted, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance transaction. We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. As always, it is no impact on comprehensive income or operating results.","Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 95.3% or 5.2 points higher than the same quarter last year. Our accident year combined ratio for the quarter was 96.4%, 3.9 points higher than the third quarter of 2014.","The chemical warehouse explosion Tianjin has significantly impacted the quarter. Excluding this loss, the accident year combined ratio for the quarter is consistent with third quarter of 2014.","For the quarter, our natural catastrophe losses totaled $31 million or 1.3 loss ratio points. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2014 totaled $30 million or two loss ratio points. Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.","The third quarter prior year reserve development was a net favorable $28 million arising from the legacy XL reserves or 1.1 loss ratio points compared to a net favorable $35 million and 2.4 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects unfavorable development of $7 million in Insurance segment, driven primarily by the impact of an unfavorable judgment on a single claim.","The Reinsurance segment had favorable development of $35 million. As we have discussed in previous calls, during the first and third quarters, our reserving process is based on review of actual versus expected loss activity for the property, international construction and entre energy lines of business insurance and for non-U.S. business in reinsurance.","The remainder of our business, including casualty, professional and specialty insurance lines and all U.S. reinsurance lines of business are reviewed in depth semiannually during the second and fourth quarters. This business tends to be medium to long tail in nature, which generally requires at least two quarters of additional information to credibly imply changes to ultimate loss ratios.","As I noted in our call last quarter and Mike mentioned earlier, we are aligning reserve methodologies and assumptions between the two legacy books. The results of this review will form part of our usual fourth quarter full valuation update.","As we indicated previously, our normal purchase GAAP accounting adjustments will earn its income over the next number of quarters. Overall the impact is relatively small; however, certain line items can be distorted in each quarter. To the extent that these are meaningful, they will be noted by Paul and Greg.","Operating expenses have increased materially in the quarter as a result of the combination. Overall, however, the run rate operating expense level of company continues to move towards the expected level of transaction expense synergies. On an annualized basis, our third quarter expenses excluding integration costs are approximately 5% less than the combined companies' 2014 expenses adjusted to align accounting practices.","If you recall, we indicated that we intend to measure our strategy levels against the run rate cost base of a low single-digit increase on a combined 2014 expense levels from the two companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded tax benefit of $31.6 million resulting in a negative effective tax rate.","The tax benefit in the quarter is driven by our ability to utilize certain of the legacy Catlin entities, U.S. deferred tax assets as we restructure our legal entities in the United States. Our operating tax rate excluding the direct tax benefit from the legal entity restructuring has declined to slightly less than 10% primarily due to the favorable change in the geographic distribution mix of income.","Turning to the investment portfolio, net investment income excluding the life funds withheld assets was $179 million or $9 million above the same quarter last year, primarily due to the addition of the legacy Catlin portfolio or offset by the impact of lower investment yields.","Gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of September remained at 2.4% consistent with the second quarter. During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7% given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we are approximately $4.2 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months.","Net income from investment fund and investment manager affiliates was $2 million for the quarter, down $38 million from a strong prior year quarter, driven primarily by our hedge fund portfolio with a negative market backdrop provided a strong headwind to a number of our event-driven and market-neutral funds.","Net income from other operating activities was $2 million, lower than the same quarter last year attributable to the sale of ARX Holdings on April 1st.","Net realized gains, excluding derivatives were flat for the quarter, down $10 million in the prior year. Our unrealized gain position declined by $101 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our equity portfolio against the negative market environment, while with fixed income, gains from lower U.S. treasury yields were largely offset by unrealized losses from credit spread widening.","Unrealized net gains were $746 million at the end of the quarter. Altogether, the total return on investments was 0.2% for the quarter excluding FX. The duration of the total portfolio, which includes P&C and the remaining life assets was 3.2 years at the end of the quarter and remained short the duration of all of our liabilities.","We continue to anticipate bouts of volatility in the market reflecting uncertainty around the timing of the U.S. rate hike and the consequent impact on the market and wider economy.","With respect to capital management, during the quarter, the Company paid ordinary dividends of $61 million in preferred share dividends of $57 million, preferred share dividends in the quarter included the semiannual payment of $22 million in the legacy Catlin preferred share dividends for the first time as a combined entity. These dividends are paid semiannually in January and July.","We plan to execute in the fourth quarter a very limited liability management program and will redeem legacy Catlin subordinated debt amounting to approximately $91 million. The proposed action improves operational efficiency and is part of streamlining our capital structure.","We continue to execute share buybacks during the third quarter. Our Board of Directors approved a new share buyback program in our August meeting, authorizing the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our ordinary shares, replacing the remaining amounts under our previous share buyback authorization.","During the third quarter, we purchased 4.8 million shares for $180 million at an average price of $37.85 per share leaving $880 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and the continued purchasing in line with philosophy we discussed in May.","I will now turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results.","Paul Brand","Thanks Pete. Today, I will cover the results for the segment, prove an update on integration and finish with remark from current market conditions. First the result, third quarter marked our 11th consecutive quarter of profitability, with the segment producing calendar quarter combined ratio of 97.2% compared to 94.7% in the same quarter last year and year-to-date combined ratio of 96.4% versus 94.6% in 2014.","PYD strengthening of $7 million compared to release of $20 million in Q3 2014 accounts to 2.4-point to-2.5 point deterioration. The remaining variance is a result of our acquisition expenses offset by an improvement in our operating expense ratio, lower CAT activity and lower accident year ex-CAT loss ratio.","On an accident quarter, ex-CAT basis, the combined ratio was 96.3% compared to 94.8 in quarter three 2014. While this is higher than we would expect, it should be noted that the insurance portion of Tianjin loss equals to 1.5% difference in the segment combined ratio. If we look at the first three quarters, the reported accident year ex-CAT combined ratio of 95.3% similar to the 95.1% we reported in 2014, demonstrating that we could absorb the Tianjin loss without jeopardizing profitability.","For Q3, we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.2%, which was 3.8 percentage points higher than Q3 2014. This is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business, largely from the Lloyd's platform, where the acquisition costs are higher than the legacy XL business.","This is offset by a lower loss ratio as reflected in our Q3 net accident year ex-CAT loss ratio of 62.7%, which was 1.3 percentage points lower than Q3 2014, just under three points lower when adjusted for the Tianjin loss.","Insurance gross premiums written in Q3 increased by 66% or $876 million year-over-year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition, this growth occurred in all four of our underwriting divisions, with the biggest growth continuing in our energy, property and construction and specialty divisions.","When me look at the full course of the both legacy organizations and normalize the foreign-exchange, our actually year-over-year growth is roughly 1% in Q3 and 3% year-to-date. While this growth is not as robust as recent quarters, it does reflect our success in maintaining the two legacy portfolios while at the same time writing new business that is on par with 2014. Given current market conditions, this growth is something we continue to be extremely proud of.","Shifting to progress and integration let me share a few highlights from Insurance segment perspective. Firstly, the market response to the deal continues to be very favorable. Having just returned from CIAB, I can tell you first time that there was an increased enthusiasm within the broker community to work more closely with us given all greater market prominence.","Kelly experienced much of the same sentiment from both, brokers and clients; on last month's FERMA conference and it is not just talk. Our retentions continue to track well with historical trends and our new business opportunities continue to be strong despite market conditions.","Second, whilst our leadership teams were announced last quarter, we have now finalized our entire underwriting organization from top to bottom retaining key talent and with minimal disruptions.","Third, we have made further advancements in centralizing our outwards reinsurance purchasing. We combined several programs and we are on track to deliver $50 million in savings in 2016. With regard to our longer term and state plans, we have made significant strides with regards to our pricing methodologies, our operating model and our legal entity structures, while at the same time focusing on our synergy opportunities. We will continue to share our progress in future quarters.","Turning to market conditions, the headwind we expected in Q2 have continued, pricing was negative across most lines of business as the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter and year-to-date. However, this was a result of general decreases in rate being offset by broadly flat rate in some lines. For example, Casualty North America, as well as some increases, most notably Cyber and Environmental North America.","Overall, our Casualty and Professional businesses were down just 1%. Our Specialty business was down 2%, largely reflecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines and our energy, property and construction businesses were once again we severely impacted, with pricing down in the mid-single digit led by reductions of the energy book as well as our international North American property books.","Despite these market headwinds, we continue to focus on margin expansion by improving our mix of business, leveraging analytics into underwriting actions, increase our reinsurance efficiency and creating operating leverage through increased productivity and rigorous expense management.","In addition, we continue to make strategic investments in our claims capabilities that should also deliver meaningful improvement to our bottom-line. In summary, we delivered another solid quarter of underwriting profitability, continue to grow the book and made significant progress on our integration. As we finalize our plans and prepare for 2016, we firmly believe we are positioned to continue our trajectory of underwriting improvements towards top quintile performance.","Now, to Greg to discuss Reinsurance results.","Greg Hendrick","Thanks Paul. Today, I will discuss the results for the quarter, provide some thoughts on Tianjin loss and close with the current market condition.","Beginning with the results, the Reinsurance segment produced a solid result despite an active loss quarter with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 91.2% and resulting underwriting profit of $68 million. This compares with the combined ratio 79.2% and an underwriting profit of $90 million for the third quarter of 2014, with the benefit of a relatively quiet quarter of catastrophe losses and continued favorable reserve run-off.","The decrease in underwriting profit is mainly attributable to losses from the explosion in Tianjin, China. Considering this loss and a competitive landscape, we are pleased with the results for this quarter.","Excluding prior development, the portfolio generated an accident quarter combined ratio of 95.8%, which compares to the 82.7% produced by XL in the third quarter of 2014. The accident quarter loss ratio increased eight points to 59.8% for the quarter. The primary driver of the loss ratio increase is related to Tianjin.","Further, the expense ratio of 36% was up 4.9 points from the third quarter of last year. This increase is a result of purchase accounting adjustments Pete noted earlier, which contributed 2.2 points with remaining increase due to a change in business mix as a result of the Catlin acquisition and higher ceding commissions as a result of the competitive marketplace.","Our reserved leases in the quarter were $35 million compared with $15 million a year ago, which benefitted the combined ratio by 4.6 and 3.5 points, respectively.","The current quarter release was driven primarily by favorable runoff in our European casualty, property treaty and marine lines of business.","Turning to the top-line, grocery written premium for the quarter was $459 million, up from $276 million in the third quarter of 2014, driven by the Catlin acquisition. With the third quarter being a relatively lower top-line quarter, the year-to-date volume is more reflective of our portfolio premium.","On a year-to-date basis for the combined XL Catlin, gross written premium fell 6% relative to the same nine-month as last year. This reduction was driven by the timing of certain treaties, lower multi-year premium and foreign-exchange.","Consistent with last quarter, less than a 0.5% or $8 million, part of the 6% drop resulted from client concerns about the XL-Catlin combination. This drop is more than offset by $70 million of new business written in the third quarter alone.","Shifting to the tragic explosion in Tianjin, the segment recorded $70 million of net losses. Our estimates based on extensive client by client review of our portfolio, our prudent reserve for losses that are not allocated to client and local dollars to our Shanghai and Beijing offices.","Our detailed lost estimate corresponds to nearly $3 billion loss estimate for our client, which translates the high-end of the current market loss estimates. It is important to note this is a very complex man-made loss that will short-tail in nature may have long tail characteristics as it is adjusted.","Turning to the market conditions, we continue to experience deteriorating rates across most lines and regions during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, global property catastrophe rates fell roughly 7.5%, other excessive loss covers fell 5% and ceding commissions on pro rata premium grew by 1 point to 1.5 points.","Through our early renewal meetings, we are seeing increased demand from some clients as well as the general acknowledgment that rate decreases are slowing across the reinsurance marketplace.","In summary, while our profitably in the quarter decreased due to Tianjin, our market momentum continues to be very positive. Our recent meetings in Monte Carlo, CIAB and Baden-Baden, all reinforced our leadership position in the market. We continue to get very strong support from our clients and brokers and we are well-positioned as we are headed in the January 1 renewals.","I will now turn it back to David.","David Radulski","Shirley, can you open the lines for questions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thanks. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead with your question.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much for the detailed description of the discrepancies on the PBD [ph] and other items for the quarter, just want to follow-up on the large losses Tianjin, is there any sort of like losses related to the Volkswagen investigation?","Overall, if you look at your CAT losses as well as large losses, how do you feel about the combined organization compare with that you had XL legacy business and do you feel that we will see more volatility in terms of your earnings in the past.","Mike McGavick","This is Mike. Hi. Thanks for the comment. On the question first of all with respect to Tianjin, we were very pleased with our results. It was very much in line with what we would have expected given our presence in Asia and given our relative position in both insurance and reinsurance that we were gratified by.","With respect to Volkswagen, which I know is very much on peoples' minds, first simply in the nature of these contracts that we do not disclose individual client relationships. In the rare cases, where that does happen, it usually has to do with either other reports in the marketplace or with somehow the level of losses with respect to that particular name exceeding what we would consider kind of the point at we would have to think about materiality and disclosure.","I think you can take some comfort from the fact that we are not commenting specifically on that loss at this time.","Kai Pan","I understood. Then my second question, if you look at your comments about market condition actually getting tougher, you try to maintain the top-line as well as the investing continue under pressure, because low rate environment. In such a condition, how do you see we getting from the current level year-to-date about 7% ROE into a double-digit or what are drivers and what timeframe in your guys' mind that we can get there?","Mike McGavick","First I will get to the ROE expansion in a minute. Finishing the answer to your earlier question, I apologize. In terms of large losses in the quarter, they were largely in line with prior year. Nothing really exceptional to speak of and we do believe that Tianjin in fact makes the point that we can have very large losses in the quarter and still remain profitable some level. I think that is greater absorbency and large loss than we would historically have, so we are actually very pleased with the spread of the book of business in the way that can continue our longstanding effort to try and reduce volatility by having greater diversity in the portfolio.","The second thing with respect to the ROE expansion, clearly we continue to believe that this will meaningfully uplift ROE. We have never given an exact timeframe to a double-digit target, though that certainly is what we expect over time. The main uplifts are coming kind of two parts if you think about it.","One, you see a good story at this stage of our ability to continue to remix our book of business to offset market conditions and I think our overall attritional loss ratios continue to show that strengthened certainly better than you would have expect given pure rate impact, so that is a piece of the story.","Second and critical piece of the story is expenses. At this stage in the cycle, we are all in a very difficult headwinds. You mentioned interest rate environment, that ain't going to change. You heard Pete talk about the downward pressure on the reinvestment rate, but at the same time, we believe one of the most important aspects of this transaction was the way in which the two companies offset each other's weaknesses with regard to expense and we are diligently trying to bring that to truth and that is the way in which we were building out at XL, a global specialty platform, obviously combining with Catlin completes that. We are now truly in a leadership position.","Second, of course, Catlin had been building out a global platform that too was not yet fully scaled and added through the existing XL global platform. We really have that fully global capability at a much more affordable basis, so our view is that by delivering on the synergy is implicit in those two comments on the general synergies available in any combination of two publicly traded companies, we believe that that together with managing against these headwinds and by mixing our book of business, we really believe we can deliver what we have said that is meaningful ROE expansion and obviously at this point we have the benefit of having early views of 2016 plans that we are certainly seeing the progress we expected.","Kai Pan","That is great. Just lastly, you outlined back in May about the major bucket of cost saving 215, G&A, about 30 from investment, 50 from claims and 50 from reinsurance. It looks like we are going to realize potentially the 50 in reinsurance. How about the other buckets? You have any updates in terms of magnitude as well as timing of those? Thanks.","Mike McGavick","We are on track for those. Of course the 50 for the reinsurance was the estimate for next year. The others are estimates over time, not in the same timeframe, and we do all of those estimates through '17, which is when we expect all of things to be fully actualize on those - so we would not describe those to be fully actualized next year. The reinsurance piece, which we think is a portion of what we can ultimately do the $50 million is for next year.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much for the answers.","Mike McGavick","Pete, you have something to?","Pete Porinno","Kai Pan, it is Pete. Just to add one thing to what Mike said or two things on the on the investment bucket, I would say part of that was around expense saves and part of that was around extending duration from the legacy Catlin portfolio. The expense saves, the actions of been taken those - the expenses saves will come in next year. The extended duration as you could tell from my comments, we still have not fully extended to what the liability duration would be, so that is still lagging behind. On the claims, as Mike said - as I said on the on the call post the transaction that those would come in as claim start coming in, we harmonize the processes, so those will take some time to come in.","Kai Pan","Thank you, Pete.","Operator","Thank you. The question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. With regard to the expense savings since there is increased confidence, I believe a quarter ago, I am thinking what else could happen that could give you potential upside to expense savings.","Mike McGavick","This is Mike, Jay. As we continue to work through these processes, it's interesting that you discover two things. One, sometimes you discover additional opportunities for savings as you actually bought the things together and you realize that you have got some more things that you do not need.","On the other hand, as you are going through them, sometimes when you do something you were planning on, you realize an unintended consequence that might require some offset or increase in expenses elsewhere, so the numbers does move around a bit and we have been unwilling to put forward any higher number until we are absolutely certain that it will be achieved, so at this point we are still sticking with the 250, because that is the number we believe will absolutely be achieved, but we continue to believe we can do better than that and when and if that number moves meaningfully higher, we will certainly share that with you, but it continues to move. As you do things, you realize either unintended benefits or unintended consequences to your actions and we would want to alert you to new number until we are certain on them.","Jay Gelb","I understand. The next issue I guess more for Pete is on the fund affiliates. I guess, it shouldn't be too surprising to anyone that it was a pretty challenged quarter given what happened in the markets in August. However, given the sharp rebound in equities, especially through September and October, I am wondering if we might see a benefit there in 4Q.","Pete Porinno","Hey, Jay. It is Pete. Thanks a question. Let me back up for a second. Let's talk about what drives - I think the question really is around the affiliate income and the drivers there, so let me spend a minute if I could and then try and help you on a go-forward basis.","As Mike said, one of the things we are trying to do which provides some clarity here, so I will do what I can to achieve that.","First on the hedge funds, on the alternative investments, there is about $1 billion of that in the affiliates. There is about another $700 million of that not in affiliates.","For the third quarter, we had for the affiliates a loss of about 1.1%. When you include all hedge funds that was about 0.7%, the benchmark on those was negative 1.8, right, so we are pretty comfortably ahead of the benchmark, but still a loss for the quarter. It is a business that we are really comfortable with. We obviously have been it for a long time.","As I said think about that business, that is the one that has a one month delay as you correctly pointed out, so September was as bad as August. October, the equity markets are looking better than the hedge fund market so far, so we think that is still going to be under some pressure for the fourth quarter when we report that out.","The other bucket that I would draw your attention to that it was implied in your question is the investment management affiliates and this is the one where there has not been much on the balance sheet. There is only about $100 million, but there is a fair amount of earnings power and that is really lumpy as you well know because the incentive fees that are built into that number.","That one has a one quarter delay, right, as opposed to the one-month delay of the hedge funds, so that one as you think about Q4, you really have to think about the fund performance in Q3, right? We know what the fund performance was in Q3. It was not good, right, and so that is one where you could see a return of incentive fees in the fourth quarter, which could actually push that into negative territory for the quarter.","I hope that helped a little bit. Jay, any follow-up on that?","Jay Gelb","No. That was very clear. Thank you. The final one I had was on the patient share buybacks, so I think initially we are looking at $50 million a month. That might have been the commentary from last quarter. I cannot quite recall, but with $180 million this quarter, it seem that XL was taking advantage of some pull back in the stock price and just trying to get your perspective on the return of capital story.","Pete Porinno","Jay, it is Pete again. I would say, when we spoke about this last time, I think what we said was there will be somewhat marginally above the 50. We do like the timing right now. We are buying back stock, so we are doing. It was $60 million a month for this quarter and based on what we have seen so far, we have no plans of changing that for the next quarter either.","Jay Gelb","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Josh Stirling","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, maybe others want to jump. Two, I will let you decide. I wanted to talk big picture about the operational challenges. The challenge is operational changes that you guys are working through. Obviously, merger is a big deal. I would love to go behind the numbers.","Better understand what is going on operationally and culturally, for your internal folks I was kind of thinking like what are the most important priorities that people who actually to firm and really focusing on now and how should we think about some of the more operational staff of things that might be happening in the back office, consolidating systems as well as more sort of top-down things like how are you changing goals and measurement and sort of cultural management of underwriters and claims people, because can we get various press reports from the trades and I would really get to a sense of what is really going on with the new XL Catlin.","Mike McGavick","Sure Josh. I appreciate the question, and I particularly appreciate that you brought up culture, because I think that is a consistently underestimated impact on how great businesses are formed and functioned, so it's nice to hear that in the question on this call. I am going to walk through three different things.","First of all, remember Stephen Catlin and I had a long run up to doing this. We spent something like 18 months just the first year just the two of us talking and then adding slowly a few more people to the mix. All that conversation was around culture. We were both, deeply aware that we had successful franchises, had no need to do anything, we felt that the indicators leading to consolidation in a sector very present, so we expected there to be consolidation and we thought that if that was true, we should pick your partner as Stephen has so well put it.","The greatest concern we had was where these cultures is really compatible. I think in the end, we are discovering the answer to that is very much. Yes, and it is yes for a couple of logical reasons. Number one, we were both definitely underwriting cultures and the disciplines that come with being great underwriters they are healthy to our skepticism a real regard for numbers and analytics. Those kinds of things, we are clearly culturally present across both places.","Second, we were both, relatively small groups of colleagues spread over the world. As a result, the premium on collegiality, mutual respect, on using tools to defeat time and distance were both deeply embedded in each culture and there was a real culture of globalism. These are companies that are truly about the world and not just about any one geography. Those two things gave us great hope and have proven to be true and I think it is logical given that we were both trying to solve similar problems that they were true.","I will tell you in a Townhall I held in London recently though, I did acknowledge something that is different and that people have to work their way through and that is I really do believe that Catlin was able to create an unusual level of family feel within the business, really extraordinary for a firm of their size and complexity.","When you get to the affirm of the now size and complexity of this firm, it is even more of a challenge to have that kind of family feel, so I advised our Catlin colleagues that I would not, if I were them, believe it will be the same.","Stephen is a unique leader and each of us is different and the size and complexity now is a bit greater and it is more difficult to retain that exact feeling. However, each firm went into the transaction with extraordinary employee engagement scores, far beyond the financial services or insurance sector generally. Meaning, each place was a place that colleagues enjoyed working.","What we said to our colleagues, you are still going to like it. It just won't be exactly the same and each person will have to choose for themselves how they feel about that. I noted in my comments earlier that voluntary departures are still only modestly above what they have historically been, which I think tells you that people are taking their time, going to make their own decisions, but generally are moving along with us and this transaction, so that is the first piece and that is because I think generally speaking the cultural traits fit together was one of the first things we addressed as a firm.","Second thing, the hardest part will always be in the back office functions. Underwriting, we were all over, acted on very, very quickly as you would expect, because you had to get the underwriting colleges working together in teams that we did literally overnight.","However, when it comes the backroom, it is hard to sort out and that is where more overlap is, so I would have to say that if you are in one of our back office functions, you would feel that the progress seen elsewhere in the firm is coming slower and that of course creates frustration, because if you are in a part where it is going fast and great and you are sitting next to somebody for whom it does not feel as good, we all are affected by how our colleagues feel, so that is why I emphasized in my remarks that the speed up of integration costs was tied to good things, the speed with which we are getting clarity to our colleagues.","With this, as I said, this business process in London around consultation, when you have redundancies as we finished this second wave, which is the last one we expect in London, you really see the functions brought up to pace with the underwriting side and that is going to go miles towards getting everybody excited about the future.","Then the third thing is the system stuff, kind of naturally fit together. It was odd where there was currently a deep investment in claims forecast for talent. We had already made those investments, where there was a need for a new strengthened underlying financial system, we had just almost finished our own investment in that and are now just going to have to add on the Catlin financial reporting systems. This not only will improve our financial reporting capabilities, but more importantly it will start to feed into analytics once completed by mid-year and therefore feed into what we think is a better ability to forecast losses and alike.","There, we were really neatly offset. The one place where there is a lot of work going on is in underwriting systems. There we were both making investments. It is not exactly clear how to resolve those investments and the best answer that will take a couple of years to get done, but I think if I take across those three, culture, as expected we are feeling very comfortable, but it does not mean it will be identical and we are being candid with our colleagues about that.","Second, with respect to our functional areas, a bit behind the speed and success we have had on the underwriting side, but coming into line now and hope that will become just a better and better experience and third with systems we had nice offsets and only one really remaining puzzle that we will sort over the next couple years. I hope that takes you a little bit behind the curtains, but the amount of detail that goes behind what I just expressed is books and books of stuff that we review every week in our integration steering committee meeting and have detailed reports of course for our Board, and everybody else, but we are most the way through all that work and now it is just about starting to grind back in the diary business in the difficulty of competition.","Josh Stirling","Thanks, Mike. I appreciate you filtering that for us. Just a brief sort of question for you as an underwriter, you and the team is underwriting portfolio manager, one of things people have framed recently, so idea there is a spectrum pricing stability in cyclical impact from same more syndicated insurance businesses on one hand and until like little less cyclical stuff like small accounts on the other.","Specialty lines kind of fit somewhere in the middle, I guess. I was curious you guys have a whole bunch of different businesses here that we sort of loop or link together. I am wondering if that framework makes sense for you and if you do sort of where you throw your various businesses on the spectrum and how we should think about this whole idea of cycle sensitivity and sort of where you fit. How is that informing your strategy as we start to feel the softening market?","Mike McGavick","Well, I will start with a couple of thoughts. I mean, ask Paul and Greg if they would like to add more clarification, but our reserve first of all unless you are in a really hard or really soft period, generally speaking it is not one cycle. It is a whole bunch of little cycles. In fact I touched on that when I talked about what is going on in energy and what is going on in political risk and crisis management and how differently we are approaching them, because they are just in such very different phases of their own profitability cycle.","I think for our business, so we generally seek to play in the morbid spoke and the more complex risks generally speaking. We like the transaction in part because it really doubled down on specialty and reinsurance underwriting, not exclusively do a lot of other things great, but they really doubled down our loss and those we think are the lines of business which are the most innovative in the sector. Over time as greater and greater opportunity comes, we believe that that critical mass of creative insurance underwriting specialties, by that I do not mean specialty lines. I mean, specialism will really be the differentiator for XL. We can handle the rate of change going on in the world, we think, better than anybody over time and that is the biggest field for us.","That distinguishes from what I would call the commoditized underwriting lines, where fundamentally the modeling has gotten so cycle so different in the way they vary, not absent but very much tighter volatility as it were and where marketing costs and the other things become the greater driver of success. We are still in more of the underwriting end of things, weather individual risk or syndicated.","Generally remember that where we generally play is as a lead not just the follow-on, so we would view that underwriting expertise as still critical even though we are heavy players in the syndicated lines, but we are more - should not work individual underwriting, does not matters, we are more interested in where there is complexity to risk and we would say therefore we have lots of little cycles going on all the time and we are trying to sort through that to create the best possible portfolio.","Paul Brand","Just, I would in some ways reiterate what Mike just said. I mean, I think the importance of leaving business at the moment. I mean, cannot be overstated. It's absolutely not a good market to be a - need to order following line. I mean, we get better insights, we better get better client relationships.","You heard Mike talking about the Gracechurch surveys on both, underwriting and claims and the survey in the U.S. and Aon's recent calling us for best renovation in Asia. Unless you are really at the top table in the lines of business, you are - executed is very difficult to sustain that type of buying from clients, brokers and everything else and does help us convert that into the margin and differentiated margin over time.","Pete Porinno","For us in reinsurance, I think that top table that Paul referred to is having a broad set of product, geography and the combination of XL-Catlin has really given us on a P&C reinsurance basis a truly top-10 position. We can service any clients' needs across a broad set of products and we can take care of their business just about anywhere in the world, so that ability puts us in the conversation with top-tier reinsurers.","Josh Stirling","Thanks guys for being so comprehensive. Good luck.","Pete Porinno","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Jay Cohen","Yes. Just a couple of follow-up questions, Pete, the integration expenses you had given us some indication for the third quarter. Frankly, you weren't too far off of what you said. I know you wanted to put some stuff out before you announced earnings next time. At this point, any indication for the fourth quarter what those expenses might look like?","Pete Porinno","I have not done a very good job, because I think what I told you, you would have come to 42 and we came to 55, so I thank you for being nice, but I am not sure I was accurate.","Jay Cohen","I may\u2026","Pete Porinno","As we look to fourth quarter, it is really hard to say. I would say, we are probably looking - that the third quarter was more the acceleration more than anything else. I think fourth quarter will be higher than third quarter, but nowhere near the same magnitude.","Jay Cohen","That is helpful. Then the other one, the $50 million in savings associated with outward reinsurance. Where would that show up in the P&L?","Mike McGavick","This is why we have been careful to separate those three buckets of costs that are synergies claims around investments and around reinsurance, because unlike OpEx which is the $250 million, that we forecast these are actually very hard to point to explicitly. You are going to see them in expense ratios, you are going to see them in acquisition costs and you will see them hopefully in loss ratios, but of course then you have to have known what we thought was going to be the case, what does turn out to be the case, so they are very hard to get your head on. Some are absolute costs, because the absolute level of reinsurance purchasing is likely to shift as we consolidate programs and therefore can negotiate fewer contacts and fewer fees and hopefully with greater impact, but those are the simple costs. It is the matter that we are really driving toward.","Jay Cohen","That shows a bit different part to the model at this point.","Mike McGavick","It will. Yes.","Jay Cohen","That is okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cliff Gallant with Nomura. You may ask your question.","Cliff Gallant","Good afternoon. I had a question. You mentioned Cyber insurance a couple of times in your remarks, about that being a growth area and I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what type of risks are actually being assumed here? Is this just for data breaches and how big is the book, how many customers do you have? I mean, anything that you can give us some color perhaps on how much risk is being taken as you go into cyber?","Paul Brand","The bulk of the - which is principally based on data breach as a team, we had in place for four years. Just coming up, it is obviously growing quite rapidly. As we have seen breaches in last quarter changed by the appetite and also in pricing and conditions. We are obviously very careful in terms of policy construction most of the business would be retro date inception for example. We would see single LIBOR [ph] growth across portfolio, so it is one of the areas that we are a sort of extremely pleased with how the pricing dynamic is improving at the moment.","Cliff Gallant","Is there like a type of client that XL specializes in when you think about the profile of who you are underwriting?","Mike McGavick","The critical objective of that team is to write broadly diversified portfolio, so you would not see a particular class. We would mainly be dealing with a smaller clients, we tend to stay away from kind of the big obvious retail financial and intend to just focus on mainly smaller clients with smaller limits.","Even if we did write in some larger programs, we would write very small limits because we want a very broadly diversified book of small limit business.","Cliff Gallant","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Thank you for taking my question past 6 o'clock, I have a question similar to Cliff's. I want to know more about the Chinese market and the syndication of losses for events like Tianjin. Can you tell us the extent to which the industry is well penetrated in that market? Are you surprised so much showed up in the reinsurance verse insurance? Maybe you can just help us understand the shape of that market a little bit?","Mike McGavick","Yes. This is Mike. I can give you some perspective and I will ask Greg to add in. The first thing to think about is that in terms of the primary insurance marketplace is overwhelmingly written by the domestic carriers, so that is why, of course you would see it largely as a reinsurance impact for most say industrial carriers like ourselves. While we did have some a percentage of the loss that came from a primary marketplace, because we do, by the way those would also mainly be syndicated losses on larger accounts to which we had a slice of in the Tianjin explosion vicinity, but you would expect more to come in reinsurance.","We would tell you that China, - first of all you can take out kind of personal lines and all the commodity businesses those that are being overwhelmingly grown by the domestic players. We have had had meetings in China with folks that we do some business with there and it is simply remarkable. The rates of growth, the rights of sales and the way that they are building out those markets, there are some non-Chinese success stories, but when you study them they have been in the market for a long time and still have tiny market shares, so that is not something we are involved with except for as a reinsurer.","When you get to the industrial and specialty spaces, you do see some activity from outside of China insurers, but it tends to be the case that that is on syndications for clients that have activities in China, but do not originate in China.","For example, we might follow a client to their plant in China with a portion of a treaty or something, but we would not have written the Chinese competitors out of China. That tends to be written by the domestics as well.","As we see the market, it is mainly an opportunity for specialty expertise to be applied. There we are seeing some success, we see it principally through our own activities, we see it also through the inherited of Lloyds Catlin operation in China.","Finally, we see our market for those risks written out of Singapore that has become something of a territorial hub, but the bigger opportunity and the more likely active area is going to be reinsurance, we think, for the foreseeable future.","Greg Hendrick","Sure. Just to put some numbers behind what Mike was saying, from the 2014 year the international carriers in China represented 1.5% market share on the P&C side and that is after some of them being added for 30 or 40 years, so it is a very, very small market between internationally and locally in China.","If I look at our loss, I think it is fairly representative of any broad-based global reinsure like ourselves about 60% to 70%, our loss is going to come from the domestic insurance marketplace, which is going to be a range from personalized, the small commercial to industrial properties, so I do not have nor we would we have, because most of our carriers write across that spectrum, so I do not have a breakdown for you within those buckets what it looks like.","Another 20% of the loss is going to be from Cargo, Marine-type losses from international players depending upon how the loss exactly was pushed out which is to yet be determined between what's Cargo and what's property. Then there is kind of two smaller buckets for us, 10% of it about being what is referred to sometimes as soft retro non-peak retro from either within China or neighboring countries. Then the last 10% of was just large risks, reassuring folks that look not dissimilar from XL Catlin insurance and might have an odd risk here and there, so that is about to breakdown of the loss as we see it.","Josh Shanker","One question, which might sound a little na\u00efve, you learn something after every big loss. After this loss, do you come to the opinion that the business you are writing in that market it is fairly priced, so that business could use more rates?","Greg Hendrick","After the event, a couple things I would say, we learned, one, I am quite pleased that we are less pro rata inclined as a carrier than the marketplace would be, so we have less of the stake on those pro rata treaties relative to our market share and certainly that conversation needs to be had around the level of risk that is inherent within China marketplace relative to what we are getting and we would submit at this point, we would need a little more rate to help compensate for that risk being taken on.","Josh Shanker","Thank you for the answers, very educational.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thanks. Two questions here. First one, just for Greg, just curious, Greg, could you tell us what the impact you think that the changes in BCAR may have on renewals?","Greg Hendrick","I am not a BCAR expert, but it has been as you can probably guess a topic of conversation over last couple of months. Based on the last set of information, I read from A. M. Best themselves, one, it is going to be a staggered implementations, it is not going to be a hard jump at January 1, but through the course of '16 and then it will be a subjective one as they are with everything they do.","We do see it and we have had conversations already around by clients percentage buying more limit on the CAT side, particularly ahead of that change, orders of magnitude of kind of 10% to 20% more limited than they had brought before, but it is still an evolving topic, Brian.","Brian Meredith","Great. Then second question for Mike, you said at the beginning of the call that you are going through your budget for next year and you are pretty happy with the way they are coming out. I am just curious, if you take a look at the budgets today versus what you would expected back when you start the transaction, how much of an impact increasingly competitive pricing environment can had on your kind of view of the potential profitability and then if that price competition eating into maybe the cost savings that you would have expected here going forward?","Mike McGavick","First of all, Brian, that last bit is a really important element to think about. It won't change how much we save. It could change how much we earned.","Brian Meredith","Right.","Mike McGavick","Their earnings will be constant. We will deliver the numbers that we have promised to deliver in streams lined operations and should our top-line be constrained by virtue of the marketplace. Our goal would be to make sure our expenses savings reflect that in addition, to what we are saving due simply to the possibilities of transaction, so that is how we are thinking about that problem. Which means that, when you take those two statements together, that means that we should be able to stay on schedule to both, expand in double-digit our EPS and meaningfully uplift ROE, so we do not see their market conditions as necessarily constraining our progress. What we would say though is that it will require us to be even more firm on how we manage our expenses.","Now there are some level of market craziness that you cannot outrun. We understand that, but so far I think we are doing a hack of a good job at remixing our book to try and offset those pressures. We will keep trying to do and if we think that market conditions have gotten so difficult that we have a difference to that, we will talk about it.","At this point, when I look at the budget for next year, by the way I am always cautious. I do not think that the word pleased actually crossed my lips. We are still mid-way through the budgeting process and I am looking at all of my colleagues. I do not think what they are taking from my face right now is pleasure, but it is directionally in line with what we expect and it is within shouting distance of what ultimately I think we will need to be.","Brian Meredith","Perfect. Thanks for the answer.","Mike McGavick","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMC. You may ask your question.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi. Good evening. I was wondering if you could help us understand what normalized EPS was in the quarter.","Pete Porinno","Yes. Sure. This is Pete. I apologize. I am not sure how to answer that.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. The reason I am getting around $0.50 if I take out Tianjin and normalize for the investment affiliates and take out the tax benefit?","Pete Porinno","Okay. Now I understand. Thank you. Thank you for that clarification. We have not done that. That would be pretty much I think backward normalized earnings guidance, which we have not done that. I think you have identified some of the things that you would look at.","Certainly, Tianjin, I mean again, you can assume it is not going to happen. There are expected losses is that portfolio. The affiliates would be one. Mike talked a little bit about the PYD, so I think you would factor those in, but we have not come up with what we thought the quarter would have been, if not for a few of those.","Mike, I do not know if you want to give any more color on the PYD.","Mike McGavick","Again, I am glad Pete answered the way that he did, because we can certainly through the four buckets that I described, account for the difference between estimates and what we have produced. Importantly, none of those had to do with the core earnings of business. It had to do with other items and this estimation is that given the cloud of the transaction, I think are understandable, but if you step back from it, probably the one that has the most impact on go-forward I guess is how you think about PYD, so maybe I could clarify that just a little bit more.","First of all, remember we regret not having done it more forcefully, but we did say that we did not think that there would be any release from Catlin in the third quarter, because again that is an A versus E quarter. We knew we had work to do to harmonize the two approaches for reserving, so that will be done in the fourth quarter. As I said in my comment, you would intuitively expect that process would probably dampen any likelihood of releases in the fourth quarter from that Catlin book.","At the same time, think about it this way. First of all, XL's reserving philosophy remains unchanged and that will be the going forward philosophy, so that is the first thought.","Second though, and by the way, obvious with the disclaimer none of knows. PYD goes where it goes and things certainly can surprise you that world, but just if you would look at it right now the second thing I would say is the XL portion of our reserves continued to performance as expected, so we are very comfortable with the way the prudence there has played out.","Third, we respect to that Catlin portion reserve, let us put it in scale the ratio of XL to Catlin reserves is 3:1 and they are performing as we expected them to according to our due diligence. That is another important point to make. We think the Catlin reserving approach made sense. We have not seen any surprises, but here is something important to understand. We are in the process of harmonizing the approaches.","As the larger casualty rider XL has historically been a bit more conservative in the speed with which we were recognized development in the portfolio. As we get to a consistent methodology, this would likely you have to expect dampen the releases from the Catlin portion of the book at least if you were to look at just looking at the pattern of historical releases, because we are going to that XL approach, so I just think that that is an important thing to keep in mind when you are looking at potential favorable development. We have just started recognize it and that is the philosophy that will now be applied across the piece.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. Thanks. You think for the fourth quarter, we should models mostly modest reserve releases?","Mike McGavick","Again I cannot give you a direct guidance on that, because we are still doing our work. In the end, we have the obligations to produce our best estimate and we will, but I just would know what I have said. It is likely that our approach, which because of our long history in writing casualty, there we have learned that you cannot ever wear rose-colored glasses the effective that is we have tend to be slower to react to positive news. If that were true historically, I think you would have had a different historical pattern from Catlin. For XL there should not be any difference to what we normally do and there has been some happy consistency there. Look, I just remind you in the end that PYD is not plan on. It is something that is studied in results, whatever it is.","Sarah DeWitt","Thank you. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie. You may ask your question.","Amit Kumar","Thanks for putting me in. Maybe just one question, maybe a follow-up to Kai and Brian's question regarding the go-forward sort ROE thought process, if I look at the level of recessions, can you sort of update where XL stands on maybe pursuing a hedge fund re-type of strategy going forward? Thanks.","Mike McGavick","Yes. Look, we have said in the past that we will be constantly looking for ways to apply our expertise and to partner with those who wish to participate in that marketplace, but at this point I just have nothing to report. We continue to work at identifying the best way forward.","Amit Kumar","Okay, because there was some press speculation regarding something in the pipeline and it sounded it was fairly eminent?","Mike McGavick","I am fairly surely you would not want me to comment on\u2026","Amit Kumar","Fair enough. Then maybe I will just switch very quickly. In the opening remarks, and I guess Jay was asking this question regarding the affiliate income, have you ever previously disclose what percent of that $1 billion is event-driven, maybe the different sort of buckets et cetera, so that maybe we can have better insight as to how we sort of benchmark those different buckets or has that not been disclosed?","Pete Porinno","Well, if you go back to our 10-K, I mean you will get a broad overview, but not overly detail, but I do think that if you would go look at it at a standard index like it is a HFRI or something like, it at least get you in the ballpark.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That is what I had. Okay. That is all the questions I have. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask your question.","Paul Newsome","I just got a couple of a modeling questions and thanks for that. One, just the tax, could you just give a little bit more detail as to what - benefit actually happened and is it fair to say that 10% normalizes is the right general number for us to think of prospectively?","Pete Porinno","Sure. Just real quick on the benefits, so they were operating losses in the United States in the legacy Catlin book of business which they could not recognize. They had to defer tax allowance on that. When we conducted the transaction, we put the legal entities together. We made sure that the Catlin legal entities will underneath the XL legal entities and therefore you follow consolidated return to get the benefit be able to use that.","To the extent that there were losses from prior years, they would have come all in the third quarter when we affected the reorganization to the extent that the losses would be coming into all of '15 that would be taken in three quarters in the third quarter in the last and the fourth quarter.","As far as your question about the 10%, we really try not to give the exact numbers. We have in the past at legacy XL, we had that number slightly above 12. I think with the lower tax positions that legacy Catlin had that number had come down. I think I had talked about that and sort of in the 10 to 12 range, so 10 I would say would be sort of at the low-end of that range, but certainly in the range.","Paul Newsome","Okay. That gets me where I need to go. Then I was wondering if you have some guidance for us on how to think about your FX exposure of the combined company from a bottom-line perspective?","Greg Hendrick","You talking income statement or balance sheet?","Paul Newsome","Income statement.","Pete Porinno","All right, so in the income statement it really depends if this a mismatch in pretty much the legal entities between the non-monetary assets and liabilities. For example, this quarter you saw that I think we had about $12 million loss in income statement, so that would be something like where we had all three assets in a non-monetary assets sitting in a U.S. dollar denominated unit, so there is no easy way that you could sort of say ballpark it should be something like this. You have to go legal entity by legal entity and determine what the functional currency is in that legal entity and then compare what currencies the non-monetary assets and liabilities are, so it is a fair question Paul, but it is not one that I think I can give you a rule of thumb that it should be something like this. We do manage the FX exposure, but we do that really more on a balance sheet basis than on an income statement basis.","Paul Newsome","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. I will try to be quick. I know it is late. When you have accelerated integration expenses, does that mean that there is also acceleration in the recognition? Should that $13 million delta from original guidance mean that we will save $10 million in the fourth-quarter?","Mike McGavick","No. When you think about it, for example as we go through the FX on headcount, because of the accounting rules you can book that expense when you know it by name and so on, but that actual saving maybe later maybe a year or two away because some of the people who know that there won't be a future job might have a couple of years of work that we asked them to do and have lined up for them, so it really depends on the specific category of expense.","Generally, while we are continuing to accelerate the cost, it does mean the less of the cost will be in the period when you have the synergy masking it, but it does not mean necessarily that the synergy is brought forward. They could be anytime during the three years.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That is helps. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your may ask your question.","Ian Gutterman","Hi. Thanks. Mike, why do not I just ask a big picture one? We have dealt with a lot of different items that are maybe one-offs, maybe not, if I just asked you looking at your internal numbers for '16 and for '17 now versus the quarter ago, are they really changed? I mean, maybe a little bit on the margin prices as little bit different, but has there anything materially changed?","Mike McGavick","No.","Meyer Shields","Okay. I think that is the main thing we are all after. Then just one detailed question was probably one that I could come up, so the Catlin reserves, you talked about the casualty part, but I guess they were surmise given their a mixed of business a lot of their releases would tend to be more property and event-driven, so that if they had attritional IVR for energy and marine and things like that and there has been a losses this year, why would not we expect in Q4 or at least Q1 of next year that has to be released?","Mike McGavick","Again, it depends on the mixed performance of those shorter tail and those medium and longer tail, so it is really about how they all work together not just the one.","Meyer Shields","Okay. I guess. Isn't they are mixed more geared towards shorter tail lines. I guess I would have thought historically that they would have well more than half of their releases be short tail than long tail. I do not know that for fact, but I would have guessed?","Mike McGavick","In more recent years, there has been pretty substantial growth in the casualty portion of the book, so that pattern that you would have historically seen, I would not expect to emerge in the way you described and that is why I made the comment that I did.","Meyer Shields","Perfect. Thank you. I will save the rest offline. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Farrell Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Dan Farrell","Thank you and good evening. Just a question with regards core combined ratio mostly insurance business, but you have obviously showed some nice improvement in the core loss ratio from mix changes, but you had a lot of offset from the acquisition ratio too and I am wondering if the increase in acquisition ratio all from mix or is there some tighten competition marketplace that is also driving those costs up.","Then secondly, how do you feel about your level of core loss ratio right now if you exclude Tianjin. It looks like a pretty sold a level right now. Do you need that to get lower to sort of hitting your goals or are there other levers and is there stuff in your control that you can continue to drive improvement in that core loss ratio? Thank you.","Mike McGavick","Yes. I will start. The biggest things that we can control well is a couple of things, number one, expenses, expenses, expenses. I think that is in this part of the cycle the thing you can control most certainly yourself and that is why I make the comment that I did that why you cannot outrun everything going since we get a portion of it back and that is our job.","When you talk about the loss ratio, you can continue to work on mixing your book of business appropriately. The world is not one theme, either by geography or by product line. You can continue to refine your mix of business in order to get up that, to try and offset the impact of deteriorating conditions in any one given segment and that is why we like having the broader breadth of product both, in insurance and reinsurance and the broader breadth of debt in geography. That this give us more choices around how to manage that.","Then of course if you become smarter in your reinsurance or retrocessional purchasing you also can gain a benefit over time, but those are three levers that you have to hand and all of which we will be pulling on. We are certainly very pleased with the overall attritional loss ratio as the two companies combined create.","While that creates some pressure on acquisition that is mainly due to mix with the much every year portion of cover holder writing that those going on and will be continuing to go on in the legacy Catlin or portion of the book. We like having both of those expertises, by the way because it gives us more ways to get to clients, but those are the general commentary I would make and look at Paul and Greg and see if they have anything they want to add.","Greg Hendrick","Yes. I think other needle, which you did not mention was we are obviously working to build up analytical insights to try and make [indiscernible] is more resilient in and of themselves. I think as you look at the larger book of business, you have great opportunities with the data site, so there is definitely market headwinds, but it is about converting all the tailwinds that we have got all those leaders and to more than offsetting and hopefully that will lead to a better outcome as we look ahead.","Paul Brand","Yes. I would say reinsurance, that I think the only place you would see the slight increase in acquisition, with ceding commissions gone up, although I will say through July 1, we start to see a ceiling being set, particularly on the long tail casual line - so that is the only part I think when you mixed it all together there is relatively small part of the overall equation, but that is the driver of reinsurance.","Dan Farrell","Thank you very much. I just have a really quick question, Tianjin. I am you curious, do you have any reinsurance or retro protection that had kick in or will start to kick in at certain point. I am just wondering if we had overall industry creep in the industry number, if there is any projections that might start to offset that from your perspective.","Greg Hendrick","This is Greg. There are reinsurance protections that are from both, legacy firms that they have come into play but there is a - I do not what Paul here for a second. There is a risk?","Paul Brand","Clash.","Greg Hendrick","\u2026clash between insurance, marine reinsurance segment as well as, but has not come into play yet, but what if there is for the development.","Pete Porinno","Yes. This is Pete. The only thing I would add is that the number that we disclosed that net number, our gross number was not materially higher that. It was a little bit higher that, but not of a huge magnitude.","Dan Farrell","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. On the reserve integration, I guess my question is could the impact of that have an impact on the accident year loss ratio on a go-forward basis like for instance if you conclude that Catlin hadn't been reserving as conservatively as XL?","Mike McGavick","I do not think there is going to be anything material. Certainly not that we have seen. In a pricing environment like this, you are always going to get some pressure on attritional loss fix. If you remix your book, you can dampen the impact of that, but we would expect over time within our multiple years of softening pricing that there will be pressure over time on those picks, and we are awfully happy to enter the period of time with such a breadth of product region to work among as we remix and also to have what we think is an unusual opportunity because of the bringing together the two firms and the expense side to hopefully even more than offset that.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. Then one quick follow-up for Pete, I think. Last quarter, I think there was some fair value adjustments to lower the loss ratio on insurance. Then something I think in the reinsurance side that raised the acquisition cost ratio. Could you quantify what those were this quarter and is the forward look still the same as what you gave previously?","Pete Porinno","Sure. They were pretty close quarter to quarter, so in total the acquisition cost, the amortization was about $12 million and the reserve was $15 million. Again, I think I said last time the commission, the result of amortization run off as you as you run off there and - reserve [ph], so by the first quarter of '17 it is pretty much over. The reserve one goes up over the life for the Catlin reserve, so that one does last a little bit longer.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. That is what thought. Thanks so much guys.","Pete Porinno","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee. You may ask your question.","Vinay Misquith","Hi. Thanks. Pete just a follow-up, so the $15 million of the amortization, that is going to last through the end of '16, correct?","Pete Porinno","The $15 million of amortization, so the amortization for going to the end of '16 that was on the acquisition cost, right, so that was $12 million. That goes through the end of '16 and then drops off almost to nothing, the reserves which was the '15, one will go through '16, will continue into '17 and you will see it stop to drop off later in 17.","Vinay Misquith","Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. Big picture for Mike, Mike, just curious as to why you think the profitability has not really changed for the future despite softening? Are you planning to remix the book or is it sort of higher expenses? Thanks.","Mike McGavick","First, we would expect to all the expense lever harder should it be necessary, particularly given where premium might go as we remain disciplined underwriters. As we have said before, it has turned out that the merger has been incredibly well received, so we have a lot of new opportunities to look at too.","We get to shift through an awful lot to find things that you like in a market like this, but you can find them out there. A second opportunity for us as we renew business, business that you know and are comfortable with, we may be able given our new presence in the market do even better with those clients and we have certainly seen indications of that as we worked along.","The third thing is the remixing and I have spoken very directly about that with illustrations, but that is a constant. I mean that is not something we would just be doing next year that is something we would do every year to try and get to right place.","As I have indicated, it would not surprise me in the coming years to have some pressure on that attritional loss ratio, because of the amount of the rate that has been coming off on consecutive years now, but I also think that so far our ability to damp that impact as proven, but having this breadth of geography and product mix really does give you an opportunity to offset that meaningfully and that has certainly been the case so far and then I do not see any reason that we won't be able to continue to offset it into the future.","When you do that it makes it a lot easier to get that last bit done with rates. Look, these are difficult market conditions, but we are I would say at this way, we are even more grateful that we Stephen Catlin raised the possibility and that we were able to consummate this transaction, because that get both firms into a position that was much stronger relative to these very different market conditions.","Vinay Misquith","Okay. That is fair. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the call over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Pete Porinno","I am sorry. This is Pete, I just want to go back and clarify Paul, some questions about the alternatives. We hold the K in two difference places in Note 7, we have lay four buckets out for the affiliates and then in Note 8 related same four buckets out for the non-equity accounted affiliates, so that is where you wound, non equity accounted hedge funds that is where you would - if you want more detail, that is where you would go.","A - Mike McGavick","Listen, I know we have gone longer than we usually do, but obviously as we have mentioned before it is a difficult time to get it right. It is a difficult time to estimate what is going on. We want to provide as much clear as we could not answer every question as best we could.","We remain as you can tell a very bullish about what this transaction enables us to do not just now, but into the future. We are excited to be up there working with clients and with their brokers partners and we are incredibly proud of the work that our colleagues have been doing and we are delighted to be able to say to them that we are getting to the backend of the worse of it and onward and upward from here and that has been a long time coming, so it is they were hoping enter this holiday season on something of a high note after all of the hard work for both of these organizations really beginning from the time of the leak last year.","Thank you for your attention, for your very thought questions and we look forward to next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

My name is Shirley and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group Plc Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David Radulski","Thank you, Shirley. Welcome to XL Group's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement.","And first we apologize for the technical glitch that resulted in our release coming out later than usual and we will work to avoid that recurring.","Now on our call tonight, you're going to hear from Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who\u2019ll offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions.","Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only for the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Michael McGavick","Good evening and thank you for joining out call. Tonight, we are pleased to discuss the third quarter in which we produced solid across the board results and continued a strong year for XL.","Total P&C underwriting profit for the quarter was $144 million, $67 million greater than the prior year quarter. This was driven by better year-over-year P&C combined ratio of 90.1% and a loss ratio of 59.1%, which is really six points better than the third quarter of 2013.","From a year-to-date view, the majority of our core metrics including gross written premium, our calendar combined ratio and loss ratio are also all better than the same period a year ago.","While we, like the majority of the industry benefited from a relatively quiet CAT quarter, the primary driver of these results were the continuing improvement of our businesses and the cementing of our re-underwriting and remixing actions.","For example, our Insurance segment produced $54 million in underwriting profit in the quarter and an accident ex-CAT combined ratio of 94.8% which is $42 million and three points better respectively than the prior year quarter.","Greg will get further into the reinsurance results, but as our work continues, I\u2019ll say that we are pleased with the progress across the segment. Our business leaders are taking the necessary action to achieve their targets and to fight in a tough rate environment. Even when that retranslates into maintaining discipline on pricing, they are not chasing the markets down in search of top-line.","Reinsurance contributed another strong quarter with an underwriting profit of $90 million and a combined ratio of 79.2%. These results were $25 million and six points better than the prior year quarter on lower gross written premium which goes to show the quality of our reinsurance book and the talent of our underwriters.","Jamie will have more on this segment and the reinsurance market, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be skewing this under or surprising you when I say that the tough conversations on price terms and conditions in the reinsurance markets continue.","But here too, we like our disciplined approach in when it means opting not to renew a line or being unwilling to follow terms refined unacceptable for the market and for our business.","And while we see the market remaining competitive for the foreseeable future, we are confident in our unique ways to continue our improvement and find our advantage. As we\u2019ve discussed, rate is only one lever we can pull, our underwriting actions are a constant for us and we continue to examine and reexamine our progress even when we like we are seeing there is more we can do same with remixing this too is a work in progress.","And in this next phase of competition, we see expense management and the ability to gain leverage from the prior strategic investments we\u2019ve made as being increasingly important.","Back to reinsurance for just a moment. We made a recent announcement of course that Jamie Veghte will be retiring at the end of this year. This will make this the last earnings call in which he will participate.","Now there has been a lot said about Jamie and the great results that he has produced over time and many of the people on this call have sent their kind regards which all I know are appreciated. But I just want to say the obvious.","There is no one who touch his excel whether a client or colleague, a shareholder or just a friend of the company that doesn\u2019t know how important Jamie has been to all of us and each of us on this call and certainly knew personally are going to deeply miss working with Jamie.","The good news is, we made that announcement in order to make sure that Jamie got a good farewell circuit in this tough renewal season. I think it\u2019s been crucial to our team that we have a nice stable reinsurance renewal season and then Jamie has his plan will leave his direct employment role at the end of the year. But I want to just extend our heartfelt thanks and congratulations to Jamie for the extraordinary run he has with us at XL and all he does as a friend.","With that, Pete?","Peter Porrino","Thanks, Mike and good evening. Operating income for the third quarter was $187 million or $0.70 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $155 million in 2013 or $0.53 per share. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $72 million or $0.27 per share on a fully diluted basis.","Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding the impact of life purchase arrangement was $223 million for the quarter or $0.83 per share on a fully diluted basis.","I am going to come back to a discussion about the life transactions\u2019 impact on net income at the end of my remarks because while we have explained this in theory before, it is now present in the full quarter\u2019s numbers for the first time and I want to make sure that everything is clear. But first, to our financial results.","Our P&C combined ratio of 90.1% for the quarter was an improvement of 4.9 points versus the same quarter last year, while our accident year combined ratio was 92.5% better by 7.6 points. This improvement in our accident year combined ratio was driven by improvements in both our catastrophe loss experience and our underlying ex-catastrophe experience in both insurance and reinsurance including a reinstatement adjustment in reinsurance.","This adjustment relates to reinstatement premiums associated with prior year non-catastrophe case reserves and our international reinsurance business that have not yet been recorded. The net of tax impact of the adjustment was approximately $20 million, the majority of which relates to cash reserves from previous years. This represents approximately three points of the reinsurance loss ratio and one point for our overall loss ratio.","As we\u2019ve outlined on previous calls, the third quarter is what we refer to as an actual versus expected quarter for our entire insurance segment in our US reinsurance business. Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $35 million or 2.4 loss ratio points compared to $79 million or 5.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2013.","This reflects favorable development of $20 million and $15 million in the insurance and reinsurance segments. Jamie will discuss prior year development for reinsurance in a few minutes. As we\u2019ve indicated in the past, we continue to expect that overall operating expense levels unadjusted for foreign exchange and performance-based compensation for 2014 will be modestly higher than 2013 at mid single-digit growth levels.","Excluding the negative impact of these two items on the quarter, our operating expenses grew by approximately 4% in the quarter compared to last year. We continue to be highly focused on balancing cost efficiency with continued investments in both infrastructure and insurance underwriting teams.","Our increased use of reinsurance cede will continue to impact the reported operating expense ratio as ceding commissions which cover all expenses are reported on the acquisition expense line.","Turning to the XL investment portfolio and similar to our second quarter focusing only on the assets which XL does retain the economics, the investment portfolio returned 0.5% for the quarter and 4.3% year-to-date.","Unrealized net gains in the retained portfolio were $1.03 billion at the end of the third quarter. The duration of our fixed income portfolio increased by 0.2 years to 3.8 years which still remains short duration relative to our benchmark. At $170 million net investment income on the portfolio excluding the life funds withheld assets was $68 million below the same quarter last year primarily due to the life transaction which contributed $56 million of this reduction.","The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of September was 2.7%. We still have a gap between the yields on maturing assets and where we are reinvesting which will keep downward pressure on net investment income. We estimate that approximately $3 billion of assets with an average gross book yield of 2.9% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months compared to the average new money rate in Q3 on the portfolio of 1.9%.","Our investment and operating affiliates continue to produce strong results for the XL portfolio.","Net income from investment affiliates in was $25 million, up $20 million from the prior year quarter with solid performance across the majority of our strategies particularly private investments. We also had good earnings from our investment manager affiliates of $16 million.","Net realized gains were $10 million in the quarter driven primarily by sales of equities. This compares to net realized losses of $2 million in third quarter of 2013. When combined with the negative movement in unrealized gains and losses of $119 million and \u2013 gains of $5 million, we ended the quarter with a negative mark-to-market of $104 million on our portfolio excluding the life funds withheld assets.","On a tax related note, you may have heard that the Irish government announced to intend to abolish the so-called double Irish tax strategy by treating companies incorporated in Ireland as tax resident of Ireland.","This change, if it goes through will have no impact on XL because all of our companies incorporate in Ireland are already Irish tax residents. And a positive side-effect of this review is that the Irish government also announced it is fully committed to its current 12.5% corporate tax rate.","With respect to capital management, during the quarter, we repaid at maturity, our $600 million 5.25% senior notes, which you will recall, we have pre-funded with five year and third year debt issued in November of 2013.","We continue to execute on our share buyback program at the higher level noted during our core following the life transaction. During the third quarter, we purchased 8.2 million shares for $275 million at an average price of $33.35 per share for a total $625 million year-to-date.","That leaves $443 million available for purchase under our previously announced share buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management too.","Now back to the life purchase session discussion. As we discussed in our April and July calls, regarding the life reinsurance transaction we completed in May, our net income numbers will be impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfers the economics of the assets backing that transaction.","This quarter is a good illustration of how we previously indicated accounting implications would occur, so let me walk you through what is happening. First, please remember that the vast majority of our life funds withheld assets are invested in European assets and while our US interest rates generally increase during the third quarter, European interest rates generally declined resulting an unrealized gains arising on that portion of the portfolio.","The increase in unrealized gains resulted in a derivative loss that lowered our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders, but that derivative movement is offset by investment income, realized gains and losses and the change in the unrealized position of our portfolio and does impact our net book value operating income or comprehensive income. We show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release.","And I\u2019ll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our insurance segment results.","Gregory Hendrick","Thanks, Pete and good evening. Today, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide insight on our continued progress and finish with the remarks on current market conditions.","Starting with the results, the third quarter marked our seventh consecutive quarter of profitability with the segment producing a calendar year combined ratio of 94.7% compared to 98.8% in the same quarter last year. This year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by the accident quarter ex CAT loss ratio of 64%, which was four points better than prior year.","And the same loss ratio improved by 1.5 points on a year-to-date basis. We believe our continued improvement in performance is evident the fact that we have once again been able to absorb medium and large loss activity in the quarter with a lower impact in our results relative to prior year.","Remainder of the calendar year improvement results from a 1.7 point increase in favorable prior year development driven by releases in short-term lines and was partially offset by CAT losses that were 0.4 worse than the prior year quarter. The underwriting expense ratio is 30.9% in the third quarter, reflecting a deterioration of 1.1 points from the third quarter last year mainly due to continued investment in certain businesses.","As mentioned previously, the actions we have taken to shift towards quota share in a number of our businesses has restored the comparison of our acquisition and expense ratio to prior year. These quota shares have increased in commission income improving our acquisition ratio by three points would have lowered net earned premiums partly contributing to a 4.1 point higher operating expense ratio.","It is worth noting that for the three main businesses where we increased our quota share usage, we have seen an improvement of over 4% in our underwriting expense ratio. Overall, we continue to focus on improving operating leverage and actions are underway to ensure the total underwriting expense ratio reflects this ongoing improvement.","Insurance gross premiums written grew by $57 million or 4.5% in the quarter when adjusted for foreign exchange movement. North America property and casualty premiums grew by 13% with construction and excess casualty contributing the largest growth.","Our specialty group was up over 11% reflecting strong growth from new teams in both our marine and crisis management businesses. Professional lines were flat for the quarter with growth in our cyber and design books offset by the timing of a large renewal in our international financial lines book.","And our international P&C business was down almost 9% resulting from underwriting changes due to underperformance in our energy and Lloyd's middle market books. While markets are increasingly competitive for many of our businesses, we continue to see increased submission for and a higher default ratio as we continue to have positive momentum in the large commercial marketplace.","Shifting to our ongoing progress, using results for the trailing 12 months, we experienced a 1.3 point improvement in our accident year ex CAT loss ratio relative to the prior 12 months period despite experiencing a higher level of large losses in the more recent 12 months.","This improvement is a result of our focus on an improved mix of business and the underwriting actions that we have taken. Our mix of business continues to improve as we shift our portfolio to more profitable lines.","On a year-to-date basis, nearly 60% of our gross premium is better than or within 5% of our target combined ratio. And our underwriting actions continue to contribute as we have delivered roughly two loss ratio points of improvement over the past two years and have identified additional actions for the fourth quarter and into 2015.","And our talent continues to get stronger as well. This quarter, we appointed Dave Schmitz to lead our Global Property Risk Engineering team. We added Michael LaRocca as its Chief Underwriting Officer in its North America Property business and Anthony Vidovich as General Counsel for our Claims operation.","In addition to these new appointments, we also strengthened our crisis management team in Asia, increased our financial lines and surety capabilities in Latin America and expanded our trade receivable insurance team with appointments in London, Baltimore and New York.","For the quarter, we increased our underwriting force by another 17 positions as we continue to invest in our businesses.","Turning to market conditions, we saw a continued slowing in rate across more lines of business as the overall rate increase for the segment was flat in the quarter and positive by 1% on a year-to-date basis.","That said, two-thirds of our businesses are still showing positive rate for the year. In the quarter, our international property and casualty and global professional businesses achieved rate in the 1% range adversely impacted by property and high excess D&O business respectively.","Our North American businesses were flat in the third quarter driven by a 4% reduction in property offset by a 7% increase in our environmental business. And our specialty business continues to be most severely impacted with an overall rate decrease of 2.5 points largely reflecting a competitive aviation marketplace.","As fourth quarter renewals begin, our aviation business is now driving positive rate movement due to recent market loss activity.","Finally, while we once again benefited from a relatively quiet catastrophe quarter, we are pleased with the continued improvements we see in our accident year results excluding CAT. But we are not satisfied. There is still room for further improvement and we remain confident with our ongoing growth in higher margin businesses and our continuous underwriting actions across all businesses will allow us to achieve our profitability targets.","On a personal note, I am honored to turn the call over one last time to my friend and colleague of 25 years. Jamie?","Jamie Veghte","Thanks, Greg and good evening. The reinsurance segment had an excellent quarter of underwriting results with a combined ratio of 79.2% and a resulting underwriting profit of $90 million. This compares to a combined ratio of 85.4% in the third quarter of 2013.","Excluding the impact of prior year releases our combined ratio in the quarter was 82.7%. This result compares favorably with the 102.4% achieved in Q3 of 2013 a quarter that was significantly impacted by catastrophe activity, most notably the German hailstorms that contributed $43 million of third quarter losses last year.","With respect to the reserve releases, you will note the $15 million derived in this quarter was substantially below what we enjoyed in the third quarter of 2013. We had the development of a large marine energy claim YME Energy which contributed $11 million. This compares to a favorable development of $12 million on cost to Concordia reflected in Q3 last year due to the trigger of retrocessional recovery.","In addition, in 2013, we had reserve reductions on prior year CAT losses of $25 million, a full $17 million larger than the release from this source in the third quarter of this year.","Broadly, we remain very comfortable with our reserve position and due to the reduction in our release, that\u2019s principally a series of one-offs.","Turning to top-line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $276 million, a 21% reduction from the $350 million written in the third quarter of 2013. The main drivers of this reduction were from our North American business unit, there we had $44 million of share reductions and cancellations largely in casualty treaty as well as $24 million of timing differences and premium adjustments.","Our international operations included reductions of $25 million primarily from our Latin American operations due to the cancellations and reduced shares. This was largely offset by the impact of premium adjustments including an additional reinstatement premiums from prior year non-catastrophe losses. Our Bermuda business unit was generally in line with last year.","On a year-to-date basis, the segment has generated a combined ratio of 77.1% which compares favorably to the 80.1% achieved in 2013. Excluding the impact of prior year releases, our combined ratio was 84.3% which compares favorably to the 92.9% generated a year ago with the improvement driven by a lower level of catastrophe activity this year.","With respect to top-line, our year-to-date gross written premium is $1.6 billion, 5.9% below 2000 year-to-date. For the full year, our Bermuda operation was up 4% with the major reductions coming from North America and international operations which were driven by competitive market conditions, cancellations, share reductions and client retention.","Things we have discussed regularly over the course of the last few years. Operationally, we have pointed continued progress with Chris McKeown and his team at New Ocean Capital Management. Chris continues to build out his infrastructure with the hiring of a Chief Operating Officer this quarter and he is attracting third-party capital including the signing of a distribution agreement with a global financial institution.","Finally, a brief word on market conditions. Other than the mid-year CAT renewals which were clearly very competitive, the third quarter is fairly quiet from a renewal perspective. I commented at length in our second quarter call on the CAT market, so I\u2019d like to look towards the year end renewals.","As Mike mentioned, I am nearing the end of my term at XL, but look forward to one last renewal season. I\u2019ve always viewed predicting year end trading condition as a bit of a full variant. This is a heavily syndicated market and forecasting its behavior with precision is extremely challenging.","Nevertheless, I look forward to this renewal for two reasons. First, the emphasis of the recent Monte Carlo and Baden Conferences pointed toward a reasonably orderly renewal season would perhaps left pressure on rates than we\u2019ve seen over the recent renewals.","A major theme was the desire of many clients to consolidate their reinsurance pattern over the tighter group of major trading partners. Given our global footprint, multi-line capabilities and long-term relationships, we are ideally situated for such an environment.","In addition, I have supreme confidence in our underwriting team\u2019s ability to navigate its way through the harshest of trading conditions. Their track record over a long period of time is proof of this and I am really looking forward to working closely with them at this yearend. I have no doubt they will perform superbly whatever trading conditions we face.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it to David for Q&A.","David R. Radulski","","Thank you, Jamie and Shirley, can you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kai pan with Morgan Stanley with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you and good evening. First question regarding to the insurance underwriting, the 300 basis point improvements year-over-year and how much of that is sort of contributable to lower level of large non-CAT losses which was present in the prior quarter? And also going forward, if the current pricing environment persists or even getting more competitive, what\u2019s your confidence of \u2013 or to show continued improvements in the insurance segment?","Gregory Hendrick","Sure, thanks Kai. It\u2019s Greg. On the first part and if we look at the short tail non-CAT large losses, they were roughly the same dollar amount, one loss for about just over $20 million in each of the third quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year.","Moreover, we look at losses, we tranche them up in the affidavit levels. So we use our short tail large being $10 million or greater. As I said in my remarks, we had some medium as well where we are little bit heavier this quarter than last quarter, but in the aggregate the non-CAT losses quarter-over-quarter are roughly the same. So the improvement is really coming from the other views of the book and better profitability embedded across the remainder of the portfolio.","In terms of your second question, the current pricing environment, no doubt about it, we\u2019ve talked about long about the four levers we pull on underwriting actions, rate, mix of business, reinsurance efficiency and so, no doubt. The rate is becoming a little more difficult.","It\u2019s not a tailwind or at back as I noted, there is still little bit of positive left in the book but on an aggregate basis, but not much and I just as an aside, observed what I observed in the past which is for short tail lines, we are seeing rates go down a little more, longer tail lines rates are going up slightly.","Whenever you are in excess market, so you have a layered syndication, excess price is going down and primary pricing is going up. So those dynamics remain the same. We still have those levers and we are working them on. I noted that the underwriting actions we have a point each year over the last three years in the hard work of getting better of how we underwrite each of our portfolios.","We are mixing our business better and better each time. We are investing in people to grow those higher margin businesses as fast as we prudently can. So, I am still confident we are on the right path. No doubt about the rate as that the headwind will make the timing of that a little bit longer than we would have hoped originally.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for that. Then the second question on expense ratio, it looks like you keep building the teams here adding some team positions, and at the same time, the market environment is becoming more competitive. I just wonder what the rational in this environment to try to grow your team and what\u2019s the outlook for the expense ratio going forward?","Michael McGavick","Hi, Kai, this is Mike. I\u2019ll start off and Pete and Greg may want to throw in. The bottom-line is there are still places in our product suite where we are very pleased with our profitability and want to take more of it into the book. That\u2019s a key part to the remixing in which we are engaged and that is achieved by adding people and teams across key positions around the world.","Greg mentioned specifically for example, expanding our presence in crisis management in Asia during the course of the quarter or expanding our financial lines and surety operations than Latin America. Those are both very positive businesses for us and any expense we are undertaking there should be repaid very handsomely, very quickly in terms of the improvement in profitability through the remixing of the book.","So I would continue to make those kinds of investments all the time. You heard Pete say in his commentary, that expenses on quarter-over-quarter were up 4%. That\u2019s actually on the lower end of the range we\u2019ve been forecasting for the year and that\u2019s because we\u2019ve already taken note of the fact that things are getting more difficult out there and are already beginning where we are not gaining profitable business as Greg has described to pool in some of our activity.","So we are already at it, we are not saying that\u2019s a coming thing. We are already managing to the more difficult environment or experiencing. And finally, of course, we are coming to budget season right now and I am quite sure it won\u2019t come as a surprise to my colleagues who are listening.","We have sent out a message as people are working through their budgeting pricing that this is the time in the market we are going to be extraordinarily conscious of every penny we spend. And we are going to have to start harvesting some of the investments we have made to deliver a more efficient platform.","Just given where these markets are going that\u2019s what we are going to have to do. I know that\u2019s kind of straight out of the soft cycle playbook, but we don\u2019t quite think of it that way.","This could be forever, we don\u2019t know. We have to be prepared to continue to drive toward the goals we\u2019ve set for ourselves and the expense lever becomes more important and frankly so does remixing as we get into this more difficult pricing environment. So I am very pleased with the approach of the team, the attitude of the team the things we are already starting to do and what I believe we can do into the future.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks so much for all the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Just one question, I guess, Jamie in the reinsurance segment, can you talk a little bit more of the year-over-year on the underlying whatever it\u2019s the severe loss math or something in that region, just trying to figure out if you want to adjust for differences year-over-year or normalize \u2013 what was the margin trend in that book? Thanks.","Jamie Veghte","Well, I am assuming you mean, normalized by excluding prior year releases and CAT losses\u2026","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes, so that was five, yes?","Jamie Veghte","The improvement went from 55.8 to 48.9. The major components of it were the reinstatement premium adjustments that Pete alluded in his opening remarks about three points lower level of non-CAT large losses about 0.5 and then better attrition loss ratio in our property proportional and risk XL book.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, and that makes out the difference. Okay, thank you. And then, would it be possible maybe to talk through, Greg, maybe a little bit more on the impact of the shift towards pro rata on the expense ratio in the insurance segment?","Just trying to make sure, something we got some headcount increases but also this dynamic. Just trying to understand how we should be thinking about that and if the current mix of business is the right baseline to start from? Thanks.","Gregory Hendrick","Sure, the pro rata treaties are predominantly in our professional and casualty protections. We are still seeing some of the change we have made during the course of this year play through. So there could be a little more shift, but the overall session ratio that we\u2019ve been observing should \u2013 you\u2019ve been observing the last couple of quarters should hold steady for the insurance segment.","At the moment, it\u2019s always \u2013 you are always evaluating this and using all the levers you have to pull to see if you can improve your book either on the frontline on the gross basis on whether you can do that on a net basis as well. At the moment, I don\u2019t foresee anything that major shift coming. We\u2019ve been hard at this work to get more efficient on reinsurance over the last 12, 18 months.","So we will see the rest of that play through. That helps a little bit where it is professional and casualty the biggest areas and then we are getting out of rate of session that we should see hold pretty steady.","Mike Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask you question.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good afternoon and Jamie, congratulations on the announcement of your retirement.","Jamie Veghte","","Thank you, Jay.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","The thing I just want to \u2013 not for much longer, can you give us a perspective on whether that year-to-date premium volume slight decline is a better indicator what you view as the run rate of growth in the reinsurance business?","Jamie Veghte","Yes, I think so. That\u2019s a very good point. As I\u2019ve said to you all over the years, reinsurance by nature is a lumpy activity and that we are not in a daily trading business. We have three or four very large renewal days each year and so you can show anomalies in quarter-to-quarter increases or drops in your top-line.","So, I think you are absolutely correct to look on an year-to-date basis would suggest \u2013 I think the 5.6% decline year-on-year and I think that\u2019s reflective of both the market conditions that Mike referenced and our underwriting philosophy.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","And then separately for Greg, the underlying insurance segment combined ratio has been oscillating right around that mid 90%, 95% range year-to-date. What\u2019s your level of confidence that that could continue to improve over the next year or so?","Gregory Hendrick","Yes, as I said earlier, Jay, I am confident we can continue to improve that number. We talked earlier about the rate being not to help it had been, being a bit of a neutral. I think I said headwind, it\u2019s actually still slightly positive, but, not keeping up with trend. We still got those other activities that we can pull on.","The underwriting actions, the mix of the portfolio, the analytics of bringing the bear and so we have a lot of other areas to work at. I think if we look at the progression we\u2019ve been on from a 104 in 2011 to 98.5 in 2012. The 96.7 in 2013 and to 94.8 in nine months this year. Now we are on the right path, it\u2019s just going to probably be a little slower as we go here both because of where the market is and it always the last few yards of a hardest ones to dig out, so.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","It\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask you question.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good evening. Thank you, thanks for taking the call. So, Greg, congratulations on a good quarter. Actually something you said in your prepared remarks, I wonder maybe I either missed out or just was a little bit surprised. So maybe, if you could clarify a bit, something you said was something on the lines of \u2013 I think 60% of your premium is better or worse than \u2013 is better I guess than 5% below target or above.","But I think that would imply something like 40% of your businesses is more than 5% worse than its target. And I just thought maybe you could if that is right, sort of walk us through what challenges \u2013 what businesses those are, what challenges those businesses are still facing and what the plans are? Or if I am wrong, maybe you can set me straight, thank you.","Gregory Hendrick","Sure, Josh, no, you heard right, Josh. We have a process as you look from the top down and how much capital you allocate to each business, each one is different target combined ratio and indeed 60% of our book on a premium basis is in that category of either better than what we are targeting as our combine ratio to make our return or within five combined ratio points of that target.","So, either they are close. The remaining 40% I am not going to drill every business. We did that a few years ago. You are always going to have a certain percent of the book in that category. Somewhere in that 10% to 20% range. You are not ever going to go through any period up or down in the cycle to not going to have something struggling.","But we are working through, if I think of one that we talked about during the call, our marine book, we brought in Lea Merrick about 18 months ago and embarked on a strategy to improve the performance of that book from where it\u2019s been. We\u2019ve identified cargo as an area where we struggle being too European-centric, we are pulling back the right things there.","We\u2019ve added new teams hence this ties this investment conversation we\u2019ve been having why we believe to get it more global book and as those teams get up and running and that business comes online we should be in a better performing basis. So, there is not a whole business in any of that 40%. It\u2019s now chunks of certain portfolios that we manage that are in that grouping.","Also the last piece I\u2019d add is, all the business that we are building out, crisis management, political risk, business surety., in marine, all of those are in growth mode and so they are in their first three years, so by definition all four of those are going to be in that bucket of not yet performing on target.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Well, that\u2019s interesting. So that\u2019s not just sort of, I mean, I don\u2019t want to use the word challenge businesses, but I mean, so it\u2019s not just underperforming businesses, some of them are just immature.","Gregory Hendrick","That\u2019s absolutely right.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Is that your conclusion? And so, overall, over the next couple of years, you guys have looked for that number presumably to decline now and that drags most of your improvement?","Gregory Hendrick","Absolutely.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Cool, if I can just think one more and Mike, really big picture. You guys let a news around sort of the alternative capital space here. You mentioned the soft market playbook somebody else talked about New Ocean or Jamie did I think, I apologize.","The question is, when you think about the various approaches to using alternative capital whether it\u2019s figuring out and people to partner with sort of create captive reinsurers and things like that, or just sort of being a more aggressive buyer of reinsurance in the open market, how are you guys thinking about the relative pros and cons and sort of the different approaches that you can see people all across the board is starting to take? Thank you.","Michael McGavick","","Yes, thanks for the question. Couple of things. Number one, I\u2019ve been of the view for sometime and I know there are other sorts, this is, well, uncomfortable, this is positive, in fact very positive.","And in putting in simple, simple term, I always want to be in a space that is more attractive to capital them less and certainly seeing these new forms of capital coming into our sector while have short-term difficulties in the long run this is good news and this provides us more capital to solve more of the world\u2019s problems and that\u2019s our job.","So, I really like it. Exactly how to apply it is the great question it comes in a number of ways, one is you notice, we are ceding more than we were in the past. We are doing it not only because of what\u2019s going on in the reinsurance marketplace and because of what alternative capital is already doing in that marketplace, but also because we have re-thought how to create greater stability in terms of our earnings all the time.","So we have been doing, I think a better job and a more strategic job of buying reinsurance that\u2019s partly influenced by what\u2019s going on in the pricing environment, partly influenced what\u2019s going on in search of capital. So that is one place where we are conscious. The second thing that we consider all the time is whether or not in every case, it has to be XL\u2019s capital that goes to the client\u2019s solution.","We haven\u2019t done anything dramatic in this space, but we spend a lot of time thinking about it because in the end, if our underwriting powers can determine a solution for a client that is made better by using capital other than our own, we should do it. We have to be open to that because ultimately, if you are solving the clients\u2019 problem that\u2019s where we are in business and that\u2019s where we are well paid for our activities. So we are looking at a variety of models for how to achieve that.","One, we\u2019ve already shown the market through New Ocean. But, I can assure you there has been a long range of people coming by with ideas, we have had a few that originated here as well, and as things evolve of course, we will announce them. I do want to note though there has been one change in how that market is behaving that I think is very important.","And I think this speaks to the importance and centrality of underwriting in what will come. When this started out, this was all about those who gather assets and they were calling all the shots. They were designing basically fit for purpose things for themselves and not really for solving clients\u2019 problems so much. My view is different.","As we\u2019ve seen conversations evolve, especially last month, six months or so, the people coming to us are no longer saying, hey we\u2019ve got a big bunch of assets and we are good at this. You just go off and don\u2019t lose too much money on that underwriting stuff and we\u2019ll make a bunch of money which was kind of how the first conversations went.","To where now, we are realizing, we have to be able to gather together pools of risk in an effective way and then match that to a solid asset gathering strategy. That\u2019s a more balanced partnership, a more reasonable and sustainable way to solve clients\u2019 problems and we happen to be pretty good around here at creating profitable portfolios of the kinds of risks with characteristics that match well for the goals and the characteristics of some of these asset managers.","So, I am very optimistic that by being thoughtful about how to go forward and being the kind of underwriter we are, that the world is coming that one that plays right into the hands of a global carrier with a complex risk profile and the selfless attitude about how do cite client problems and not just how to throw their own balance sheet around. So I like the world that\u2019s coming and I think we are poised for.","But that\u2019s kind of how I see that all playing out. It\u2019s going to show up in lots of ways across the entire place and every one of us has to be open to and thoughtful about how we can creative and enable that capital to come in and solve client problems. One last thought, sorry.","And we shouldn\u2019t just focus on the problems we are solving today. Every time there is a difference between economic loss and insured loss, we should track subtract a little b it for retention to make sure the risks are aligned and then we can say the rest of it is a problem insurance could be solving, why aren\u2019t we.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. You may ask you question.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi, good evening. So the improvement in the primary insurance combined ratio, just curious how much more is left in terms of the re-underwriting of the business because you\u2019ve been at it for a while and where would you say you are in the process of remixing the business right now?","Peter Porrino","So, Vinay, on the first part, the underwriting actions is a continuous and never ending process. You are always working through your book to sort through and find how you can improve it and underwrite it better. That\u2019s what I call of additional underwriting site, so you are guiding the book by industry, by geography, whether it\u2019s in the actuarial pricing side or whether it\u2019s in the predictive.","We are bringing all three to bear on that problem to get better and better. We are \u2013 on the second part, where are we in that remixing, we are more \u2013 so we are there more than further close to where we want to be, but the new business that\u2019s coming online still have a long way to come up to get up on plan there. Some of them are already in this \u2013 they are six months, one year, 18 months period.","So, really it takes three years for those books to get up and going and so, I\u2019d say in the activities of the core book were there but in those, particularly those new businesses we believe are really going to have a lot of lift, we\u2019ve got more runway to go.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And on the reinsurance side, I mean, we\u2019ve seen margins there hold up pretty well relative to last year, are we seeing prices sort of coming down. Would remixing of that book, so for example, I think this quarter, some casualty quota share treaties were not renewed. So do you think that the remixing of portfolio will have to maintain margins near term next year?","Peter Porrino","Vinay, we have always been of the view that remixing the portfolio based on market conditions is a core part of our strategy and competency. I would point out that property CAT in 2005 was about 11% of our global portfolio today, it\u2019s about 30%, that\u2019s because, we like the CAT business.","We made a lot of money out of it, but we\u2019ve seen tricking margins in other parts of our portfolio. So, we go forward with the same attitude. We are completely unafraid to shift the mix of business based on the margins out there.","Michael McGavick","Vinay, \u2013 kind of touching into all of this conversation, I think it\u2019s important to remember that, while we have been at it, as we said a while now, all of the books here in \u2013 when we look at insurance we are talking about 22 different specific books and activity with different leaders.","All of them got to their attention whether the underwriting is at a different point in time it didn\u2019t all happen at the same time. For some of them that are on the second route does have improvements. For some of them that are still in the first year of experiencing improvements, my point is that even those initial underwriting reactions, or re-underwriting actions, are not completely exhausted in terms of being run through the book.","At the same time, we are extremely cautious of the pace at which we take credit for them which I assure you is the right way to do it as a prudent reserve but I can also tell you that, our underwriters often throw fits about the gap between their action and its recognition.","So, when you ask have you seen all the benefit from what we\u2019ve been up to, the answer, my book is not even close and remixing is a constant. I think, Jamie said it well and it\u2019s something we are not getting better out in reinsurance not just in insurance \u2013 not just reinsurance which is there has to be a core competency.","We have to be constantly having the capital flow to where the opportunities are and when we can get into the businesses that have more flexible designs of operations so that we don\u2019t have as much fixed cost to drag which is what you are doing when you are growing out specialty lines.","I really think you are seeing some great benefit. I just want to kind of pound on it again, because this has been a theme throughout the line and well, we are great to see the progress but are you going to stall out here? And our answer is, based on everything we are up to and what we are seeing, no.","And I would just \u2013 just like what\u2019s happened this year, two of our three quarters are under 95. I got to go back a long ways and certainly a long ways back before me to get to where those were the kinds of numbers we were regularly delivering and delivering with a fair amount of consistency. So I am really pleased with where we are.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Sure, that\u2019s helpful and so, just to follow-up on that, the expense ratio sort of coming down with the growth in the top-line with one of the levers I thought that was supposed to have the combined ratio. So, with growth slowing down and expenses growing at north of 9%, just wanted to follow\\-up. I mean, I think you said that expenses are going to be more important. How should we look at sort of the disconnect between right now at least the top-line versus the expenses?","Michael McGavick","Well, first-line expenses, remember you got to correct for FX and for the comp volatility which tracks the improvement in results. So, when you normalize for that as I observed earlier as Pete emphasized in his remarks, you are talking about 4% increase quarter-over-quarter.","The second thing I would point out and I think this is crucial expenses are a lever that when you pool them, if you do it right, especially if you have everything investments you made, they fall right to the bottom-line. So the fact that we are starting to adjust already on expenses in light of what we are seeing as they coming slowdown is exactly where we ought to be.","Third, some of what slowing down is some intentional continuation of your first point, the underwriting actions. When you had that slowdown for example, in our \u2013 forgive me, on energy for example, as Greg mentioned in his remarks, we made some very specific re-underwriting and I already booked to take risk at the table to lock away from premiums and we did it very aggressively.","That wasn\u2019t in our original plan as a result, we have to adjust expenses to match to that but that\u2019s still the right action to take even if you sacrificed a bit of top-line because it will pay off in the long run.","So, again, I think we are being in the right kind of steward and we\u2019ll get another chance to talk about expenses when we announce next year\u2019s plan which will be one of the few times where we give something approaching guidance which is right to give some explicit view of expense and we will be able to give you a clear picture of how we\u2019ll play next year given all these conditions at that time.","But given that we went from saying, it can be kind of mid-digit, single-digit this year, ex forgetting FX and forgetting what were the comp that\u2019s volatility that we can forecast, given that we already said, we\u2019d be kind of mid to upper mid single-digits, we kind of said five to six at the beginning of the year, now we\u2019ve pulled it back down to four because of what we are seeing, I think we are handling this about right.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. You may ask you question.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","","Great, thank you very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the top-line being lower in the reinsurance segment, I appreciate the commentary on first it\u2019d be lumpy in the year-to-date result being better.","But I guess, I\u2019d like to ask if anything is changing in those markets in particular, notwithstanding the higher level of comments from Mike and alternative impacts for XL, but is alternative capital coming into that area? That\u2019s the first question. The second is, is there any impact from a slowdown in the macro economy particularly in places like Latin America that might be affecting that line more so now than in the past?","Peter Porrino","Let\u2019s talk about the alternative capital first. The impact to-date has been obviously in the property CAT area.","There has been expanding discussions about other lines of business principally short tail lines of business although I do believe that there is some problem solving going on to address long tail lines as well. So, the direct impact on the marketplace to-date has recently been in property CAT but my expectation over time is that you will see alternative sources of capital taking on risk at other parts of the marketplace. In terms of macroeconomic conditions, flowing things down.","I suppose there is an argument that, that slows down, for example, increased insurance penetration and the development of the middle-class and so forth in emerging markets, I hadn\u2019t really thought about it that closely and linking it to our own top-line. We have just now particularly in Latin America extremely challenging trading conditions for a long, long time and we are just re-underwriting that book of business until we get it right.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay, so those are more concepts anything you felt like you felt in the top-line for reinsurance this particular quarter. Is that a fair takeaway both with alternative and emerging economies?","Peter Porrino","Yes.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay, thank you. And then, another one on the aviation book, you mentioned that you were seeing better rate because of the loss activity. I think it\u2019s the worst year on record for aviation losses. Can you give us a sense of what kind of rate you are getting there and the other clarification or detailed question was, have the losses emerged out in the reported results for the third quarter or is that still being sorted out?","Gregory Hendrick","Randy, it\u2019s Greg, So, on the first part, on the aviation book, a little color. It\u2019s always very difficult for us to get very precise industry numbers on a lot of these specialty lines. But as we look at that aviation market as a whole, we think we are around about 5% market share player by premium. And as best we can tell on the losses we\u2019ve recorded relative to what we think the industry loss is, we are about 1% to 1.5% share of loss. So, we\u2019ve done a very good job of underwriting around those losses this year..","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. You may ask you question.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Hi, thanks, Peter, I just have a few numbers questions, I am just struck on to reconcile the release to the net income as you can everything that up right. I guess, first, on the life business that\u2019s retained, am I getting it right that there is about $6 million of operating income? And if so, is that a reasonable run rate or might that not be a higher or lower going forward?","Peter Porrino","Ian, it\u2019s Pete. $6 million is the number that was recorded in income for the quarter around the retail business. I\u2019d say, within a few million that would be a reasonable number to expect in the future.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Okay, great. On investment income ex \u2013 or ex the fund withheld, there are two different sports that\u2019s in the supplement and there are different numbers on Page 4 it\u2019s a $153 million \u2013 I am sorry, Page 8, it\u2019s a $153 million and Page 4 it\u2019s $170 million, what\u2019s the difference?","Peter Porrino","Let me take a look that, if I\u2019m guessing, it would be on the structured, we had this structured business that we record out separately both the income and expenses. So let me take a look at the pages and confirm that by the time of your last question come in.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Got it. Okay, and the $20 million reinstatement that you talked about, can you explain that again, it went a little too fast for me, is that basically prior period development comes into your earned premium or is it something else?","Peter Porrino","So, anyhow I am happy to \u2013 Jamie and I just are discussing who is going to go and talk about it. So, if you look at \u2013 I apologize \u2013 so if you look at sort of the go back to the reinstatement premiums and we are very familiar with the property CAT business, right, this is not property CAT, much of the adjustment was for all the claims, short tail lines of business.","We haven\u2019t received an indication of closure from these. We hadn\u2019t recorded reinstatement premiums most of them in the property risk area. And with that a detailed analysis of the older claims and we did released the case reserves, but also felt that these older claim reserves were released or paid the related premiums should be accrued.","So that\u2019s what we did. It was about $20 million net. I gave you the materiality to the overall results. We don\u2019t see that as significant either and the trends in the combined ratios are an income.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Okay, just to clarify, I am still little confused. So, it\u2019s basically $20 million to premium and $20 million earnings or is it some offset somewhere?","Peter Porrino","No, there is a little bit of tax offset in there.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Right, okay. And this refers to prior year\u2019s losses then? And you just then take a reinstatement at the time?","Peter Porrino","Yes.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Got it, okay. And then my last one is, do you have, I was able to reconcile everything to net income, but I can\u2019t get the operating income right, I am guessing it\u2019s taxes. Do you have the tax rate or the operating tax rate or the operating tax dollars?","Peter Porrino","Yes, the operating tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management","Okay, then I am going to try it with you later. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome\u2026","Michael McGavick","","Okay, and then Ian, just going back, we\u2019d confirm that it was the structured product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. You may ask your question.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter and obviously, congratulations to Mr. Veghte. I want to ask kind of a big picture question. We \u2013 XL has been, I think much more focused on hiring to expand product lines as opposed to acquiring. We are getting into a softer cycle, I think that tends to change the outlook. I\u2019d like to know a few things that that\u2019s happening. Anyhow XL is currently balancing the hire versus buy trade-offs, just given today\u2019s environment?","Michael McGavick","Paul, it\u2019s Mike. I think that, we\u2019ve obviously established a bias. We\u2019ve been adding teams and individuals to grow our premium for a while and we found it a very successful strategy. We have identified businesses that we think we would be good at that are complementary to our core skills and that would our core strategy of serving as the company the world turns to complex needs. So we still see that strategy is unchanged.","The question really goes to, if acquisition would help in a strategy would you do it? Well, if that would accelerate our strategy, sure. We\u2019ve made only one small acquisitions in my six years here, I think in my time at \u2013 we also made one small acquisition in those five years.","So in a 11.5 years, I think I have done two small things. We look at a lot of things, but generally speaking, when we do get involved we don\u2019t come up to winner, because we do it on an economic basis not just some kind of strategic calculation. And I think in the end, we are so proud of our culture and our approach that we are very cautious about how we would approach those kinds of questions.","So do we look sure, do we think that the market conditions generally point toward greater M&A. hell, I am on the record, on that I\u2019ve been asked that on panels and I\u2019ve been saying for a couple of years I think market conditions increasingly point to M&A as a more likely activity in the next period of time. And I think every day that gets a little more likely. But for us, it\u2019s a matter of strategy, if something accelerated the \u2013 our drive to our goals, we\u2019d be intrigued by it. If it doesn\u2019t serve what we are doing, we are not.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Always appreciate your thoughts. Thank you very much.","Michael McGavick","Thank you.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Yes, thank you very much for taking the question late. Most of my questions have been answered, I just want to refresh something about investment funds and look your outlook. You said in the past that some of your funds get marked on a one month basis, others on a three months basis, is that still correct?","Peter Porrino","Yes, Josh, it\u2019s Pete. That is still correct.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So, thinking about your outlook I\u2019ve seen some of your competitors who are shrinking their equity risk performance, some of them are increasing. Do you have an outlook as a company right now and in terms of \u2013 I was a little surprised that the point it\u2019s a little better this quarter I guess, given what we see in the strong performance from many of your competitors, if you have any thoughts on that?","Peter Porrino","So, as far as the change in strategies, no, we really haven\u2019t changed the strategy and our alternative investment and as far as go forward Sarah, if you want to take that?","Sarah Street","Yes, we have more \u2013 this is Sarah, we have more hedge fund buyers form many of our payers who are more private equity and you have seen some big write-ups in private equity. So that might be the differentiator.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Sarah, I think that answers it perfectly. And so, no change of allocation going forward though?","Peter Porrino","No, no.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Yes, thank you. So just one other question I had. You have obviously changed your retention strategy on your insurance business but it looks like on the reinsurance business, you\u2019ve done very little from a ceded standpoint. I am wondering, given the changes in the market, have you considered opportunities on that side?","Gregory Hendrick","Yes, Jay. And I think I mentioned in the second quarter call, we actually increased our spend on our CAT program. I think we are always looking at opportunities to buy reinsurance, I think actually Greg probably has more opportunity the retrocession market is a narrower trading market, but, yes, the answer is, we are constantly looking at opportunities.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, I forgot about that 2Q. That\u2019s right thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And our final question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Okay, great. Thanks for fitting the end. Mike, sort of big picture question. Has the timeline that you imagine or that you expect let\u2019s say, for achieving 10% ROE been impacted at all by interest rate declines year-to-date?","Michael McGavick","Well, I mean, there is no question that the entire sector and the entire insurance business model is been impacted by these interest rates and it\u2019s challenged everyone. How the year will finish out, it\u2019s hard to tell, it just depends on part on \u2013 there is just a lot of variables that we just don\u2019t know.","So, we\u2019ve been kind of hovering around that 10% ROE line. Made it last year whether we do or not this year, it\u2019s little hard for me to forecast and I wouldn\u2019t do such even if I could. But, there is no question that the interest rates make it more difficult.","When our reinvestment rate is something like 1.9%, this is a very tough environment and it just makes it obvious why it is so important for us to keep driving the levers. I thought this is a very good call. I just want to comment the questions because we are talking about the right thing.","The core to the story at XL for the last period of time and then rate of improvement and likelihood of continuation improvement and getting out insurance combined in line and where does the reinsurance go getting the strategic pressures. It\u2019s been holding up nicely on the strategic pressures on the reinsurance, it\u2019s difficult but it\u2019s fine. On insurance, we are seeking continued expansion in margins.","There may be some slowdown because of the headwinds and pricing, but that\u2019s already been matched to the idea that interest rates aren\u2019t going to suddenly become our friend. So, well it\u2019s made more difficult. It is how we have designed the plan and it\u2019s certainly going to be on our minds next year as well given all that we are seeing in terms of the interest rates that we are taking for next year in our budgets.","So, I am optimistic only because we are on the right thing, and we are accepting that as a given rather than saying, somehow we don\u2019t meet our hurdles until that turns around, we are saying we got to deliver it, even if the rate environment is difficult and even if the interest rate environment is difficult. So, I hope that\u2019s helpful. But that\u2019s how we look at it.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","No, it is. I appreciate it and then, Greg, if I can go really quickly, would you talk about the immature businesses not being at return targets. Should we look at that as an expense ratio issue or does that felt in loss ratio as well?","Gregory Hendrick","It\u2019s mostly in the expense ratio, Meyer. It\u2019s little bit in the loss ratio because, as Mike noted earlier, we tend to be pretty conservative about how we look at things early on until we can get established track record of loss, but by and large that\u2019s just getting your book up to size and covering all the expenses and the investments you made just set the business up in year one.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Okay, fantastic. Thanks so much all.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Mike McGavick for closing remarks.","Michael McGavick","Well, I guess, I made them in essence. But I really did think this was a call that\u2019s focused on the right issues. And the good news from my point of view is where we stand to have two of our three quarters this year below 95 ex CAT action here combined and our insurance operations is a good feeling and have this third quarter be the second of those, it\u2019s a great feeling.","I think Jamie\u2019s troops continue to do a very good job in very difficult conditions and I think we are thinking about the business in the right context which is where all starts from. You have to have the right problem to solve in order to solve the problem and I think we\u2019ve got the right problems solved in our minds and are working with real diligence around it.","I am also very proud of the expense story. Because we\u2019ve been reacting in an appropriate way even when those are always difficult things to do and we have \u2013 I think, I am pleased with where I see the planning process so far. So, I have actually enjoyed this conversation because it felt like the business we are actually running and I appreciate that spirit.","I do want to add one thought, though. I didn\u2019t want to do in this personal of way at the beginning, because I knew Jamie had some work to do tonight. But six years ago, I got here and Jamie was already here and if Jamie hadn\u2019t been in the engine room of this business for these last six years, while we finished all of these \u2013 and been dealing with all of these incredible problems from the time that we solved SCA to all the other things we\u2019ve done, we wouldn\u2019t be on this call.","And I think the people who represent XL in the market or comment on XL in the market really owe Jamie a huge debt of thanks. Now I feel it that way. So, thank you very much and again, we do want to apologize that the press release on the path for most of you got a little slowdown, but in the end, I hope you\u2019ve gotten this call useful. Good night.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

My name is Shirley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David R. Radulski","Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement. On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our Financial Results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, will review the segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open up for questions. ","Also in attendance are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer; and Steve Robb, our Controller.","Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I'd turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Michael S. McGavick","Good evening. As you can see from our release, XL's first quarter results were solid across the board. We returned to profitability in the first quarter with fully diluted operating earnings of $0.52 per ordinary share and an operating ROE of 6.9%. Following a difficult 2011, where much of our progress was obscured by the high level of catastrophes and large losses, this is a gratifying announcement to make and further supports our confidence in XL's days and years ahead.","In my year-end letter to shareholders, I outlined several reasons for our confidence. I'll go through some of these again, updating them with our first quarter results. First, our underwriting is improving. And look, we're not confused, we are not at the level of underwriting results that we are expecting to show in every business, but we are improving. The insurance segment combined ratio improved to 101.2%, obviously higher than it should be, but significantly better than the 121% in the first quarter of last year. And even when one removes the extreme cat events of last year, we saw margin expansion in the insurance results in first quarter last year over this year, and we expect that expansion to accelerate. At the same time, Reinsurance continued their record of achievement. The Reinsurance segment's combined ratio for the quarter was 82.4%, a great performance. Jamie will give further details momentarily. It's a good sign that these improvements were especially noticeable among the 7 challenged businesses and insurance that we've discussed in detail on prior calls. In fact, the combined ratio of these 7 businesses was, in this quarter, 104.3%, getting closer in line with the rest of our insurance book in this first quarter. Again, nowhere near good enough, but as we expected, moving in the right direction.","Now in the P&C industry, we all know better than to expect an immediate turnaround in underwriting results. But as our actions take hold, improvements will accelerate, we believe. Everyday, these businesses are decreasingly affected by prior decisions and increasingly improving as a result of our corrections. As we've shared with you, some of these 7 businesses are already on their way to reaching appropriate margins. And at the same time, as we have emphasized, we are watching all of our businesses with intense focus, always on the lookout for anything that warrants special attention or greater opportunity to expand our profit. ","Turning to another source of confidence. Pricing improved in each month of the first quarter. To use the metric that many of our peers report, North American Property & Casualty rate growth was 5% in the first quarter and rate achievement was accelerating throughout the quarter. I'll ask Greg and Jamie to elaborate, but we feel very comfortable that our positive rate change will continue. We are a long way from regaining the ground lost over the past 10 years, but as the momentum moves in the right direction, we believe XL is well positioned to benefit from this rate movement. ","Another source of our confidence is our focus on smart profitable growth. Our P&C gross premiums written increased over 10% from the first quarter of last year. Insurance segment gross premiums written were up 9.3% as a result of new business initiatives in North American Property & Casualty lines, higher retention levels in our profitable professional lines, and improved pricing. Gross premiums written by our Reinsurance segment grew by 11.8%, primarily in International Casualty. We like what we are seeing, remixing our businesses towards premiums written in the lines we think provide the greatest opportunity for profit. ","Another source of confidence is our ERM. Our enterprise risk management record continues to show results. While the entire industry did benefit from a relatively quiet cat quarter, where losses were reported, XL again fared in line with our expectations and performed well relative to peers as a percentage of shareholders' equity. Now in the first quarter, this was illustrated by Costa Concordia, an awful human tragedy obviously, and one of the true marine catastrophes that we have experienced. In fact, for the sector, this resulted in a loss approaching $1 billion. Now we're a leader in insurance and reinsurance marine coverages for both haul damage and liability. And for us to have a net loss from this event, currently estimated about $45 million, is a sound underwriting achievement given the catastrophe to the market. In the first quarter, we continue to invest favorable reserve development. And we believe you should find more evidence of our reserving prudence when we relieve our -- when we release our Global Loss Triangles later this week. Recall that the first quarter is an actual versus expected quarter. And as usual, we will again perform a complete review of our reserves in the second and fourth quarter, and look forward to discuss reserving in greater detail with you next quarter. Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary, will join us then.","As we made clear, our operating efficiency remains an area of intense focus. We are committed to ensuring that every dollar we spend improves our ability to expand margins. As people discuss, we are on track with the expense guidance for the year that we provided at the end of last year. But as I've said, we retain our ability to hold back spending of our expected loss ratio, driven margin improvement does not materialize. And we are just as committed to efficiently managing investors' capital. We bought back $100 million worth of XL shares in the first quarter. We've told you that we consider the $400 million in share buybacks for the year that we spoke of in our last call, as less a ceiling than a floor, and we intended to continue buying back shares for as long as the economics remain compelling versus other opportunities.","One final note on the quarter and I'll turn it over to Pete. At the annual RIMS Conference recently, I bet and I know you all follow, I was especially pleased by how often clients and brokers would take me aside to tell me how impressed they are, both with the talent we've been adding, and our already strong team and their creativity. These brokers of course follow-up by asking us to look at many of the most complex challenges, exactly the kind of position XL strives to be in everyday. We are driven to provide solutions that add value to our clients, while generating return on our capital for shareholders that invest in us. We have a strong edge -- or sense of urgency to succeed at both and we're pleased by the progress this quarter demonstrates.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to discuss the financials in more detail.","Peter R. Porrino","Well, thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating income for the first quarter was $165 million or $0.52 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to an operating loss of $163 million or $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Our net income attributable to our ordinary shareholders was $177 million or $0.56 per share. The loss in the prior year was driven by cat losses, which net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums totaled $387 million compared to $20 million in the current year quarter.","Turning to our summary of financial results on Slide 3, you'll see the P&C premium growth that Mike highlighted. Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 95.3%, or 13.5 points smaller than the same quarter last year. Our accident year combined ratio was 101.3%, or 30.1 points smaller than the same quarter last year. As I mentioned, cat losses in the prior year quarter was significant and accounted for 30.5 loss ratio points compared to 1.5 points in Q1 2012.","Prior year development in the quarter was a favorable $80 million or 5.9 loss ratio points, this reflects favorable development of $54 million and $26 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively. Positive movements came from professional and property insurance lines, as well as shorter-tail reinsurance lines. As we pointed out in the past, the first quarter results do not include a full reserve review for the majority of our businesses. In fact, more than 80% of our reserves are not subject to a complete reserve review this quarter, and as a result, we generally react only to actual versus expected results in shorter-tail lines.","We continue to see positive actual-versus-expected development across most of our businesses. Professional lines releases of $24 million in the quarter arose primarily from a large favorable case settlement on a 10-year old claim. The current and prior year quarters were also impacted by losses from large, nonnatural catastrophe events in both Insurance and Reinsurance. In Q1 2012, this was largely related to Costa Concordia. ","XL reported a loss net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums of $45 million, of which $24 million was attributable to the Insurance segment and $21 million to the Reinsurance segment. Of the total Costa Concordia impact, a significant amount was in the form of reinstatement premiums and as a result, operating and acquisition expense ratios was somewhat distorted in the quarter. Excluding natural cat and PYD, our Q1 combined ratios were 104.8% for Insurance, 88.7% for Reinsurance and 98 -- 99.8% for all of P&C. Costa Concordia added 2.6, 5.2 and 3.3 points respectively to those ratios. ","Our combined $282 million of operating expenses for the first quarter was up 8.4% or $22 million year-over-year. The year-over-year increase rose principally from costs supporting our strategic initiatives and higher compensation cost from both growth and headcount associated with new business initiatives and certain severance costs. This increase is consistent with the investments we have been discussing on prior calls and in line with the additional spend level we indicated last quarter. ","At $190 million, net investment income under P&C portfolio in the first quarter was 6.4% below the prior year, due primarily to lower new money rates and cash outflows from the investment portfolio. The P&C gross book yield at the end of the quarter was 3.2%. We achieved an average new money rate on our P&C portfolio in the quarter of 2.1%. We estimate that approximately $3.2 billion of P&C assets, with an average gross book yield of 3.1%, will mature and pay down over the next 12 months. ","Our net income from investment affiliates was $30 million, down $2 million from the prior year. The first quarter performance of the equity accounted alternative portfolio was above our return expectations and reflected the positive investment environment that we expected late last year and during much of the first quarter of 2012. ","Realized gains were $21 million compared to realized losses of $66 million in the prior year quarter. This gain was net of $21 million in OTTI charges, which were primarily taken on non-agency RMBS assets. The total return on the portfolio was 1.5% for the quarter and contributed to book value growth with a positive mark-to-market of $249 million. This was driven by the narrowing of credit spreads which more than absorbed the impact of increasing rates. ","The P&C duration increased by 0.3 years to 3.1 years, more in line, although still less than the duration of all our liabilities. The life asset duration declined by 0.1 years. Our fixed income holdings in Euro-zone countries is again listed in our financial supplement. We continue to have negligible exposure to the sovereign and financial institution data peripheral countries, and our Continental European bank holdings, including covered bonds, totaled $801 million and remain largely exposed and national champions Northern Europe. The net unrealized gain position on these securities was $4 million at March 31. ","Now to capital management. Following the February Board of Directors meeting, we announced the authorization of a new $750 million share buyback program, which replaced the approximately $190 million remaining under the previous buyback program. During the quarter, we purchased in capital 4.7 million of ordinary shares at an average cost of $21.14 under the new program for $100 million, leaving 615 million remaining available for purchase under the current program. ","And as we announced on our year-end call in January, 2012, we repaid at maturity the $600 million, 6.5% guaranteed senior notes. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Pete, and good evening. I'm going to cover 4  topics tonight. I'll  provide updates on the insurance segment results for the quarter and on the corrective actions we are taking in our challenged businesses, a review of talent changes and a summary of current market conditions. ","Turning to results. I share Mike's sentiment that while our overall results are not where they need to be, I am pleased that we made progress this quarter. Insurance gross premiums written grew by $114 million or 9.3% in the quarter, and net premiums earned grew by $58 million or 6.6%. ","Mike touched on some main areas of confidence and some of the big factors driving this growth. While I would add that we had success in 2 of our targeted growth businesses, international perimeter [ph] market and political risk, and in our marine book, driven by geographic expansion and rate improvement. I'll cover the overall pricing environment in a few moments. ","The Insurance segment's combined ratio for the quarter was 101.2%, or 19.8 points better than the same quarter last year. Reduced natural catastrophe activity accounted for 13 points of this improvement, as Q1 2011 was adversely impacted by $133 million catastrophic losses compared only to $20 million cat losses this quarter. Prior year reserve releases of $53.9 million compared to $6.6 million last year accounted for another 5 points of improvement. In the current accident year loss ratio, excluding cats of 71.3% also improved by 4.3 points despite absorbing 2.2 points from Costa Concordia. And Q1 2011 was adversely impacted by several large non-cat property losses, whereas there was one large property loss this quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of improved accident quarter loss ratios.","These improvements are partially offset by a 1.4 point increase in acquisition ratio, partly due to reinstatement premiums related to the Costa Concordia loss, and a 1.2 point increase in the operating expense ratio, mostly due to increased compensation costs related to expansion in many of our businesses, an improved results, but we are still losing money on an underwriting basis which is unacceptable. However, the corrective actions we have discussed will begin to take hold. As you may recall, last quarter we talked about the businesses that we view as challenged. While this is just one quarter of progress, these businesses came into line with the rest of the book. Our combined ratio of the challenged businesses in the quarter was 104.3%, and the remainder we reported 100.2% combined ratio. Recall that last quarter, our challenged businesses combined ratio was 151.9% versus 104.4% for the balance of insurance. If we move the impact of prior development, cats and Costa, the Q1 combined ratio of the challenge businesses drops to 103.3%, while the remainder of the book reported a 101.9% combined ratio. ","The leaders of these businesses continue to implement re-underwriting strategies to turn their respective books around. I'll now share some examples of the actions underway to how they have translated to progress this quarter. We are improving the management of our cat capacity, ensuring that it is allocated to those accounts where we can get the best returns. Not only have we seen our catastrophe exposures reduced at a faster rate than our premium base in our international property book, we've also freed up capacity on certain accounts on our North American property book, allowing us to increase the size of our portfolio without increasing overall cat exposure. We continue de-emphasizing the guaranteed cost workers comp business in our risk management portfolio, as it is lagged the rest of the book in profitability. Through the first quarter, we have canceled nearly 25% of the renewal business, achieved rate increases of 10% and increased the average deductibles by 11% on the renewed business. ","In our surplus lines business, we continue re-underwriting the New York contractors' general liability line, where we have either non-renewed accounts or achieved rate increases of over 50% in the first quarter. We shift to the GL portfolio mix away from distressed areas, and we have successfully diversified the book in the other lines, namely real [ph] and property. The challenged businesses continue to be an area of great focus, but it's important to repeat that we moderate all of our businesses very closely.","Moving on to people. We were again pleased by our ability to add talent throughout this segment. This quarter, we appointed Jason Harris as Chief Executive for International Property and Casualty business group. We also added new talent in our political risk, international construction, and in marine businesses to name a few. As Pete mentioned, we did incur redundancy costs this quarter as we continue to replace underperforming talents. While we added 20 new underwriters in the quarter, the net increase was only 3. ","And finally, a word on market conditions. The positive pricing momentum which began roughly one year ago is real and we believe sustainable. In fact, in Q1, we saw a positive rating indication in all of our business groups, including professional lines. And as Mike said, this return to gradual sustained rate improvement is something we've all been expecting and we feel we're well positioned to benefit from these market changes. ","In North America, our P&C portfolio is up 5% year-to-date, led by double-digit rate increases in our property and E&S businesses. While our professional portfolio was just positive, our design business is up 3%. With our specialty portfolio up 1%, the only area of disappointment was in our international book which is almost flat. Despite 2011 loss activity and depressed pricing levels, we are losing business to competitors for double-digit rate reductions. While I'm always disappointed with the customer, many of the underwriting decisions we face in these situations are quite easy. ","And while on the topic of rates, I want to be clear that we are thoughtful about how we implement rate increases. These are not blanket mandates which inevitably lead to adverse selection. Rather, our teams have segmented their portfolios based on a variety of factors and used a graded approach to rate change. In summary, the hard work of our teams produced progress in the first quarter, but we remain relentless in our pursuit of acceptable margins. ","And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.","James Veghte","Thanks, Greg, and good evening. The reinsurance segment had a very solid quarter of underwriting results, with a combined ratio of 82.4%. Naturally, we had the benefit of negligible of cat activity compared to $271 million a year ago, principally from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand. Our reserve of leases in the quarter were $26.4 million compared to $64.4 million a year ago. The reduction was principally due to deterioration in 2011 cat losses, $10 million from the Thailand flood and $10 million from storm Dagmar in Northern Europe. Notwithstanding this, 85% of our releases came from short-tail property and marine businesses. Excluding the impact of cat losses and prior-year development, our combined ratio was 88.7% versus a combined of 87.7% in the first quarter of 2011. The deterioration from last year resulted from Costa Concordia, which had a net impact of $21 million or 5.5 loss ratio points.","Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $980 million, an 11.8% increase from the first quarter of 2011. This increase was virtually entirely driven by our European and Asia-Pacific operations. In Europe, we had a significant increase of premium assumed in a U.K. motor proportional treaty, select new casualty opportunities in London, and increased shares on Continental European cat business. In Asia-Pacific, we wrote new business and increased shares on property proportional business as that market responded to the non-cat activity in the region last year.","In summary, we had an excellent quarter of underwriting results on both an accident and calendar year basis. We found select opportunities to grow our portfolio, and we continue to maintain a very sound reserve position. ","Turning to market conditions. The headline event at April 1 is the Japanese renewal. You will understand this will be a Q2 event from a top line perspective. Nevertheless, I would like to comment on the renewal, given the significant amount of intention this market has gotten over the last 12 months. As we've said previously, we had to significantly reduced our position in the Japanese market over the course of the last 10 years, as treaty conditions have gotten progressively competitive. While we would have liked to see more fundamental changes in the way the market is structured at this renewal, there was enough improvement that we increased our overall aggregates quite significantly. In fact, we increased them by 53%. These improvements included reductions in proportional ceding commissions of 3% to 4%, event limits on proportional treaties reduced by 30%, original rates increased by 25% to 50%, earthquake excess of loss rates increased from 15% to 50% and wind and flood rates came up 15%. Overall, it's a very solid renewal, although that marks overall rate adequacy still lags well below our U.S. wind portfolio. Our behavior in that market, including a very manageable loss from the earthquake last year, is a clear illustration of our underwriting discipline over the course of the decade of activity in that market. ","Outside of Japan, I would echo Greg's comments on pricing. We're starting to see positive pricing momentum in sectors of the U.S. casualty market, particularly XL's liability in E&O. Cat exposed short tail lines are showing nice price movement and we would expect our U.S. mid-year wind renewals to have a continued momentum in a positive direction. We have virtually no business activity in Continental Europe at April 1, although we did renew a very large Continental European cat program with a risk adjusted increase of 6%, which we are pleased with. Elsewhere, Latin America remains very competitive and as mentioned, Asia-Pacific is showing an improvement in short tail lines as the market reacts to the national cat activity in the region last year. ","So overall, we were very pleased with our quarter, both financially and relative to our underwriting activity. As we've said, we are ideally positioned to take advantage with what is clearly an improving environment with our global footprint, deep talent pool and long-term relationships with customers and producers.","With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Q&A.","David R. Radulski","Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Keith Walsh with Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mike, first question. You commented about underlying margin expansion is up and should accelerate. Can you talk to this a little bit more? What are you seeing in rate trend by month? And what do you view as your overall underlying loss cost trends?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, I'm going to let Greg comment more on the rate trends by month because he gives you a little more insight there. But my point is that relative to the same quarter a year ago or relative to even the fourth quarter of last year, our combined ratios came down. And that is even more exciting when you get to the loss ratios versus the combined ratios because we did have some expense expansion through both the Costa Concordia and the noise it created as well as a headcount cost associated with growth as well as cost of some redundancies. So when you add all of that together, the fact that the loss ratio is moving the right way is the expansion I'm talking about. And I expect that to accelerate through this year, as I've said, leading to more attractive returns this year, and we think really getting exciting next year on our -- relative to this tough market basis. So we're excited about where the book is going and the kinds of underwriting actions that Greg describes will be critical to getting us on the right path. Now when we get into the kind of mid-single digits rate increases that we're describing in North America, we're beginning to catch up the loss cost trend and make some real margin expansion. That is not the level across the whole book yet, but as I said we expect this to expand and accelerate quarter-by-quarter as our underwriting actions take hold. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Greg to comment a little more on what we're seeing on rate.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure. February, March, April -- each one had success of improvements. The figures I gave you in my comment blend over the portfolio to a positive 1%. And as Mike noted, if you blended the trend that we needed across our entire portfolio, it's somewhere between 3% and 5%. But clearly, it's a story amongst very different lines of business. In North America, the rate increases are north of 10% and accelerating on the short-tail line, and that is way in excess of trend. Conversely, while professional is positive just over -- just almost came to 1%, that's probably behind trend a little bit. So in summary, we're doing better each month-by-month, we're gaining ahead on the short-tail lines of trend and we're probably still lagging a little bit on the longer-tail lines.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then Greg, just a follow-up on -- specifically on professional lines. You mentioned you're still probably a little below trend there, but your retention is actually up and you've written more, why not push rate more on that specific line if you could talk to that.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure. First of all, it's one of our more profitable books of business and so while we may be lagging trend, we still have very acceptable margins there. And the rate is very spotty. It's not a smooth -- it never is with any market. It's not a smooth 1%, and we're hitting on more of the tougher risks that we like -- than we are in the general spread of business. And so I would say the retention ratio being up is more business, hitting that mark than we did in the past. It's not a very large increase, it's roughly about 1 or 2 points up on the large professional book.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the net-to-gross property casualty insurance written premiums, the retention rate went up to around 84.7% in the first quarter of '12 from 81.7% a year ago. I'm just trying to get a sense if that reflects XL more exposure net or if there's something out there.","Stephen Robb","I can comment on the Reinsurance side, Jay, that a lot of that delta is because we switched the heart and crop [ph] program from fronting  where we ceded a lot out into the market to assume from the new owner and that dropped the ceded premium quite substantially.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, on the insurance side, there isn't anything specific that comes to mind. You'll know, of course, in some of our bigger risk businesses there's a larger amounts of business that we fund for other carriers or for the captives of our clients. So there could be a little bit of noise in there, but not anything dramatic that I'm aware of driving changes in retentions.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then my next issue is on share buybacks. There was $100 million done in the quarter. There is $650 million left in the authorization. The debt-to-capital is down over 400 basis points just on one quarter when you repaid the maturing debt. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what kind of speed could we see the rest of buyback completed?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, we don't -- as you know, we don't give forecast on the exact levels we'll be purchasing, and that's a source of constant dialogue with our board. But I can tell you, as I've said before, while we emphasize $400 million as something we were fairly certain of in this year, the reality of the way the market is playing out and the confidence we're gaining and seeing our margins expand lead us to be more bullish, as we've said. But in the end, we view the $400 million as more likely to be a floor than a ceiling. And you just have to take at face value and this is the kind of thing where given the effects it has on our subs, we let people know after the fact rather than before the fact what we do.","James Veghte","I would just add to that the debt to cap, that is pretty much exactly what we pegged it to be 6 months ago. So that's all according to long-term capital plan we had in place.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then my final one is on the Insurance segment. If you back out the Costa Concordia loss, the accident year x-cat combined ratio, we're still running around 102.5. Mike, to achieve adequate returns, where do you think that needs to be down to?","Michael S. McGavick","Look, I believe our accident year combine has got to come in around 90. I think that's just the reality of the back-of-the-envelope math of this low interest rate times. And that is really what we're delivered -- we're driven to deliver as an average across the book, that's how we develop our plans, that's how well we think the hurdle rates are now. You have to get into it business by business to get to an exact target for a particular business. But I think that's where this block ought to be running. This kind of low 90s, high 80s depending on the business. But we got a lot of work to do. But one of the things that is going to be hard as we go through this journey together, a couple of facts: One, it's not just rate change. I mean, as the markets harden, the first place that you usually get the most movement is on terms and conditions as much as it is on rates. Second, we're remixing the block of business towards more profitable activities. And third, we're reevaluating our lines shares and where to play in towers and all kinds of underwriting actions that aren't as obvious, aren't as directly related, but all of which we think have a meaningful impact. And if you take some of these more challenged businesses or some of our business that are more market takers and you make them less a part of the whole, and you take these kinds of less visible actions with real determination, you'll move a block of business like that. So that's not a forever statement to get into the 90s, it's just a lot of hard work.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I just have a question on the Reinsurance business, you're at an 87.7% underlying -- but what kind of ROE does that translate into? I'm just assuming lower premium surplus there than for insurance, but just trying to get an understanding of kind of how adequate is that when you think about overall returns? And then just one follow-up.","James Veghte","It depends on what you use there. But I think if you use any form of economic capital or rating agency capital, it's certainly in the high teens.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then thinking about the bad lines versus the not-so-bad lines, I guess, in insurance. I'm just kind of surprised that the range was so narrow between 103.3 versus 101.1. Is there something -- just trying to understand, what is it that makes -- like is the range within those groups wider than that kind of initial glance would indicate?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes. This is Mike. I'll start with a couple of things and I'll turn it over to Greg. First thing, if you look at that block of business, the entire insurance block, you got to divide it in essence into 3 segments: Challenged business which is about 1\/4 of it, and then the balance can be -- we talked about this before, at our Investor Day last year. The balance can be kind of divided into half and half. Half of it businesses that we're really pleased with the results of, and that we would like to write more of that or somehow extend the advantage. And then businesses that are solid businesses, but they're at a very low point in their cycle, they are kind of market taking at this stage, we're doing the best we can to manage down their impact on results without our capabilities so that we can take advantage of the market as it returns. So you're going to get this real big spread of results. Remember also the Costa Concordia was in the sort of the good side of the ledger was where Costa happens, not in the 7. So you've got 2 would have narrowed in the spread between the 2. But if you look at the history of performance of the 7 and you look at this quarter, that's a pretty happy number. And one other frustration, I think, we're all going to experience is, when we break this book up into smaller and smaller segments and we talk about on a quarterly basis, we're not going to have -- we're going to have a lot of movements around because we take big limits and there will be pops here and there. The question for me is, over time, are we seeing evidence of our actions taking hold that are -- the overall numbers moving the right way? In this quarter, I'm pleased to say they are.","Gregory S. Hendrick","And Mike, I'd only add in that business that is performing well. There is new growth initiatives in there, where we're investing in future revenue and income streams. Construction, Surety, Political Risk, just to name 3 of them. So there's a bit of everything in that in the non-challenged part of the portfolio.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean -- so if I'm looking at the insurance -- so the underlying commodities we adjusted Costa is like 102 and change, I think I mentioned that before. And you grew that segment like 14%. I'm just trying to -- is the area where you grew the -- is that area exhibiting current underwriting profitability or are the areas that you see, where you see opportunities maybe not profitable now but you expect that trends will move in your favor as you grow those segments, those businesses out?","Peter R. Porrino","Mike, it's Pete. Let's me just start off and then give it back to Greg. What you're looking at is specialty is not -- so those are lines of businesses that we disclosed because that's the way that the market expect us to disclose them. That's not equivalent to our specialty business. So you'll need to -- we would need to draw you a map to try and reconcile those 2. So they are not all that comparable, but Greg you want to...","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure. In general, Professional and Specialty where we have increasing retentions are where more the profitable businesses is located. And in our P&C business, where most of the challenged businesses were at lower retention levels than we were before. Those retention levels are following the margin opportunities that we see. Clearly, as you break each one of those down, there are differing levels of activity going on based on each business's -- and indeed within each business, each sub-portfolio's profit margin. So we're getting up to high-level number that are aggregating here. But In general, we're heading more towards the profitable businesses and away from the unprofitable.","Michael S. McGavick","And the other thing I would emphasize is some of it -- this is Mike, some of this cost will be affected by building up new activity. We have very acceptable loss ratios in the new business activities as we've discussed businesses like Political Risk and in Marine and such. But of course, there are subscale today and they're adding an expense burden that's affecting us all. But we like our timing of entry, a great deal given where those markets are going and we're liking what that capability does for the rest of our book.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of quick questions here for you. First, Greg, maybe you could tell a little bit -- a lot of companies have been talking about attritional kind of losses this quarter. Property losses were actually quite low. Did you all experience it all this quarter?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Certainly, in the quarter, there was the absence of large non-cat losses. And also, on pure attritional losses, there was nothing in there that we observed that would make us think that things are better or worse than prior. I didn't -- we didn't see any abnormally low.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And the next one for Jamie. Could you give us a little color on how you think that order is going to turn out and your capacity to write some more business down there?","James Veghte","Let me cover the last part first, Brian. As you know, we set our capacity based on shareholders equity as of the end of the third quarter of last year at 15% for our Tier 1 risk which includes U.S. wins. So that will be $1,570,000,000. As of January 1, we were at $1,358,000,000. That's Greg's book and ours combined. So going into the win season, we've got plenty of capacity to compete and we will deploy capacity. We are expecting continued great improvement. I would remind you, though, that, that market got sort of 10% to 12% risk-adjusted improvement a year ago as opposed to those that renewed at January 1, 2011, who basically were flat up slightly, so they paid a pretty good increase last year. I don't know what's going to happen, it's a highly syndicated market. My own view is it will  go up, again, although probably about halfway levels we saw last year, and we will deploy. I can't tell you, though, that what we've seen over the last year is anything that clears the pricing of the major league markets will get done. There is plenty of capacity out there.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then one quick one for Mike. I'm just curious, the technology spend that's going on, that is increasing the expenses this year. I'm wondering if you could drill down a little bit exactly what is that technology that's going through? Is it under investing in technology or is it new stuff that's going through?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, as I talked about back in Investor, let me emphasize a couple of points. I think the firm has chronically under invested in technology. As you know, the firm is basically built over time, much of it through acquisitions and much of the systems infrastructure was acquired in acquisition. And while I think that the people did heroic work keeping those systems functioning and supporting the business, in the end, as we envisioned the business over time, being more successful requires that we get that architecture stabilized and more uniform and more able to allow us to grow and gain operating leverage on adding new premium. So today, if we add a lot of new premium, we don't get much lift on the expense side. That's just ridiculous; we really ought to be seeing a lot of lift from adding premium. And that can only come by making this architecture more scalable. So you see things like really rebuilding the way in which our front-end underwriting tools work, both to make our underwriters more efficient with their time to give them more access to insight, to make better underwriting calls and to begin a flow of work that lowers the net cost of fulfillment for the client. That's one big area of investment, for example, right now. You know that we're investing a lot on the insight side of the equation, we have been for really more than 1.5 years now in terms of modeling, where we think modeling is applicable to the kinds of risk we take on. And again, the systems need to be substantially improved in order to allow that insight to be efficiently fed into the underwriting process. So I'm very confident in the end result of all this work and our ability to then really kind of add a booster to our progress. But as you know, systems work is a big intense effort, and it's not fun to finance, especially at a low point in a cycle. But we think it's the right time to be making the investment.","Peter R. Porrino","Brian, this is Pete. The only thing I'd add to put it in context of the increase that I spoke about, the majority of that would have been not in the technology space, it would have been in the compensation and related areas.","Michael S. McGavick","The strategic stuff we hold at corporate. That's the point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, just wanted to clarify, did you mention that the goal was a 90 combined on an accident-year basis?","Michael S. McGavick","If all economics stayed the same, our goal would be running around a 90. Now that -- I suppose I should be a little bit cautious. We are very prudent reservers and so sometimes I think the accident year at any particular time might run a bit hotter than the year will actually play out over time. But that's just a consequence to that approach. But I believe this firm needs to run in kind of in the low 90s, high 80s. Yes.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. So the mass on that is...","Michael S. McGavick","[indiscernible] the economic's change some, you can see a different result.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So the math on that is more than $1 a share, it seems from current levels, just as -- as you run it through the model, if you achieve those goals. And so on the one hand, it's incredible if you can do it. On the other, I look at 20 years of data for the corporation and it's a level that's only been achieved in a handful of years.","Michael S. McGavick","Actually, it was achieved most of our early years and then very infrequently sense. But if you look at the history of large pops that we've managed to produce at XL that we think we've contained through our strategic redesign and our attention to ERM and all the rest, we don\u2019t see any reason that we can't get that kind of stuff the heck out of the way and have our underwriters do their job. But we note that competitors are achieving the profit levels, it's not undoable and it's not out of sequence with our total history; it's just out of sequence with our recent history. But our determination to improve this book is very real.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and that includes -- I mean, you think the march towards that level is -- obviously began this quarter and just continues in the quarters ahead and years ahead?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, actually, as Greg reported, that's the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement on the loss ratio which is what we're focused on. That's the main driver we've got and then as we get these investments done, we'll be able to add in the booster on expense, too, we believe.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, perfect, perfect. And then just jumping to another key lever is the investment yield, again in the commentary, it doesn't sound like that --I mean it's just an unfortunate reality that where yields are, there's no movement or ability to re-risk the book or get higher yields. It sounds like that's going to just continue to be a headwind in the model, the combined ratio is the real kicker, that's where we're going to see the ROE much higher over time.","Michael S. McGavick","Yes. This is -- We are underwriting loss ratio focused. I mean that is the driver around here. No question. Now on the investment side, I wouldn't say that there is no ability to, there's just no want or desire to. We like being middle of that pack on the investment side. We've chosen this defensive position. We believe in the current market conditions justify  it and you'll see relatively modest movements in line with how the market conditions involved. We're not going to be heroes there, we intend to be the kinds of underwriters we historically were. And it's not as though there aren't pockets of us that show us what we can do. We have businesses that are operating at this level today. And our Reinsurance business and a number of our Insurance business are achieving these kinds of levels. It's just about making the expectation and reality that the whole firm is doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","On the 7 underperforming businesses, just curious as to what the targeted level of combined ratio is, you've done a great job of moving it down to 103.3, but is the high 90s or is it just 100 combined ratio the target? And when do you think that's achievable by?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, Vinay, first, we have given explicit forecast on subsets of the business. We've said that over time, we believe will see this year that we'll see margin expansion. Next year, we'll see more exciting results on a relative basis, given where the sectors stand. I stand by that and believe we'll deliver that. A big part of how you get that, Vinay, is getting these businesses to stop beating you in the head. It's impossible to get there when some of these businesses produce such unreliable and often terrible results. And the businesses are working hard at it. How fast -- but what's a rule of thumb? A rule of thumb would be it takes 3 years to turn around a commercial book of business. I mean that's a good rule of thumb to work with. But we didn't start yesterday, we started back at the end of the strategic planning cycle back in '10. Some businesses got more attention quicker, others took longer. We discussed this in detail before how we went through our various review. So they're at an uneven state, each one of them, relative to the speed of turnaround. But I expect this speed of turnaround now to get a little wind behind its sails due to what's going on in rate generally across the market, which is long overdue and well justified by the economics of the business today. So I'm -- I feel encouraged about the work we're doing. I see the steady progress. We have all the short-term metrics you can imagine to make sure everybody's doing what they said they will do. And I feel as good as you can feel when it's moving the right way, but not as fast as you would like. And we'd like it to move it faster and we'll keep working towards that.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure, fair enough. Second question was in numbers or question I think in the Costa Concordia loss. Could you please give us a breakdown between the impact on the expenses and the losses of price segments, please?","Michael S. McGavick","The billing statement premiums, by and large, it went in 2 different ways for reinsurance and for insurance. Insurance reinstatement premiums ended up costing -- yes, for insurance, $13 million and for reinsurance, it was additional of $5 million. So you can run the math through that.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So it was a positive $5 million for reinsurance...","Peter R. Porrino","And negative $13 million for insurance.","Operator","The next question comes from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions. The first one, you made the comment initially that the reserve release related to the quarter were not related to an annual reserve analysis but just quarterly truing up, I suppose. I looked historically, and I don't really see a pattern of the annual reserve study making much of a difference in how you release reserves, can you sort of go into why you made that distinction? What the distinctions are and how you analyze your reserves quarterly versus annually?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, the quarterly, again, is just we take a look at the actual versus expected and where there are and focus on the shorter lines. Where there are unique anomalies, where something is simply manifest and time to react to it we will deal with it uniquely. The reason we emphasize it in this quarter is there was one such unique event which drove a larger than we would usually expect movement out of the professional lines relating to a 10-year-old claim that was resolved during the period, and we felt at that point, we could have waited if you want to follow the model that we use perfectly but we felt that it was simply manifested and should be dealt with. That's why called out the distinction. And again, you're going to get a really good picture and the ability to get all deep in the data when the Global Loss Triangles come out here next week.","Gregory S. Hendrick","So Josh, just to clarify, it's not annual. It's semiannual where we do the full reserve review.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And the second situation, you mentioned the international casualty growth depending on where that is and what you're looking at the market. This is reinsurance, of course, although we see casualty growth in insurance as well. International casualty markets don't have the same kind of optimistic maybe as U.S. casualty markets. Can we sort of draw some distinctions on where it is exactly that you like the business there compared to what others might be saying about those international casualty markets?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, the growth in our international book has principally been over the last couple years on the U.K. motor market, which is very substantial rate increases,  although we would admit they're slowing down now. Elsewhere, you're correct, it's a fairly competitive market.","James Veghte","And I think you also need to be a little bit careful when comparing growth in our reinsurance book from our insurance book, where our transaction count is much lower than Greg's would be on a regular basis. So you could get distorted growth or reduction numbers based on 1 or 2 Underwriting actions.","Gregory S. Hendrick","On the insurance side, the international casualty growth came in some very targeted activities, typically geographically in Germany. The book renews predominantly at 1 [ph]. So there isn't necessarily any need to project that through the rest of the year. This is a one-one book of business and we were successful in targeting some new customers that we wanted, that we wanted to pick up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, I was a little surprised that when you're talking about professional lines, you seem to conclude [ph] to having more business at your hurdles and large account. Can you -- did I hear you right? And I guess any specific industry classes that's happening? I know there's been some capacity withdrawals so I was curious if that's playing a role in that, too.","Gregory S. Hendrick","It wasn't -- Matthew, it wasn't so much large as difficult, it can come in a variety of sizes. There's nothing that I am aware that would make me think anything industry-specific happening in that book of business. It's more just we've found a few risks that with our somewhat contrarian view, we have thought to hit the hurdles and have written them at a little bit better clip than we did the year before. Again, I want to emphasize this is not a dramatic, large increase but an incrementally increase.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then Jamie just -- with respect to Japan. I guess not a surprise that, that book isn't as rate adequate as your U.S. book, but just be curious how you think the Japan portfolio compares to Europe now?","James Veghte","I would say very close to Europe the way we calculate rate adequacy levels. I won't tell you, I won't go through the entire calculation, but it has moved from sort of a high 70s to the mid 90s, and I would say euro win this probably about the same level and U.S. win the way we calculate it is about 108 to 110.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one clarification for Peter. You had mentioned for Costa Concordia, was the only impact on the acquisition and expense ratio is broadly just the reinstatement premium factor, was there some ceding commission going through there as well?","Peter R. Porrino","No, the reinstatement premium, that will be both on the driver on the commission and brokerage as well as the operating expense ratios.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Mewhirter with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Mewhirter - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, obviously you bought a fair amount of shares back this quarter. I noticed the diluted share count didn't respond as proportionately as I thought. The diluted share count was sequentially -- only went down by about 2 million. Is that a function of the stock going up a little bit and more options in the money, or is there any residual from many of the shares that are converted or anything like that?","Michael S. McGavick","I'm going to hand it over to Steve, but it was in the dilution calculation. Do you want to just go through that?","Stephen Robb","Yes, it will be options on restricted stocks that have a more diluted effect. I'd have to go back and look at when impact of the conversions of the reinsurance [ph] they were the last -- primarily, the last quarter. So it's mostly just the dilution impact.","Doug Mewhirter - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. My second question is, I guess, a little bit more conceptual. I know a couple of quarters back, you were commenting on some actuary lines which you thought were actually historically excellent, very profitable lines with 10-year combined ratios of 60s. They were going through periods where the combined ratios run the 90s and the 100s because of a few large losses here and there. And this is Casualty and Property, it's not necessarily -- large property losses could be anything. And it's almost like there is a luck -- a big luck factor involved in any given quarter. How do you think this quarter would be characterized in terms of that factor, where a good line might have had unusual string of losses and a bad -- or a bad line or a challenged line, as you would say, might have had an unusually good string of non-losses, for lack of a better term.","Michael S. McGavick","I think that's a very interesting question. Let me give you a little perspective in the line that comes to mind the most, by far the most which is International Property. I think it's true that 3 years ago, in '08 for example, we were talking a lot about large pops, that there was an unusual level of large loss activities. I don't think we were the only ones talking about it. The market was talking about it, too. And I -- and we did talk about how -- if you looked over 10 years, these had been very profitable lines, and we were confident that this was an aberration. But you may remember us being very direct in our disappointment the more we study these lines as the large pops continue. And we felt that the underwriting in this business on deeper examination did not justify the confidence that we have placed in them or the defense that we had made to them 3 years before. And we were pretty candid about that, and I'm trying to continue to be candid about that. Not of our standards. So we really have torn into those books in a very rigorous way using resources from all over the company to try and get at what we think is going on, and how to improve it quickly. And while we'll -- given the kind of large lines, complex risk strategy we have, given the fact that we're not a shop that has large blocks of kind of commodity business around, we will have some more volatility perhaps and others, but I think the level of volatility that XL has been seeing is unreasonable to the size of the blocks of business. And so we have been using a variety of underwriting tactics and other tactics to lessen that volatility. So I just want to give you that thematic comment. With respect to this quarter, I'd say that in general, this was a more favorable quarter, certainly than the kind of stuff that we were going to last year. But every time you say that, you have to say, well, except for Costa Concordia, a true marine catastrophe and happens, marine is a business that were a big and leading player and want to be a leading player in giving results over history. So if I were to characterize the quarter, it was more favorable than what we've been seeing. Certainly less influenced by the kinds of things we were seeing out of International Property. Would I claim that's all because of Underwriting actions at this  stage? No, it's too early for them to all have taken hold. But we would expect over time that it's less and less likely we'll see those kinds of pops because there is less and less opportunity for the kind of practices that were in place before to be influencing the book. So interesting question, and I hope that's responsive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","We appreciate all the color around the underperforming businesses and the initiatives that are going on. The big question I'd ask is big picture, Mike. If the underperforming business is relatively converging with your better business, and I want to recognize it, it's skewed by Contra Costa -- Costa Concordia, pardon me. Just actually, literally, do the math. The question I think is longer term, how much of the improvement you're targeting are you really hoping to get from these underperforming businesses? And how should we think about, I guess, improvements in these businesses versus, say, just broader mix initiatives that you're talking about improving the mix and more property -- or some of these other lines that you're growing? And then just, generally, sort of broad industry pricing and broad repricing at your book. When you think about the weights of those 3 things, how should we be monitoring them> And generally and I wonder if you could give us some targets for us to think about it over the next couple of years.","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, I'm going to disappoint you on targets by that level of granularity. I think that gets me too close to the forecasting business, which we try not to be in, except where when we think there's very controllable things we can talk about such as expenses. So as I look up, let me give you a few flavors. First of all, as rate accelerates, it's going to be an obviously bigger part of it, but it changes where you think of your improvement coming from. The fact that we're now seeing positive rate in some of the Casualty business for the first time that we've seen it is one of the biggest positive indicators I can point to. When you have a very large book of already meaningfully profitable business like our professional book and you start to get some positive rate into it as well, that's a  very encouraging fact that prevents the margin there from being hollowed out while you work on the rest and that is a very large portion of our block of business. When you look at the underperforming, which is kind of a quarter of our business, when you start to pull that thing into the 90s, which we are believing we can do at reasonable pace, you then really have taken away one of your biggest deadweights and you turn it into at least at that point, benign. You take those together and you've got about half the book described. You add in specialty businesses, which are performing well by and large. You add in the reinsurance book that continues to provide very good combined. And then you're down to the kind of the portion that is kind of in the market taking phase where we still like the business, and there it's about being very assertive on pricing, doing what we can and not losing our capability for when the turns come. You add all that together and it doesn't -- I think you can see that rate isn't the whole focus. What we can do on those market taking business is every bit as important. Every new dollar of earnings we get there is every bit as important as what's going on in the so-called challenged business. And believe me, somewhere during this year, if things go as I expect, we're going to stop talking about this breakout because it won't be relevant anymore. It will be about how the whole book comes together. But when you have something hurting you as bad as -- what was it, 150 or some ridiculous number on some of these challenged business last year, it really gets your attention, you realize that, that just can't happen, that kind of so-called bad luck is not bad luck, it's not quality underwriting and you've got to get your arms around it. You take out that kind of beating your head on the rock and you can really get this book moving. So there's no -- every dollar of added earnings is valuable no matter where it comes from. And as we get these kind of more aggressive actions completed in these underperforming business, then it's the usual soft market stuff, remix to the more profitable lines, maintain your capability, push rate, explore rate, see what you can do, manage your loss cost as best as you can and you'll come out of it. Sorry that that's not the specific forecast by 3-part division that you want but that's how it's going to happen.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's fine. I guess, the final question, that you guys have been in front of some of these issues are certainly related on your own book, but I think it's sort of publicly so. I'm wondering how over the past 6 months sort of -- the tone of this conversation has shifted at conference like RIMS and even in dealing with some of these troubled businesses. We have had to have a lot of tough conversations with these brokers that you have to have big, broad relationships with. Is the market coming to you? And do you think that maybe there is some momentum for taking more pricing in some of the market taking in the price-taking businesses as well?","Michael S. McGavick","I really do, I -- the market -- look, this is not a big, radical, sudden hard market. This may be that long-awaited slow appropriate turn that the market has long thought would be great, where we don't just see sudden disruptive events for clients and instead, just a rational conversation towards pricing levels that are acceptable. And as we talk to brokers, their attitude is generally very supportive. I mean, every once in a while on the reinsurance side, we'll see someone put out a study about capacity. But generally, we're on the insurance side, people know that the game has to change. They know that there is a reality to these low-interest rate environments. They know that there is a reality to many companies, I think, increasingly finding their reserves less pull some [ph] and as that plays out, those of us who've been more prudent, those of us who have been more cautious are in a good position. And the brokers understand that. They're seeing more rate-driven behavior, I think by competitors. And as a result, they are, I think, generally very supportive. We've certainly have no big disruptive conversation with them. Occasionally, if you get into some subclass when there is a program involved or something, they'll be a very, very unpleasant conversation. But that's really rare.","Operator","Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was hoping to get some color on the PYD that happened in P&C and reinsurance, specifically looking for color on what business lines stood out there and what accident years drove the favorable development?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, the -- overwhelmingly, it's the short-tail lines and recent years that we would recognize relatively quickly. So that's the heart of the story. There are couple offsets, as Jamie mentioned in his remarks, about 10 million associated with New Zealand earthquakes where there was some adverse development, some adverse on Dagmar, the Northern European storm. You got offsets, you got short-tail lines, otherwise, being released whether it wasn't -- and then you have the one big one that we're calling out specifically that otherwise wouldn't have been addressed in this quarter it being an A versus E quarter, which was a -- Professional lines loss one client where there was a big settlement and it's from 10 years ago, if I remember the accident. But that's what's driving all this, it's really recent years, short-tail reaction.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Thanks for bringing all that together. And so I guess kind of '03 to '07 liability redundancies, are those pretty much faded at this point or have those have been realized?","Michael S. McGavick","I think, next week, you're going to hit the Global Loss Triangle. That's going to be a good place to study that, you want to study carefully because there is always noise of this large event to that large event, you want to get to the underlying trends, so study carefully. But you're going to find, I think, well -- we'll let those speak for themselves and talk about it next quarter because next quarter is when we get the in-depth reviews from the entire book, and that's where we could give you more color on that.","James Veghte","I can tell you, Randy, that by class, this quarter, 16.2 part of the 26 was from Property and 7 was from Marine. So very much for short-tail relief [ph].","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones. One, is there any reason why the first quarter interest expense shouldn't be a good run rate for the rest of the year?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, I'm sorry, could you repeat that?","Peter R. Porrino","The answer is no. It should be reasonably the same. I mean, there's a few days of extra interest on the debt that we retired so that, that would be about it.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, Mike. The question was whether the interest rate...","Michael S. McGavick","We got it. Pete just listens faster than I do.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Second question just with regard to life re, is there any long-term planning going on right now? It looks like the ROEs on an annual basis are low single digits?","Peter R. Porrino","I'm sorry, is there any kind of what plan?","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Long-term adjustments?","Peter R. Porrino","So we will -- for the life reinsurance book, as we said before, we put it in run off, we would, at the right price -- I mean, we said we would sell that business. The returns -- you have to be a little careful coming up with ROEs. You can describe different levels of capital for that business, right. In fact, if you look at our economic models on the  floor-wide [ph] basis, the returns are actually reasonably strong. The business has been pretty consistent over time. Right, so we're happy to -- we're happy to hold it but we'll be happy to sell it at the right price.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, there is nothing, no updates, I guess, is the right way of asking you.","Peter R. Porrino","There is nothing that has happened in that book of business to the last several quarters.","Michael S. McGavick","Given that, that block is what has us talking about long-dated European financials, which are, as we mentioned, in the national champions in Northern Europe, but that's the block that's causing us to have that portfolio. You can guess that the likelihood of something stepping up to that, given the uneven news that we continue to experience from Europe is relatively slight.","Operator","And our final question is a follow-up question from Michael Nannizzi.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess one question I had is just on the kind of businesses that you've invested in and talent over the last year or so. And kind of what was your baseline expectation for the market overall pricing, those lines of business? And what's your kind of runway as you look out and if conditions change or if they don\u2019t meet your expectations for maybe to reverse course in some areas where maybe you don't see the growth or opportunity that you saw when you made the decision to ramp up?","Michael S. McGavick","Good point. First of all, we didn't enter any business where we didn't think there were adequate returns at the point we were entering the business. So none of these were on comp. We thought that there were adequate returns available if we could find the right talent. In terms of loss ratios from Day 1, combined ratios take time because you have to build the book to the size to absorb the cost, so that's all obvious and it will take time. I don't -- I can't give you a precise -- because it will be very different by line of business. I mean Surety can grow very fast for the couple of writings and you could be in great shape then, Surety doesn't cost us very much to begin and I'd really love our guys. I'd be willing to take our time and let the market work out. So it would be a different answer there that it would be on Political Risk where we've made a pretty substantial investment. We like that marketplace right now with all the uncertainty in the world and the quality of our underwriting team. But I do expect them to get going. And they're under pressure and they should be and we're very careful in monitoring very carefully how they're allocating their risk. So you really got to go business by business. I can't give you a real rule of thumb. I think Greg want to add a little color, and I'd like him to.","Gregory S. Hendrick","The piece on talent, too, is the big component can be also the replacement of leaders that we need to replace to be effective at turning around some of these challenged books of businesses. They can't underestimate the impact of a strong leadership, and Mike and I saw the firsthand of RIMS with a couple of different challenged business where a new leader not only energized the marketplace -- I had people pulling me aside to tell me what a great hire it was, but also how they have observed much better response and actually with the remaining team. The other part of it is there's talent being added in existing lines of business, for instance, North American property where it's a very, very easy metric to watch. How much premium you're getting per underwriter and what kind of returns you gain in the pricing. So not all of this is new business additions.","Michael S. McGavick","And then there is probably one last thing to add, is really talented underwriters have a greater utility than just narrow business activity of their own line of business. So we will have cadence where the talent come in, we'll work at the business. We may, in the end, decide that isn't working out like we thought but here is something else you can contribute to this place. And we find that having a community of talent where underwriting talent is what we celebrate, what we try to drive everyday, supported by world-class insurance professionals in every discipline, this is what makes the place fly, and that's why we've had such success as people sense that this is a unique point in XL's history where there is an increasing excitement among that community. And they're being treated in a way that they perhaps haven't experienced in their other places and they just realized they are a part of something special. And we intend to make this a great home for that kind of entrepreneurial, exceptional, complex risk underwriting talent. And we're seeing people -- our doors are knocked on all the time, and we're excited about that.","Operator","I'll turn the call back over the speakers for closing remarks.","Michael S. McGavick","I don't think I can give a better closer remark than I just did. This was and is becoming again a very special place. We are proud to be a part of it, it's not easy, we've got a long road to hold between where we stand today and our aspirations. But we're driven to bring that to life as quickly as the economics of our business rule out. So thanks for all the time, and we appreciate sharing our story with you.","Operator","Thank you, and this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions]. Now I would like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David Radulski","Thank you, Lori and welcome to XL Group's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlcatlin.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement. We also refer you to the 8-K referencing Q1 integration costs we posted to our website on March 30, 2016. On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team, and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, will review their segment results and market conditions, then we'll open it up for questions.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we will discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, as well as other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Mike McGavick","Good evening and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings call, a call on which XL Catlin navigated challenging conditions and produced good underlying results, while maintaining our focus on bottom-line underwriting and top-line discipline. It will be no surprise to you that our view is consistent with what you have already been hearing from others during this quarter, that market headwinds are very tough. But as we will discuss tonight, in our results we think you can see many indicators of a well-managed book, and at the same time, a few one-off impacts related to the continuing fine-tuning of some of our processes and underwriting following the Catlin acquisition, particularly now our ceded reprograms.","So I'm going to walk through our results and a few of these highlights and impacts and then we also want to give you a little bit more help. And in a break with our normal tradition, a little guidance on two specific areas, the insurance acquisition expense ratio and the split between insurance and reinsurance, now that we have nearly 12 months of XL Catlin results to point to. And then, of course, I'll turn it over to Pete for some additional financial information and to Paul and Greg to discuss the segment results in greater detail. Looking at our results from the top of the house, in this quarter we produced a P&C combined ratio of 92.5%, gross premiums written of $4.4 billion and an underwriting profit of $175 million.","Our operating net income for the quarter of $103 million was impacted by $55 million of transaction-related integration costs and a higher level of cats in the quarter, at $53 million in this first quarter versus $15 million in the first quarter of 2015. We also continue to see impacts from the financial markets in our affiliate income, with $8 million of earnings in this quarter compared with $58 million in the first quarter of 2015. Now, that is a portfolio that has served us really well over time and we think it will do so again in the future. Obviously it is a difficult time for the hedge funds right now. Prior-year releases in the quarter were $43 million versus $48 million in the first quarter of 2015.","As a reminder, we conduct a full review of our reserves in the second and fourth quarters. In terms of the segments' results, we continue to look for pockets of opportunity amid the tough pricing environment. Reinsurance saw some new business opportunities which Greg will discuss and produced a solid combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119 million. In insurance, the ongoing fine-tuning and hard work came through once again in the accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 61.2%. As you know, this has been an area of focus for us and we're pleased to see this metric continue to improve now for three consecutive quarters. And it again points to the determination to focus on the bottom-line fundamentals amidst all the difficulties of the current market conditions. Paul will have further details regarding the insurance segment in his remarks.","Now, I said that there were some one-off and unique items impacting these results, particularly in insurance, including higher acquisition costs, due in part to the timing and mix of our ceded Re programs. And here, as I said, for one time I'm going to give you some forward-looking guidance. As these acquisition expenses even out through the rest of the year, we expect that the insurance segment acquisition expense ratio should move back in line with what we saw in the second half of 2015. And then to the second bit of guidance I mentioned.","We realize that this overall challenging rate environment, as well as the transaction effects themselves, haven't made it easy for you to model certain things like the insurance and reinsurance business split for net earned premium. We have now reported, of course, 11 months as a combined company. When you add in April of last year and include the Catlin results for that period, you have a trailing 12-month split of between 68% and 69% for insurance, with the balance being reinsurance and that would be the gauge I would look to use, looking forward for the full year.","So, stepping back, how should you think about XL Catlin in this current market? This is a question obviously we've been asking our leaders and broker partners and clients quite a bit, as well. And the challenge of the market means that the actual reception XL Catlin receives from brokers and clients is not yet fully showing up in the numbers. But the fundamentals we intended to deliver through the transaction continued to be very strong.","First, I've already mentioned our continued loss ratio progress in insurance. Second, we're ahead of the transaction-related synergy savings targets. And as you'll recall in the previous quarter, we increased our expected run rate synergy savings to $300 million. Further, the P&C expense ratio for the quarter decreased to 16.6% in Q1 versus the 19.1% in the prior-year quarter. And that is actually the lowest this metric has been in eight quarters. And as we've said, we're working toward greater efficiency and we're ready to pull the expense level further, if and when it should prove necessary.","Third, this transaction was based on combining two underwriting-centric cultures and we're insisting on fundamental bottom-line focused behavior. And when you tell underwriters to do what's right for the bottom line in a difficult rate environment like this, you will get less premium. It's that simple. But we like the discipline. We like the focus. And we like what our combined trends have been able to do so far, whether it's in fine-tuning their books and exiting some underperforming lines or simply walking away from new opportunities where we don't see the margins. Yes, we want them out there seeking opportunities and we see an amazing flow of opportunities, just not many that we're willing to write at these prices.","Fourth, we've maintained the ability to manage our capital. Based on what we told you previously, you should have expected around $700 million in buybacks for the year. Then, seeing our premium trends in this quarter, combined with our comfort in our capital position, led us during the quarter to add $250 million in buybacks to the plan. With this additional $250 million, we got through buying back about $180 million in quarter one. We expect to finish the balance of that additional $250 million in buybacks, as well as the planned amount towards the original $700 million, in the next quarter.","So to be very clear, as of right now, around $950 million is what you should expect for the year for buybacks. Of course, we will continue to evaluate this as the trends emerge. So all-in, the Company is producing good results and the reaction from clients and brokers continues to be enormously positive. And I certainly know you have good networks to check me out on this. The recent RIMS Conference was simply a resounding success for our firm. We're producing on the new opportunities as we intended, but we will not chase top line. This isn't the market for it. We're only going to write what we see the margin. And we will make the tough decisions to stay disciplined, exit lines where we don't see future potential and plan for these difficult markets to continue, even though, in the end, of course, they are unsustainable. And when there is a turn, we intend to be the best positioned firm in the marketplace. We're seeing that come true and we're looking forward to that inevitable time.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.","Pete Porrino","Well, thanks, Mike and good evening. Operating net income for the first quarter was $103 million or $0.35 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $194 million in 2015 or $0.75 per share. As we previously disclosed, during the first quarter we incurred $55 million in integration costs which have been included in operating income. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $22 million or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $36 million or $0.14 per share for the same quarter in 2015.","As we have previously noted, our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 Life Reinsurance sale transaction. We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. As always, it has no impact on comprehensive income or operating results. Our property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 92.5% or 3.6 points higher than the same quarter last year. Our property and casualty combined ratio, excluding private development and the impact of natural catastrophes for the quarter, was 92.1%, 0.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015.","Our natural catastrophe losses totaled $53 million or 2.2 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $15 million or 1.1 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. Prior-year development was a positive $43 million or 1.8 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $48 million and 3.7 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects a favorable development of $11 million in the insurance segment and favorable development of $32 million in the reinsurance segment. As we have discussed in previous calls, during the first and third quarters, our reserving process is based on our review of actual versus expected losses.","Our semiannual full actuarial review will be included in our results next quarter and we intend to provide our global loss triangles later this quarter. These will be our first as a combined company. And Paul and Greg will discuss our lending rounding results in further detail. Operating expenses have decreased in the quarter as we have made material progress achieving synergies from the transaction. We continue to view the overall relationship between the one-time cost to achieve integration and the ongoing synergies to be approximately 1.25 to 1. We expect that additional synergies will exceed normal course expense growth to improve our overall operational leverage and this is already coming through our results as our P&C operating expense ratios have decreased by 2.4 points from the first quarter of 2015.","Total combined operating expenses, excluding integration costs, are already more than 10% lower than at the time of the acquisition. Our first quarter operating tax rate was approximately 11%, with certain taxes on nonoperating mark-to-market items driving the higher tax rate on net income. We still expect our overall operating tax rate to be in the 10% to 12% range. Turning to the investment portfolio, reflecting the addition of the Catlin portfolio, net investment income, excluding the Life fund's withheld assets, was $164 million, up $6 million.","The gross book yield in the portfolio at the end of March was 2.4%. Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.6 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7%. Total affiliate income was $8 million for the quarter compared to $58 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to our investment fund affiliates, where equity and credit market volatility impacted returns and our hedge fund affiliate portfolio was not immune.","Despite these disappointing absolute returns, our hedge fund portfolio continues to significantly outperform its benchmark. And we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves the risk-adjusted returns we earn on the overall portfolio. Our strategic and other operating affiliates earned $13 million compared to $23 million in the prior-year quarter due primarily to the sale of ARX Holdings in the second quarter of 2015. Net realized losses, excluding derivatives, were $8 million for the quarter, down $13 million from the prior year.","Our unrealized gain position, including other investments, increased by $417 million during the quarter, driven primarily by rate decreases in our major jurisdictions. Unrealized net gains were $939 million at the end of the quarter, including other investments. On a performance basis, the total return on investments was 1.7% for the quarter, excluding foreign exchange. The duration of the total portfolio was consistent, at 3.2 years. Now with respect to capital management, under the share buyback program approved by our Board of Directors at our August meeting, we purchased just under 10 million shares for $355 million at an average price of $35.69 per share, leaving $348 million available for purchase under our share buyback program.","As Mike noted, we increased our level of share buybacks in the first quarter with the goal of adding $250 million of additional purchases over our typical pace in the first quarter. Given the combination of the limited time with the open trading window and relatively low volumes of market trading in March, we completed only $180 million through March 31 and we expect to complete these purchases during our next open trading window. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and will return capital when we believe it appropriate. We also remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.","I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results.","Paul Brand","Thanks, Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, but would firstly like to share some thoughts on current market conditions. The headwinds which strengthened throughout 2015 have continued, with pricing being negative across most lines of business as the overall rate change for the segment was down 2% in the quarter. Overall, our casualty lines were flat and professional businesses were down 1%.","Our specialty business was down 2%, affecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation and crisis management lines. And our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%. This negative environment has had an impact on top line. But our underwriters are under clear instruction to preserve margins and sacrifice top line, if terms don't meet our requirements. We have also chosen to execute certain underperforming books which, in aggregate, reduced top line by approximately $70 million in the quarter. Against this backdrop, I'm pleased to report that we have continued our trend of profitable quarters, dating back to quarter-one 2013, with the segment producing a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.5% compared to 94.1% in quarter-one 2015 and 98.2% last quarter.","Higher cat experience at $35 million, compared to $15 million in quarter-one 2015, contributed to one-third of the deterioration, with the majority of the balance due to the higher acquisition expenses, largely offset by an improvement in our operating expense and accident year ex-cat loss ratios. Prior-year reserve releases of $11 million or 0.7 points, was consistent with prior-year quarter. On an accident quarter ex-cat basis, the combined ratio was 95% compared to 93.2% in quarter-one 2015 and 95.7% last quarter. For Q1, we reported an acquisition ratio of 14.1% compared to 8.4% in Q1 2015 and 13.9% reported last quarter.","The majority of this increase is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business, where the gross acquisition costs are higher and loss ratios are lower than legacy XL business. The remaining business is largely driven by higher quota share sessions in Q1 2015 on the legacy XL book which generated additional ceding commissions, reducing the net acquisition ratio. Looking forward, we expect this ratio to reduce modestly to be more in line with our experience in Q3 and Q4 2015, as changes in our reinsurance strategy are fully implemented. This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a lower Q1 operating expense ratio of 19.7% which was 1.9 points lower than Q1 2015, and by a lower net accident year ex-cat loss ratio of 61.2% which was 2 points lower than Q1 2015.","Insurance gross premiums written in Q1 increased by 51% or $849 million year-over-year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all four of our underwriting divisions. When we look at both legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was flat in Q1. However, when you also consider the Chilean [ph] activities that started in 2015, whereas mentioned previously decisions were made to exit certain underperforming books, you would see growth in the 3% to 4% range. This underlying growth demonstrates that while the market is difficult, it is not entirely bereft of opportunity.","And while we consider that the dislocation experienced by some competitors should have a positive impact on rates and terms, we saw little evidence of this in the first quarter. Our underwriters will continue to monitor the market closely. And given our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post- the transaction, we're well positioned to execute profitable opportunities when they arise, be that next quarter or next year. This expectation is further underpinned as the market response to XL Catlin continues to be very favorable, as was evidenced repeatedly at this month's 2016 RIMS Conference, as both current and prospective clients were interested in hearing how we could help. For the insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $1 billion.","The ceded premium written line reflects some changes in the way we buy our reinsurance program and the timing of our reinsurance purchasing as we move towards a more integrated, enterprise-wide reinsurance program. In Q1, approximately $100 million of ceded premium written came solely from timing differences. These included consolidation alignment to the grid catastrophe covers at 1-1, bringing forward our Q3 international casualty renewal, and placing the Galileo cat bond which provides cover for three years.","Adjusting for these timing differences, the insurance segment's spend as a proportion of GPW in Q1 2016 was 35.9%, roughly 4.1% less than for the combination of the individual companies in Q1 2015. While the 35.9% is slightly higher than the 34.3% reported in Q1 2015 for legacy XL, we expect this to reduce as the full year unfolds and we fully transition to our integrated reinsurance program, the benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the Group's risk\/return profile, a strong coordination across our wider capital strategy. As Mike has mentioned, it is essential to react to the top-line challenges by carefully managing expenses and we have developed further plans to improve efficiencies during 2016.","We began executing these plans in the quarter by selectively exiting 35 positions as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across divisions and regions. While the expense savings from these actions are not reflected in the quarter, they will begin flowing through in subsequent quarters, along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway. In summary, we have taken the correct action in response to a difficult market. And we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability, continued to grow the book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And we fully expect this to continue, margin expansion remains our first priority.","And now to Greg to discuss reinsurance results.","Greg Hendrick","Thanks, Paul. Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter and provide a summary of the current market conditions. Beginning with the results, the reinsurance segment produced solid underwriting performance, with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 84.3% and an underwriting profit of $119 million, compared with 74.7% and $90 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year. Result for the quarter continued to benefit from favorable prior-year development, lower accident year ex-cat loss ratio and modest catastrophe losses, although to a lesser extent than the prior year. ","Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $32 million compared to $42 million a year ago, lowering the combined ratio by 4.3 and 11.9 points, respectively. In the current quarter, the releases were primarily in the property classes and reflect our harmonized reserve process. Further, our actual versus expected analysis continues to be positive and indicative of a strong reserve position going forward. The reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 52.3% which compares to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease is driven primarily by favorable attritional loss activity in our property treaty business and the impact of a change in business mix resulting from the Catlin acquisition.","The expense ratio increased 1.9 points to 33.8% in the first quarter compared to 31.9% for the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by a purchase accounting adjustment of $7 million or 0.9 points and higher ceding commissions due to the competitive pricing environment, particularly in our short-tail classes. Catastrophe losses totaled $17 million, net of reinstatement premiums, during the quarter, compared to no catastrophe losses in the first quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter related to the Taiwan earthquake and impacted our property catastrophe and property treaty lines of business.","Turning to the top line, gross written premium for the quarter was $1.86 billion, up from $826 million in the first correct 2015, with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. We continue to see very little lost business as a result of the transaction, again, running at less than 1%. In fact, brokers and clients have been very supportive of XL Catlin Re and we're seeing significant new business opportunities as we generated $240 million of new business during the first quarter of 2016. This was offset by continued underwriting discipline as we non-renewed $150 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms and conditions.","On a combined XL Catlin view, after adjusting for foreign exchange, the segment top line was flat in the quarter. Turning to reinsurance market conditions, we found the environment to be challenging, but rate decreases continue to decelerate in most classes and regions. During the quarter, rates for the segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 6% and at a lower rate of change than the prior year. On the remainder of the property treaty portfolio, rates were down 3% and ceding commissions on pro rata treaties increased slightly. ","Our casualty portfolio renewed essentially flat over last year and the remainder of our classes were flat to down low-single-digits. Having just completed the recent April end renewals, rates in Japan were down 7.5% for property catastrophe covers. We observed an increase in client demand and were able to grow our portfolio at this renewal. In summary, the first quarter results were solid for the reinsurance segment. Despite difficult market conditions, our underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline. We're well positioned for continued success as we have the broad support from our clients and brokers.","I will now turn it back to David.","David Radulski","Lori, can you please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.","Kai Pan","So this first, probably for Mike. Mike, it sounds the tone probably changed a little bit, because last few quarter you talked about more emphasis on the retained business, like a loss base of less than 1%.","But now it seems like the competitive environment becoming tougher, you actually want to proactively protect the margin. In some cases, you need to shrink the top-line growth. I just wonder, in the current environment, if you look in aggregate, both at the top line probably under a little bit of pressure, as well as pricing probably limit your ability to improve the margin. Is that conceivable, you can still achieve a double-digit ROE in the near future?","Mike McGavick","First of all, thank you, Kai. The most important thing that I would emphasize is that we have always emphasized the effects of the transaction in terms of lost business as a discrete category. In other words, where we were focused is, was there a market reaction that took business away from us? In other words, somebody feeling that because there was a Catlin line and an XL line previously, that they couldn't support the combination of lines on an account or someone feeling that, because of the transaction, that we were somehow going to become inwardly focused and therefore not someone they wanted to trade with during a period of consolidation and integration. Those were the kinds of things we were worried about.","And overwhelmingly -- and we really knew this and have expressed it to you repeatedly -- by the middle of last year we knew that the market reaction was actually quite positive and going to give us more opportunities, not declining opportunities. And we have continued to monitor that, as Greg just mentioned. It's still true that less than 1% of the premiums in reinsurance have any effect because of the transaction, as was just defined. And I think it will go slightly over 1% because of one program that comes off this year, but it will be right around 1% in insurance as well. So, to me, that is a fantastic endorsement by the market of the combination. That is not the same and we've been very specific about this throughout the last half of last year -- it is not the same as saying and we will keep all of the business at any cost. We have continued to focus on bottom-line underwriting.","And I've mentioned many times that by the middle of last year, we knew very well the book was going to stick together and people were enthusiastic for the combination. And we gave our underwriters, at that point, our usual instruction. The job is to underwrite what we think is a reasonably priced business under appropriate terms and conditions. If we can find it, we won't write it. We also made sure that our underwriters knew they had permission -- as they came to know the books better which they did through the year -- to take larger actions if they felt profitability warranted it.","So we have come off some program business. For example, we've shuttered some operations that we didn't think had the future earnings potential and that is what you are hearing about when we mention the re-underwriting activities. All of that shows up in the way -- particularly in insurance -- the first quarter net earned premium works out. Although, there, you have to add in the impacts that Paul mentioned about the reinsurance programs being in flight in terms of ceded readjustments.","So, this quarter overstates those impacts, but those impacts are in there as well. In terms of going forward, having started this re underwriting back in the middle of last year and seeing it now more fully in swing as we went through the planning process and are executing, we in fact believe that that will be a contributor to being able to expand margins because we believe that's exactly the kinds of actions that are necessary to lower the loss ratio. And of course you know, as Pete mentioned, we're well on track -- ahead, in fact, of the timing -- on seeing the expense reductions come through. And with those two categories in decline and with the acquisition ratio increase, that's what we have to solve for to expand margins. Those have to all add up to, in the end, a lower combined and we're still on track to do so.","In fact, in this quarter, if you took out the one-time noise that was mentioned by Paul on the acquisition ratio, we would have nearly done so just in this quarter alone. Never mind that we know the benefits of those re underwriting actions and the benefits of the expense ratio should show up more prominently in the back half of the year.","Now, I want to caution, though, on that. We're in a very difficult pricing environment, more difficult certainly than we anticipated. And certainly every call I've listen to or read the transcript of this quarter emphasizes the same realization. That will make it more difficult over time to show the margin expansion we plan, but it doesn't mean that we give up or think it's impossible. We certainly have the expense piece in the right place.","And this quarter, at least, is a good indicator on the loss ratio as well. So, with all of that said and with capital actions that we've talked about, do I think it means that in the reasonable future we can't deliver a double-digit ROE? No. I still believe that in a reasonable future that we have the tools to get there. These conditions just make it more difficult. But no, by no means have we walked away from that goal or the belief that that is plausible in the reasonable term.","Kai Pan","And then the follow-up with Greg on the reinsurance segment. Looks like the core loss ratio improved 240 basis points year-over-year. But if you look at sequentially, it's actually up from like a 50.2% in the fourth quarter. And also you mentioned before that -- in supposedly the third quarter and fourth quarter, you have some unusual large losses, including changing in the third quarter and some large losses, about 6 points, in the fourth quarter. I just wondered, is there any unusual items in the 52.3% or it's a good run rate?","Greg Hendrick","I won't comment on whether it's a good run rate. There aren't any unusual losses in that number. That's reflective of what we've just talked about in terms of a competitive environment. And when you have these rate decreases, it will obviously make you pick your non-cat loss ratio higher year-over-year to reflect that slightly deteriorated margin. But there isn't any large loss activity in this quarter.","Kai Pan","And lastly, if I may, just do you have any early reads on the second quarter catastrophes, including earthquakes, as well as Texas events?","Greg Hendrick","Nothing definitive to report, Kai. I'll say, taking Japan first it's incredibly early in the process. Clearly, we and our clients are just getting going on the loss adjusting process. Japan has an added complexity because of the nature of the policies. The personalized policies respond to a percentage of damage rather than a dollar loss amount. The commercial policies don't have a uniform approach to business interruption.","And so there's a lot at play there that makes it very difficult to get to a precise number quickly. But certainly as we have looked at the exposure, we're not concerned by what we see on our books in Japan. Ecuador would be much less. It's a lower industry loss and it's a lower penetration for us.","And I guess the third piece of activity would be on the Texas or Midwest storms that have been going on. They are likely to impact something. But generally on a lot of the covers that are on the large nationals, you are going to see it be well within the retentions of our customers. So, I don't have anything definitive to report, but so far what we see doesn't concern me.","Kai Pan","What about on the primary sites, Paul?","Paul Brand","Yes, it's very modest cat impact for the first quarter, not really expecting very much from Japan at all. And as Greg said, on the Midwest storms -- yes, we would be surprised if we saw a great deal there.","Mike McGavick","And the only caution I would add is we always remember, we have large limits on pinpoint facilities. So we have these kinds of Midwest storms. You can get hit. We don't have anything to report to you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. You may go ahead.","Jay Gelb","The first thing I want to come back to is the ROE target. Understanding that the full benefit of expense savings aren't yet reflected, to get that ROE from 4% annualized this quarter, in a somewhat overall light cat quarter, up to 10% -- I'm still trying to figure out the walk to get there.","Mike McGavick","As I said, you have to have all of the pieces continue to move in the trend they are moving. In other words, you have to have the one-time stuff back out. You have to have the loss ratio continue to improve. You have to have the expense ratio actually come down in the way that we have forecasted it will and you have to manage your capital. You have to do all of those pieces at the same time.","Certainly I'm not uncomfortable with sitting here today and telling you that we can see how that takes place. But we have never given a timing forecast on that and I'm not going to tonight. But I continue to be pleased with the way the book is positioned and the progress on the core elements. I think that the market environment has made it more difficult to write business.","And that has some dampening effect [Technical Difficulty] as you don't write business, you also do what we did this quarter in consideration of a variety of factors, you are able to up your repurchases. So, I haven't at all walked away from what I believe this transaction produces. Not in one bit, Jay.","Pete Porrino","And Jay, this is Pete. Let's make sure we back out the integration costs. I heard you go through the synergies and that kind of stuff. But there's also the integration costs that are in there that have a pretty large drag on ROE that are obviously going to disappear.","Jay Gelb","And then specifically on the insurance segment, the ceded premium ratio was 40% in the first quarter. And I believe the comment was that directionally that that would improve. Would you be able to give us a sense of what you feel the ceded premium ratio might be for the entire year of 2016?","Paul Brand","For the insurance segment, as we say, we think it might improve a little bit. As we normalize for the one-offs, we came down to 34. We may be a high 33 is what our analysis is showing.","Jay Gelb","For the full year?","Paul Brand","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. You may go ahead","Brian Meredith","Couple questions here. The first one, was there any impact of changes in retro buying at all on the reinsurance segment in the quarter?","Greg Hendrick","Yes. Not in the quarter, but as relative to the prior year, we now buy -- as we've talked about a couple of times -- we now buy no specific retro -- particularly on that property cat book, we buy as part of the overall group strategy that Paul is responsible for. We have a couple of remaining covers that we're looking at harmonizing over the next 6 to 12 months. So we get allocations back, Brian, but we don't have specific covers like we used to.","Brian Meredith","Okay, so no one-timers?","Greg Hendrick","No one-timers.","Brian Meredith","And then just quickly on the insurance side also, you mentioned there was some impact on the earned premium in the quarter from the one-timers. What was the impact in the earned premium?","Paul Brand","It's not a huge impact. It's in the sort of $30 million mark on that.","Brian Meredith","So, basically, the $100 million will go through the earned over the course of the year. So, it wasn't like a one-time kit to earn in this quarter?","Paul Brand","No.","Brian Meredith","Okay. All right. Just wanted to understand that. And then one other quick one here. Pete, as far as the rate of expense saves that you all are going to be recognizing here, going forward, it looks like this quarter there was roughly, on a sequential basis, it was about $30 million, $40 million recognized. Is that a good figure to think about your going forward?","Pete Porrino","Yes, Brian. I would say, as we -- it's interesting. We keep talking about the synergies. And more and more, we as a Company are managing a total expense [indiscernible] and doing that in a very holistic basis. But to answer your question directly, yes, that is about sequentially. And again, it's hard to use the synergy number, per se, as we move to managing expenses totally. But it's probably 200-ish, I would say, we're into so far, cumulatively.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead","Josh Shanker","I just wanted to understand a couple things. In the prepared remarks, Mike, you said that you would expect the acquisition ratio on insurance to be elevated, but revert towards where it was in the back half of 2015 towards the end of the year. That's a correct way to understand what you said?","Mike McGavick","I would take it, the back half of the year -- I would take the two quarters and put them together and then look at it.","Josh Shanker","Yes, so there is like, a 13.2 and a 13.9. Should we think about 13.5 as a normalized acquisition cost for the combined Company?","Mike McGavick","I'm obviously avoiding giving you a specific number, but you've got the right exercise in mind. I'm not talking about the trend over the two quarters. I'm talking about the totality of the two quarters.","Josh Shanker","And when you think about -- and no number you don't have to give -- but is that going forward a 17? And that's kind of where the combined acquisition costs will be for these two combined companies, I guess. Is that correct?","Mike McGavick","Certainly for this year. Over time, it remains to be seen because we have some impacts that are a exaggerating that a bit right now, because of the way certain sub-segments are impacted by the competitive environment. So, I'll pick an example. Energy is one that's affected in this space because of the way our reinsurance treaties and everything else. And energy has been one of the most affected down markets in terms of premium, so we're writing a fair amount less. Were we writing what we would ordinarily be writing, this would have had less of an effect.","So, some of it is business mix and there, you just can't predict where the cycles in those sub ones will go which is why I'm not being particularly precise and why I'm not able to forecast beyond the year. As I look at the year, I get a good handle on it. If you get me into next year, depends on what those subcycles are doing and it depends on what we're doing in reaction, because it changes the business mix and drives this number.","Josh Shanker","The other question, there's a lot more information than we probably need in the financials associated with the Life business that's now been sold. Is there any lingering income? And I know there is that's associated with the Life Re transaction that you can quickly point out, a quick way that we can figure out what contribution there was from that?","Mike McGavick","You mean from what's left?","Josh Shanker","From what's left, yes. Is there one number -- it was $4 million.","Pete Porrino","Yes, there is a couple of million dollars and I can take you through the financial supplement. You can actually walk through it. It takes a little while to figure out the geography, but you can actually pretty much figure it out. But Josh, I'll be glad to take you through that.","Josh Shanker","And then without even pointing -- the number for just as a placeholder for me right now is a couple million, yes?","Pete Porrino","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. You may go ahead","Sarah DeWitt","On the investment affiliate earnings, what's the right run rate to think about there? And has that recovered so far in the second quarter?","Pete Porrino","So we've talked, in the past, of something like a 6% to 7% over the cycle type of return. That's what I would encourage you to use, assuming we can figure out the cycle of hedge fund returns. So, that's as good as anything I could give you. It has not recovered yet. We report those numbers on a one-month lag. And from what we saw in March, it was not a spectacular month for hedge funds, either.","Sarah DeWitt","So, assume another loss for the second quarter or just something lower than the 6% to 7%?","Pete Porrino","That will entirely on how the hedge funds do over the next two months. Again, the only thing I would say -- and Mike said it and I said if you look over the last three months, nine months, 12 months, three years, five years or 10 years, we outperformed those indices by hundreds of basis points. And so, we're really proud of that track record. But again, it's a pretty bad tailwind right now. But I can't predict what it's going to do for the rest of the quarter, at least not on the hedge fund affiliates.","Sarah DeWitt","And then, secondly, in the insurance segment, I think historically you were targeting a 90% combined ratio, including cats but excluding reserve releases. Can you just talk about where we're in that plan to get there and how long you think it could take?","Paul Brand","Clearly, as Mike has said and we're making progress on the loss ratio and I would like to expect that to continue. But we do have headwinds from the market which is slowing the progress down, as you can see. The job is to ensure that as we make that progress on both the expense and the OpEx and the loss ratio, that we're getting closer to that goal.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. Do you still have confidence?","Mike McGavick","Sorry, go ahead?","Sarah DeWitt","But you still have confidence in that number?","Mike McGavick","As an over cycle number, yes. But with our concentration in specialty which we're delighted to have, given the different stat -- a couple things about it. Number one, specialty lines require a lot less accepting of non-variable costs in order to sustain yourself through the cycle. So being in specialty gives us the ability to ride out this cycle, keep our teams together, keep our capabilities intact and go forward strongly into the coming change, whenever it happens.","So we like being concentrated in businesses like that, where they don't drag a lot of infrastructure in order to maintain your competitive position. But when you are concentrated in those and they are in the toughest pricing environment many of us can remember, you're going to have difficulty getting to your target combined ratio. But that doesn't mean that over time you aren't making progress, as we're right now. And it doesn't mean that you can't get to those in more appropriate markets. But these markets are making it very, very difficult to make progress.","We believe, as I said, we believe we can. We're continuing to do the things that are necessary. But at the same time, getting to a 90X and then with PYD right now, is just darned tough. We're moving toward it, but it is going to be tough until these markets improve somehow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead","Ryan Tunis","I think my question is going down the same line that Kai, I think, was going down. And just thinking about the overall accident year loss ratio and framing the discussion relative to where we were in 4Q, which was at 4Q, we had the harmonization, we had large losses and I think we even had some true-ups on just the current accident year and we were at a 58.6.","And this quarter, we're at a 58.4 and I think the message was that overall that would come down. And I'm just trying to understand, was it elevated loss activity? Is there seasonality in there? Or is all of what we're looking at, as Mike said, just tougher market conditions? Thanks.","Mike McGavick","So, remember, when you cite the numeric that way, you are including both insurance and reinsurance. Reinsurance is always going to be bumpier. This quarter, we had Taiwan and so on. You're just going to have more noise there. But we focus much more on the insurance accident year loss ratios. That's the one where we keep saying, we think we can continue through mix and re underwriting to expand the margin. And as you saw in this quarter, we're down fully 2 points over a year ago, at the same time.","So, my view is we're doing that job and we can continue to do the job. I see the progress as meaningful. I do give you the caution that these markets make it much more difficult. But I would encourage -- when you focus just on the loss ratios, one of the metrics that we've got to solve for, I'd break them up and think about them that way. And to be blunt, when you are thinking about reinsurance, you always have to be thinking about it on a cat expected basis or else you are fooling yourself about where the reinsurance book is performing.","Ryan Tunis","And just following up then on insurance, I think Paul mentioned the exit from some underperforming books. And I think you said $70 million of premium loss from that. Just looking for maybe a little more color on those underperforming books and also just how we -- to the extent of which we can think about that as a tailwind for the loss ratio on insurance, thinking about the relative profitability of those books versus where you are trying to run in insurance. Thanks.","Mike McGavick","Yes, I'll let Paul give a little more color commentary, but let me just pick on the one that's been the recurring challenge. I think, if I'm not mistaken, across something I participated in at CNA when I was there, something I participated in Safeco when I was there and once at XL and once now at XL Catlin, I can't tell you how much I find it uncomfortable to write anything in the New York contracting space.","So this will be the fourth time I've participated in shutting down New York contracting business. But just as an example, you would have seen -- and it's known in the market -- that XL had taken a run at the surety marketplace over the last five years. We weren't getting the kinds of scale and returns we wanted. We shut down that operation. It was pretty small, but I'll let Paul get into more detail about the characteristics.","Paul Brand","Yes and the one I would add to that is insure [indiscernible] which is a UK motor facility. I'd say those would be the major items in our discontinued operations. And clearly those businesses run at higher loss ratios than the balance of the portfolio. So taking them out absolutely should have a good effect on the lost ratio as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Byrnes from Janney. You may go ahead","Ryan Byrnes","Just wanted to see if we could go over the thought process of adding $250 million to the buyback plan for this year. Just want to see what parts of your plan changed for this year. It looks like obviously the increased sessions in the insurance segment, but just wanted to make sure I fully understood that.","Mike McGavick","I think it's a several-part analysis, always. The first thing we're thinking about is can we -- what are our plans for a premium and how are they jiving with what is available to write at a reasonable rate? And at the start of the year, when we were back in planning, as you're going back into last year, we were not expecting the level of deterioration and the intensifying of competition that we're seeing. So we would have expected to be able to write a bit more at top line.","In fact, Paul referenced it well when he talked about the fact that we're seeing a lot of dislocation. It's not much that's coming at us with terms and conditions that we would be interested in writing. Whether that will change or not, it's very hard to say, because we're fairly early in those processes. So, the first thing you realize is we're not going to be able, through our organic writings, to put as much to work of the capital as we had thought, that the first place you go to.","The second place, then, you go to is, is there any other we could put that money to work for our shareholders? And then finding none, we've always believed that then if we can't put it to good work and it's not necessary for our buffer, then we should do our best to get it back to shareholders. And then of course you also look at the raw economics of such a decision. How do we view where we're trading and what does that tell us about the economics of buybacks? So you take that whole equation together and, as we looked at all those factors, we said this is in fact -- not only does it indicate we will need to hold less capital for the year, relative to our buffers and relative to our planned writings and not only did we find where we were trading attractive relative to our tangible book value, in our book value. Not only all those things where true, but we just said, gee, we should do it in the first part of the year rather than just spreading it across the year and then react to market conditions later.","So, kind of as a base line, you should forecast four equal installments of the $700 million. But then we decided to the first half of the year that to go after $250 million more, giving you a total for the year of $950 million. And as I said, we will continue to evaluate our needs and market conditions and these trends. And whether we will do more or not, is for future decisions. ","Pete Porrino","The only other thing I would add is we had a strategy for a few years here now trying to be consistent around buybacks. And we have signaled those well in advance. I do think that we're looking now at being a little more opportunistic. And so, when it looks like the right time, you will probably see us be a little bit more real-time management than we had in the past.","Ryan Byrnes","Okay. And then just one follow-up to that is what -- which metric or which book value do you guys look at most? Is it tangible, ex-AOCI or stated? Is there any one that you guys look at the most?","Pete Porrino","Ryan, our math here, we probably have six or seven different metrics that we look like. Both of those would be in there. A lot has to do with our expectation as to what our earnings engine looks like and what we think our returns are going to be and looking and doing that calculation. From what do you look at? Yes, we look at tangible book. We look at stated book. I have historically probably looked at tangible book a little bit more. But these days, there's a lot of conversations going around the value of looking at just plain book value. So, I can't point to any one, per se. I'd say we do, again, five or six. But we really look at it from a return point of view. We do look at an IRR on it.","Mike McGavick","And actually let me add, just as a matter of clarity, these are management recommendations to the Board. These decisions are not made solo.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead","Jay Cohen","I'm not sure if you mentioned it yet, but can you talk about your estimate for what the integration expenses are going to be in 2Q?","Pete Porrino","Jay, it's Pete. That we haven't done that yet. What we did this quarter, we're planning on doing again next quarter which is sort of at the end of the quarter, we will go and publish a -- I'll call it a hard estimate, rather than giving you a ballpark now and then having to adjust it later on in the quarter.","Jay Cohen","Is it reasonable to expect, directionally, that it would go down from the first quarter?","Mike McGavick","So that it's in advance of your model running, rather than after.","Jay Cohen","I'm sorry, is it reasonable to expect it might go down from the first quarter?","Pete Porrino","I would say, at this point, maybe a little.","Jay Cohen","Okay.","Pete Porrino","Look, it is going to start to trail off.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. You may go ahead","Meyer Shields","Mike, you gave some, I think pretty helpful guidance on the acquisition expense ratio. When we look at the dollars of operating expenses in the individual segments, is there any reason that first quarter numbers would be lower than a typical quarterly run rate?","Mike McGavick","In terms of the expense run rate?","Meyer Shields","The operating expense in each of the two segments.","Pete Porrino","What I'd say is -- and I wouldn't look at the individual segments. What we do, we manage expenses overall. Obviously Paul and Greg manage theirs and then we manage the rest of the Corporation, including all the functions. And then we go through a pretty rigorous allocation process.","What I would say is, in the first quarter, there would be maybe a little bit of benefit that was taken because of some accruals that were up at the end of the year, that ended up not being needed. But they were really around the margins more than anything else. You saw corporate expenses drop pretty precipitously. That probably is a timing more than anything else. It will drop and it will drop significantly, probably not quite to the level that it went down. But nothing specific for insurance or reinsurance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. You may go ahead","Ian Gutterman","Mike, forgive me if I'm going to be a little argumentative here. But I guess I'm a little surprised that you opened the call saying you thought these were good underlying results when you missed Street significantly. And it wasn't just affiliates or the acquisition costs, the core loss ratio was also below Street and some of the other items as well. ","And when I look at the 12 months, basically the combined ratio since the deal happened, it's around 93. And that's with low cats. And maybe if I normalize that, it is more of a mid-90s. And to get to a double-digit ROE, you need to get closer to 90. So can you help us understand how we're getting those high points? Because I think the reason this question keeps coming up is a lot of people are struggling to see how the improvement comes, given the pace I think has been slower than people anticipated.","Mike McGavick","Ian, first of all, I don't find that argumentative and I appreciate the question. We continue to see the progress coming in. We continue to see the expense ratio dropping and we expect it to continue to drop. We continue to see the loss ratio dropping. And though I've been cautious to note the conditions out there, but we believe and have shown in this quarter, that we can continue to bring it down.","We think with this quarter, we show, as we've seen a couple of times in recent quarters, some unusual activity that is one-time and related to the way the books are coming together. Whether it's the way we're putting our ceded reprogram together which we believe will be meaningfully beneficial over the course of the year, but it did have some unusual effects in the period.","So, when we back out those unusual effects and we look at the progress that we're making, we add all that up and say, we believe we can get to the levels of return that we have planned. And there's nothing that has happened, outside of market conditions being more difficult, that has shaken us from that belief. That could change the pace some. It could change how you have to drive it some, but it doesn't change our fundamental belief that we can get this Company to those kinds of results. And I would just point out, across reinsurance and specialty, we're certainly in incredibly difficult conditions.","And if we're able to produce these results with all that noise in this period, I like our chances as we get further into the year. But a lot of that will depend on things beyond our control. But the things we're controlling, we're very pleased with the job we're doing. So that's what I'm talking about, Ian and that continues to please me. And I'm particularly pleased that our underwriters have kept their wits about them. In an environment like this, where conditions are very difficult, you always worry how underwriters on the frontline will respond to the challenging conditions they face.","And I'm simply very pleased with the quality of our underwriting behavior and the way in which that will produce results now and well into the future. And we certainly see organizations or underwriters that are not maintaining their discipline. And while that makes it challenging for now, that makes our relative performance position all that much better over time.","Ian Gutterman","Just to follow up on that, I understand what you're saying but when you're saying not much has changed as far as where things ultimately come out, I'm looking at it. Your comments earlier about not having given an expectation in the past about the double-digit ROE and using the term in the reasonable future. Mike, I'm looking at the transcript from last May when you guys did the call post-close and you said you expected double-digit ROE, ex-AOCI, in 2016. So, you have said it before and now you're not willing to say it. So it seems like something has changed.","Mike McGavick","Well, as I said, market conditions are more difficult, Ian. And I've said that throughout this call and we've been saying that for a couple of quarters. So that piece will affect the pace. But I see double-digit ROEs as plausible, given the progress we're making. Obviously with this start to this year, it would be pretty unlikely for me to forecast it for this year. But I continue to see it -- I've said it, Ian and I believe it.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. Just the last thing I would say is, I would just urge you guys to find a way to maybe educate us more on how we get there. Again, I know we've talked about some of the stuff before, at least Pete and I have. But the synergies are really impossible for investors to track. We can't see them in the financial statements, so we don't really know where the progress is. If there were ways you can give more firm numbers around things like mix change and things like that -- it is very hard to model, still, even at year-end and to really be able to sort of assess where you are versus where you started.","We've seen the expense synergy goal go up which is a positive. But you know what I mean? We can't really see evidence of that in the income statement, per se, because there are so many other adjustments. I know a lot of companies, when they do deals, give disclosures on specifics of where the benefits come from. I think something like that would help a lot.","Pete Porrino","If we just spend a minute on the synergy because I did make a comment earlier about how we're managing the Company, so we had, net of integration expenses, $460 million this quarter. And last quarter, we had $490 million. You take those two, you average them, you multiply it by two for a full year, you are at about $1.9 billion. When we were on the call when we first did the deal, we said use $2.3 billion as the starting point.","Now, we have a little bit of FX benefit there which is way more than offset by what you would have had for expected wage inflation over that period. And so, when I look at it right now, to be honest, we're past the $300 million. And so, we can get more granular on the synergies. Maybe we need another conversation about expense levels and where they can go. But I think that actually might be a more fruitful conversation than a focus on the synergies. When you run the numbers and this is not a surprise to anybody, because of where you all think we're going to come out on the expenses. Everyone has modeled more than $300 million already in there.","Ian Gutterman","Right. No, fair enough. I guess that's the thing, right? I mean, I can argue the other side of that, is if the $300 million is already in there, then to get from, say, a normal -- again, I'm spitballing this, but with normal cats at 95, down to a 90 is almost all loss ratio and acquisition ratio from here. So, that makes it look tougher if most of the expense ratio benefit is already in there, the operating expense ratio benefit is already in there. And so that's why I think it would be helpful if we can try to split the pieces out so people don't jump to the wrong conclusions on some of this stuff.","Pete Porrino","And I take your comments, as I always do with appreciation, because you are very thoughtful about them. I did not mean to signal that we're done with the -- that we're done with expenses continuing to have the benefit of the transaction. In fact, we said earlier that we expect the ratios to continue to go down and that is in a very difficult insurance market where you're not going to be growing rapidly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Sterne Agee. You may go ahead","Vinay Misquith","So just two quick questions. One is on the accident year loss ratio, ex-cat, in the primary insurance business. They were 61.2 this quarter. Curious as to whether the benefits of the reinsurance savings and the claims and management expenses has flown through. And do you expect to have a lower loss ratio in the next few quarters?","Paul Brand","We're obviously working to try and move the loss ratio down. And there's a number of actions, largely the re underwriting and tuning actions that we've talked about, but also we would expect some reinsurance benefits with that, too.","Vinay Misquith","So, should that raise the loss ratio going forward?","David Radulski","Vinay, could you repeat that?","Vinay Misquith","So, should that -- really is the loss ratio going forward.","Paul Brand","Yes, that is our expectation. Yes.","Vinay Misquith","And second, Mike, if you could talk a little bit about moving business from Lloyds' paper onto XL's paper -- what do you think is the opportunity and how soon do you think you could get there?","Mike McGavick","We have already had some movements between the two platforms. We've been able to take some business off of Lloyds and put it into our retail operations. That's been a positive, because of course if you can write it on that basis, at the same loss ratios, you are getting an expense uplift.","We've also seen some business transfer to Lloyds or increase at Lloyds where we've been able to round out, for example, in reinsurance or other programs where we've been able to use the Lloyds platform as a better additive for those clients that wanted more exposure to us, but didn't want it on any one balance sheet. So we've had some ins and some outs on Lloyds. All I can say is we're going to continue to optimize it. And I think there will be more opportunity over time to see a greater shift in the primary book to retail operations.","Vinay Misquith","Well, then shouldn't we have seen a benefit on the expense ratio? And we haven't really seen that, so I'm just wondering where the missing numbers are.","Mike McGavick","No, the amount of movement wouldn't be great enough that it would be larger an impact that the synergy benefits that you are seeing so pronounced. They'd just be in there somewhere. It wouldn't be a discrete thing that I would think would -- you would locate.","Vinay Misquith","Sure. And do you think, in the future, that number will be meaningful for us?","Mike McGavick","I think it's too early to tell. We're still driving those two themes and how those two themes play out over time. I would think it's a little early to tell whether that will be a big number or a number that has to be taken in its totality. It's like much of the conversation tonight which I think has been at the right level. It's not how any one of these levers moves, it's how they all move together and that's the job ahead and that's certainly the way we view the job. It's not one lever, it's how the levers cumulatively add up.","David Radulski","Any more questions in the queue? If not, then we'll turn it back to Mike for a closing comment.","Mike McGavick","Yes, this is Mike. Thank you again. We appreciate, as always, your time and your thoughtfulness. And we don't mind at all -- you've been very kind in your questions and pointed where necessary. We understand what we're hearing, but we also know what we think we can do. And we're going continue to work toward that objective with the kind of ambition that we've always had.","And in the end, no one company makes a market, markets are big things, but there's a lot we can that is within our control and we're acting on it every day. Thank you very much and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.","David Radulski","And that closes our call and you can disconnect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",""],"22713":["XL Group (NYSE:XL) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 29, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David R.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations.","David R. Radulski","Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement.","On our call this evening, you'll hear from Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions. Among those also available for questions are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer; and Stephen Robb, our Controller.","Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Michael S. McGavick","Good evening, and thank you for joining XL's second quarter 2013 earnings call. As you would have seen in our prerelease, XL's results for the second quarter, like those of many of our peers, were significantly impacted by natural catastrophes. This comes after our sector had enjoyed the benefits of relatively low CAT losses in the first quarter, yet we feel the same about each the first and the second quarter. Setting aside the level of CAT losses, we have maintained our focus on strengthening the quality of our underwriting businesses and enhancing our already strong leadership and we are excited with our progress as it is demonstrated when one looks at the first half of 2013 in its entirety.","Year-to-date, our all-in combined ratio was 90.8% versus 93% for the first half of 2012. Our combined ratio for the second quarter was 93.8%. Ex-CAT, this was a 92.7%. Again, an improvement over the 93.7% ex-CAT combined ratio for the second quarter a year ago. As regards the second quarter, it includes 3 positive results, one that moves sideways and one that was, at least on the surface, negative.","On the positive side, first is the fact that we had strong contributions from favorable prior year development of $119 million, a nice affirmation of the strength and prudence of our reserving process. Second, our income from investment affiliates was $74 million in the quarter versus just $17 million in the same quarter a year ago. And third, the pricing trends and insurance continue to be positive and we have seen positive rate in 19 of 22 of our insurance businesses. Those are the 3 things that went well.","As for a result that was more sideways, that would be this quarter's action ex-CAT combined ratio insurance. While it improved by 1.5 points versus the second quarter last year, it did not stay at the very healthy levels of the first quarter. We are unconcerned. As we near the goal of running a 90% combined, we would expect it to not always be improving but to bounce around some, and this was such a quarter. At the same time, we were able to grow insurance premiums written in the first half of the year by 12.2%, even as we chose to write 3.8% less premium in reinsurance, and the underlying trends in our books leave us convinced that we will continue to see the improvements towards our goals.","Rising interest rates, on the surface, provided our negative result. In the second quarter, they had a predictably significant impact on our mark-to-market losses, and our book value per share on a fully diluted basis decreased $1.59 in the quarter and $0.86 for the year-to-date. We have long been in a defensive position with regard to interest rates, and while timing and the degree of movement cannot be predicted, we have been expecting an upward move. And everyone on this call knows there are also some very positive benefits to rising interest rates, that is why I call this only a negative on the surface.","This interest rate volatility is why we regularly refer to our operating ROE excluding unrealized gains and losses. On that basis, our operating ROE was an annualized 9.7% in the second quarter and an 11% for the year-to-date.","So while in aggregate, we feel very good about the first half of 2013, a quarter like the second quarter reminds us we must continue to improve to reach the goals we have shared with you, and we intend to retain our focus on daily execution.","I have 2 other issues I would like to briefly comment on before turning it over to Pete. First, as you all know, there are public reports that XL is involved in the insurance coverage of the tragic train accident in Canada. You may have questions on this topic but I must emphasize that we cannot comment on this ongoing situation. And lastly, just in the days leading up to this call, we concluded the establishment of a new Bermuda-based company formed in partnership with a private equity firm Stone Point Capital focused on marrying our exceptional underwriters with third-party capital, where appropriate. We are delighted to announce this new venture and to partner with Stone Point. They have a fantastic track record of investment in the insurance and reinsurance sector, and this initiative aligns perfectly with XL's continued objective to offer innovative solutions for our clients.","With that, I will turn it over to Pete.","Peter R. Porrino","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating net income for the second quarter was $222 million or $0.75 a share on a fully diluted basis, which is the same operating income level as in 2012, but then it represented only $0.71 per share. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $273 million or $0.93 per share.","Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 93.8% or 3 points higher than the same quarter last year, while our accident year combined ratio was 101.8%, higher by 3.8 points. These increases were due to higher natural catastrophe losses in the quarter, which included flooding in Europe, Argentina and Canada, and tornadoes and hailstorms in the United States. As we previously announced for the quarter, our natural catastrophe losses totaled $134 million or 9.3 loss ratio points, which was split approximately $76 million and $58 million between our Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2012 totaled $61 million or 4.2 loss ratio points. Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $119 million or 8 loss ratio points compared to $101 million or 7 loss ratio points for Q2 2012. This reflects favorable development of $49 million and $70 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively.","As you are aware, the second quarter is a significant reserve valuation quarter for us, and as a result, we have reacted appropriately to any development indications identified during our in-depth review.","Positive movements came from specialty insurance lines, as well as casualty reinsurance, and to a lesser extent, property reinsurance lines, partially offset by some strengthening in insurance international professional and certain discontinued lines of business. Our operating expenses were marginally higher than the prior year quarter and in the first quarter of 2013, largely due to added headcount from an expansion in the underlying business, partially offset by ongoing efficiency efforts. As we have indicated in the past, we continue to expect that overall operating expense levels for 2013 will be modestly higher than 2012, but at levels which will show continued improvement in overall operating leverage.","Turning to our investment portfolio. As a result of increasing interest rates in our key currency jurisdictions late in the quarter, our Investment Portfolio had a negative mark-to-market of $669 million for the quarter, which resulted in a negative total return of 1.6% in the quarter. Unrealized net gains in the portfolio was $686 million at the end of the second quarter. Net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was $162 million compared to $188 million in the same quarter last year, due primarily to lower reinvestment rates over the last 12 months. The P&C gross book yield at the end of June was 2.7%.","We estimate that approximately $3.3 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 2.9% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months compared to the average new money rate in Q2 on our P&C portfolio of 1.6%. As a result, net investment income remains under pressure although current new money yields are generally up 30 to 50 basis points over what we achieved in Q2, which will help alleviate some of that gap if they are sustained.","As Mike mentioned, our net income from investment affiliates was a very strong $74 million, up $57 million in the prior year quarter. As you know, these results can be volatile but this quarter we saw good returns in all 3 investment affiliate classes, alternatives, private investments and our investment manager affiliates. As a reminder, we report these items on either a 1 or 3-month lag basis.","Our portfolio composition has not changed significantly. Our P&C fixed income duration increased by 0.3 years to 3.7 years. This increase was largely caused by the impact of higher rates late in the quarter on our Agency MBS portfolio.","We also added a small amount of duration at the end of the quarter to take advantage of the back up in rates that occurred. Another notable action was the sale of almost 1\/3 of our legacy Non-Agency RMBS portfolio in May, which resulted in $17 million of realized gains.","With respect to capital management, we continue to execute on our share buyback program, and during the second quarter, we purchased 4.8 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $30.97 per share, leaving $575 million available for purchase under our previously announced $850 million share buyback program.","While for the year-to-date, we have seen a significant increase in our share price, we continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool.","As we announced earlier in the quarter, we continue to focus on talent development with the addition of Phil Jacobs to our finance leadership team. I've known Phil for over 25 years and he brings with him a wealth of experience from companies including Barclays and AIG, and we look forward to him joining us next month.","I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Steve, and good evening. Tonight, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide some comments on our semiannual reserve review, give an update on talent and finish with remarks on current market conditions.","Beginning with the results, the Insurance segment combined ratio for the quarter was 99.6%, 0.5 points worse than the same quarter last year, driven largely by CATs and partially offset by slight improvements in our accident year loss ratio. On an accident quarter basis, excluding CATs, our combined ratio of 97% improved by 1.5 points compared to prior year, driven largely by improved operating leverage. Our year-to-date accident year combined ratio ex-CAT of 95.2% reflects a 6.4 point improvement over the first half of 2012.","The accident quarter loss ratio ex-CAT was 65.5% for the quarter, or just 0.3 points better than prior year quarter. While I'm unsatisfied with the 2.3 point deterioration in our accident quarter, ex-CAT loss ratio relative to our first quarter results, as I've said in the past, we believe it best to look at results over a period longer than 1 quarter, given we are in a large corporate risk business with inherent volatility. We remain confident about our progress, given our year-to-date accident year loss ratio ex-CAT was 64.4%, a 4.1 point improvement over the same period in 2012. This improvement was driven by better loss and experience in our international property book where underwriting actions have contributed to a full year without a large non-CAT loss in our Marine business. We also benefited from reduced loss ratio within several of our lines, reflecting implementation of various underwriting actions.","Briefly on CAT losses in the quarter. As Steve mentioned, although the segment incurred $76 million, we performed well relative to market losses as several of our underwriting actions such as tighter flood supplements and the use of facultative reinsurance reduced our overall loss exposure as intended. Insurance gross written premiums grew by $154 million or 11.7% in the quarter after adjusting for foreign exchange movement. We continue to achieve growth in both our mature and new businesses. Our international property North American Construction and U.S. risk management business experienced the largest percentage growth, with the U.S. risk management business benefiting from the addition of several key new clients this quarter.","Meaningful rate increases across nearly all of our 22 businesses also contributed to the growth. And during the quarter, we renewed our core professional, property and casualty treaties, notably converting the professional treaty to a quota share from an excessive loss. On all 3 placements, we were able to achieve an improved economic result for XL.","Shifting to loss reserves. We completed our reserve review in the second quarter based on experience of the first quarter of 2013. Overall, this resulted in a prior year reserve lease of $48 million compared to $43 million in the second quarter of 2012. Releases in our aerospace, Bermuda Professional and North American Excess Casualty books were partially offset by strength in our International Professional portfolio and a flat result for our U.S. Professional portfolio, which has been a strong contributor start with a positive PYD.","Within the U.S. Professional business, we are seeing a security -- that as securities class action lawsuit continue to slow, regulatory investigations and M&A-related losses have picked up. These types of claims tend to incur with a higher frequency, have a lower severity and develop at a faster pace. Being one of the lead primary carriers in the U.S. professional market, XL has been working with clients to structure programs to appropriately ensure these increasing risks since the end of last year. Even with this recent shift, we continue to be very pleased with the stellar performance of this portfolio.","The adverse development in our international professional book is related to our small solicitors business. Loss frequency has increased over the last few years, and with market competition heating up, some of it with unrated insurance carriers, we simply are not able to obtain the necessary rate increases to make this book profitable. We are in the process of reducing this book by 75% from a peak volume of $80 million, effectively returning only those accounts -- retaining only those accounts that we can underwrite at or above our target return.","Moving onto talent. We continue to strengthen our teams throughout the segment. In addition to Andy Pinkes who joined as Global Head of Claims in May, we recruited Luiz [indiscernible] to lead our International Professional Group. Luiz starts in September. And we added Renato Rodr\u00edgues as country manager in Brazil, supporting our expansion strategy in Latin America.","We began underwriting our new crisis management business this quarter after successfully adding 13 new hires to the team. In addition to adding talent from outside the firm, we continue to develop talent from within, promoting Kadidja Sinz to lead our Continental Europe Distribution and Network team.","Finally, turning to recent market conditions. The second quarter was a further continuation of what we've been seeing for the past several quarters, with positive pricing trends outpacing claim trends in most of our businesses and an overall segment rate increase of 3%. Once again, nearly all businesses achieved positive rate in the quarter, on top of rate achieved in the second quarter of 2012.","In the second quarter, our global professional book showed the most strength with rate increases of over 4%, and more than 5% in our U.S. professional portfolio. Our North American P&C businesses had another solid quarter with rate increases of 4%, led by our U.S. risk management and excess casualty businesses. Our International P&C business, which has a lower volume in the second quarter, and our specialty business, both had rate increases of 1%, impacted by the competitive market conditions in our primary casualty and aviation businesses, respectively.","While rate increases are broad-based and 1.5 points over loss trend on a year-to-date basis, we have seen a minor slowing in short-tail lines, particularly in North America. Long-tail rates were generally stable to accelerating this quarter as the economic reality of low investment returns continues to be a positive factor. Attaining price change over loss trends is only one important component of our portfolio management strategy. Optimizing mix and developing appropriate underwriting actions are equally important activities in achieving our return objectives.","Analyzing most of our businesses on a quarterly basis yields small data sets, and as a result, we do expect some volatility in our results from quarter-to-quarter. That said, our 2013 half year results continue to reflect the improvements that have been made in our underwriting over the past 2 years, and we remain confident in reaching our longer-term goals of combined ratio of 90% or better. From where we stand, it's clearly obtainable, given our determination to maintain our underwriting diligence.","And now, to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.","James H. Veghte","Thanks, Greg, and good evening. The Reinsurance segment had a solid quarter of underwriting results with a combined ratio of 79.7%, producing an underwriting profit of $87 million. These results were impacted by prior year reserve releases of $70 million, and catastrophe losses in the quarter of $58 million, net of reinstatement premiums. The headline industry event in the quarter were the European floods, which generated $44 million of this CAT activity, a number well within our expectations for an industry event of this magnitude.","Excluding the impact of these items, our combined ratio was 82%, which compares favorably to the 83.2% in the second quarter of 2012 on the same basis. During the quarter, $25 million of the prior year releases were from short-tail lines, $45 million were from long-tail lines, and of these, $35 million were from North American lines, where we performed our semiannual major reserve review. We remain very cautious on recent underwriting years and the majority of releases from North American long-tail lines were from the 2006 and prior underwriting years.","On a year-to-date basis, the segment has produced a combined ratio of 77.3%, virtually the same result as the 77.4% in 2012. Excluding the impact of CAT losses and prior year releases, the 6 months combined of 80.9% compares favorably to the 85.9% in 2012.","With respect to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $472 million, a 4.4% increase from the second quarter of 2012. There were 2 sources of growth during the quarter. First, $9 million in growth from the property CAT line was driven by increased reinstatement premium and select new business opportunities. In addition, our other category grew by over $25 million. This included $17 million of new business opportunities in our Bermuda specialty account portfolio and $4 million of adjustments from business attaching in prior periods.","Turning to market conditions. The mid-year CAT renewals in the U.S. have generated considerable commentary around the industry. With abundant capital supplies from both traditional and nontraditional sources chasing the business, particularly the Florida-domicile specialist companies, the pricing pressure was significant. On a risk-adjusted basis, pricing was off 15% to 20%.","You will be aware we have a consistent and long-standing method of measuring rate adequacy. Going into this renewal, this portfolio had a very solid adequacy level, and notwithstanding the price reductions, still measures acceptably on our scale. Therefore, we actually grew our book slightly with our Florida-generated direct CAT premium increasing by $3 million. Prior to the renewal season, we targeted a limited number of clients to grow and were successful in doing so.","In addition, we have traditionally found rate adequacy levels to be more attractive at the higher end of these programs, and the greatest pressure on pricing was at these higher attachment levels. We chose to rebalance the portfolio slightly with more capacity deployed at lower attachment levels as the rate adequacy differential tightened. So all in, we modestly grew our aggregates and our premium based on targeted client expansion and rebalancing the book. While we would have preferred a less competitive renewal, we are satisfied we have a balanced, solidly price portfolio in the region.","On the long-tail side, our position remains cautious as we continue to navigate through an improving but still competitive primary market and the reinsurance market that seems intense on forfeiting the gains derived from primary pricing by granting improved terms and conditions, particularly on proportional placements.","So overall, we had an excellent quarter on a calendar year basis and an accident year result that was heavily impacted by the European flood, and to a lesser degree, the flood losses in Canada and the U.S. tornadoes. We firmly believe we will continue to lever one of the best underwriting teams in the world into attractive returns to our shareholders in challenging market conditions.","With that, I will turn things back to David for Q&A.","David R. Radulski","Shirley, can you please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mike, I know you mentioned that you can't comment on the Canadian situation. I'm not asking you specifically about that one, but I'm wondering if you could tell us what a typical limit is for a large property placement for the company and what you typically retain, if there is a number that is typical for you?","Michael S. McGavick","Jay, first, I really appreciate the sensitive way you've formulated your question. We have given that some thought, and Greg has some information for you.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure. Jay, on our North American rail liability portfolio, it's underwritten in our E&S and our Excess Casualty businesses. We've got experienced rail underwriters in both those organizations and they adhere to strict risk aggregation limits to control our exposures. To your direct question, our average line on short line railroads across the 2 portfolios is $32 million gross, and $19 million net. That's really all I can give you at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","For the underlying combined ratio in the Insurance segment, it's clear that, that moved up from the first quarter. I'm wondering if there are any large non-CAT losses in there versus perhaps an absence in the first quarter?","Gregory S. Hendrick","It's Greg, Jay. There's nothing -- let me give you a little color. The movement of the loss ratio, which is the main piece, the expense part of it is about 1.2%, it's a lot of little moving pieces back-and-forth, generally comp-driven, related to, as Pete noted, about of growth in our talent. On the loss ratio side, we've had slightly higher lost dollars from modest losses. Nothing in the large loss category but from modest losses, and we've got an earn-out going on of some previous underwriting action which is a benefit, but the main driver is higher accident year loss ratio picks across a few lines of business. These changes are mostly based on updated views flowing from our kind of semiannual reserve review and they reflect 2 quarters of impact. In rough numbers, there's a 2% deterioration in the quarter and 1% deterioration on a 2013 year-to-date basis.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it essentially reflects increased conservatism on most recent accident years?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, Jay, that's a good way to think about it. It's reacting to more data, but I don't think about it quite so much as 1 quarter going higher. What I really think about is that probably the first year -- in the first quarter, some of it was too optimistic, and with more information, we have a more balanced view. I think that's the more appropriate way to look at it. So I'm very comfortable with where these loss ratios are. They continue to indicate progress over where we stood last year, and we believe we can continue to expand margins.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. Next question is on the unrealized investment gains. The AOCI in the quarter was -- it's half of what it was 3 months ago, obviously reflecting the rise in rates. I'm just wondering, does that affect your view on excess capital position at all?","Peter R. Porrino","Jay, it's Pete. The short answer would be no. So when we think about our capital, our excess capital, as we do with a lot of things that we've talked about, we look at that on an economic capital basis much more than an accounting basis. We've talked about in the past about also looking at rating agency capital, right? And when we look at that stuff, we've always viewed these positive marks as potentially temporary, right, so we've never taken the benefit for them, right, and so they get cut in half, we don't -- there's no real adjustment to make when they come down either.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just accounting, not economic.","Peter R. Porrino","Right.","Michael S. McGavick","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on the Reinsurance segment, just a little bit surprised that property CAT premiums are higher. Would it be fair to assume that because you guys went lower down in the risks -- I mean, lower down in the TARs, that the dollar sort of premiums were higher, so that's skewing the year over result in property CAT for Florida?","Gregory S. Hendrick","There's 2 components of the $9 million increase in property tax. $7 million was from reinstatement premiums. We obviously had elevated CAT activity in the quarter. And as I mentioned we did increase our lines in Florida. But remember, as I think we've mentioned in prior quarters, we don't depend heavily on Florida as a source of our CAT business. So we started with $33 million and ended with roughly $36.5 million.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's fair. The second question was on the status of maybe a sale of the Life Reinsurance segment. If you've seen another life property that's been recently sold and interest rates are higher. So any update on that would be helpful?","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike. As we continue to work along the marketplace, in some ways, you could say it's more favorable but at this point, for our particular book of business, there's nothing to announce at all.","Peter R. Porrino","This is Pete, the only thing I'd add is spread narrowing are more beneficial than just risk fees [ph] going the right direction as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In regards to the insurance-linked securities venture with Stone Point, do you guys envision packaging non-property catastrophe risks into the fund, such as casualty and maybe you could elaborate on when you expect the business to be written and\/or the geographies?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes. I think you can expect that some of the preliminary focus will be on some of the lines that we've seen more traditionally associated with these activities but we do not have a limited vision for that business. We believe that there's a lot of opportunity for innovation in marrying our great underwriting talent and additional capital, and we think that our shareholders can get a good reward from that process. In terms of timing, you'll see the real focus is getting the business up and operational and involved in the 1 1 renewal cycle coming this year.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Separate question on ceding levels. In the past, XL has talked about getting operating leverage. Would potentially keeping more primary insurance and ceding less given the favorable reinsurance market conditions be a strategy?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Well, no. Mike, as I touched upon in my comments, we're seeing what Jamie alluded to, which is we're reaping the benefit of the enhanced structures that are available. Just to give you a little color around -- a little more color on what I was referring to in my comments. We renewed our property per risk, our property CAT, our Casualty and our Professional treaties. On the property side, it's a pretty easy story. The volume of premium going in and out has not changed year-over-year. It's really a case of buying lower down, rounding out some coverage, lower down and having more exposures as we grow, going into the treaty. So you get a pick up there. Clearly, that's an economic pickup. You won't get that gain if there is no CAT losses over the next treaty year. On the Casualty North American quota share, and the Professional quota share, we are going to cede -- it is a lot of moving parts in here but just under $100 million more premium and an enhanced ceding commission on the North American Casualty side. And for the Professional side, we're converting from an excess of loss to a quota share. So on the margin, that's a little bit more than the current run rate but we just are picking up on what we're seeing on the reinsurance marketplace as Jamie alluded to earlier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up, during an earlier question, you said that you might have been too optimistic about your first quarter loss picks, I'm wondering just how -- is there favorable development on current accident year in the second quarter numbers?","Michael S. McGavick","Exactly. Again, as the year unfolds and you start to see the real loss activity, you adjust your pick for the year to reflect the trends you're seeing. So more data gives us more information. But again, what I'm emphasizing is that this has been evolving over the 6 months, not just in the last 3 months. And it was immature to react to in the first quarter, and we do our deep dive in the second. So what you're seeing is the impact of all that. The good news about it though is, again, as I look at it, the overall book continues to improve compared to where it was last year. And while the trajectory may not be at the same rate as we saw in the first quarter, we're very pleased with the progress and think it continues.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Does that mean there's unfavorable development in the tail end of 2012 coming through?","Michael S. McGavick","Again, we're reacting to loss patterns as they emerge, we're not talking about unfavorable development on the book. This hasn't been a -- losses that have somehow evolved unfavorably.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes. Some of it, if I could try -- the deterioration that we saw in some of these lines of business in a number of accident years, say, '09, '12, and that in some instance informs your view going forward. And so in learning about the 6-month reserve development of the prior year, that impacts your view of how optimistic or not you want to be on the accident year going forward in '13. So it's not -- it's an interaction of those 2 pieces is the main driver of the information we learned during the quarter of what pushed us out.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So as we're trying to think about the rate increases that you're getting in excess of loss cost trend into future quarters, the question I am trying to figure out is does this recent development cause you to be more conservative in how you think your future quarters loss picks will be or did you -- or I'm saying, did you nip a few things in the bud that were irritants and now the progress will continue when we think about the future?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, I think, it was more as you said it in the last half of your sentence than the first. And in particular, in the second quarter, you're going to get not only the effect of what we're picking for the rest of the year based on this additional information but you are going to get a little bit of a negative catch-up effect as we apply it to the first quarter as well. So the way I would think about it is that the first quarter probably looked better than it was and because of the catch-up, the second quarter looks slightly worse than it is. But in total, again -- and you have to remember, when we're doing this, we're dealing with large accounts with high volatility and fairly small data sets so we have to have a very long view, and that's why we always emphasize looking at this on a 1 quarter is not how we think and not the right way to do it and not how our mechanics work. Looking at it over time, it is the right way. And that's why as we look at it over time, we're very pleased with the continuing progress.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And unrelated, the rising interest rates, does that give you a potential opportunity to revisit the potential sale of the life reinsurance business?","Peter R. Porrino","Josh, it's Pete. I mean, we're always looking at that. So I wouldn't say it gives us a chance to revisit it, we're constantly looking at that would be my first comment. The second one, as I said a little earlier, the risk-free rates, move up of the rates are probably meaningful than a drop in the spread, which we have not seen yet. But that would be a bigger driver towards what we would see a more value-driven sale. So we look at it all the time, and 2, the move up is really not going to be a driver.","Michael S. McGavick","And I would only offer 1 other point of emphasis and that is that we remain focused on it in an economic way, I mean, we're focused not on all the different accounting elements, we're focused on the economics of it, and we have a business that's in a run-on -- runoff that is performing according to expectations. We don't feel any sense of pressure on this, we just realized that if there were a better owner, we'd be happy to work something out but at this point, we're the best owner.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of quick questions here. First, Pete, I'm just curious, the decline in investment income this quarter seemed a little more than I had expected. Was any of that due to the sale of the RMBS securities just having a higher investment yield? Is that something we may see going forward also when you sell off some blocks like that?","Peter R. Porrino","So certainly, when we sell off those blocks, which would have been higher-yielding blocks, you would see a potential drop. But those are not huge amounts relative to our asset portfolio. And to be honest, the net investment income that came in for the quarter was pretty much exactly what at least we thought it was going to be, so there was nothing unusual going on.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then, Greg, quick question. On the professional liability business, was the decline in quarter-to-quarter all related to business you said that you're going to be running off?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Well, I'm sorry, say that again...","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The gross written premium was down in Professional Liability's year-over-year. Was that related to some of the business you said you're going to get out of.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, that international source, that's the main driver, it's a little bit lower as you execute on restructuring and repricing some of the U.S. Professional book that will always result in a little bit of breakage but the main driver is the beginning of that process, absolutely.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then, on the quota share, just quickly, was there any unwritten premium that went in with that, that would have had an impact on the net written premium?","Gregory S. Hendrick","No, it's a risk-attaching quota share. So there's nothing, it's not a straight quote share of the whole book, just to add a little more color, it's a session on just our larger limit policy. So not only is it not a straight quota share of the whole thing but it's also a risk-attaching basis.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And therefore, we shouldn't expect it to much have of an impact on your policy acquisition ratio?","Gregory S. Hendrick","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up on Josh's question earlier on the pick going a little higher. So that -- have you given some color on which lines this is occurring in? Is it the international professional liability book or what lines of business are you changing the picks on?","Gregory S. Hendrick","So we're picking it up in 4 key places. One is indeed the international solicitors. The other, as I touched upon in my comments, the U.S. professional liability for non clash, we continue to be -- as you know, we reserve our clash -- our professional liability book in the clash and non clash component as we talked about in our 10-Q. And so this is the non clash piece that reflects some of this changing activity, small on our property book of business related to energy and the last piece is on our international marine cargo book, were the 4 places.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just, again, to clarify, it was an extra 200 basis points, so really spread in the second quarter but we should think of that as kind of a 6-month 100 basis points per quarter, is that correct?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes.","Gregory S. Hendrick","That's correct.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, just the rhythm of the way you go back in and look at reserves means we won't revisit this until the end of the year. So this will stay with us for the back half of the year as well?","Gregory S. Hendrick","On long-tail lines, that's correct. On short-tail lines, we do pick up activity quarter-to-quarter, each quarter.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, the way I'm thinking about it is just that the picks are going higher, okay, I guess, for the long-tail books, the picks will be higher for the next couple of quarters, and then we'll see what the world brings. So we should be taking kind of the new accident year loss ratio and trending it forward for 2 more quarters, I think, to be conservative, right?","Gregory S. Hendrick","The 64 4, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Was there any reserves [indiscernible] for the Costa Concordia loss in the second quarter?","Michael S. McGavick","I'm sorry, that was for the Costa Concordia loss?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Michael S. McGavick","So overall, for the company, the answer is no.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is there any update on -- specifically on Professional Liability, claim cost inflation that you can share?","Peter R. Porrino","I'm sorry, claim cost inflation?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Gregory S. Hendrick","No, we haven't seen -- no, in terms of -- we've just -- as I mentioned, it's been -- the severity actually has been lower, it's the frequency that's been up higher than we would've thought. So no, we haven't seen anything, particularly there, disturbing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you give us a little bit more color on the Stone Point arrangement? I'm just trying to understand, how is that structured and is it -- would you be putting business into that, that you're currently writing or is that -- is the profile of the business that you plan whether you would like to write in there, different in some characteristic or quality than what you're writing currently on your own balance sheet?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, I'm going to ask Pete to give some of the detail in just a second but I just want to emphasize, this is such an exciting development for us. In the final analysis, we were one of the pioneers of side TARs and other forms of applying our underwriting to additional capital providers, and we've watched the latest flurry of activity with real interest. We know a lot about it, we've thought a lot about it, and we had a view that for -- with the kinds of profits we were already delivering to our shareholders, that we had to come up with just the right way to enter it, that we didn't have to rush in and do anything silly. And as a result, we focused on the fact that if we want to create something that could last over time to be substantial, we would have to have a partner that really understood the elements of stewardship of other people's money, of all of the various complexities that go with it, and that really understood what was going on in the insurance marketplaces so that we can have a realistic partnership, one that we thought could endure. And in Stone Point, someone we've worked with on many ventures over many years, we found really, we think, the ideal partnership. And again, as I have said on an overall way of looking at, it's about marrying our underwriting expertise and making sure, in this rapidly evolving entry of additional forms of capital, that we are able to serve our clients with innovation, that we're able to continue to see our underwriters being able to reward our shareholders with their performance. We see it as a neat combination, so I just wanted to make sure to give a little more background, but Pete, talk about the various initial activities.","Peter R. Porrino","Just a couple of comments. As we said in the release, it's 75% XL, 25% Stone Point. The initial plans would be that one of the funds, the activities would be in the insurance-linked securities space. There will be a collateralized reinsurance vehicle also put in place. We're also talking about some other things that would be unique to XL. One of the things that we're really pleased with teaming up with Stone Point is that we think having that asset management expertise and the real deep reinsurance property CAT expertise is going to enable us to have a broader width of product than maybe what you've seen -- we've seen out there. And as Mike said earlier, we view that pretty much as the beginning of this relationship, it could go in a number of different ways, and again, the benefit of teaming up with Stone Point is you have a natural partner as this thing potentially morphs outside of property CAT reinsurance.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I mean, would you expect that, over time, that your 75% stake would fall as other outside investors are recruited and join the program or do you expect to retain that level of ownership no matter how large it might grow?","Peter R. Porrino","Right. So Mike, the plan is that we would keep the 75% because that's the investment in the top company, right? So that's the -- that the asset management company is the one that we would own 75%, they would own 25%. The plan would be to raise third-party money in the funds underneath that asset management company.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I see. And in terms of the profile of the business that this entity would write, I mean, in terms of is it going to be more skewed towards high-layer property CAT, is it -- at its inception, or do you anticipate kind of pushing the innovation through there and trying to move outside of just kind of that starting point?","James H. Veghte","It's Jamie. I think that there'll be a variety of products introduced in the vehicle. Some that have been traditionally associated with XL and others, such as retrocessional business where we have not been considered historically a large player. And in addition, as Mike and Pete both mentioned, ILS fund would also be involved.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one last one on the sequential loss ratio conversation. Looks like your marine book shrank, and it seems like you maybe took some actions there. I mean, if you back out the -- maybe underwriting actions that were associated with the premium declines there, can you sort of talk about what the sequential change might have been overall?","James H. Veghte","Well, at least on the reinsurance side, you're correct, it has dropped substantially. There's 2 particular specific reasons for that. One is we used to have outlets in both North America and in the London market to write marine reinsurance. We closed the U.S. operation and have focused our attention on the London market. And in addition, we've simply reduced our overall marine activity because we've just felt for a long, long time that we were better off deploying our NatCAT capacity, particularly U.S. exposed with our direct property CAT book and not the marine book.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, and on the insurance side, the Marine premium flows into the specialty line and so -- but just for color, it's down just a couple of million dollars.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Byrnes with Janney Capital Markets.","Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney","Quickly first, I noticed that the equity in the Life segment declined pretty substantially in the quarter. I imagine that is mainly from bond marks, but just wanted to see if there's anything in there that brought down the equity?","Michael S. McGavick","The answer, Ryan, is that it's in essence from those bond marks. I mean, one way to think about it, we do about -- we do a fair amount of disclosure at the bottom, so that you can look at it both on a GAAP basis and on a regulatory basis but those marks, clearly, on a U.S. GAAP basis, drove the lion's share of it. The only other thing that we did was, we did dividend some money out of the Life operation that also drove that.","Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney","And what was the size of that?","Michael S. McGavick","About $300 million.","Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney","Great. And then just my second question is last quarter, I guess, in the Insurance segment, you guys noted that kind of 17 out of your 22 insurance lines were getting rate in excess of the loss cost trend. Just wanted to see where that stands now, and maybe I guess as you guys look at the re-estimation of some of the lines as well, just want to see how attractive that segment is?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, it's 18 out of 22 and it's roughly 85% of the premium.","Operator","And the next question comes from Josh Stirling with Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So Greg, a question for you. Everybody is trying to figure out where you are in your sort of bridge to getting to a below 90s combined, so I thought, first, I'd just ask, is your year-to-date sort of 96% all-in, should we think about that as sort of a reasonable give or take number for where you think a normalized performance ought to be? And then, second, also for Greg, can you help us, with 3% pricing, should we look at your growth initiatives as the primary drivers to get your combined ratio down to 90% or below from expense leverage and loss ratio mix or are there some big initiatives in re-underwriting that we should still be thinking about?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Right. So the 96 is a number that you can observe, and it's a reasonable estimate for the book in its current state. To get to the 90%, we've got to move a number of letters. Rate is one piece of it. I talked about that. Mix is the other, big one, is we're shifting away from businesses that are less profitable into more profitable businesses. We've got about some underwriting actions identified as well. And then, Pete remarked upon it, is operating leverage as well. All 4 of those drivers are going to bring us towards that 90, I'm not going to try and break it down into numbers piece by piece but those are the 4 big drivers.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. Jamie, I wonder if I -- I was very interested to see your guys' growth in the whole account business. I'm wondering if you could just give us some color on that, sort of the opportunity and what sort of customer segments and underlying lines and maybe just some basics, of is it proportional excess of loss and sort of what you think the risk return looks like?","James H. Veghte","That book of business, Josh, is one that we've been playing in going back to the acquisition of Brockbank in the mid-90s. It's a very opportunistic play. They're basically whole -- you think about them as whole account quota shares from specific Lloyd's syndicates. We typically -- and one of the reasons you may have seen the increase in our ceded premium on the reinsurance side is because we piggyback on the outwards reinsurance strategy of our clients. In this particular case, we wrote one large new whole account of a syndicate that we've known for quite some time. It is not a specialist syndicate. It's a broad syndicate that we've known for a long time and they write a variety of lines of business. It's a book of business that we would not hesitate to shrink dramatically, as we have in the past. As I mentioned, it's very, very opportunistic in texture.","Operator","And our final question comes from Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Most are asked and answered. But just on pricing, I wanted to clarify something that's been talked about in previous calls, and that's that, I think, you said in the commentary that the U.S. lines kind of broadly speaking, this is more reinsurance, we're seeing a slowdown, but is Europe still kind of catching up because it was slower to firm in the first place?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, Randy, that's definitely the case. The North American property business has gotten a lot of rate over the last 12 to 18 months. And we're still positive. We're at 3 point -- we're just 4% in the second quarter. So we're still -- it's just lower than it's been over the last couple of quarters. And the international property, while the volumes aren't as big in Q2 as they are in Q1, has picked up to 3.5%. It's nothing I'm counting on, I'm very -- our guys are driving towards more because we need more, but it's certainly a positive sign and that's finally starting to pick up in kind of almost like a 12-month lag from where North America was.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So your European business is a little less sensitive to this kind of second derivative argument on pricing?","Gregory S. Hendrick","That's correct.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, my other question is a follow-up actually on the Costa Concordia question. I just wanted to clarify something. I've read a little bit about the mitigation effort for that being quite a bit more complicated. So is it that you don't have -- you didn't have development in the quarter or you no longer have exposure to how those containment remediation costs might increase?","Peter R. Porrino","So we didn't have -- and I'll turn it over to Susan if you want to make a comment. We did not have development in the quarter, both because of where we had our pick going in, as well as some reinsurances that we had in place. Susan, you want to give some more color?","Susan L. Cross","Yes, I would just add to that, Pete, that we didn't have any impact in the quarter. And even as we look at potential further deterioration from the latest estimates that have come out of the P&I club, which are about the $1.17 billion, if that were even to go to $1.5 billion, we'd have potential deterioration of $5 million. So it's not a material exposure for us, even if there is further development on that loss.","Operator","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.","Michael S. McGavick","Great. Listen, we really appreciate the questions. We know it's a hectic earnings season with a couple of other companies that have come out tonight. We know that you have a lot on your minds. We remain very pleased with the progress we've been making at XL. We can see the underlying trends for our business is moving in the right way and we're going to be very driven, as we've told you many times, to execute, execute and execute some more. So we look forward to being with you again in another quarter's time, and thank you for the attention tonight.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to XL Group plc Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David R. Radulski","Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL group's fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement. On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Peter Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions. ","Also in attendance and available for questions are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer; and Stephen Robb, our Controller.","Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I'd turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Michael S. McGavick","Thanks, David. As you have seen by reading our release, the fourth quarter of 2011 was highly unusual, and that understanding it requires some explanation, which we will attempt to do thoroughly tonight. At the same time, once we clarify the unusual items, I think you will come to the same  3 conclusions that we do. First, that XL has become an excellent manager of catastrophe risk across the firm. Second, that while there are large blocks of excellent underwriting at XL, we remain plagued by lost activity in a handful of insurance lines that undermine our results. And third and most important, that we have the proper focus on improving or eliminating these sources of poorer results. ","Now for clarity's sake, this is how the call will go tonight. First, I will walk through the unusual items for the quarter at a high level. Second, I will similarly walk through our underwriting results highlighting the evidence of the 3 points I just made. Then I'm going to turn the call over to our CFO, Pete Porrino, who will walk through these unusual items in deeper detail, as well as updating you on other critical aspects such as investments. After Pete, our newly appointed CEO of Insurance, Greg Hendrick, will provide even more detail on the breadth of correction underwriting actions underway, and give some examples of the early results that would not  yet appear in the financials, but will give you a sense of why we have such confidence. Finally, we will conclude with a very positive report by Jamie Veghte on our Reinsurance operations. Both Jamie and Greg will also give their perspectives on the improving rate environment. Then we will take your questions. ","So let me begin with some of the unusual items that drove the quarter's results. First, I want to give you the thinking behind the largest item for the financial note, the goodwill charge. Next I want to give you some perspective on expense levels, as you will notice, that expenses ran higher in the fourth quarter. Finally, I need to provide you with some perspective on tax in the quarter and for the year, as without understanding this nuance, one could wrongly conclude that our underwriting was worse that it in fact is. ","First, about the goodwill charge. As you well know, the P&C insurance sector is continuing to trade at low valuations, and XL is traded at an even greater discount. When these conditions persist long enough, we must closely examine the goodwill we carry, in relation to the purchase of these operations. In our third quarter 10-Q, we described that this examination was intensified. When the fourth quarter showed higher levels of non-cat loss activity, as had the third quarter. We felt that our assessment of how the market would value these operations had to reflect these recent poor results, even if we remain bullish about our potential over time. ","Pete will give you the greater detail, but this is the basic thinking behind our goodwill write-down of $429 million.  Note that this has no impact on our calculations related to excess capital. Second as to operating expenses. ","Back in June, we said that we thought the fourth quarter of 2010, would have been a good proxy for the 2011 run rate. And so it proved to be. Our 2011 full-year expenses were, in fact, roughly 4x the expense load in the fourth quarter of 2010. But what does this say about 2012? While we generally stay out of the business of giving guidance, for 2012, we expect to come in at the right around about 100 more  --  $100 million more in expenditure, than our actual full year 2011 level. But we need to emphasize that going forward, there will likely continue to be meaningful volatility from quarter-to-quarter. Technology spending, for example, can be quite lumpy. And new hires can be very hard to predict in terms of quarterly timing. And it is in those less predictable areas, we are exactly where we are making investments. Investing teams who can grow the business in lines where we find current and future returns appealing, upgrading talent where we have found it to be deficient, and building pricing and product modeling and the technology to deliver it while lowering costs. ","And so on to the third item. Tax. Now this item would not be obvious just from reading the materials you have in front of you. At XL, we typically have an effective global operating tax rate in the mid-teens. And this was true through the first few quarters of 2011. But in the fourth quarter, an unfortunate phenomena took place. Pete will get more granular about this, but it has a simple idea behind it. The heavy losses we experienced, such as the Thailand floods, ultimately were written in low tax jurisdictions. While our positive earnings, such as the reserve releases in our London markets operation, came in a high tax jurisdiction. As a result, the effective tax rates for the year, instead of being in the mid-teens, was in the mid-30s. And in the fourth quarter, this tax item added fully $59 million to our operating loss. This rare phenomenon of tax adding insult to injury has happened at XL before, in cases of high volatility, low earnings quarters like we just experienced. In general, however, and over time, our tax strategies have proven to be very effective. And while we will always work to make sure our global structure is tax efficient, there are no obvious changes suggested by our studies of this fluke pattern. I should add that the move of the holding company last year to Ireland, has nothing to do with this result. ","With those 3 unusual items discussed, this brings us to Underwriting. The essence of what we think our business is all about. Again here, there are 3 ideas, as I enumerated at the start of the call. First, strong relative performance in the face of incredibly high cat losses around the globe, second, mainly strong underwriting performance in Insurance, undercut by pockets of poor performance; and third, intense corrective actions, well underway in those businesses requiring improvement. ","So first, with respect to cat losses. In one of the worst years on record for catastrophe losses, including the fourth quarter's devastating Thailand floods, XL's cat loss profile relative to our peers, once again demonstrated the effectiveness of our risk management discipline. Remember that we would expect to be infected in both our Reinsurance and Insurance operations, given our global footprint in each. That said, our total losses across both businesses of $761 million, compares favorably to the global carriers we compete with, especially, we considered as a portion of our shareholders equity. As analysts have independently noted, as compared to 19 other major insurers and reinsurers with whom we compete, our loss as a percentage of shareholders equity was in the best quintile of performance. And looked at another way, while market share is hard to get at, and while our market share varies around the world, given our view of pricing adequacy and our drive to put our capital to work where returns are best, we believe that yet in nearly every case, and certainly overall, our loss compared favorably to our market share. This is an impressive result, and a real improvement, given as history in the first part of the 2000s. ","As for the second Underwriting point, we note the challenge to businesses at XL represent only about 20% of the 2011 global teams seen net premiums written. Meaning the lion share of our premium comes from key businesses that continue to demonstrate their excellence, covering a wide range of parallels on a global basis. For example, our excellence in Reinsurance method, despite the high level of cash, we showed an Underwriting profit for the year. Professional lines, broadly speaking continued to generate tremendous results, despite downward rate pressures. ","Our Specialty businesses, mainly known by our businesses at Lloyd's, also had excellent performance. And we remain very pleased with our performance in global casualty, over time. In fact, out of our 25 businesses in Insurance, it is precisely 7 that are challenged. To put it in perspective, without these businesses, our x cat, x PYD combined ratio, would be below 95%. ","As I said, I will leave it to Greg to provide greater detail on our various Underwriting actions. But I want to emphasize the role of leadership and talent. Talent is at the core of the completion in the complex risk Underwriting businesses, of which XL is comprised. And while there's a lot of excitement and commentary about our entry into a few new lines of similar business, the far bigger story is the broader upgrade of talent at XL. Of the 96 underwriters we hired at XL in 2011, only 18 were tied to the noted new activities. The balance was hired to add to or to upgrade the Underwriting talent in existing lines of business. In fact, all 7 of these challenges businesses, not only went through an in-depth review of all aspects of their operation in 2011, but we changed the leadership and the top underwriters in 5 of the 7 businesses. The new leadership and the action of all these businesses are undertaking under the new plans, are monitored intensely at all levels of XL. ","Now, with all of that said, you will logically ask, as you have in the past, when can we expect to see the benefits of these actions? Well, like you, we think we're experts at these lines of business, and we know that it takes real-time for the results to show up on the bottom line. And the speed of impact depends on the lost profiles of the businesses being acted upon. This is especially true at a firm like ours with a strong and continuing track record of prudent reserving. But I can say this, the actions are happening at the urgent pace we have set out for it, the precursor indicators of progress are also showing up as expected, and we expect these actions will show up to an increasing degree on the bottom line, throughout 2012. ","So before turning it over to Pete, I would say that in some, while we are frustrated, as we are sure investors are, with the time it takes for an Insurance book to respond to medicine, we are unwavering in our faith that the right actions have been and are being taken, and we are intensely resolved to make all of XL, and not just most of it, match our historical underwriting prowess. Pete?","Peter R. Porrino","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. I'll be covering 3 items in more detail. First, I'll discuss the quarterly year's results, including discussions on goodwill and taxes. Second, I'll provide you with an update on our investment activity, including our exposure to Continental Europe, and third, I will address on capital market activities. ","The fourth quarter and full year 2011 results were significantly impacted by severe natural catastrophes, resulting in an operating net loss for the quarter of $80 million compared to operating income of $242 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, we reported an operating profit of $89 million compared to $810 million in 2010. Cat losses, net of Reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the fourth quarter were $195 million, which is at the midpoint of our preliminary cat loss estimate range, included in our January '11 press release. And that compares to $30 million in the prior year. For the full year, cat losses were $761 million compared to $294 million in 2010. ","Our net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $516 million for the fourth quarter, and $475 million for the full year. The net losses were driven by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $429 million. Now this impairment of goodwill represents all of the goodwill included in our Insurance segment. This was due to a combination of persistent low market valuations for XL and in the Insurance industry generally, and the continuing underperformance in that segment. This underperformance impacts the assumptions used in goodwill valuation tests, such as market multiples and select discount rate and related risk premium, a third-party might demand. Consistent with Mike's comments, we did not fundamentally change the assumptions about the future profitability of this business. ","Turning to our summary financial results on Slide 3, you'll see that the P&C gross premiums written were down 3.5% versus the fourth quarter of 2010, with a 4.4% decrease, and 7.9% increase in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively. The Insurance segment decrease was driven by a prior year quarter multiyear Insurance agreement, excluding this agreement, there was a 5% increase in 2010. Greg and Jamie will highlight the sources of growth in their comments. Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 108.2% or 16 points -- 16.8 points higher than the same quarter last year. As detailed on Slide 4, cat losses in the quarter accounted for 14.2 lost ratio points, 11.8 points higher than the same quarter last year. ","Prior year development in the quarter was a favorable $68 million or 4.9 loss ratio points. This reflects favorable development of $28 million and $40 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments respectively, from our fourth quarter detailed ground-up reserve review. Positive movements came from Specialty and Professional  Insurance lines, as well as longer tail U.S. and European Reinsurance lines. Although these releases are down from the prior year quarter, our actual gross is expected loss experience continues to trend favorably x PYD and cat or combined ratio increased by 0.5 points. ","In the quarter and for the full year, our operating tax expense was clearly out of line with operating income. In the quarter, we added $21 million pretax operating loss, and $59 of tax expense. As Mike stated, our losses ended up largely in low tax jurisdictions, while our income was seen in the higher tax jurisdictions. The distribution of cat losses was a function  both of where the policies were written, and also our internal Reinsurance arrangements, including certain stop-loss agreements. In addition, positive prior-year reserve releases, which are net above positive and negative results for different lines of business, were most significant in our legal entity with the highest overall tax rate. ","Other items contributed, such as the tax treatment of unrealized investment gains in certain jurisdictions, but generally, the result reflects the unusual distribution of profits and losses around our global organization this quarter.  At $192 million, net investment income under P&C portfolio in the fourth quarter was 9% below the prior year, due primarily, to new money rates and cash outflows from the investment portfolio. The average new money rate on our P&C portfolio in the quarter was 2.5%. The P&C gross book yield at the end of the quarter was 3.2%. From the P&C duration remains unchanged at 2.8 years. ","Our net loss from investment affiliate was $24 million, down $70 million from the prior year. Now it's important to remember that we record our affiliate earnings on a lag of between 1 and 3 months. As we discussed in our third quarter call, our private equity and investment management business portfolios state difficult Q3 market conditions. Realized losses were $50 million compared to $104 million in the prior year quarter. Of this total $29 million related to OTTI charges, which were primarily due to foreign exchange items and from non-agency RMBS assets. The total mark-to-market was $130 million positive, with the impact of lower rates being somewhat offset by widening credit spreads, primarily on European investment grade corporate credit. ","While we've mentioned our reductions to European investments on previous calls, we think it is worth repeating, given the continued turmoil in Europe. Our peripheral government exposure is immaterial at $27 million. In addition to avoiding direct peripheral sovereign risk, we have also eliminated all peripheral hybrid financial exposure. Within core Europe, we have been concerned about the indirect effects of the European crisis on the banking system, particularly on the risks exposed to hybrid securities, given the amount of recapitalization required of certain of these banks. ","Over the past several years, we have successfully reduced exposure, to a point where it is very manageable. Our Continental European hybrid exposure was $102 million at year end, with only $73 million to banks, largely national champions in Northern Europe. Even including subordinated bank debt, the exposure's only $133 million. In fact, including senior debt and other financials, our total Continental Europe financials holdings are $870 million, which is down $350 million from December 31, 2010. Just as importantly, these bonds have an unrealized loss of just $28 million. At less than 3% of our 15 comp portfolio, we have significantly reduced our investment risk to a Eurozone meltdown. ","Now to our capital management. We purchased and canceled $4.9 million ordinary shares, at an average cost of $20.21 for $100 million in the fourth quarter, and $31.7 million ordinary shares at an average price of $21.03, for a total of $665 million in 2011. This leaves $190.5 million available for purchase under our $1 billion share buyback program. In October, we announced the termination of the Stoneheath 3 facility, and the resulting issuance of $350 million of series D preference ordinary shares, at 312 basis points over LIBOR, a very attractive rate in today's market. ","And in 2012, we repaid, at maturity, the $600 million, 6.5% guaranteed senior notes. All of our actions were designed to maintain a capital structure that balances the ability to build shareholder value, whether it's redeploying more resources behind a considerable underwriting talent we've been building, or taking advantage of attractive share repurchase opportunities or other means of returning shareholder capital. ","Since August 2010, XL has repurchased 57.3 million shares, or approximately 17% of the outstanding shares at that time. We reconsidered the amount we repurchased in Q4 2011, as more indicative going forward than the earlier part of the year. Of course, this will be tampered by significant catastrophe -- large loss activity, or a specific opportunity to put our capital to work. ","Now before I hand it over to Greg, I'll make some comments on the Costa Concordia  situation. We expressed our sympathy to the loved ones of those who lost their lives in this tragic accident. The loss is in early stages and investigations continue, particularly as to the ultimate size of the loss. XL has exposure in both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Our exposure is significantly reinsured, which we expect will contain our net loss. Based on our exposure for Insurance and Reinsurance, net of Reinsurance protections and inwards and outwards reinstatement premiums, we estimate our losses in this $40 million to $50 million range. Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Pete. I'll focus on 3 topics tonight. First, our results for the segment; second, some of the actions we are taking to improve these results; and third, a brief comment on the current rate trends. ","First, the results. As Pete mentioned, we normalized for one-off multiyear deal written in Q4 2010, Insurance gross premiums written grew by 5% in the quarter. ","The majority of this growth is due to a new premium from targeted initiatives. In particular, our North American construction programs in international professional businesses, each had a significant new premium. Net premiums earned were up $59 million or 6.6% reflecting the year-end grew of higher gross premiums written. The Insurance segments combined ratio for the quarter of 116.2% was 15.2 points higher, versus the same quarter last year. Current year debt loss is accounted for $133 million or 12.2 points of the increase. While Thailand  floods accounted for $102 million, we also had $26 million development  in the quarter from events occurring in the first 3 quarters of 2011. ","Lower prior year of favorable development accounted for 4.5 points of the increase, as we released $28 million in Q4, compared to $66 million in Q4 last year. While the reserve releases in many lines were offset by strengthened reserves in E&S risk management and 2 of our professional businesses. An increase in the expected account were 1.4 points of the increase -- attributable to primarily the foreign exchange rates, and higher compensation cost, as we continue to add underwriters, and make changes in business leadership. ","The deterioration that I've mentioned was slightly offset by lower current accident year loss experience, which contributed 3.8 points of improvement, primarily due to lower large losses compared to the fourth quarter last year. However, the current accident  loss ratio of nearly 72%, adjusted for prior year development in cats, is unacceptably high.  Let me be clear, we view this segment result as a whole, unacceptable. There are numerous bright spots, and there are business that is challenge. So I want to walk you through some of the actions we are taking to improve results. ","First, it's important to step back to what we told you at our Investor Day, that we have changed the way we think about managing XL. We used to be a handful of global product lines for sign of goals. We now consider each business a core unit of accountability, but with aligned goals and strategies. This is the portfolio of business that I know well. ","In past year, we've examined every pocket of performance, both positive and negative, that would have previously stayed hidden. In businesses that we view as challenged, we have added new leadership and experienced team, and we have re-underwritten strategies. Particularly, this has meant empowering these leaders to re-underwrite the sectors of their books that are underperforming. This takes some time, but we feel it will yield the right results. ","In many other areas, we found opportunities to be even better at the things we're already doing well. So it's some specifics. With new leadership in both the North American and international property businesses, we've reviewed our approach to cat underwriting. While we have outperformed relative to the industry in almost all events, we can still improve our catastrophe performance, and cat is an area I know very well. For example, we've looked closely at our approach to flood underwriting, and decided to  dramatically reduce limited authorities for our property underwriters. In our International business, we restricted cat authority, and we've seen our exposures reduce at a faster rate than our premium base, as the book renews.","Learning from our improvement in track record in reinsurance, we integrated the latest industry cat models to support pricing and underwriting decisions in this portfolio as well. We also have a new approach for our property Reinsurance treaties, which we knew at May 1. By considering capacity from a variety of capital sources, we will optimize our seat of reinsurance coverage and cost. ","With new leadership in our risk management business, we're taking action to deemphasize the guaranteed cost workers comps in this portfolio, and it's lagged the rest of the book by 10 loss ratio points. We know there are real opportunities in workers comp, and we've added new volumes in our North American and construction business. With our focus on very large contractors, most of whom, have outstanding risk management practices, we are selectively underwriting a book that should outperform the general workers comp industry. ","To further enhance our results, we're planning a new underwriting workstation, greatly improving our operational efficiencies, pricing data and analytics. Other challenges, we are confronting by shifting our mix of business, and I'll give you examples from E&S and professional. In our E&S business, again an area where we have added new leadership, we know one of the sectors of underperformance is the New York Contractors General Liability Line, specifically subcontractor risk. ","We are re-underwriting this book and shifting our exposure to general contractors. We also know our book about partner risk to experience a 20-point higher loss ratio than the rest of our general liability portfolio. We have decided to renew just a handful of our best risks in this class. ","Since early 2011, 2 of our professional businesses started shifting their portfolios towards smaller customers, and optimizing a geographic mix. We're already seeing signs of improvement, we've reported claim counts down 30% year-over-year. ","We're made more confident, given our lengthy history in some of these classes, and accumulation of data, which we are minding, to yield a strong competitive advantage. Our strategic analytics team is currently working with our underwriters to take advantage of this opportunity. ","Another illustration of our re-underwriting is the private D&O portfolio, which peaked at $75 million of premium in 2008. As we experienced the turn of results, we decided to completely revamp the business, and it's now just $10 million of premium in 2011. With new leaders and redefined strategies to improve existing businesses, we're also enhancing our profitability for strategic growth opportunities. ","In 2011, this meant the addition of Inland Marine, Political Risk and Surety teams, the latter 2 of which, we view as having true global potential. These businesses will add -- will aid our delivery of expansion into areas of opportunities, in particular, our new offices in China and Brazil. ","Finally, a word on market conditions. We have seen positive rate trends across most of our businesses. We achieved our third consecutive quarter of positive pricing in North America and P&C businesses. Specialty pricing was also positive in the quarter and for the year. And we continue to see material improvement in our U.S. D&O book, as rate decreases continue to slow in Q4, and early 2012 renewals are yielding rate increases. ","We believe that the positive pricing momentum we see is real and sustainable, and will continue on 2012. While we are taking corrective actions in the quarter of our Insurance businesses, we are very well prepared to take advantage of, and a deep push for, increasing rates in the remaining 3 quarters of our book. ","And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.","James Veghte","Thanks, Greg, and good evening. I'd like to cover 2 principal issues tonight, a review of our fourth quarter and full year results, and also, some comments on a very successful renewal season, market conditions and how we view our position in an improving environment. This segment has a solid result in the quarter, despite the onslaught of significant industry cat losses we experienced throughout the year. In this instance, Thailand flooding. Our combined ratio was 90.8% for the quarter, and included the benefit of prior year releases of $40 million. This compares to a combined of 69.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the benefit of prior-year releases, we had a combined ratio of 100%, which compares to 84.1% in 2010. ","The performance in the fourth quarter was substantially impacted by catastrophe losses of $62 million, including $56 million from the flooding in Thailand. Excluding the impact of both cat losses and prior year releases, the segment had a combined ratio of 85.6%, which compares to 80.2% in the fourth quarter of 2010. This 5-point delta from last year was driven by a number of issues, including 2 fire losses from our U.S. operations, a deterioration of performance of our U.S. crop portfolio, and a co-mutation in the fourth quarter of 2010 that was nonrecurring. ","For the full year, XL Re had a combined ratio of 97.8%, which compared to the 80.1% combined in 2010. Our year was heavily impacted by cat losses of $406 million, an increase of just under $250 million from what we experienced in 2010. Excluding the impact of both Cat losses in prior year releases, we had a combined ratio of 85.7%, virtually identical to the 85.9 in 2010. Frankly, we are gratified to produce an Underwriting profit in a year when industry global cat losses were north of $100 billion.  I think this speaks to the experience and discipline of our Underwriting teams, and the prudent reserve position of our business. ","Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $105 million, which compares to the 97.5 written in the fourth quarter of 2010, an 8% increase. This increase was driven largely by the reinstatement premiums, emanating from the Thailand flood loss. For the full year, gross written premiums were $2.1 billion, a 12.5% increase from 2010. This increase was due to new business and increased share in both XL Re Europe and XL Re America, increased reinstatement premiums, and an increase in our U.S. crop ratings. ","Turning to market conditions, our year-end renewal went largely as we expected. For U.S. cap business, non-loss impacted programs saw rate increases in the 7.5% to 12.5 range, while loss impacted placements saw increase from 15%, to as much as 40%. Loss impacted international business, paid an increase of 30% to 70%. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, we saw fairly modest single-digit risk adjusted increases, a bit below what we expected going into renewals. ","Capacity was readily available, although we would say customers that tried to undercut the lead price indication, struggled to get things home. We saw a fair amount of business get repriced and increased during the last couple of days of the season. In addition, both aggregate and worldwide type placements struggled to get done. While there were a couple of headline accounts that bought less capacity than they did in 2010, overall, we saw a fairly healthy demand profile from the market. It's our estimation that north of $1 billion of additional U.S. wind exposed cat cover was bought at year end. Broadly, we were pleased with the renewal of our cat portfolio. ","Turning to Casualty. The U.S. market was competitive at January 1. Reinsurers were generally quite determined to retain their renewal accounts, and most tried to increase their lines with limited success. There were some increase in ceding [ph] company retention levels, particularly, on business that performed well over time. As Greg mentioned, relative to original pricing, we are beginning to see positive movement in the primary market, with the exception of sectors of the professional lines market. ","For international casualty, rate levels remained broadly flat, with those seeing some willing to accept increases, often taking additional retention. We do continue to see improvements in the U.K. motor market, particularly on accessible loss pricing. ","With respect to the Specialty areas of the market. January 1 is a fairly light renewal for aviation, and the marine market had a very late renewal season, with significant improvement in the energy sector, from those programs impacted by Griffin and Deepwater. ","Overall, we are pleased with our book of business and our market position going into 2012. We've had 6 consecutive years of attractive Underwriting results, a very experienced team, deep relationships across the market, and we are ready to leverage all of these assets into continued success as we go forward. ","With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A.","David R. Radulski","Shirley, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Walsh with Citi.","Unknown Analyst","I guess my first question for you, I appreciate the extra detail around the weaker lines of coverage. But just a couple of questions around that, what percent of total premiums do those 7 lines represent? And how much allocated capital is behind that? And what accident years are really showing the weakness? And then I've got one for Peter.","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, the capital allocation, we'll have to get back to you  to get precise. I don't have it broken out that way, but it's about 20% of the net written premium, 1\/5.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Any years in particular that are showing strain?","Michael S. McGavick","It would really depend by line of business. Some of them have deteriorated as rates have come off over time and kind of revealed themselves to be under performers. Others have been -- there might have been a year or an event over the years that has given a rise to this. But generally speaking, these are books of business where we, ourselves, when we started breaking the business into separate business lines, rather than this kind of global view of Casualty and Property, that's when we got intense about these particular businesses, as ones that we had a real opportunity to upgrade the performance.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then for Peter, just on the rate of repurchase, I think you mentioned $100 million a quarter. And I would guess, you guys have significant excess capital writing $5.5 billion of premium on a $10 billion balance sheet. Why not a much higher run rate here?","Peter R. Porrino","Well, a couple of things, I'd say. One is, we do see some opportunities in the marketplace, and we were certainly investing, as Mike said, in talent. We do believe that we are at the beginning stages of a hardening market. And we also noticed, I mean, catastrophes this quarter was a difficult quarter for the industry and for us. And so to come out and signal, I would say, increased buyback activity would probably not be correct. And then the other thing is, throughout 20 -- the end of 2010 and 2011, I'd say there was a little bit of a catch up in lack of buybacks in the prior periods. Mike, you have...","Michael S. McGavick","No, I just. At the same -- I think your question is a very good one. And the only thing I'd add to what Peter said, is you've heard me walk through the 3-part analysis before, what percentage buffer do we want to hold to our rating agency capital in order to make sure that we do not ever put it at risk to the best of our ability. Second, once we'd determined that, then we understand what this truly excess, and then, we're always judging, where can we put it to work to make the franchise better, and if we can't, how do we get back to shareholders the efficient way. That thought process hasn\u2019t changed in the time I've been here. Right now, you have 2 things kind of going in opposite directions and we're always analyzing across both. One thing, you have an improving rate environment, as Pete mentioned, which can give us some opportunities for profitable growth. You have seen us invest in new teams and some new opportunities because of that. But at the same time, trading where we're trading, it's hard to ignore, the economics of share repurchase. So they kind of move in competition with each other, and we're always analyzing across those 2. So that's why we want to be cautious and at the same time, it's been a volatile time for the industry and I think all of us having seen 2011 in the rearview mirror, we'd like to see that calm down.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, a quick numbers question. With the change in debt accounting, coming on January 1, will there be any write down of the book value on that, or impact to earnings in 2012?","Michael S. McGavick","Our estimate is that it will be a small number in the 10s of millions of dollars, that will be disclosed in the 10-K.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In terms of the impact of book value?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Any impact on 2012 earnings?","Peter R. Porrino","No, at least nothing at all material.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then more broadly, if I look at the Insurance segment, even excluding net prior year development, cats and reinstatement premiums, the underlying combined ratio, is it 104 of the full year 2011, up from 101 in 2010? And Mike, I know you don\u2019t like giving guidance, but what do you -- what type of improvement you think you can drive through the results in 2012?","Michael S. McGavick","Jay, your first part of your question -- your first part of your comment was the governing one. We don't give guidance. We believe the business is too volatile for that, it just has a general observation about the sector. But I've tried to be as clear as I can, and maybe I could step back and make it a little broader to at least, be as helpful as I can be. You know very well, and all the people on this call being Insurance experts, you know, that the reality of any one period's underwritings, are mainly the product of underwritings from a year and more ago, and decreasingly, the product of more recent underwriting activity. So you're always getting a pretty nice lag, just by the nature of the business, from the underwriters action to the result. What we can tell you and what we have told you going back to our investor call, was that because of our new way of looking at it, with  greater insight, greater accountability, we had identified some areas that really needed improvement and we're un-implementing significant change. And you've seen announcement after announcement that really can be tied to that observation. While it's a short-tail line, as soon as you implement a new approach in underwriting, you get the effect, roughly a year after the underwriting action takes place or it can be sooner if you're not underwriting something again, if you're not renewing, you can get an immediate impact, if you're writing your nonrenewal actions. But of course your opportunity for nonrenewal takes place for the following year after you make the decision, because our policies don't all incept, in common at one particular day. We certainly get, in some books, more bang for the buck at the 1-1 renewal point. And at least, some of our actions this past year would have taken place at that time. So you really kind of have to get extremely granular, line by line, action by action and pattern of renewal by pattern of renewal, or pattern of new inception by pattern of new inception, before you can start adding up when exactly an action might take place. And that's why because of the complexity of all that, and bluntly, the fortuity as well, on what we would say is more and more over the course of '12, and certainly, much more impact than we saw in '11, you will see the book remixing to these new underwriting actions, and that should of course, in turn, see the actions take hold in the bottom line. What we do plan to do over the course of the year as we're able to do so, is to give you updates on evidence that we're seeing, that may not be ready to translate into the bottom line. We will not change our very prudent approach to reserving. I know there's a lot of -- kind of commentary that goes on about the industry and the various phases of how people behave during different cycles, during periods of the Underwriting cycle, but in our reserving, we just remain consistent throughout. I would say that actually sets us apart relative to the industry from all the numbers I'm seeing, at least generally. And in fact, I think when you look at the global triangles for this year, for example, you're going to see -- we think, and I think you will judge too, and independently, we're seeing judge that our margins are actually increasing somewhat in terms of reserve redundancy, that is not generally true about the sector. So as I look at it, when you take all of that together, the fact that we're not going to overreact quickly, we're going to want -- we're going have  a 'prove it to us' actuarial attitude, and because these actions took place in different pockets over different time periods over the last year, it will work its way into the book, increasingly through each quarter, you should see more influence from these underwriting actions.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Makes sense. Sorry for follow up, but are you also implying that we should expect to see premium volume in the insurance segment to be lower in 2012 than it is in 2011?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, I'm going to ask Greg to jump in here too because Greg is the one, I just want to emphasize the point that was made earlier, that I think is really important for the market to understand. While Greg started his job leading insurance on January 1, Greg led our strategic review in 2010 that led us to the changes we made and how we lead the business, and throughout '11, was leading various of the most urgent of our process for reviewing those lines that we found had challenges, along with Jamie Veghte, and a team of our best underwriters. So Greg's starting point had a big run rate to it and the lot of knowledge added to it. So, yes, where we saw business that was underperforming, you should expect to see that there'll be jamming rate through it, changing underwrite terms and conditions, changing our limit strategy and changing our reinsurance strategy, or in some cases, simply nonrenewal. And those will take place over those impacts will take place over time. In those places, you'll see shrinkage, but we also have pockets, but we assure you, we didn't think we were using all of our capacity. And where we'll see growth. And I'll ask Greg to comment a little bit on some of those lines where we saw opportunities for growth, and some of the lines where we actually jumped into the line because we see the conditions as so enticing. ","Yes, when I touched on some of them, in my comments. Jerry, but generally, we're looking at -- ones I didn't touch on in particular, our North American property business with Joe Tucker as the new leader, is showing a strong growth of our construction business. I did mention, we also didn't touch upon it, but we're adding new programs as we've re-underwritten, it's one of the areas that we've been focused on, a new leader there as well, and Pete Purpose [ph], and he is quickly refocusing the book and adding new programs, in fact, you will see in the press release, in the last couple of days of our latest program there.","Unknown Executive","There is one new line I would add to my comment, one particular book, the international property book, we're in the last chunk of what we had told you in previous calls are the end of LTAs. And so that book will roll off in 2012, and we'll get a good crack at 1 1 13 for that last big chunk of business, so you'll see some activity there. It's important to point out again, that's 25% of the insurance business that we're talking about, and we are doing some strong growth initiatives in the other 75% of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, I wanted to just touch on the incremental $100 million of expenses you're talking about next year. Guess a little surprised by the magnitude of that. But was, rather than talking about what the number is, I was hoping you could help us put in perspective, how you're thinking about the payback on that investment, and what metrics we should be thinking about over what time frame we should be thinking about to kind of judge how well spent that money is?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, we generally don't think of things over much longer than a several year horizon when we do payback analysis, because I just don't trust numbers and get out longer than that. So that's how we think about it, we wouldn't have, none of these investments will be made if we didn't think they would generate an adequate return within 3 years. So that's a general rule of thumb. Now when you're investing in businesses, they can make their returns at different paces over time. For example, some businesses, with relatively low infrastructure cost, let's say Surety, you could -- depending on what happens in the marketplace, you can have that business grow relatively quickly at relatively low cost, and get to payback relatively quickly. On other businesses that are a little more infrastructure intense, say Inland Marine, would come to mind, I would expect the payback on those investments to take longer to realize. But in no case, would we jump into something where we didn't think over 3 years, we'd be getting to a meaningful return on investment. On the technology side and on the Underwriting Analytics side -- Underwriting analytics, I expect to have fairly rapid payoff, if you think about it because when we make an investment in the new model, and that model gets implemented, the only constraint to the speed of the benefit, is the same factors I described a moment ago, when you're dealing with Underwriting decisions. That is how quickly can you get the book through the new decisions that you've made. And then finally on the broader Underwriting and the technology infrastructure paybacks, those are always the hardest to get to, because the reality is, they tend to be softer numbers that really have benefited, may show up in the expense ratio over time. But we do know that even our growth is enabled by these platform investments. So we couldn't be adding some of the premiums as was described when you take out the one special items of note, it was a 5% growth of Insurance in the last year, we couldn't be doing that without some of these technology investments. So while it's a little softer, we would have the same rigor over return periods that we would expect.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And can you -- well, I guess, as I listened to your answer, kind of the way that it works in my mind is, you've got a certain percentage that's really about investing in people and presence, and that will get paid back, in terms of -- you get production, and ultimately, profits on it. Part of it, on the model side, feels to me like, it's not so much -- it enables you to accomplish a lot of things, but it's more about maybe avoiding losses, then it is necessarily and helping volatility than it is necessarily about an absolute dollar. And the last one, just kind of feels like some business cost  to some extent. So -- but I'm just -- I position it that way, because I'd be curious if you give a sense of whether or not, how much of its people versus the other 2, because I guess, from a people standpoint, would've been unfair to expect that over the next 3 years, you'd recoup that expense, plus some margin on top of it.","Michael S. McGavick","All right. First of all, I think the way that you've thought about it is correct. In terms of additional expense, we're talking really about the $100 million in run rate increase, as opposed to the ordinary cost of the business, which we're always trying to grind down. As I think about it, I think the right answer, we'll get you some confirmation, is about 1\/3 of this is specifically related to people that we're adding, where you get the return in the profile you described. And about 2\/3 of it is related to technology and infrastructure costs, which we would expect to show up in allowing for growth or in some cases, and the reason you were right to split into 3 buckets and not 2, when you get into those analytics, and that's -- we're really investing in what we believe will show up as a lower loss ratio. And for us, I know this will sound trite, but I mean it, for the way, for the businesses we're in, and the way we think about the business, it is the loss ratio stupid. I mean that's how we think about the business, where we make investments, we're trying to drive insight to give us a loss ratio advantage over our competitors, over time.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just with respect, just following up on the buyback. I mean, it's part of the issue here when we think externally about your capital. Is that some of the new growth initiatives you have are basically in areas where you're not warehousing a lot of capital. So to some extent, until those get high, the capital efficiency is low.","Michael S. McGavick","Our smaller lines of business don't line up at the beginning, especially given diversification benefits, consuming that much of our capital model. So I don't think that would be a fair way to think about it. If I was going to speculate that there is any particular miss anywhere in the analytical cycle, between how we think about it and how you all think about it, the only place I would speculate, is that it is the way that we, versus the way which you think about the buffer, to rating agency capital. If I was going to guess, I would think that might be the biggest mismatch. But by either how I've seen you analyze it or how I see us analyze it, we don't dispute that there's excess capital. It's just a matter how we're thinking about acting on that, and our degree of comfort given current market conditions and opportunities. But if I was going to speculate about the difference, that's probably where that difference is, and I think a lot of that, where we might be able to do the difference, could really not only relate to how the market works today, but how the market works in the future. Because we are preparing steadily for the impact on our legal entities, as correlated to solvency to and other future regulatory impositions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, I'm trying to understand here, you're thinking about investing for growth and we're sitting here in mid-single, at least my estimates, kind of mid-single-digit ROEs next year, talking about spending a little bit more on expense, maybe $100 million for compensation, as opposed to maybe buying back stock. And what that difference means from an ROE and book value perspective, what do you look at to make sure that maybe it's not too early to invest for growth right now? And just one follow-up. Thanks.","Michael S. McGavick","I appreciate the question. And I do really appreciate the spirit of the questions, because they relate to the trade-offs that are very difficult trade-offs to judge. So we'd rather salute [ph]to the ground just as you do on our behalf in analyzing us. But again, when we can remix this book of business to more profitable line, we can create returns that are not only more attractive in the short-term, but very much more attractive in the long-term for the franchise. And that is our ultimate mission. Second, as we are able to attract this better talent, it's not the case, and this we talked about last quarter, it's not the case that you just get expense out of that and no other benefit. You can get very quickly to lower loss ratios, which are very attractive for our investors or you can grow in a space of business, where you're already getting attractive returns, and thereby, be affecting the remix of the business towards more profitable activity that shareholders will most appreciate over time. And so, when we think about it, that's why I emphasized the idea that only 18 of the underwriters, 96 of them, only 18 of them were tied to these  new businesses last year. Because the new business thing has the lag effects that we've talked about. But the other ones, are immediately put to work on blocks of business that are already in the house, and if they give us headaches, they give you headaches, and if they give us profitable for growth, they can remix this book faster toward more profit. So I view that as very common-sense activity, because to not do that, is to literally continue to produce these kinds of anemic returns, and then, just be kind of worst off over time. The other point I would make is, we can only be in the market timing game to a point. Because in the end, if you dive in after the turn, and everybody knows the turn, you're not ready and you're not going to be active present in the market to benefit from what comes. We want to be present. We want to be active. We want to have the capital capacity, we want to have the cap capacity, and we want to have the talent to take advantage of what comes next. Because while it isn't a hard market, it is sure changing. And in some lines more than others, and we can take advantage of that phenomena to remix the book of business. So I say all of that, and then I'll still say what you know, when we're trading like this, the economics of share repurchase are compelling, we know that, and we're very aware of that as we make this trade-offs.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean I understand, I guess if you're talking about 80% of your business running at a 95 combined in Insurance, I mean that -- just the delta there is significant to earnings, and you add to -- and then don't add the additional expense from hiring, and now you have more capital to deploy. I just wonder, does it make sense to think about fixing, showing some ROE trajectory, and then growing? And I understand your point about missing a turn, but I just wonder if that -- this puts us in a mezzanine phase for maybe another 12 to 24 months.","Michael S. McGavick","Well again, again a thoughtful question. I would emphasize again, that the remixing didn't start today on this call. It started over the course of last year, which is why I believe that the benefits from this remixing will start to take increasing effect on the book through 2012 and beyond. I think that's a very important notion. So if we were at a standing start today, I'm talking about actions, the equation might be different, we're not. And we're very, we remained resolved to see these plans that we put in place come through. So I think that's part of the difference here. The second thing is, you can -- it is always possible to create short-term benefit by discontinuing a challenged activity or just grinding expenses down as low as you can. You could create some short-term lift out of that, but you're not building a business that's going to be great over time. You're just giving a short term kick to it. And that's not just what we're trying to do. We don't think that's what you want us to do either. So it is always a complex equation, but I do think that on balance we have this equation right and have had through the year.","Peter R. Porrino","This is Pete Porrino. Keith, just to get back to you on your question about the capital on those 7 businesses. So as Mike said, it's just over 20% of premium. It's quite a bit less than that on capital, it's in the 12% to 14% range.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I forget who mentioned it, but there was some commentary around, there were certain lines in the Insurance business, where you saw some adverse development in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you could talk more about that and why you're comfortable that, that won't continue, that's question number one.","Michael S. McGavick","Sure. And we have, as David mentioned, we have Susan Cross, our Chief Reserving Actuary here with us, so she can get very precise about that. Susan?","Susan L. Cross","Yes, sure. So within the insurance segment, we did have net favorable prior development of $28 million in the quarter. And that comprised of $38 million favorable in Specialty, $15 million favorable in professional, $23 million unfavorable in Casualty, and $2 million unfavorable in property. So we had very favorable experience across most Specialty lines, and strong favorable in the core professional lines. Areas of strengthening, include the design and select professional books, and that was about $40 million of strengthening. We had strengthening in North Americas E&S, programs and U.S. risk management businesses of about $20 million. And that's related to the guaranteed workers comp and New York contractors, general liability exposures that Greg mentioned in his remarks. And finally, we had strengthening of about $18 million in excess casualty, related to some large energy claims in the 2010 accident year. So overall, we had very favorable in the quarter, and for the full year. Yet, we are strengthening where we need to ensure that strong balance sheet and foundation for the future. I'll also point out that we continue to experience favorable actual loss immergence, relative to effective levels across most of our businesses, especially, in primary casualty, professional and U.S. Casualty Reinsurance. And that gives us confidence in our overall reserve position, yet we're giving this time, to more fully develop before recognizing it, either in our prior-year development, or in our current year loss ratio picks. So that where we had that strengthening, is very specific portfolios, portfolios where we're taking underwriting actions, and we're confident overall.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just quickly. I'm sorry, go ahead.","Gregory S. Hendrick","I just want to jump in, it's Greg. Sorry, Jay. Let me just -- on 2 of them in particular, let me just follow on what Susan just said. In the design and select, and in particular, the professionals. 2 strong leaders that have been with us for a while, these activities just started either late in '10 or early in '11, design, while we're disappointed with the development, it's still on an on level and adjusted basis, is a profitable book of business for us over the last 10 years. And we're putting some things in place to make sure that continues into the future, we're very convinced with the future of that book.  Select is also refocusing on some smaller customers, and some of the better states, and they're well underway to improve it, and I'll touch on my comments there, where we're seeing already claim counts reducing. So not all this reserved development, if necessary, I mean, these businesses are not going to be future profitable for us in the future, but we are taking it seriously, and making sure we stay vigilant about the performance on each of these books.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just quickly, and I'll follow up on that. The stabs that you took at both design and select and North American  E&S, when you lasted a deeper dive, I guess this would have been in the second quarter into your reserves, were those running a temperature at that point? Is this something new, were there reserved increases bigger than you've done in the past?","Susan L. Cross","In our second quarter review, a couple of these areas, we did have some adverse developments, specifically in the E&S and in the select professional portfolio. So it's not across all the portfolios. So we had seen some signs of it earlier in the year. But I would say this might too, was a little bit more than what we've seen earlier in the year.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just quick numbers question.","Michael S. McGavick","I'm sorry, Jay. I would also add one other thought to that. The emergence of this development wasn't our first clue that these businesses needed attention. When we started -- and this is just such an important plan, I want to emphasize it again. The decision to move away from these very large global lines of business approach where everything got lumped together, really obscured where there were pockets of correctable underperformance. Because you've look at the top level of casualty line and the top-level profit, and you go , all looks okay, and given the time in the cycle, blah blah blah and we just didn't know, we don't want to run the business that way, we want to get very clear level  accountability, at the granular business level. So when we start pulling it apart and analyzing it that way, back in the latter half of '10, after this strategy was devised, that's when we got a focused on these lines of business, because we started looking and finding things that we really didn't like, that didn't meet our kinds of standards of activity. And since then, that's when all of these things really get more intense. So I just -- I just want to make that point, because I think it's important to understand the narrative of why we're feeling frustrated, hasn't shown up yet, but confident that it's there, that's the period of time we've been working on this not just in the last quarter or 2.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Thanks for that clarification. And then one just quick numbers question for modeling purposes. The loss from the Concordia sinking, can you give us an estimate of kind of what is reinsurance and what's insurance at this point?","Peter R. Porrino","No. There are some confidentiality things that we have with our clients. We don't -- remember, we almost never will  talk about a single and short events, right? So this is very unusual, only doing it because others have done it. But at this point, we would not be comfortable splitting it out between insurance and reinsurance.","Unknown Executive","We did pretty clear with the client, the way which we've talked about it. But that's just specific as we can get.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions here. First, Greg, you talked about looking at some changes to your cat reinsurance program. Can you give us some sense of what you're thinking about doing here? Or could we expect more volatility, less volatility going forward?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure, Brian. First, let me stress, our core reinsurers have been with us a long time, and will continue to be important parts of our seated plans. But I personally, and XL as a whole, have a lot of comfort with alternative sources of capital. You'll recall, we did Cyrus Re for 3 years, and our Bermuda book and reinsurance is quite active, and trading with alternative partners. We see the recent activity in this area, we see supply from this alternative source of capital exceeding demand, and we think we can see some of our peak exposures more efficiently. And to be direct -- to be in your question, we will not to an increased volatility at all. This is to try and reduce the volatility of our book, net after Reinsurance.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then, just 2 other quick ones here. The investment affiliates, big loss in the quarter. Was that Select related to performance or was there some type of write off or something that happened? Seemed awfully large at $19.9 million.","Michael S. McGavick","So it was not a write-off, we\u2019ve got Sarah here, who can get into more detail. But as we mentioned, Q3, as you know, is a pretty bad equity quarter. And we've got investment managers that go above the high-water market, and they go below the high-water market. When those happen, you can get a fairly large delta, but Sarah can add a lot more.","Sarah Elizabeth Street","Yes that's exactly, Pete at the high point. I mean the big number was $20 million from our investment manager affiliates, which effectively, was a reversal. If remember, back in Q2, we have very strong earnings from our investment manager affiliates, and it was because a number of them had gone above the high water marks, so we've got a big pickup. But with a very difficult third quarter, one of them fell back below, and therefore, they had to reverse back or give back basically, the performance fees that they were earning.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then last question, Pete, I wonder, you gave us the new money, what you've got right now, we know what your book yield is. What's the maturity profile look like kind of over the next 12 months for the investment portfolio?","Susan L. Cross","Brian, Pete's pointing to me on that one again. No. I mean in terms -- if we look at the bonds that they're maturing over the next year, along with our estimates of the cash flows that we expect to get back from structured credits, in total, it is about $3.6 billion, and they have an average yield of 3.11%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Randy Binner from FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","On the $100 million expense increase, I'm just trying to understand where that would come through the model? If you can give out, it will just be helpful for modeling, if you can describe kind of the portion that might go through the corporate and other line versus down in the segments?","Michael S. McGavick","Sure, Steve? So why don't you give us a minute to go and collect that.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes, okay.","Michael S. McGavick","And then we'll get back to you. Do you have another question, we'll probably have the answer to the first one by the time you're done with the second one.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, I mean I just want to add, I mean I had another one, thank you. Just on U.S. D&O, in all the descriptions that have happened so far, it seems like losses have been generally benign still, but I thought I also heard commentary that pricing was getting better. So I just wanted to make sure I understood that better. Especially, I'm thinking of large case, U.S. D&O, or our North American D&O, is that the case that losses are  benign but you actually are seeing higher pricing?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes. Absolutely. We're seeing, certainly benign losses around the large events. There is some more noise as I would call it, around smaller claims, particularly, the result mostly just the defense costs. But the line has seen rates come off over the last few years. And we are now seeing the early part of '12 here, the first positive rate movement in that book.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I mean, just to sound a little bit cynical, so why, with benign loss activity, you'd think people would still be soft on price. So is there a kind of a collective recognition that there might be some losses coming down the pike?","Michael S. McGavick","Personally, I don't think so. I think there's a fundamental realization here, that when you look at yields on your investment portfolio of where they are today, and the rate decreases that are piling on the loss cost trends, it have been moving out. When I say small increase, let me be clear, we're still not exceeding loss cost trends, we're not covering that in our rate increases. So I think it's the accumulation of the rate decreases coming through, low investment returns, and a realization that you're not writing this business at a big profit in that kind of economic environment.","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike. I would just add a couple of thoughts. One is, I think as I've observed, the D&O underwriting space overtime, as opposed to general commercial insurance overtime. Maybe it's because they read financial statements all day long, but D&O underwriters tend to be more disciplined. And the down part of their cycles, in my observation of them, tend to get a quicker response. So they've been -- I think, getting into areas they were uncomfortable with, and they're reacting to it, as the market seems to be reacting to that, and I find that very understandable. I think the second thing though, is a  broader comment on where rates are. I wish I think it's worth picking up on this theme. With these investment yields now, continuously locked further in place by the governments around the world, I think underwriters are finally getting it through their heads, that you cannot, cannot keep these rate levels and expect to make much money. I mean, it just -- the paradigm has shifted, and people are slowly, more and more reacting to that. And that's why I think we're seeing this, as I said, it's not a hard market yet, but it's a positive turning market. And people have said, well that will fall back as competition persists, I believe what will happen is people will realize that the baby steps they've taken so far, are insufficient. As against the problem of this historic low, and somewhat locked in for the near-term, yield environment. And I think they're going to have to keep chasing their tail on this until they get it right. We're certainly, going to remain as disciplined as possible as against this yield environment. I also would observe that unlike us, unlike the relative discipline that we have historically and continue  to show on reserves, when I look at the industry, I don't see -- broadly, across the commercial sector, I don't see increasing reserve discipline, not at all. So when you add that in, to this anemic yields, I think you really got to have a newer discipline in underwriting, and I expect that to accelerate as people's results show the effects of this period of time.","Peter R. Porrino","Randy, to get back to your first question, I don't want to give -- be overly precise here, because this level will move around a lot, based on allocations throughout the year. But ballpark, while the $30 million will be in the corporate line and $70 million would be in the operating line. I'm sorry, the other way around.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So the 70 corporate, that's a delta increase, 2012 over 2011, and then 30 is kind of spread among the expense rations basically?","Michael S. McGavick","Just trying to get confirmation. The corporate line, right, would be the 30.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sorry, I thought you switched it back.","Michael S. McGavick","If I miss-said that, I apologize. But the corporate line would be the 30 and the operating line, meaning the Insurance lines, reinsurance would be the 70.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is really the 7 underperforming businesses. I believe you mentioned that's about 20% of your business. So is that 20% of your total business, or is it only of the primary Insurance? And you mentioned that the rest of the businesses were running at sub-95% x cat expire. So it's the onset of the total business or just of the primary Insurance business?","Michael S. McGavick","The 20% figure is of the total global net written premium for the entire P&C business, for the entire business. So Reinsurance and Insurance combined. It would be roughly a quarter of the Insurance premiums.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure, and the 95% of that is only for the insurance, correct?","Michael S. McGavick","That's the whole firm.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's a whole firm as a whole. And the -- when will the underwriting actions taken to help these businesses? What has started early in 2011, and what's your target as to when they'll get an acceptable normalized combined ratio? And would you say that, that's a sub-100%?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, first of all, as a target over time, we do find is just fundamentally unacceptable from any lines of business knowingly over 100. I mean, we have -- that just drives us crazy. Now it will happen from time to time, particularly in casualty driven blocks of business, and some of it can be artificial. I'll give you an example of where it can be artificial. We break up, our reinsurance group by geography. And so for example, with our North American Reinsurance group, we basically take away their opportunities write catastrophe, which we write out of -- largely, out of Bermuda. So that line can look like -- if you looked at it narrowly, you can say, well that's running pretty hot. And in reality, it's running terrific. And if you look at the development overtime, it's running even better. But because we artificially have broken that business up between cat and non-cat, you could fool yourself into thinking it's worse than it is. So that's an example of anomalies that can take place. But generally speaking, we are trying to drive all of our business below 100 combined. And in this rate environment, that's even -- this interest rate environment, that's an even-greater imperative than the normal. So in terms of targets, we certainly don't expect these books of business running over 100 combined. With respect to when they'll take place, I think I have answered that before. And in fact, I noticed a colleague shaking their head at the length of my last answer. So I think getting back, probably get a very strong and negative reaction from the group here. But basically, some of these started in late 2010, some started, and frankly, I can give you the same answer about every quarter up until the last, there's nothing that's new in this quarter. Right now, we're basically, fully locked and loaded on these activities and if anything else pops it's head up, we'll whack that gopher too.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","My second question, I will be quick, is on the prime, Peter favorable development. Your results seem to be actually fairly good. Just curious as to why the level of favorable reserve releases has dropped off in the last couple of quarters? Was it just the year end cleanup? And do you expect a similar level next year?","Michael S. McGavick","I'll take it. Prior quarter, right? We've tried to be clear, we probably didn't do a very good job, but in Q3, would be, we delved to our in-debt analysis, right? So all we do is, it's only in neighbors' e-quarter. It's probably the quarter that would have to the less, least amount of movement during the year. So that one is not surprisingly, went to the prior call about some of the things that happened in the prior year, that caused a larger favorable PYD, than what you would have seen this year.","Susan L. Cross","And I would just say that individual quarter's results, what comes out of that prior development analysis, reflects the unique circumstances of what emerges in each of those quarters, you can have results that are somewhat higher or level in terms of prior development on a quarterly basis. And specific to the fourth quarter of 2010, we had some significant favorable development in our professional insurance business, including some releases on the 2006 and prior cash losses, most notably the Enron related cases back from 2001. And then I went through what actually occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011, where we had strengthening in certain classes. So the pluses and minuses in the fourth quarter of '11 were less than those of 2010, but I wouldn't read anything into that, in terms of any trends, because as I mentioned, we have had continued favorable A vs E, actual versus expected emergence, specifically in primary casualty, professional, U.S. Casualty Reinsurance, those are our longer tail lines, and were we take longer to reflect that favorable experience over time, in both our prior developments and in our current year loss pics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike  Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, in regards to the writing agency capital buffer, is the buffer currently larger that it would potentially need to be due to XL's historical earnings volatility? So said another way, is there an element of the company's past that's suppressing excess capital, which could dissipate over time?","Michael S. McGavick","No.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And any color on how to think about potential affiliate investment returns assessed in '12?","Michael S. McGavick","This is Sarah. I mean, we still believe that the alternative portfolio can be generating an 8% to 10% return over the fourth cycle. Clearly, last year, it ran at the lower level than that. But we're also optimistic that over the long term, that the 8% to 10% will get generated, and certainly, that put our 3-year and 5-year and 10-year track record show.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One quick question and one maybe a bigger picture, Mike, you talked about 95% sort of being the dividing line between the troubled lines of business and not. Is the 95% command ratio enough? Is that low enough to generate an appropriate ROE?","Michael S. McGavick","It isn't our target. I'm just making the point that there is a really significant delta of performance difference between most of our book and those businesses that require some very intense attention. So that's the -- and the relatively small portion that is that. But no, I wouldn't not tell you that a 95 is our goal. Given the more Specialty nature of our book of business overall, given its complex risk characteristics, I would expect to see this business in -- and let's normalized per cycle conditions, because obviously, you're going to run hotter at the time like this, when this prolonged period of soft pricing. But I would really expect to see this book operating more around the 90 than a 95.","Peter R. Porrino","The only thing I would add, Meyer, this is Pete, would be, as you listen to Susan's talk discussion about reserve in Mike's comments as well, we try to be really prudent when we go and set reserves. And when said that our accident near loss ratios, we certainly are expecting that they are not going to trend up anything they would trend the other way.","Michael S. McGavick","That's a really good point, it would be, in normal times, kind of expected for us to have our accent here. Be it worse than our target in our calendar year, to be the number that reflected our goals more accurately.","Unknown Analyst","And second, recalling the 20% of businesses in these troubled lines, what was the percentage of premiums in 2010 in those 7 lines?","Michael S. McGavick","I don't have that on top of my head, but I know for sure, it would be higher.  Those have been reducing.","Operator","Our final question comes from Josh Stirling, Sanford C. Beinstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","This is a great granular focus that you guys are getting us on your efforts in the 7 lines of business. And I was trying to do the math, and I presume, you won't give us the number, but from what it backs into, it sounds like you're sort of clearly well, well above 100 in these lines. And I'm curious, should we view this as sort of XL specific, rate and underwriting issues in these lines of business, or is this more of the generally deteriorating environment that  are going to be industry phenomenon, and then I guess, the related question, assuming it isn't just sort of some additional, sort of catch-up or sort of fixing things, that you guys are doing is,  do you feel like that they're making these changes in line with your competitors, or your sort of ahead or behind the same sort of things you see playing out?","Michael S. McGavick","I'm going to start with a couple of general comments. But I want to ask Greg to get into it a bit more. As has been my answer pretty consistently, it really depends on the line of business. I'll give you an example of one where I think XL can really do a much better business, job. And I'm really determined and pleased with what I see so far, is our global property business. I really think there -- some of the issues are XL issues, and we can fix, in fact, you heard Greg mentioned, one area where I think we can do a better job in applying some of the knowledge we had in our reinsurance lines around how to treat flood. So there, I would describe as idiosyncratically disappointed. And that's a pretty sizable block of the premium that we're talking about. In other lines, what you're seeing now is really a reflection of what's going on in the marketplace. So for example, in risk management, where you have guaranteed cost comp, that deterioration has been noted by the market very broadly, and I would say, our actual rate of deterioration is comparable, or maybe not even as bad. It's just not satisfying to us, relative to what we know we can deliver in that business. So there  you really have something that's going on more broadly in the marketplace, and where our actions are, we think potentially, can give us a leading result. I'm going to stop there, because I'm at risk of giving everything I know Greg will talk about, but it really -- it is syncretic, and it would really depend by line. Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Let me speak specifically about when you hit programs. When you get a program wrong, you're going to be  the only one on it,  you're the only issuing character, in almost every case, except for some very large MGAs where they might have multiple characters. So there, we might have gotten 1 or 2 wrong, and so we're going to have to shift our way out, and that's going to be a specific XL issue. I'd just touch it a little bit more on the international property piece. The market is making it difficult for us though. We were able to achieve a 3% rate increase as of January 1, but we still have a lot of competitors that are offering rate decreases. And more troubling, as we've said to you before, we're not doing LTAs anymore, we lost more business because competitors are offering LTAs than we did because we couldn't get to the right rate. So it's always going to be a little bit of everything.","Unknown Analyst","That's really helpful. And if I could shift to sort of a more optimistic note, can you just help us think about the relative order of magnitude of the growth that you're likely to see this year? How much of it is likely to be from new -- some from the very sort of new initiatives that you guys are pursuing, new teams, new lines of business, things like that versus merely repricing the book?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, it's hard to break that out specifically, especially on the team side, because that's how opportunistic of great team in a line that we analyzed we're intrigued by, could come at any time in the year, because that one's really impossible to forecast. And as a result, it's hard to break it by percentage, because you don't know when you're going to get those opportunities. In general, I would expect that next year, the story will be more driven by rate. Because I see rate moving broadly, more favorably than I see opportunistic growth. The only caveat to that is a couple of our lines, like let's say, North American property, we've really analyzed that we have some really great results over time and some real opportunity. And just to be clear, when you get deeply into the numbers, sometimes, this is where it can't always pay off to get too deep on XL's number. I'll give an example. You can find losses that will show up on the yellow apparels is in the U.S., if you choose to dig that far. But what you won't know, is that the originating office of that account was European, and it's written on a global program basis. And it's the European underwriting operations on property that we have this really intense opportunity around, not the North American group that has done a really quite good job over time. And where we actually analyze with some additional pockets of growth, are really going to help us remix the books. So I'm sorry to give an answer that's not real specific.   Rate. Generally, will drive more of the story. I think next year, but you could get opportunistic, it depends on what comes available to us.","Unknown Analyst","I guess, the one final follow-up I'd ask related to that is, if you just look back at the last quarter, I think you said it was HI after adjusting, I think it was 5% growth rate, if I have that correctly. Do you still have a sense of how much of that is sort of the new initiatives taking off? Or again, sort of just getting more price on your same book?","Michael S. McGavick","In the fourth quarter, specifically, across the whole insurance portfolio, that number would've been driven more by some of the new initiatives than the rate. We have pockets of rate, but it wouldn\u2019t, if I had to guess, 20% would be rate and 80% would be new initiatives. That's not a percentage of calculation.","Michael S. McGavick","Sorry to have you even more, but you've noticed in this whole call, we're trying to be very granular because we knew there'd be questions, and we really like our story, and we felt it was important to get very granular, so you would understand why we are pleased. The bottom line on that last comment, where we talked about -- so much of our business is in U.S. D& O. So when you have this negative rate trend during the year last year, it was undoing the positive rate we were achieving everywhere else, and the rate, the positive rate improvement that we're starting to see in U.S. D&O, is a  1 1 phenomena, not a fourth quarter phenomena. So you haven't seen that start to change it, and contribute to better rate picture overall. So just a nuance  that I thought I' d make sure you understood.","Operator","At this time, I'm showing no further questions.","Michael S. McGavick","Well, I just want to close by thanking everyone. We know we stayed over our ordinary time on the call. But then we expected to given the way the quarter played out. We continue to focus on the long-term health of this franchise. We continue to be very disciplined about how we build a very solid book of business. And we believe that this quarter, in a strange way, the quarter actually confirmed the places that we have been putting our energy into as opportunities for improving XL, both in terms of where we're growing, and in terms of where we have these intense, re-underwriting activities taking place. And we are certainly looking forward to quarters in the future, when we can increasingly describe that those events that have taken place, as we have indicated to you tonight, we will. We thank you for the extra time and attention, and look forward to our visits throughout the year next year.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised this conference is being recorded.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David Radulski - Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Laura. And welcome to the earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2016. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlgroup.com. Note that on July 25, 2016, we completed our re-domestification from Ireland to Bermuda, and XL Group Ltd. is now our public parent company.","However, as the quarter ended June 30, the results discussed today are those of XL Group plc. We posted to our website several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement. We also remind you that we use our website as a means of disclosing material information from time to time and encourage you to monitor our Investor Relations web page.","On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results; followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team; and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of the Reinsurance Operations, will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions.","Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K, as well as other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good evening, and thank you for joining our call. Tonight, as is our normal practice, I'll share some highlights from the quarter results; Pete will discuss the financials; and then Greg and Paul will go through the Insurance and Reinsurance segments retrospectively.","Turning to our results. The most notable aspect of the quarter, as it has been for the entire sector, was the high level of catastrophes. We pre-announced our losses of $240 million due to these events back on July 13. Major sources of loss were the wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta, the earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador, and U.S. and European storms. These events reduced our second quarter operating earnings by $0.84 per share, as you'll hear in greater detail from Greg and from Paul. These losses were in line with our expectations and in line with, or below, our market share. And it is noteworthy that both segments turned a profit despite these losses.","Turning then to our underlying performance in the quarter, we would say, simply, this is more like it. The quarter was largely free of distortions related to the Catlin acquisition, and many of the metrics suggest that we have taken an important step forward in the right direction.","Despite the cat events, and including $52 million in integration costs, in the second quarter, XL Catlin generated $0.37 in operating earnings per share and grew fully diluted tangible book value per share by 3.6%. XL Catlin's ex-cat accident year P&C combined ratio of 90.3% was an improvement of 1.8 points from the first quarter of the year, and 2 points from the second quarter a year ago. These improvements came from both operating and underwriting discipline.","Let me focus briefly on underwriting discipline. You've heard us often comment that we believe that this combination of XL and Catlin has really changed our relationship to the market. We know that the way clients and brokers think about us is truly different. And as a result, we have been given the opportunity to write things that neither XL nor Catlin would have seen before. And what we're seeing now is the effect of these new opportunities and the effect of our discipline, come together.","You'll hear in a moment from Paul that when you take out programs we're exiting, the growth rate in Insurance was actually about 5%. So, why would we be having that success? Well, submission volume is up from our top broker partners, and we are quoting a commensurate more amount. But our hit ratio, the amount that we actually write when we quote, has stayed flat, meaning we're finding about the same portion that we are willing to write on our conditions, but we're getting a greater volume to select from.","This gives me comfort that we are not chasing business, as does our system of backchecking price adequacy. This is the hallmark of the underwriting discipline. And while this progress has been building quarter-over-quarter, it is exactly the kind of thing that we believe we should be able to continue to produce, even accelerate, as our underwriting teams are really hitting their strides. We are very proud of the hard work of our underwriters and their support teams in these difficult market conditions.","Before I turn it over to Pete to discuss our financial results, I'll make two brief comments on other important topics that I'm sure are on your minds. First is Brexit. We believe we are well-prepared, as well-prepared as possible for this outcome, that we have thought about the future possibilities, and that we're in a great position to respond accordingly to whatever develops.","Second, our parent company moved to Bermuda, which was completed as of Monday. Bermuda has served as a base for global insurance and reinsurance providers for decades and has, in the Bermuda Monetary Authority, a proven world-class regulator.","XL has had substantial operations in Bermuda for 30 years and, of course, it was the corporate home for Catlin before our companies joined. So our integration, combined with Bermuda receiving full Solvency II equivalents early this year, made this a very logical move, which we think will serve the company well. We are pleased to be there.","It is worth noting, from a day-per-day perspective our clients, brokers, counterparties and partners should see no change in how we work with them. And as we said before, we expect no material impact to our future results or global effective tax rate as a result of this move.","So in sum, positive progress showed in the numbers in the second quarter. We are determined that it will continue.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating net income for the second quarter was $106 million or $0.37 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $246 million or $0.84 per share in the second quarter of 2015, which included two months of the legacy Catlin operations.","As indicated in our July 13 8-K, our natural catastrophe losses for the second quarter totaled $240 million compared to $60 million in the prior-year quarter. The largest of these events, the wildfires in and around Fort McMurray, accounted for approximately half of our estimate of catastrophe losses for the quarter. During the second quarter, we incurred $52 million in integration costs, which are included in our operating income.","For the quarter, our property and casualty combined ratio was 96%, or 6.1 points higher than the same quarter last year, again primarily driven by those catastrophe losses. As Mike noted, our ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 90.3%, or 2 points better than the same period last year. Paul and Greg will discuss our underwriting results in further detail.","As discussed on previous calls, the second and fourth quarters are significant reserve valuation quarters, and as a result, we react appropriately to any development indications identified during those in-depth reviews.","Prior-year net development in the second quarter was a favorable $99 million, or 3.9 loss ratio points for the quarter, compared to net favorable development of $109 million or 5.3 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $34 million in the Insurance segment and favorable development of $65 million in the Reinsurance segment.","Operating expenses have remained generally flat compared to the first quarter of this year and slightly higher than the second quarter of 2015, due to legacy Catlin costs being included only from May 2015 onward. We continue to view full year overall expense levels and integration expense levels as in line with the estimates provided in our 8-K filed in June.","Our estimated operating tax rate to ordinary shareholders remains consistent with the 10% to 12% we noted in April, with adjustments to the prior-year tax revisions lowering the six-month rate to 8.8%. Our annualized operating ROE, excluding integration costs in AOCI, was 5.7% for the six-month ended June 30, 2016, and was significantly impacted by the catastrophe losses in the second quarter.","Turning to the investment portfolio, and as usual, my comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income was $176 million, in line with the same quarter last year and greater than the $164 million in the previous quarter. While the low interest rate environment continue to pressure net investment income, the second quarter benefited to a modest extent from some non-recurring factors, including certain amortization adjustments.","Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure, as we have approximately $3.1 billion of assets with book yields of 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. During the second quarter, our average new money rate was 1.7%.","The gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio at the end of June was 2.3%, virtually unchanged from the first quarter. The duration of the fixed income and cash portfolio was 3.3 years at the end of the quarter, marginally higher than the prior-year quarter, mainly due to cash being put to work.","Total affiliate income was $35 million for the quarter compared to $41 million in the prior-year quarter. While our hedge fund affiliate portfolio broke even for the quarter, it did not meet its benchmarks. Many of our funds pursuing quantitative equity strategies were challenged, and several of our directional equity funds did not fully capture the market rally.","On a year-to-date basis, our hedge fund portfolio continues to outperform its benchmark, and we continue to believe that a modest allocation to this asset class improves our overall risk adjusted returns. Our private equity, strategic and other operating affiliates posted relatively strong equity earnings. Our investment manager affiliates contributed $15 million (11:14) to affiliate income with the gain on the sale of an individual position being an important contributor.","Unrealized net gains were $1.14 billion at the end of the quarter. The total mark-to-market return on investments was 1.5% for the quarter in original currency. The favorable return was driven by lower rates, which more than offset the adverse impact in credit spread widening.","Looking forward, we expect financial markets to remain volatile over the near to mid-term, and we will continue to monitor our portfolios closely, as a result. And with respect to the capital management, we continue to execute share buybacks during the second quarter.","Our board of directors approved a new share buyback program at our May meeting authorizing the purchase of up to $1 billion of our ordinary shares, replacing the remaining amounts under our previous share buyback authorization. During the quarter, we purchased 9.7 million shares for $328 million at an average price of $34 per share, leaving $816 million available for purchase under our share buyback program.","This accelerated rate of buyback represents the completion of the additional $250 million we discussed in April, as well as a slight acceleration of our 2016 target given current market conditions. We continue to view these buybacks as an efficient capital management tool and remain focused on ensuring that our overall financial leverage moves towards our target levels over the next few years.","And I'll now turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results.","Paul Brand - Chief Underwriting Officer-Insurance & Chair-Insurance Leadership Team","Thanks, Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segments, provide an update on current market conditions and finish with some comments on premiums and expense management.","First, the results. I am pleased to report our 14th consecutive quarter of profitability dating back to Q1 2013, despite the higher cat activity we experienced during the quarter. The segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 96.4%, compared to 97% in Q2 2015, and 96.5% last quarter.","Higher cat expense of $97 million, compared to $60 million in Q2 2015, and slightly lower prior year reserve releases of $34 million, compared to $38 million last year were more than offset by material improvements in the underwriting expense ratio of 1.8 points and the accident-year ex-cat loss ratio of 1.1 points. On accident quarter ex-cat basis, the combined ratio was 92.6%, compared to 95.4% in Q2 2015 and 95% last quarter.","For Q2, we reported an acquisition ratio of 13.7%, compared to 12.9% in Q2 2015 and 14.1% reported last quarter. This is more in line with the guidance provided last quarter. The reason for the slight increase over prior year is because Q2 2015 only reflected two months of the Catlin business, which included a larger share of wholesale specialty business where the gross acquisition costs are higher and the loss ratio is lower than the legacy XL business.","This increase in acquisition ratio is largely offset by a Q2 operating expense ratio of 18.1%, which was 2.6 points lower than Q2 2015 and by a net accident-year ex-cat loss ratio of 60.8%, which was 1.1 points lower than Q2 2015.","Pricing has remained broadly consistent at minus 3% for the quarter. Our casualty line showed flat pricing in the quarter. Our professional and specially businesses were both down 3% reflecting continued competitive conditions in the North American professional, aviation, and crisis management lines. And our energy, property and construction businesses were down 5%.","Insurance gross premiums written in Q2 increased by 13% or $292 million year-over-year driven mostly from the Catlin acquisition, where we had three months of the Catlin business in the quarter versus only two months in Q2 2015. When we look at both legacy organizations and normalized for foreign exchange, our actual year-over-year growth was circa 1% in Q2.","However, when you consider the portfolio tuning activities we started in 2015, where as mentioned previously, decisions were made to exit certain underperforming businesses, totaling approximately $100 million in the quarter, we see growth in the range of 5%, and 3% on a year-to-date basis.","This underlying growth whilst the market remains difficult our underwriters continue to leverage our enhanced capabilities and stronger market presence post the transaction into finding new profitable opportunities.","Driving some of these opportunities was also the addition of new talent as Q2 was a strong quarter for new leaders of both existing and new businesses.","We recruited Dan Riordan to lead our global political risk trade and credit business, Patrick Corbett joined to head our new retail accident health business, Simon Mobey we've added to head our Ultra High Net Worth, Brian Benjamin joined to launch our global merger and acquisitions businesses, and Stephen Oh was recruited to lead our excess and surplus lines business. We fully expect these new leaders and businesses to add further profitable growth to the segment in both the short and long-term.","For the insurance segment, ceded premiums written in the quarter were $732 million compared to $818 million in Q2 2015. This represents 29.1% of GPW compared to 36.8% in Q2 2015 and 39.9% reported in Q1 2016. As mentioned last quarter, the ceded written premium line reflects some changes in the way we purchase our reinsurance program, the timing of our reinsurance program purchasing as we move towards an enterprise wide reinsurance program.","On a year-to-date basis, our cession ratio was 34.5% compared to 35.7% in 2015, and we expect it to further reduce as the full year unfolds and we fully transition to our enterprise wide reinsurance program. The benefits of which will continue to deliver better value to our shareholders by sustainably improving the group's risk return profile with strong coordination across our wider capital strategy.","It is essential that we react to the top line challenges by carefully managing expenses. In the quarter, we selectively exited another 35 positions for a total of over 70 positions during the first half, as we continue to streamline our underwriting capabilities across our divisions and regions.","While some of the expense savings from these actions are reflect in the quarter, additional savings will flow through in subsequent quarters along with other efficiency initiatives that are currently underway.","In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We continued to grow the book and made significant progress on our efficiency and portfolio management initiatives. And we fully expect this to continue as margin expansion remains our primary focus.","And now to Greg, to discuss the reinsurance results.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","Thanks, Paul. Today I'll discuss the results for the quarter with added color on property catastrophe losses and summarize current market conditions.","Beginning with the results, the reinsurance segment produced acceptable underwriting performance given the property catastrophe activity with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 95.1%, compared with 74.5% for the second quarter of last year. The result for the quarter experienced favorable prior year development, increased accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio and property catastrophe losses, offset by a lower expense ratio.","Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $65 million, compared to $71 million a year ago. As Pete noted, in the second quarter, we completed a full review of our reserves and the releases were primarily in casualty classes. This quarter we see the impact of the aligned parameters and reserving assumptions across both legacy companies for prior and current accident years. Further, our actual versus expected analysis was favorable across both legacy portfolios.","The reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 54.4%, which compares to 50% in the second quarter of 2015. The increase is driven primarily by last year's harmonized accident year loss ratio picks across the combined segment particularly in the casualty treaty and property catastrophe exposed portfolios. As we have noted in previous calls, XL Catlin's philosophy on reserving is to take bad news quickly and allow good news to fully season.","In particular, for property catastrophe exposed treaties, we allow for the seasonality of exposure and a lag for delayed reporting from our clients. Further, within the reinsurance segment, we recorded attritional cat losses in the accident year ex-cat loss ratio. This produces a higher accident year ex-cat loss ratio in the first half of the year relative to the second half. This can be seen in the historical accident year ex-cat quarter loss ratios for the legacy XL portfolio.","Catastrophe losses totaled $143 million, net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter, compared to no catastrophe losses in the second quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter resulted from numerous events and produced between $15 billion and $20 billion of market insured loss around the globe.","For context, we estimated that XL Catlin Re has roughly a 2.5% share of the $150 billion global property and casualty reinsurance market and between 4% and 5% of the $20 billion to $25 billion catastrophe excess of loss market. While a precise reinsured market loss estimate is difficult to calculate, we are satisfied that our losses in the quarter were at or below our market share.","As we have noted previously, our combined catastrophe portfolio will produce higher nominal dollars of loss relative to the legacy XL book, but it is a better diversified portfolio. Expense ratio decreased 4.7 points to 30.6% in the second quarter compared to 35.3% for the second quarter of 2015. This decrease is primarily driven by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies earned through. Further we saw a 1.9 point drop in our acquisition expense as the impact from purchase accounting begins to diminish.","Turning to top line, gross written premiums for the quarter was $1.02 billion, up from $782 million in the second quarter of 2015 with the increase driven by the Catlin acquisition. April 1 was the last renewal to complete as a combined company, and we were able to grow our share of the Japanese market, contributing $221 million of new business across the segment. This is offset by continued underwriting discipline as we non-renewed nearly $100 million of premium due to unacceptable pricing or terms.","And finally, a long standing client decided to retain a quarter share treaty which resulted in just over $80 million of non-renewed premium. On a combined basis for the full quarter, our top line grew 2% after adjusting for foreign exchange and reinstatement premiums.","Shifting to reinsurance market conditions, we found the pricing environment challenging, with rate decreases continued to decelerate in most lines and regions, and we appear to be reaching a bottom in many classes of business. During the quarter, rates for the segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 3% this quarter, significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015.","For the remainder of the property treaty book, rates were also down 3%. Our casualty business renewed essentially flat over last year and the remainder of our classes were flat to down low single digits.","Overall, the U.S. short-tail and global casualty treaty markets resisted any meaningful reductions on renewals as many placements were repriced or failed to reach their target placement.","In summary, the second quarter results were acceptable for the reinsurance segment. Despite increased connectivity, we were able to generate an underwriting profit in the quarter. Underwriting teams continue to do an excellent job retaining profitable business and finding new opportunities, while maintaining underwriting discipline. Underwriting in our second year together, we're well positioned for success given the strong support from our clients and brokers.","I'll now turn it back to David.","David Radulski - Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations","Laura, can you open the lines for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good evening. Thank you. First question on the expense ratio side, it looks like material improvements year-over-year as well as comparing with the first quarter. Could you talk a bit more about what are the sources of this like the improvements as well as the sustainability of it? Are we expecting those ratio or (25:13) in absolute dollar amount go even lower given that Paul talk about that the some of the reduction were yet to earn us through going forward?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Mike. Hi. Thanks. A couple of things. First of all, we are continuing to execute on our synergy program, and that benefit continues to grow in its impact over time depending, of course, on the timing of departures, the timing of shutdowns of systems. All those things that we've been doing have a growing impact on into next year.","So those are the sources, and those are the reasons that it continues to grow, is its just timing of the execution. We have had some continuing activity, as Paul described, and those just kind of go on top of what we've done before and continue to earn out again according to the actual departure dates or shutdowns of operations.","So we do expect the expense ratio and the absolute level expenses to be able to continue to decline. Of course, in the end, expense ratios are a coefficient between what goes on with the top line and that absolute level of expense. And there we are seeing some meaningful growth, as you would have heard. When you x out programs that we're exiting our insurance operations, for example, grew about 5%, we saw some growth in the reinsurance segment as well. And so that can have a continuing improvement effect on the ratio.","In terms of the absolute level of expense, we remain on track to deliver what we said we would deliver, as we issued in the 8-K, where we gave you a forecast all the way through to next year. I would only add one other thought, and that is the \u2013 I think if there's one point that I've made over time, but I don't know that I've made it emphatically enough, when we established that 8-K level of expense for next year, that was based on a series of presumptions about what volume of premium we'd be working with, because, of course, some costs are variable and some are fixed.","But I want to make it clear that if, for some reason, and I wouldn't forecast it today, but if for some reason, we see the market get from here even more difficult than it has been, and you've heard both Greg and Paul talk about some decline in the rate of deterioration or in Greg's case perhaps reaching a bottom in some lines. But if it were to suddenly get worse again, we would expect to get beneath the absolute level of expense that we put out in that 8-K. We would have to drive our expenses down to match what the market delivers in terms of top line.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Then second question on the underlying loss ratio. It shows some improvement, 100 basis point in the insurance operation. Why some deterioration on the reinsurance side? You mentioned like three drivers, harmonization of the reserve, practice as a mix, as well as the rates. Could you talk a little bit more about each of these buckets, how much contribute to that? And as regarding to the harmonization process, are we done, since we are already at sort of like anniversary of your merger close?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Two quick things, then I'm going to turn it over to Greg and then to Paul. First, with respect to the harmonization process, that was actually completed at the end of last year. There's been no additional work in that regard. What Greg is commenting on is that some of the impact of the higher loss ratio picks for this year, that work having been done at the beginning of the year, now starts showing up relative to last year's lower picks. But generally speaking, that harmonization work is done, and we continue to be very pleased with where the loss ratios are going across both segments.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Kai, before I start, a little preface, attribution to any one of these three categories I'm going to give you is difficult with the reinsurance portfolio. They're large, chunky treaties. A handful of them can impact the outcome of any subset of our book, but in looking at the 4.4% increase, that attributed roughly 40% to the intersection of cat and non-cat in our property portfolios. 40% to the casualty treaty, initial accident year loss pick, and about 20% to rate and mix.","So let me start with the cat and non-cat. Step back for a moment, in the financial supplement, we have two lines in there that really are impacted predominantly by property catastrophes. The property cat line, which is the pure excess of loss cat reinsurance that we write, and the property treaty line, which is the pro risk and the pro rata, which has both cat and non-cat exposures in it.","So with that property treaty book, we set a loss ratio pick for the year that's comprised of cat, large loss, and attritional. And as the quarters unfold, we tend to react \u2013 not react to reported experience, particularly because it's very limited early in the year, and instead to prefer to true that up at the end of the year.","And so it's in line with our bad news fast, good news slow philosophy that you see that \u2013 what I referred to, which is higher in the first half of the year, lower in the second half of the year. Of course, I would not be doing my job if I didn't point out, future loss activity could happen that would vary this outcome, depending upon how losses broke.","The second piece is the casualty. And quite simply, our casualty treaty portfolio, relative to last year, the legacy Catlin business is now set at a higher initial pick, in line with the legacy XL book. This increase was established during the fourth quarter of last year, which was another full review quarter and where we harmonized our accident year picks, which Mike just talked about. We then project that forward to the current accident year, which we've done. And then here again, we allow this to season over a number of years, to make sure any good news that might emerge is real and solid.","And finally the third piece, rate and mix. Rate, as we've been talking about, has been down over the last two years. So you're seeing a little bit of a small impact from that in increase to loss ratios in 2016. And mix has impacted the loss ratio a bit, although it's not really mix across those different segments of the portfolio. It's within the segment, certain treaties that we've written, that might \u2013 because a number of these classes, particularly casualty, we roll our accident year pick up by treaty. So, the mix of how those break in a given year will be impacted.","So, intersection property cat and non-cat, casualty treaty portfolio, rate and mix. And I think this is just a very prudent way to run our book for long-term success.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","Paul?","Paul Brand - Chief Underwriting Officer-Insurance & Chair-Insurance Leadership Team","Yes. I mean, as we've talked about before, we started sort of re-underwriting even before (31:56) came together. I think that the impact of some of those actions around exiting some of our (32:02) business and it takes a bit of time for that to start to earn through into the loss ratio, because you obviously still have the unearned premium to earn through. We're also very focused, in terms of additional underwriting actions that we can take. We got a big lift in terms of how we think about pricing and portfolio analysis by bringing the businesses together. And we've been working on some of those insights, and that is starting to show through in the numbers in the second quarter.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The only thing I'd add in closing this is that, with respect to the insurance segment. We \u2013 while we are seeing the benefit of actions taken last year and into this year, we don't think we're done with our ability to continue to improve, despite the headwinds we're facing.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Last one, if I may. If we look at buyback, so far $800 million to $683 million year-to-date, and your full year target is $950 million. I just wonder how you sort of like \u2013 are we expecting a much slower pace in the second half, or is there some upside to the full year guidance?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well just \u2013 this is Mike. I'll start and hand it over to Pete. First, just to remember where we were. We had said at the beginning of the year we thought it'd be around $700 million for the year. We did note in the second quarter \u2013 or in the first quarter call, that we had decided to do another batch of $250 million that was executed quite quickly. In response, in essence to our reforecast of what we thought the top line would do, based on what we saw in the first quarter and what we've seen, so we tried to make sure that we were not holding capital that we didn't think we would need to support growth. So that was an isolated $250 million to add to that $700 million. Pete?","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, hey Kai. The year-to-date, the $683 million, right, one way to think about that is, first half of the year we had initially, as Mike said, targeted $700 million. And so that would have been $350 million of a buyback, if we would've done a pro rata, which was the plan, and then the additional $250 million which we completed, to get to the $600 million. So we are $83 million above that. I did mention in my comments about an acceleration. I would expect, given where our shares are trading, that that acceleration will continue. At some point in the future, we will talk about whether or not the $950 million should go up. The only comment I'd make there is that, right now, is sort of the minimum target, but we're not, at least at this point, ready to go and say that it will go above the $950 million.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kai, the way we think about this is, as we always have, we start with our required capital. We add a buffer. Then we decide what we could do with anything above that. So we're on the same philosophy we've always been on.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good luck.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jay Cohen from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. I guess on the reinsurance side, the acquisition expense ratio did come down. That number has jumped around a bit. I'm wondering, if we look at the 2Q number, is that a reasonable run rate at this point, or will it tick down a little bit more?","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","There is very little impact left in there from the purchase accounting, so it should be for the second quarter mix of business, Jay, it's a reasonable run rate. Remember each quarter does change. So you'll get a bit of a different impact from the first quarter, the second quarter and so forth.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great. And then on the overhead, the G&A expenses, in the segment, it did look like the absolute value came down from first quarter to second quarter. On the corporate side, taking out the integration expenses, it looked like it may have ticked up. Was there some reallocation there?","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jay. It's Pete. No. Last quarter, I commented a little bit on the expenses. One, that the first quarter total expenses were a little lower than run rate because of some, I'll call it, accruals we made at 12\/31 that we didn't fully need. And I also commented that our corporate expenses, mostly as a result of that, were lower than what you would expect, mostly for timing. And in this quarter, that timing reversed. I would say the corporate expenses are higher than what I would say the normal run rate would be. And so therefore, you would have seen that allocation change a little bit to the segment, but not in a material amount. The difference from quarter-to-quarter for corporate was about $20 million-odd, right, and if \u2013 and again, as I think about corporate going forward, it'll be a little bit less than what we had in this quarter so far, but not materially. And so the work in (37:00) allocation change it was more just the way that the accruals ran through the corporate segment.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's really helpful, Pete. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is now open.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. First question, here. Paul, you mentioned in your commentary about the reinsurance purchasing and how it benefits shareholders from a risk adjusted return perspective. I'm just curious, how should we think about that from a modeling purposes or kind of think about looking at it going forward? Should we expect lower cat loads? How should I think about that from my perspective, an outsider's perspective?","Paul Brand - Chief Underwriting Officer-Insurance & Chair-Insurance Leadership Team","Sure. And I think it's \u2013 it's quite a good time to be thinking about ways we can enhance and improve our reinsurance buying. I mean, I would expect to see that absolutely. There's an interplay between how much volatility we want to take on our own balance sheet versus how much that we want to have on reinsurers or other types of third-party capital.","We should also start to see this working through and potentially helping with loss ratios as well. So we go through quite an exhaustive set of discussions around what the optimal points for some of these things are, and that depends upon our view of risk, our view of prices and the availability of different reinsurance products. But it's easier to make improvements at the moment than as other times.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And then another just quick question, Paul. You guys do a fair amount of professional liability. What does the loss trend look like in that line of business right now? I mean, we saw a big pickup in class-action litigation in the second quarter. Any concerns about that?","Paul Brand - Chief Underwriting Officer-Insurance & Chair-Insurance Leadership Team","We're not seeing that coming through in our numbers at the moment. I mean, it is \u2013 I mean, clearly, it is something that we're watching. I mean, we've seen things like this happen before. And so we're aware of how to underwrite our way around it. But, as I say, not seeing that in our numbers yet but definitely something we watch for.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good evening. Last quarter, I think you pushed back the timing on getting to a double-digit ROE. And this quarter it seems like if you take the earnings x the integration cost and normalize the cap, you're nearly at a double-digit ROE. So are you more optimistic on the timing of achieving that goal?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Mike. Obviously that was a noteworthy exchange last time around. So I'm going to be particularly thoughtful as I answer you. As you look at the quarter, and you could do a number of your own calculations to try and figure it out, you'll notice that the key drivers that we're really focused on and that we can operate to, whether gross written premium, whether expenses, whether technical ratio, the loss ratio, and our capital management activities, all of them in this quarter are moving in the right direction. That said, we're mindful of how we felt about last quarter and how the world felt about last quarter.","So my view is that projecting exactly when we'll cross that line is really not a useful conversation today. I'm looking forward to that conversation based on what we learn in the next quarter as well, but I will tell you these trends are obviously more pleasing and we remain absolutely committed to, even in this difficult part of the cycle, operating and achieving that level of performance.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks. And then just a couple of numbers questions. On the investment and operating affiliate earnings, is 2Q a good run rate for that number? Was there anything unusual in there?","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry. Couldn't hear you, sorry, which ones?","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Operating and investment affiliate income?","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I would have said in the operating, no, there wasn't anything significant in there. In the investment manager one, there was the gain that I mentioned before that was a significant component to that. And that was about $11 million worth.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thank you for answering my questions, and congratulations on a good quarter. So my first question, following up on something that Jay Cohen said, you noted that the expense ratio in terms of the operating costs for the reinsurance business that would be a good run rate for the second quarter. Does that mean we're getting to the bottom of where you can apply synergies and cost saves in the reinsurance segment? Or why can't that get better from here?","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","So, Josh, as I heard Jay's question, it was on acquisition costs. Not on the operating costs, so I answered....","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe I heard it wrong then.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","If I misunderstood, then I apologize to Jay and to you. Our operating expenses, I'll let Pete take that.","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think Greg, on your ratio, I mean we did have an increase in earned premium, right. And we do those ratios on earned premium, not on written premium. And so I do think that there was sort of a reduction in the second quarter versus the first quarter and whether or not that continues, that one, Greg, you may have a view on. But there was \u2013 you could see a big increase in the earned premium that drove that ratio down.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And I remember (43:35) trying to think about that going forward, that it's materially lower than the first quarter, but a lot of that growth is tough for me to see because there's Catlin volume in there. Do you have any help thinking about how that should be maybe seasonally or as thinking one year ahead, where you'd be on an annual basis?","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So this is Pete, Josh. Let me start and I'll hand it back to Greg. And I'll handle the expense side of the ratio and then I'll let Greg handle the premium side of the ratio. The expense work that is being done is obviously going across both segments and corporate. We still have a ways to go. I mean if you look at the 8-K that we put out there, we expect on an absolute dollar basis that our 2017 expenses are going to be between $70 million and $80 million less than our 2016 expenses, right. And that will be done partially within reinsurance and partially within corporate that gets allocated to reinsurance. And so from an expense point of view, I absolutely expect the expenses are going to go down and therefore the ratios go down. And I'll turn it over to Greg if you want to talk about the premium side.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","Yeah. And reinsurance is a lumpy business. And in this quarter one of the pieces of business that we were fortunate enough to lead for a core client had a component of retrospective and a component of prospective nature to it. So we earned more premium in the quarter on that retrospective piece then we normally would. So there's no good way to give you a good idea that this was just a piece \u2013 that this is just a piece of this puzzle was the \u2013 that lumpiness of earned premium. And we will have that on reinsurance, as we go quarter-to-quarter.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then in Mike's opening remarks, despite the catastrophe, he said that look, we expect to be about 2.5%, I guess, of the industry loss or what not. Given the new reinsurance purchasing habit and (45:34) whatnot, would you expect that this kind of outcome in the future would be what you're expecting if the events were to repeat, or is there a lesson learned and you might try and come together and trim some exposures?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to let Greg comment on some of the specifics. Let me give you a few really important notions. Number one, the market share Greg will talk about, but our view was that by becoming a leader in the reinsurance marketplace, and particularly in the catastrophe marketplace, where we had a very long track record of extraordinary results, was the way that we could continue to participate effectively in that marketplace given the structural changes that are going on.","So in essence, size is really mattering in reinsurance, and we believe that pushing those expertises into greater concentration would give us an opportunity to ride through those structural changes. The guys that are getting hurt by all the alternative capital coming in are largely the smaller players. So we think we've been well-positioned. We think that also is going to give us the opportunity over time and we've already seen some of this particularly in terms of terms and conditions to lead the market where it needs to go and not just follow it. So we're very pleased with the position. We've sawed it (46:45) intentionally. And we see this quarter, as a reflection of that larger share of market.","Having said that, when it relates to how we consider our reinsurance programs, that reinsurance program is now put together for the whole firm, and we could therefore, are able, as Paul noted, to cede less with what we think is actually better protection to our peak exposures and better protection to the overall loss experience.","So we already are seeing the benefits to those lower cessions of profits, and we think equal to or better protections for the firm. How individual cats play out is a whole different story. You never know what zone you're going to get hit in, how that fits with the whole story. But this quarter we would tell you this came out as expected. It came out relative to our market share or better across the various events.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","Yeah. And Josh, this is Greg. On that 2.5%, that's a gross market share of the total P&C reinsurance market. And then the add-on to that is on share of property cat as a loss, we have about a 4% to 5% share. So this loss is a blend of those two books. When I look at this, if I'm really forcing to estimate in a re market loss, I'd give you a much broader range than I gave you on the industry loss. So the $15 billion to $20 billion industry loss could be around about $5 billion to $7.5 billion of reinsured market loss. And when we look at your numbers, we have $167 million of gross loss in the current quarter events from these cats, and that gives us about a 2% to 3.5% market share, some refrain between that 2.5% overall market share and the 4% to 5% cat market share. So that's roughly the math we went through to how we felt good about where we are on these events.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, thank you for all the color. It's quite in depth and once again congratulations.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much. I guess a couple questions. One major question just on top line and leverage. I mean, clearly the system benefits from growth in terms of leveraging the benefit of a declining or a shrinking fixed cost base. We saw that with the results here. How should we think about your pursuit of growth in this market? Is the desire to improve operating leverage a factor? Do you think about the allocated economics of lower operating expense ratio in pursuit of new business, or is that not a factor?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, we are consistent in our pricing approach. Our pricing is to the risk, and we don't vary our pricing strategies around our forecast expenses. We obviously have an expense load as a part of how we build it up. But we are not forecasting to oh, gee, we can take on a lesser price because we are going to have a lesser \u2013 since we are driving our expenses down to expand our margins, not consume them by worst performing business.","So our pricing strategy remains unchanged. It is about the risk we're taking on and taking them on appropriately. And while that is difficult to do in this market, that's why I emphasized the statistics I did at the beginning of the call. We're seeing more volume from which to choose, but we're finding our success rate against that volume to be the same as it was before. And that I think reflects that market discipline and, as I mentioned briefly in my remarks, we also have a rigorous process that is done through cross-checking of teams, across different lines to make sure that our adherence to our pricing principles is done appropriately. So, we would not chase top line just because we would get more efficient (50:48). We'd be looking to apply that more efficient operation to expanding our margins. We will pursue growth only to the extent it meets our pricing modeling and our terms and conditions.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks. I guess, I mean, in insurance clearly you saw, I mean, even with the additional month I mean you saw good growth, the underlying improved and reinsurance is where you saw a lot more growth sort of than we had expected and the underlying \u2013 the loss ratio at least deteriorated year-over-year granted to Q 2015 was anomalistically low but still I mean you had some deterioration there. So, I'm just trying to balance that in terms of how we should be thinking about, I mean if that loss ratio sticks in that level \u2013 at this level, should we expect that you're going to continue to pursue growth in that segment?","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","So Mike, let me start with the kind of \u2013 is a very difficult place where I ask our underwriters to live which is I want them out there seeking growth in both upside \u2013 with current clients and new opportunities because of the market presence we have now. But at the same time not abandoning our underwriting discipline and I think some of my remarks was around we did have a great success in new business over $200 million, but we also let $100 million of premium go. And I think they're executing very well on that nice edge of trying to make sure you grow where you can, but don't give \u2013 we're not here to give away the store going forward.","Perhaps, I was \u2013 and I apologize I wasn't probably clear in the opening remarks. When you look at a full three quarters for both firms legacy Catlin and legacy XL and adjust for FX and reinstatement premium we grew 2% in the reinsurance segment. So, I'm pleased by that. It's a difficult market to grow in but I don't think it's indicative of any kind of heavy growth or giving away the store.","And I think the third thing is on the profitability as I've talked about, we feel is pretty good on the underlying book and so we're happy to write this business in a way we're writing it at the moment given the returns we have available to us.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, thanks good evening guys. I just have a few quick ones, hopefully. The first one I guess is just on the PYD and understanding if there's any one timers there. I mean was there adverse from Catlin from a harmonization or anything like that because just comparing it to the year ago when it was just XL, what we're running below the level was in 2Q 2015.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ryan this is Mike. No, there were no big one timers or anything else. This is our ordinary deep dive quarter and it produced the results you see. A couple of other notes, we've seen good positive A versus B (53:36) both in the quarter and year-to-date across both segments. I'm very pleased by that. We've been quite clear in our earlier calls that going forward, we think the right way to think about the performance in the total portfolio is it'll produce, assuming all things being equal which they never quite are, roughly the same level of releases that you used to from the XL alone portfolio. The harmonization would have put Catlin at the end of the year kind of to the midpoint of the range, as we would expect, and then we'll see what happens over time.","In terms of the specific, we're not (54:12) \u2013 I won't be doing this again, to be blunt, because in future quarters, you just won't be able to tell where it came from. It's getting too far away from when the books were run separately. And of course, since eight months of last year, we were operating as a combined business, pricing in a combined way, it just gets less and less meaningful to try and ascribe attribution.","But if you did look backward and try and sort it out in this quarter, you did see some releases from things that were attributable to Catlin activity in the past. You saw some that were attributable to XL activity in the past. There was no one theme. And so I think that overall guidance was true in this quarter, and we think it'll be true going forward.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's really helpful, Mike. Thanks. And then just real quickly in insurance, how would you characterize the elevated large loss activity that wasn't cat there, in terms of the impact that might have had on the loss ratio year-over-year? Was there anything notable there?","Paul Brand - Chief Underwriting Officer-Insurance & Chair-Insurance Leadership Team","Yes. Sure. I mean, clearly, we've seen the accident ex-cat loss ratio come down a little bit. And whilst we've had some larger losses within the quarter, that's not adversely affected that ratio, so I think (55:32) that a good size, with our new scale, we've got ability to absorb some of these things.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one last one quickly, for Pete. I think you said that the core investment portfolio benefited from some favorable amortization adjustment. Just hoping you could quantify that? Thanks.","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, Ryan, if you look at the delta from Q1 to Q2, it's about $12 million. And I would say probably half of that was due to what I would characterize as the one-off, and half of that I would've said is more run rate, and that would include things like including the acquisition of the small company that we made back in the beginning of the year. Their portfolio would be adding about $2 million. And there are a couple other small things in there putting cash to work. I would call nothing major in the portfolio, a couple of tweaks here and there. But that would be it.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for the answers, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your line is now open.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Hi, thanks. Just, I guess maybe first to follow-up a little bit on the cats, do you have, just specifically for Canada, what your industry loss assumption is? And is my guess right that a lot of those losses came from your local office, as opposed to out of Bermuda?","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","Ian, it's Greg. We're at the moment estimating about a $3.5 billion industry loss. It's important to note that we didn't take that loss and then market share it out to get to our estimate. Our estimate is built from the ground up, client by client.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Sure.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","And the loss, I don't have the exact splits in front of me, but the loss splits roughly a third in Toronto, a third in Bermuda, and a third in our London office.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it. Okay. Great. And then the question about mix that came up earlier. I guess just to expand on that a little bit. Greg, I think you talked about the growth in new business versus non-renewals, and Paul talked about, I think it was about $100 million of business that you sort of pivoted away from. Did those mix impacts on a go forward not so much what happened in this \u2013 on a GAAP basis this quarter \u2013 but on a go-forward basis, should those be positives to your margins going forward, or is there other things to consider, like long-tail versus short-tail, or other items that may not be so obvious, that we see show up in an accident year loss ratio improvement?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to ask the two segment \u2013 this is Mike, Ian. I'm going to ask the two segment leaders to comment specifically for their portfolios. But overall, this is a clear positive. And as these continue to earn out, and as I said, I don't think we're completely done. In fact I know we're not done with the benefits from these kinds of activities. But I do expect, in terms of headwinds to GWP, they will decline over time.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it.","Paul Brand - Chief Underwriting Officer-Insurance & Chair-Insurance Leadership Team","Exactly. I mean, obviously, we try and maximize our attention around the business we like the best, and it's the business that really was underperforming that we've exited, and that's the $100 million that we talked about. And clearly, that still has a bit of time to earn, because while some of those actions were started early in 2015, some of them continued through into 2016, and we continue to tune the portfolio. That's what we're here to do.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","Yeah. From a reinsurance perspective, on an expected basis, we would \u2013 we believe the new business will outperform the business that we've exited and should improve. Obviously, the actual performance may differ from expectations.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And there's no profound shift, Ian, between casualty and property. The basic shape of the book is the same as at the time of acquisition.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","That's why I wanted to check that. And then just, lastly, Mike or whoever else maybe it's appropriate for, I just was wondering if you could expand on a recent press lease about a High Net Worth operation. And I think it was in the UK, is that right? Can you just talk a little bit about what that's about, and what your vision is for that?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure, Ian, this is Mike. We did announce a couple of market-leading hires out of the UK, that they will go to work building and offering a comprehensive offering in the High and Ultra High Net Worth space in the UK and EU. Of course that distinguishes it from a lot of what you've seen announced of late. So we're not just joining that chorus.","The reason for this, and we've been looking at this for a long time. But we think this is a perfect time to be doing so, for what are obvious market reasons. But we have a breadth of product that is specifically designed for these type of folk. We've just never collected them up and presented them to the market in the way that we will in the future.","But if you consider, we're in aviation, we're in the fine art and specie, we're in kidnap and ransom, we're in yachts, we're in equine. I mean, and we have market-leading products and market-leading positions and market-leading services related to those, and some other handful of lines. And we believe that that leading position can lead to a really extraordinarily beneficial offering into the marketplace. Again, it is UK and EU facing.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Good, interesting. I might follow up with that \u2013 more on that later, but I'll let someone else have it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Randy Binner from FBR & Company. Your line is now open.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, good evening and thanks. I'm mostly asked and answered. But I wanted to go back to the commentary around reinsurance pricing, because it seemed to be better than I would have expected. And I think Greg had said that you had about 3% declines overall versus 8% last year. And so I just wanted to make sure that I got that right. And I think the answer I heard was that you're leveraging the size of the platform to drive that. So the question I guess I have is twofold. One, do you have any sense if that level of holding the line on price is consistent with what other reinsurers of a similar size are seeing in the market? And is this a pause before more capital comes into your market, or do you really think that it's sustainable? Because intuitively, it seems like it would be getting worse than that.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","Sure, Randy. So from my perspective, yes, you did hear that right. On the cat book, the 3% this quarter relative to 8% last year, certainly is a much improved, if you'll pardon the term, result relative to the prior year. We certainly see pricing in \u2013 particularly in the markets I talked about, short-tail lines and the global \u2013 U.S. short-tail lines and the global casualty book, we see pricing there very much reaching the bottom.","Now, from my perspective, we could be at the bottom for a while and we think we're well suited and well prepared to do very well and succeed if it stays in the bottom. I don't see anything at the moment that would indicate a rush of capital coming into the business that would change that dynamic of a lowering or diminishing of the rate of decrease and kind of a flattening coming in.","The other part of the question I heard was around just kind of who we are. We definitely operate in a syndicated marketplace. So I would think from what I've heard so far anyways, these are in line with what some of our larger peers are saying. We do view ourselves as a market leader and we think in our June 1 Florida renewals in particular, we would say, our book there relative to the 3% decline for cat overall, we were flat in Florida.","We felt we were really one of the \u2013 a handful of market leaders around pushing the AOB crisis in the state. And so we definitely differentiated between clients that have a good form and look after that exposure and have a great claims capability (01:03:46) with the idea that when an event comes those that aren't well prepared will have a higher losses.","So we reduced exposure in the state. We've reshaped our portfolio there a bit. And just to me the ability to do that is a good sign that there wasn't a bunch of capital rushing in and people cutting off our ability to do that.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's great. And just can you peg in the non-cat book what the \u2013 what was the rate decline there roughly this quarter versus last year?","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","For most of the classes, it's about flat to down a few points. And last year I would have said it was down a few points to 5%.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right. Got it. Thanks a lot.","Gregory S. Hendrick - Chief Executive-Reinsurance Operations & EVP","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. And good evening, and thanks for fitting me in. Just had a one quick follow-up, perhaps going back to Sarah's question. That's a fair point that just getting caught up in the discussion in ROE. I think the bigger challenge is if you look at 2017 Street estimates, the mean is at 8%, but the range is from 5.4% to, let's say, 9% plus. So you can drive sort of a truck through it. I think investors are looking for some confidence or assurance on the trajectory of ROE improvement, and perhaps they're not getting a clear answer, what that might be. So, any help on that would be I think very much appreciated.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I hear you loud and clear, Amit. And I've been \u2013 I hope my earlier answer was quite clear as well. The levers that we believe drive us forward toward that goal are kind of obvious. And in this quarter they \u2013 across them all, obviously, improved. So we're obviously that does give us greater confidence.","The question that Sarah asked was really about a forecast of timing. When are you going to cross the line? And as I said, given our experience with the first quarter and it's a very different experience with this quarter, we think it's wise to allow more evidence to develop for all of us, and then make a further comment.","But certainly from where we sit, we remain committed to the exact call we laid out before, and we will give further commentary around timing as we have a bit more evidence to back us up, given what we've been through. But, all of that said, you can't help but sit in this room and be more confident and more pleased.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. That's all I have. I realize it's already 6:10. Thanks for the answer and good luck for the future.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is now open.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. I'll try to make quick a little bit this way (01:06:57). One, Mike, this is sort of based in ignorance, but you talked about how your hit ratios remaining constant and you're seeing more submissions. And I guess I would have expected the hit ratio to go up because you're in a more exclusive club post the merger. Am I thinking about that wrong?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That may happen, but I haven't seen it yet. And I'm pretty pleased that I haven't. We're still in a declining rate environment. I think Paul identified only casualty is relatively flat. I think Greg identified casualty is relatively flat. Well, given this interest rate, if casualty isn't flat we're all idiots. So, to me the fact that some areas are a little bit flatter or slowing down isn't the same as saying, this is a sustainable market condition. And so our people are rightly picking their way through and being very cautious but certainly hunting for opportunity. And I do think your point is right. Over time, I expect our different market position, which we hear compliments about constantly, can yield a bit of a difference, but we've encouraged our people that we hunt for that growth, but be careful. And given that they know how serious we are about that, I wouldn't have expected to see that hit ratio move at this point.","There are a couple of things that give us greater confidence overtime, and why I did say in my comments that we could see some acceleration of our opportunity. Number one, it's known to everyone that every player in this phase shows distress to varying degrees. And we've certainly got some of our key competitors who are showing that. And when that kind of thing happens, our underwriters are going through a very careful exercise to identify accounts that either they have personal history or knowledge with, or where we know that's our kind of risk. And then we do target and go after things that could, I think, and has been showing signs of success in that activity. And it wouldn't surprise me if that improved our hit ratio, because you're kind of pre-selecting. So, that can help.","Second thing that we've been doing, and it's really, again, I think, accelerating, is we've been working very hard to make sure that our line sizes with good clients reflect our new position in the market and aren't just static to one or the other company's historical level of participation. Those are obviously good adds, because you know those accounts very, very well.","Some do see opportunities for it to accelerate, but I'm not at all displeased to see the equation I described at this point, but \u2013 sure, we could see that. I'm very pleased with our underwriting discipline. And I just \u2013 I know a lot of our underwriters, and the actuaries, and the folks that support us. They listen to these calls. And I just want them to know I'm very pleased. Let's keep hunting for those opportunities. And if we can show a difference in that way, I'll be even more pleased.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's very thorough. Now that we're past the anniversary of the deal closing, are we done with business leaving just out of agency concerns of book consolidation?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","There was so little that did \u2013 before that there really isn't \u2013 there wasn't much in the beginning to comment on. I don't know the timing of the one program. I know, there was one program that was a floor one. So, that would have been an April kind of departure, so that will have a little bit of trailing impact. But all right, that's not a topic we talk about literally.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Fantastic. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Byrnes from Janney. Your line is now open.","Ryan Byrnes - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. Thanks for fitting me in guys. I just had a quick question on debt-to-cap levels. Obviously, the buyback is going to be elevated this year. But if I look at debt, I guess, plus preferred were in high 20%s, I think, when the deal was originally consummated, I think, you were targeting a mid-20%s range. Just wanted to get your updated thoughts on that.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, the first round, I just observed that the objective of the firm is unchanged. We like being kind of in the middle of the pack of our competitors around leverage ratios. When I got to excel, we were at an elevated \u2013 well, shortly thereafter, we were at an elevated position, we worked it back down to the middle of the pack. As a part of this transaction, we did move up again, and we do plan to work that back down.","You observed correctly that at this point in time, with the high level of shareback activity that is partly, of course, opportunistic given our share price that, that puts a little pressure on it. But the overall direction we intend over time is the same.","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ryan, its Pete. I go with what Mike said with where the direction is over time. If you remember, when we first did the transaction and we had talked to the rating agencies, we have talked about starting out at a 30% ratio and going down from there. So, we started at a lower ratio, having gone down, and having gone down larger because of the extent of our buyback activity.","As Mike said, given the share price today, it's hard to justify taking capital and doing \u2013 and buying in debt, rather than buying in stock. We are doing cognizant that, that ratio though really can't go up meaningfully. It really hasn't gone up over the last couple of quarters at least. We do have $300 million of debt coming due in 2018, right. So, there is something out there in the mid-term that you might think that would be unlikely to be refinanced as a result of that. But it is something that we weigh pretty much every quarter about is do we need to do something? The one thing I would say is that, anything that we did on the debt side, it would only be 25% of what we would have to do pretty much on the buyback side.","Ryan Byrnes - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then just, again, just to frame it out, is there an upward bound? Is 30% kind of the bright line for you guys, or is there a bright line in terms of the top end?","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Ryan, I'd hate to use the word bright line, but it's hard for me to envision being above 30%.","Ryan Byrnes - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Great.","Peter R. Porrino - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The only other comment I would make is we haven't \u2013 Mike mentioned a little bit about how we think about buybacks. We go through the process of thinking about our capital and how much we \u2013 and at what point are we at the right capital base, and do we have too much or too little. I'd say, at this point, we are still comfortable that we have plenty of capital to conduct the business that we're conducting and an opportunity to buy back stock with excess capital, so.","Ryan Byrnes - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. Thanks for the answers, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jay Cohen from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thanks. I want to just go back to the ROE issue for a second, maybe think a little bit bigger picture. The fact that you have kind of pushed out this ROE target, I think, a casual observer of the company, the industry might say, gee, they screwed up the deal, and that's why they pushed out. And that doesn't seem to be the case. Obviously, you have market condition, maybe have gotten worse, interest rates are lower. Beyond those two things, is there anything else, Mike, that has caused you to push out the ROE target a bit?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just the macro issues then?","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the macro issues, particularly, the way they played into the first quarter, gave us a bit of pause. And I think that \u2013 we saw obviously a humbling reaction to our observation. And we, of course, internally, took that as a lesson and as an opportunity to really get everyone redoubled in their focus to make sure that the transaction delivered, and delivered in the way that we believed it could.","And for the last quarter, I'd say, as I travel around the world, it's \u2013 there's been a bit of dissonance when I travel with investors, their conversations have been very pointed. When I travel with clients and with brokers, the conversations have been enthusiastic and even effusive in praise. And our colleagues experienced that dissonance, too, and say to themselves, geez, what's going on?","My \u2013 so, I \u2013 but no, this quarter tells a clear and more compelling story, but it's one quarter. And I'm going to take the humbling lesson of last quarter and be cautious in how I comment on that for the time being. But you shouldn't take in that any less commitment to our goal or any certainty that we can't make that goal in the right way at the right time. So, I'm \u2013 look, we'll take this conversation up more. You can tell I'm a little itching to say more than that, but all my colleagues are about to slit my throat. So, I'm \u2013 we're done. But I'm \u2013 there's \u2013 when you phrase the question the way you did, it really is a two-letter answer, no.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, Mike.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yup.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I show no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Radulski.","Michael S. McGavick - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think there's anything to add at this point. We're very grateful for your time and attention. We're grateful for all of the feedback that we got over the course of the last 90 days. You've all made a variety of useful comments that we've taken to heart. And I can tell you that we used those comments, and what's gone on these last 90 days to refocus and reenergize. And we're very pleased with the bit of progress that showed up this quarter.","But like I said, at the beginning, I really mean it. It's a step in the right direction, and it's more like it. And I just want to thank the people of XL all around the world; at XL Catlin, who've hung in there with us, who are seeing it through and are delivering the progress that we're showing.","David Radulski - Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations","Thank you.

Please go ahead.","David R. Radulski","Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast in XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our website several document, including our quarterly financial supplement. On our call this evening, you'll hear from Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who'll offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market condition. Then we'll open it up for questions. Among those also available for questions are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, the Chief Investment Officer; and Stephen Robb, our Controller.","Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date in which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Michael S. McGavick","Good evening, and thank you for joining our call. In the first quarter of 2013, XL showed continued momentum. While the entire industry benefited from benign CAT and large loss experience, XL's core metrics again demonstrate that the margin-expanding initiatives we have shared with you in previous calls are producing the desired result. We have told you that an important indicator of progress for us is the improving trend in loss ratio especially in Insurance.","In the first quarter, our accident year loss ratio for Insurance improved by 9.8 points versus the same quarter a year ago, and Reinsurance by 8.5 points. Greg and Jamie will provide more detail when they discuss their segment results in a moment.","Our P&C combined ratio of 87.7% was 7.6 points better than the first quarter last year. Net income for the quarter almost doubled from a year ago with operating net income up 70%. Our first quarter annualized operating return on shareholders equity was 10.7%. As we discussed in our last call, we recognize that movement in our investment portfolio can lead to volatility, so we focus on our operating ROE ex-unrealized gains and losses. In the first quarter that was 12.3%.","We grew our fully diluted book value per ordinary share by 2.1% in the quarter. We also continue to buy back shares and raise our dividend as people discussed. In this regard, it is worth restating that it is not our goal to expand our capital buffer but rather to keep it level, and the economics continue to favor share purchases at these levels and we expect it to continue.","Overall, P&C gross premiums written for the quarter increased 3.8%. The Insurance segment saw an increase of 12.1% primarily due to new business initiatives and pricing improvements across most lines. However, the same improving pricing trend is not being played out in the reinsurance market and we wrote 7.5% less premium versus the same quarter a year ago. In sum, we are keenly focused on grinding our way through sourcing, selecting, underwriting and binding better performing risks across all of our businesses.","We should also note that we see 5 tailwinds that should help us sustain our progress. The first tailwind comes from the fact that we are seeing the reunderwriting of our books of business, now earning their way to the bottom line, and we expect that positive impact to continue over time. Second, the new leaders that we have put in charge of many of our businesses are hitting their strides. Whether they are industry stars attracted to join XL or company veterans who are rising to the challenge, and we expect these leaders to continue delivering improving results.","In connection with this second wind at our back, we have many examples. So let me give you a highlight. We recently announced that Andy Pinkes would be joining XL as the Global Head of Claims. He's taking over from Paul Tuhy, who had built our claims team into one of the best in the industry and was looking for a new challenge. Andy has a great track record, and we see him building on our already solid reputation. Meanwhile, Paul has agreed to become Head of our Insurance Aerospace team. So from outside and within, we believe we are attracting and motivating the very best.","Third, we continue to refine our business mix. We are generally allocating more capital to those businesses with lower loss ratios leading to expanded margins. This effort, too, has more room to run.","The fourth XL-specific tailwind is that we are seeing improvements in our operating leverage. This was illustrated in the first quarter by the 1.2% reduction in our P&C operating expense ratio, the second consecutive quarter of meaningful improvement.","Fifth and finally, we have benefited, as has the broader primary insurance sector, from continued improvement in rate for the risk we take on. It is not yet where it should be, but it is moving in the right direction, and we will continue to push for adequate rate in all of our lines in both insurance and reinsurance.","Of course, we are in a severity business and we don't expect to go through the entire year with all of these tailwinds, not to mention this benign loss environment, perfectly aligned at our backs. Yet with what we are seeing now, we are very pleased with our progress and quite excited about the momentum we have in place. And I would emphasize to all who are listening in this call, we are certainly not satisfied. We will continue to work to continue the progress we have demonstrated for the past 4 quarters.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.","Peter R. Porrino","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating net income for the first quarter was $280 million or $0.93 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to operating income of $165 million or $0.52 per share in the first quarter a year ago. Our net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was $351 million or $1.17 per share. Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 87.7% or 7.6 points lower than the same quarter last year, including favorable prior year development of $31 million. This reflects favorable development of $10 million and $20 million -- $21 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments, respectively. As expected, positive movements came generally from the short-tail property and catastrophe lines in this A versus E quarter. Our semi-annual full actuarial review will be reported on next quarter.","P&C favorable PYD in the prior year quarter was $80 million, generally in the same lines combined with a single large positive settlement on an older large professional claim. On a reserve-related note, we intend to publish our Global Loss Triangles next week.","Our accident year combined ratio was 89.8%, an 11.5-point improvement from the same quarter last year. CAT losses both this quarter and the prior year quarter were relatively light and accounted for 0.3 and 1.5 combined ratio points, respectively. Our accident year ex-CAT P&C combined ratio improved by 10.3 points, mainly due to lower attritional and large losses, changes in the mix of business and improved pricing. It is important to remember that the Costa Concordia accident was our first quarter 2012 event and added 3.3 points to last year's combined ratio.","Our operating expenses were marginally higher than the prior year quarter and slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2012 largely due to the timing of costs associated with infrastructure and organizational initiatives. Underlying expenses continue to grow along with the business, but with increasing levels of operating leverage expected as the large initiatives continue to come online. As indicated in the last quarter call, we expect -- we continue to expect that overall operating expense levels for 2013 will be modestly higher than 2012.","Our Investment Portfolio delivered total returns of 0.7% in the quarter. As a result of increasing rates in the U.S., we had a small negative mark-to-market of $82 million in the quarter. Our P&C fixed income duration increased by 0.3 years to 3.4 years. This was a combination of adding duration in the Euro portfolio to be nearer our benchmark duration, putting cash to work in our U.S. portfolios and the extension of prepayments in our agency mortgage portfolios. We still remain short duration relative to our liability.","At $175 million net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the quarter was 8.1% below the same quarter last year due primarily to lower reinvestment rate. We did have a couple of small items in net investment income in the quarter that contributed positively to our results. The P&C gross book yield at the end of March was 2.9%. We estimate that approximately $3.3 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 3.3% will mature and pay down over the next 12 months compared to the average new money rate in Q1 on our P&C portfolio of 1.5%. As a result, net investment income will remain under pressure.","We have added some further breakouts related to our investment income on structured products in the financial supplement to improve clarity on where the components of investment income flow through our financial results.","Our net income from investment affiliates was $51 million, up $21 million from the prior year quarter supported by capital market tailwind. As you know, these results can be volatile, but this quarter we saw good returns in all 3 investment affiliate classes: hedge funds, private investments and our investment managers. We also had positive returns from our other strategic affiliates, as several had very good fourth quarter 2012 operating results.","Now to our capital management. We continue to see compelling economics and share buyback. And during the quarter, we continued to buy back our ordinary shares. Following the February Board of Directors meeting, we announced the authorization of the new $850 million share buyback program. This replaced the approximately $250 million remaining under the previous program. We also increased our ordinary dividend by 27% to $0.14 per quarter. In January, we purchased and canceled 3.8 million ordinary shares for $98.4 million under the previous buyback program as we pause our buybacks as a result of Sandy in the fourth quarter. We also purchased and canceled 4.2 million ordinary shares under the new buyback program for $125 million compared to $100 million in Q1 2012. In total, during the first 3 months of 2013, we purchased and canceled 8 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $27.89 for $223 million.","I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Pete, and good evening. Tonight, I'll cover results for the segment, provide some color on our continuing improvements, give a brief update on talent and finish with remarks on current market condition.","Beginning with the results. The Insurance segment combined ratio for the quarter was 92.9%, generating underwriting profit of $74 million. This is an improvement of 8.3 points compared to the prior year quarter, and it's the best quarter for this segment in more than 5 years. Like the rest of the industry, XL benefited from both minimal CAT activity and limited large losses. On an accident year basis, ex-catastrophes, our combined ratio of 93.5% improved by 11.3 points. The accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT, was 63.2% or 8.1 points better than prior year quarter, 2 points driven by favorable loss experience in our International and North American property portfolios and 3 points from lower accident year loss ratios and several other books, reflecting better loss experience, changes in business mix and the impact of various underwriting action. Also contributing to the improvement, as Pete mentioned, was the absence of the Costa Concordia marine loss, which adversely impacted our first quarter 2012 loss ratio by approximately 2 points.","The expense ratio improved by 3.3 points this quarter with 2.2 points driven by flat operating expenses, relative growth in net earning premiums and 1.1 points of improvement in the acquisition ratio, mostly due to business mix. Insurance gross premiums written grew by $155 million or 11.6% in the quarter when adjusted for foreign exchange movement. We continue to realize planned growth as a result of new leadership in existing businesses as well as businesses that are new to XL. Further, we have less drag as some of the corrective actions we implemented over the past 12 to 18 months take hold. Meaningful rate increases across nearly all of our 22 businesses contributed to the growth.","Our U.S. Professional, North American Construction, North American property and U.S. risk management businesses experienced the largest percentage growth with the U.S. risk management teams solidifying their position as a new force in the market.","Our momentum continues to build. At the recent RIMS convention, clients and brokers were eager to learn about how XL Insurance can help solve their risk management needs, and there was no pushback to our assertion that further rate is needed to generate appropriate returns.","Although we clearly benefited from a quiet quarter in terms of CAT and large loss activity, we believe that the improvements we are beginning to see are the result of our ongoing efforts to expand margins. These are the tailwinds that Mike described. Clearly, we're not ready to wave the victory flag, especially given the variability that can occur with poor results due to the nature of our business, but we do feel confident that we are making material progress.","Moving on to talent. We continue to enhance our teams throughout this segment. In addition to Andy Pinkes, Stephen Ashwell joined us to lead a new crisis management business that will include our current product recall portfolio. And we have recruited Lee Meyrick to lead Global Marine. And while we have been adding talent from outside the firm, we are also promoting talent from within. Mike touched on Paul Tuhy, and we also promoted Matt O'Malley to lead our North American Environmental business. We continue to add underwriting talent with additions to our construction, surplus lines and political risk teams, and we expanded our underwriting capabilities in Atlanta and Australia.","Finally, turning to recent market conditions. The first quarter was a further continuation of what we've been seeing for the past several quarters with positive pricing trends outpacing claim trends in most of our businesses and an overall segment rate increase of 3.5%. Over 70% of the first quarter premium experienced rate increases this quarter and in the first quarter of 2012. This rate-on-rate is up from 60% in the fourth quarter of last year.","North America Property & Casualty continues to show the most strength with the first quarter rate increase in the 4% to 5% range. Our Global Professional portfolio had another solid quarter, with rate increases that were also over 4%, led by our U.S. Professional portfolio, which increased by nearly 6%. Our International P&C business, which has a large January 1 first renewal book, received meaningful rates for the first time in years, with a rate increase of nearly 3% compared to flat rate in the first quarter of 2012.","And lastly, our Specialty business had a rate increase of just under 4%, led largely by our Marine portfolio. While rate increases are broad-based, the increase over loss trend is small, and we continue to believe more progress is needed to achieve rate adequacy especially given the low investment rate, cited by Pete.","In addition to the need in long tail lines that I've spoken on prior quarters, excess layers across many lines of businesses are suffering from an oversupply of capacity and require further rate. We have and we'll continue to walk away from business, if the returns are not an acceptable level as we maintain our discipline and grind our way to a better return.","In summary, we're off to a solid start as we continue to build on the foundation that was laid over the past couple of years, positioning us for continued improvement in 2013 and beyond. There is still a great deal of work to do to achieve our ultimate goal, a combined ratio of 90% or better, but we have more confidence than ever that is attainable as long as we maintain our underwriting diligence.","And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.","James H. Veghte","Thanks, Greg, and good evening. The Reinsurance segment had a very solid quarter of underwriting results with a combined ratio of 74.9%. Naturally, we had the benefit of negligible CAT activity, but we were broadly pleased with the performance across the portfolio. Our reserve releases in the quarter were $21 million compared to $26 million a year ago. On an accident year basis, the portfolio generated a combined ratio of 79.9%, which compares favorably to the 88.7% produced in the first quarter of 2012. The improvement in accident year performance was driven principally by the Costa Concordia loss in 2012 and the lower attritional property losses. As respects our reserved releases, we remain vigilant on our long tail business in recent underwriting years. In the first quarter, virtually all of our releases were from short tail lines.","Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $907 million, a 7% reduction from the first quarter of 2012. These reductions were principally driven by 3 factors. A year ago, after a long period of mediocre returns, we decided to reduce our position in the marine market. We closed our U.S. operation and have tightened our underwriting standards in London, where the bulk of our remaining activity takes place. This accounted for a material portion of the segment's premium reduction.","Second, reinsurance by nature is not a daily trading business, and a small number of specific underwriting actions can make a significant difference on premiums written in any given quarter. In the first quarter, for example, 3 treaties in our U.S. Property department failed to meet our return targets, so we canceled 2 of them and reduced our line on the third. This accounted for over $30 million of the drop.","Finally, we reduced our writings in both the U.S. and European casualty markets, as a result of our own underwriting actions and an increase in client retentions, a dynamic we have been observing and discussing with you for several years.","So with respect to our top line and the market broadly, there is no question, as Greg reported, that there's positive pricing momentum across many sectors of the primary market. We do not believe the reinsurance market is showing the same level of discipline, and we've responded accordingly. In fact, the obvious benefits reinsurers should enjoy as a result of primary pricing power have been diluted by weakening terms and conditions, particularly in proportional treaties, where commission structures are under pressures in sectors of the market.","Since the end of the first quarter, the most significant renewal activity for XL Re at April 1 was in the Japanese market. This went reasonably smoothly this year with risk adjusted rate reductions of about 2%. The signing environment remains challenging but in both last year's and this year's renewals, we had some success and selectively increased our lines in the market, though the weakening of the yen will moderate the gain on our top line.","As you're all aware, June and July 1 had a large component of U.S. Southeast wind renewals. We have a significant portfolio of renewal business in this market, are actively quoting business, and while it's too early to say what the pricing environment will ultimately be, we anticipate a successful renewal. From a pure rate adequacy perspective, this is the most well-rated business in the world, and we expect it will remain a very attractive component of our account once our renewal activity has been completed.","So overall, we are very pleased with our bottom line results in the first quarter, and we remain committed to our long-held focus on underwriting discipline and cycle management, which has produced a strong track record of underwriting profit for XL.","With that, I'll turn it over to David for Q&A.","David R. Radulski","Shirley, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The Insurance segment underlying combined ratio of 93.5%, stronger than we expected, and clearly, approaching your target of around 90%. I'm just trying to get a sense of if you feel that you've got everything in place to achieve that targeted goal.","Michael S. McGavick","I'll start -- this is Mike, Jay, and thanks for the question. I'll start and pass it on to Greg. Broadly speaking, for the reasons that I identified, the so-called 5 tailwinds, clearly, we have some momentum toward those goals. And while it's hard to be precise about how close we are, we clearly demonstrated in this quarter what we're capable of and we just need to keep driving in the business mix changes, the reunderwriting and the right kind of pricing to get the job done. But it's clearly within our grasp. That, to us, is very much what this quarter demonstrated.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, not too much to add to that, Jay. We are on the right path. We've got to be incredibly disciplined and execute on all of our plans. We've got a stream of underwriting activity, new corrections that we need to execute on. But we are definitely headed in the right direction. There was a low amount of, particularly on our property book, a low amount of large loss book -- effectively, no large loss activity, as we define it, in the quarter. And so there's still a little bit of fortuity in there, but it's becoming more and more skill every day.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Switching gears to share buyback. I believe the plan for 2013 was in the $500 million range. You completed almost half of that in the first quarter alone. I'm just trying to get a sense of the seasonality for the remainder of repurchases or whether there's upside to that plan now.","Michael S. McGavick","Well, Jay, a couple of points. First, I think that the first quarter is a little bit confusing just because we were finishing off repurchases that we associate with the fourth quarter of last year. Now they certainly occurred in this quarter and are accounted in this quarter's results. But you'll recall that when Sandy occurred, of course, we were busy in analyzing our losses, and because we had knowledge the market didn't have as we were going through that, we felt it prudent to stop our repurchases in the open market and not continue them again until we had put out our Sandy loss. So that caused a pause in repurchasing that we -- and given the time of year and everything else, that we really couldn't get done until we were in the first quarter. So we associate that portion of the repurchase with the fourth quarter and don't really count it against what we were forecasting for this year. What's been repurchased in this year, as we associate it with this year, is $125 million, as Pete said. That's obviously directly in keeping with our sort of our commentary around what we thought was the likely level of repurchases, but we had said when we -- and so that's clearly 1\/4 of $500 million. But we've also said, we try to give a number that we're pretty confident around and that if things come in better, we would see there is some opportunity for upside to that. And that statement is every bit as true today as it was when we said it. That said, we don't give a direct guidance about our plans. We don't see anybody being well served by that, and we'll look forward to discussing next quarter what we choose to do in the second quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just one for Pete. The property-casualty investment income came in stronger than expected, and my sense is the robust level of returns in the alternatives may have had something to do with that. Do you have a sense of how much above plan investment income was recognized in last quarter?","Peter R. Porrino","Sure, Jay, so I would not go towards the affiliate income there. What I would say, I did mention a couple of items that moved that number up in the quarter. There were 2. One was we had some paydowns on our MBS that were, I'll call it, more in line with expectations this quarter as opposed to the acceleration that we saw in the past couple of quarters. So that, I think, drove maybe one of the things that might have surprised people. The second one was some stronger cash flows on a few older CDOs that we received in the first quarter. When you add those together, it's, talking ballpark, $6 million, $7 million.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that's in the P&C investment income line?","Peter R. Porrino","That is in the P&C net investment income line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Was there an impact, Greg, from crop in the first quarter or maybe, Jamie, in terms of reserve reestimates or losses related to 4Q?","James H. Veghte","Yes, we increased our reserves on last year's crop results by $4 million in the quarter.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one question, I mean, we've heard a lot -- Jamie mentioned conditions in reinsurance not being as favorable as what Greg talked about on the Insurance side. What about the stuff that's in the middle like the broker-placed primary and excess business, what are the conditions like there from a rate perspective? And is there a risk that, that -- or what is the risk that, that starts to see these sort of conditions bleed over from the reinsurance market? And just one follow-up, if I can.","Gregory S. Hendrick","So, Mike, are you on like the Property E&S line there?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I mean, not anywhere in particular. But sure, let's say, property. Let's say, like U.S. non-CAT property.","Gregory S. Hendrick","So far, what we've seen right now is -- the rate increases I described to you are broad-based across our entire portfolio, which would include a portion that's an E&S property, as I would call it. And so to date, we haven't seen nor do we hear about any noise from the market if there's any damage to that coming over from the reinsurance market. They're just 2 very different markets at the moment.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, just maybe if I could, Greg, you mentioned 4-ish percent rate in some U.S. lines. What is loss trend that you -- where are you booking that from a loss trend perspective and how much of the year-over-year combined ratio improvement was driven by rate well in excess of loss trend?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure, Mike. For the quarter, our 3.5% rate change across the segment compares to a blended loss trend of 1.8%, so we're about -- just under 2 points rate over ahead of trend. That's on a written basis though. So we're -- an earned estimate of that would be just under 1 point is where we're thinking, in that delta. We've got 17 out of 22 businesses, or 85% of the premium that's in that camp of rate exceeding trend. Geographically split, the U.S. is getting more further ahead of trend. International is finally starting to make a dent against trend. So as you look at it across on a written basis all-in, this translates to just under basically roughly 1% improvement in loss ratio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You had mentioned some timing issues that affected the expense comparison, and hard to tell if it benefited this quarter or hurt past quarters. Is the expense run rate for this quarter understated because of these timing issues?","Peter R. Porrino","Jay, I would say broadly, yes, and I would pretty much reiterate what we talked about last quarter, which was that we thought for the year that we were looking at something in the low to mid-single-digit range of an increase. I would say that is still holding true.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then separately, do you know at this point if you have any material exposure to the plant explosion in West Texas?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, we don't -- as you know, Jay, we don't get into specific clients or accounts, but at this point, no, we don't have any specific news out of Texas to comment on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two questions here. The first one, the quick one, was there commutation in the life insurance segment? It looks like something happened there.","Peter R. Porrino","No, no. There wasn't. What happened -- so you're talking about the reduction in the premium line?","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The reduction, yes.","Peter R. Porrino","Yes. So one of our blocks of business is some term life business, Reinsurance business, and we had a client that had a number of, I'll call it, policyholders that were coming up upon -- every 5 or 10 years you get a large increase, right, scheduled increase. Most people have 6 months in which they can go back and cash in and say, \"I really didn't want that policy.\" We had a number of those in the first quarter, right, and that's what drove it. It was simply some term life movement. I would not view that as a permanent decline.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And the second one, Mike, I'm just curious, you all have a Lloyd's Syndicate. And I'm wondering what your thoughts are on the Aon deal with Berkshire Hathaway. What that means for the Lloyd's market, kind of what are your thoughts on it?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, the specific answer to your question is it's too early to tell. I mean, this is a fairly new phenomenon. I think everybody is trying to get their head around it. You can't help but step back and admire Ajit. I mean, this is a very smart, shrewd industry participant, and he demonstrated again those qualities. In terms of how we're viewing it, what we'll be very mindful of is, we, too, have a very significant relationship with Aon and we, too, have a very significant presence in the Lloyd's market. And we don't expect that arrangement like this with other players should have meaningful impact on our own experience with either our broker partner or our market experience. And so that's what we'll be monitoring for. But you can't help but admire the creativity of Ajit. It's very impressive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to congratulate you guys. The combined ratio was the best since from what I can see 2007. So great work by the team. Just a small thing on that. It's just reserve releases were actually lower than what we had thought and lower than actually most of the first quarters that I've seen for a while. We're going to see your Triangles, it sounds like very soon. Can you comment a bit on what we'll see and how you're feeling on the reserve side and -- relative to previous periods?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, this is Mike. I'll start and then, Chris, we have the benefit of having Susan Cross here, our Global Chief Actuary, and I'll ask Susan to make a couple of comments. But the first comment is the obvious one. Remember this is not a quarter in which we do a deep dive on our reserves. That's for next quarter. So you don't get a lot of action in this quarter. And each quarter has a result when you're comparing first quarter to first quarter to first quarter. It can have its own little story. The second thing I would say is that the real place to get deep inside into where we stand on our reserving is in the Global Loss Triangles. That's coming shortly, and I won't steal any of the thunder from that. But you can -- you know our history and you know how we think about these things, and I continue to be very comfortable with both the approach, which is unchanged, and the results, which I'm pleased by. But, Susan, do you want to add a little more color?","Susan L. Cross","Sure, Mike. As Pete mentioned in his comments regarding the prior year development releases that we had this quarter relative to last year, the first quarter in 2012, we did have a large professional liability settlement that we reflected last quarter. And from time to time, we will have those kind of one-off adjustments that we'll make in an A versus E quarter. The magnitude of that was about $24 million and that, yes, obviously, did result in a larger favorable prior development last year. But this is very much in line with what we would expect in an A versus E quarter. The releases were driven by the short-tail lines. I would say one of the other differences we had relative to the first quarter last year is, reflecting some of the short-tail experience in our Marine business in the first quarter of last year, we had some favorable development, and this quarter we had some adverse development related to some large Marine losses. That was another $10 million of the difference. So nothing to read into those changes. It's what we would normally expect. With the Global Loss Triangles that we have coming out next week, there's essentially no change in terms of the presentation of the information. We have 12 classes of business. We hope you will find that useful in doing your own analysis. We believe they will demonstrate what they have in the past around a very strong reserve position.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then shifting gears entirely just one of the things I'm wrestling with is the pricing power outside the United States, and you had mentioned actually International was at plus-3%, which is actually a little better than what some others are talking about. Do you see the International markets lagging the U.S.? In other words, will they be catching up in future periods, or is the International markets -- are they just doomed to be beneath, structurally for some reason, what we're seeing in the United States?","Michael S. McGavick","I'll start and hand it -- this is Mike. I'll start and hand it to Greg. There's no structural reason for the difference. There's a matter of habit, and we think those habits are correctable over time. And that's, I think, illustrated by the progress we've made by seeing, I think, some really good leadership. People like Jason Harris, who's now leading our IPC booking in France, who's been recruited to lead our property book; our longtime leader of casualty, Thomas Stamm. I think those folks just have a real sense of determination and purpose and are approaching their clients to show what the XL difference is that is worthy of a fair price. And that determination is working. And I'm just -- I'm really proud of that crew and all the people who work with them. We're really seeing a real difference now. But there's no structural reason. The only thing you can point to that people do tend to point to is, of course, the general weakness in the European economy. But in the end, the companies that we seek to serve over time are not just in the European economy. Many of them are export driven and multinational. They're going to have experiences from all around the world. So we're not accepting the notion that because Europe is specifically experiencing economic weakness that, that means that somehow that has to translate into us selling our products for less than they're worth. We don't accept that argument, and I think our lack of accepting that argument is serving us well. Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, it's nothing to get -- Greg, it's nothing to get excited about, right? We're talking about from all the color I've seen anyways, flat to plus 1% from some of the peer group, and we're at just under 3%. One thing that is helpful is that the trends in our book. When we have -- when we talk about International Property & Casualty, it is literally just that. It's our global property and our primary casualty and our upper middle-market books. We don't -- and I think some others may blend in professional and other lines of business. And so you have that delta going on as well, but the loss trend is about half in IPC, what we call IPC, International Property & Casualty, than it is in North America. So we're making some progress. I am -- I have long said that you're foolish to try and predict rates going forward. You're balancing the need for better margin there with some strong sources of capacity, both from global players and local champions as we would look strong local companies.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. Hats off to the team. It wasn't just weather that helped in the quarter. There's a lot of real good progress being made here, very tangible signs of that coming through the P&L.","Operator","And the next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess you guys cited low levels of large losses. Is there a way to kind of help us size that up and what is -- how much a benefit it was versus normal?","Michael S. McGavick","We -- while many of our businesses have large loss loads that we measure to, we don't disclose those. But this quarter was exceptionally light. I mean, I think you know that from just about every call you've been on. Certainly it's true at XL. And we would experience -- we would ordinarily experience at least some in the quarter. And while there are always some losses that stick out, and that we're paying particular attention to, it was one of those odd quarters where things didn't seem to happen to the degree they usually do.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. In terms of -- and lastly, most of my questions have been answered. In terms of the reinsurance outlook, it sounds like clearly there is some pressure on pricing, a number of companies' reinsurers have cited expectation for supply to outstrip demand at mid-year renewals as well. I was curious if you guys can touch on -- if you guys are thinking the same and how you guys will manage that going forward.","James H. Veghte","Well, I'd make a couple of points, Mike. One is we only have 2 firm orders so far, and there were double-digit, risk-adjusted reductions in both of them. Having said that, from the way we measure rate adequacy, they were both very, very highly paid before they went in to their renewals. So there clearly seems to be a real demand for people to write additional Florida business. I think it's too early right now having only had 2 firm orders to say precisely what the pricing outcome will be. But the other point I'd make for our own portfolio is our Florida book is about $35 million of CAT business. We write proportional business as well. Last year, we wrote $460 million of worldwide CAT premium. So while we have a significant book, even if there are risk-adjusted reductions in the high single digits or low double digits, we'll still have a very attractive portfolio of CAT business.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, I'll slip one last one on Reinsurance then. You're hearing a lot of -- seeing a lot of headlines about the crops not being potentially planted. If a farmer didn't plant his crop, would that qualify for crop insurance, if you know?","James H. Veghte","To be perfectly candid with you, I don't know the answer to that question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","First, I want an answer to the other Ajit question, which is your thoughts on how XL and the rest of market may be affected by Ajit looking to build a large E&S operation.","Michael S. McGavick","Well, first, you've told me more than I know. All I know is that there are 4 very respected folks that moved from one company to another, but exactly what all they're going to do when they get there, I was unaware there was so much news about it. People move around the industry a fair amount. One of the things we've been extremely excited about is the degree to which we feel that we've created a company where birds of a feather who love being great underwriters and love innovation are wanting to work. So to the extent that Ajit has charms, that he has prevailed upon these guys, that's normal to me. And so Ajit having some -- and Berkshire having some interest in perhaps the E&S market, welcome aboard. It's a tough space to make money in, and those are people who have real skill at it. Whether they were applying that trade where they were or where they're going, they'll be, I'm sure, tough competitors. At the same time, I'm awfully proud of our team and the progress that they've made in our E&S book, and we're going to keep sticking to our knitting and growing our nice book of business. But there's not -- I don't -- you just can't overreact to that kind of stuff. It feels like it goes on all the time. We've just enjoyed the fact that we tend to be issuing more releases about what's coming our way. That's been our joy around here.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Understood, understood. And then, Pete, can you clarify, I was wanting to understand a bit better why increase the ratio now. It seems there's -- the consensus is to keep duration shorter. It seems maybe a risky time to go out right now.","Peter R. Porrino","Yes, well, so, the one I'd say is part of it is just getting closer to where we're supposed to be, right? So it isn't -- this isn't a massive move out on the  curb. Part of it is pushing -- part of it is putting cash to work, right? We had an awful lot of idle cash at the end of the year that we put into some fixed instruments. But I don't know, Sarah, do you have any -- anything you like to add?","Sarah Elizabeth Street","Yes, the only thing I would add is a lot of the duration expense came in the Europe portfolio, and there we all less concerned about rising rates and in fact, the other way, given the struggle that the economy is facing there.","Operator","The next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but from a retention perspective, I think you mentioned that your retentions were higher. Could you help us understand so what's happening behind the scenes for that?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, first of all, I want to make one general comment. And then, I'll turn it over to Greg for some specific retention comments on Insurance. But as Jamie described in Reinsurance, we've had a couple of decisions not to retain business on our part and, at least, in one case a client retaining some risk. And in the insurance side, we've seen some strong retention performance backed up by some positive rates. So we're -- that's a very pleasing combinations. Now look, some people -- we're really pleased that we have a portfolio of businesses. And we love the fact that when we see poor market behavior in one space, we can shift capital to where the grass is greener. And we try to do that with sophistication, both across the segment level from insurance to reinsurance depending on market conditions and then within the various businesses in each of those segments according to their prospects. So for example, in reinsurance, while our top line suffered a bit in the quarter because of some very specific underwriting actions, we've also got a couple of green shoots going in a few product lines at the same time. And at the same time, in insurance, we're remixing through what we -- where we will push growth and where we push rate and maybe have a more mix retention because the overall profitability of book has improved. We love having this many levers. This gives us, we think, in the marketplace, an advantage. Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Vinay, across the segment, the retention is 85% versus 81% of last year, which doesn't surprise me. We had a lot of corrective actions going on. You remember particularly in North America, they're up to 83% from 78%. So that makes sense. And in terms of discipline, that's one part of the story is how you're doing on your renewals. The other part is how you're doing on your new. We've got an 8% increase in submission flow in the first quarter. We're quoting 4% more than we did last year. So we're quoting 43% of our submissions. But our hit ratios are down. We're down to 28% from 31%. So I feel like we're seeing the flow. Our teams are getting out there and quoting the business, and we were still -- we're not as successful as we were last year because price is still tough to come by. So I think those 2 together give you a pretty good picture of what's going on.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. Just as a follow-up, within the primary insurance operations, your premiums were up 12% this quarter. Last quarter, I think, quotes on a normalized basis, it was 12%. Do you think that momentum accelerates as your teams gain further traction in this market?","Michael S. McGavick","That's really difficult to forecast. We had forecast that we would -- that we believe we would have growth, but we haven't been specific about the number because these markets change every day it seems. We have to really have the people on the ground with the right message about what it is we want, that the fact that we put profitability as the first concern and great underwriting, and then we let people run. And when they've got that message right, we get a mix of results. And in this quarter, it turned out to yield strong growth. We do have a lot of new activities going on that are now maturing. And I think that is part of the, as I mentioned earlier, the tailwind at our back, from having these new lines of business maturing and these leaders maturing. I think all of that is positive. But we wouldn't turn that into some kind of an assurance about what happens next, because it will depend on the environment for profit in the market.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So fair enough. And just one last numbers question. I think you mentioned it was -- the net investment income was $6 million to $7 million higher this quarter did I hear that correctly?","Peter R. Porrino","Yes, Vinay, this is Pete. Yes, that was -- those are the numbers we quoted.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ryan Byrnes with Langen McAlenney.","Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney","My first question was just quickly on the tax rate, obviously, was kind of a little bit lower than you guys previously stated, kind of mid-teens area. Is that still the kind of the target we should shoot for is mid-teens, even though it was a little bit lighter this year -- or this quarter?","Peter R. Porrino","What we've talked about is an effective tax rate typically in the 11% and 12% range. This was pretty much exactly in line with where we thought it would be. Remember the way that we look at our tax rate is we annualize it. So we look to see what we think our effective tax rate will be for the year, and that's what we booked in the quarter. And this one was pretty much in line with what we thought it would be.","Ryan J. Byrnes - Langen McAlenney","Great. And then secondly, I realize I'm probably a little early on this, but you're kind of -- you stated 2014 goal of getting a double-digit ROE, ex-AOCI. It seems somewhat achievable, I guess, a year early in 2013. I guess at what point do you guys kind of move that goal forward, obviously, as rate increases and the reunderwriting kind of takes shape?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, this is Mike. Certainly, we're not moving it forward just because 1 quarter came in well. There are other -- as we've emphasized several times, there are some winds at our backs that you don't count on. You don't count on this kind of a benign catastrophe environment. You don't count on this kind of benign large loss environment. But that said, and maybe I'll say this in a way that I'm really talking not only to you but to all of my colleagues, who I know often phone into these calls. We are very driven to continue to improve this business. We are not satisfied with this result. We don't think it is a time to say victory. It is not at all that. And while I'm fond of that notion that the harder I work, the luckier I get, I think the reality is that we have a lot of work left to do to really be able to see this kind of result repeatedly, which is ultimately what we'd like to do. But we know that this is just a taste of what it's like when we're hitting on all cylinders and that's a pretty sweet taste, and it makes us driven to do what we can to assure it happens more often. But that's all I can say about it. This is 1 quarter down. The year stretches out long ahead of us.","Operator","And I'll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Michael S. McGavick","Well, I think, I just gave them really. I mean, we're excited by this start. It gives us a sense of what can be achieved. We're well aware of the fortuity involved, but we're very pleased with the underlying metrics that demonstrate that the work we have promised we would do is delivering the results we intended. We appreciate all of your time and attention. We know you'll have follow-up questions, and we're happy to take them, and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines."],"22843":["XL Group Ltd.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group Limited Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Please be advised, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Abbe Goldstein of XL's Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Abbe F. Goldstein - XL Group Ltd.","Thank you. Welcome to the XL Group Limited second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at xlgroup.com. We've posted to our website several documents, including our earnings press release, our quarterly financial statement, and presentation slides we will refer to on our call.","On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks; Steve Robb, XL's CFO, will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, President of P&C, who will review the Insurance and Reinsurance segment results and market conditions. We will then open up the call for questions.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. And a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on Form 10-Q and 10-K, as well as other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statements in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, operating net income, operating ROE measures that are based on operating net income, and fully diluted tangible book value per share. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our website, and the earnings release included in an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing our second quarter 2000 (sic) [2017] result.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","Thank you, Abbe. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call. Tonight, I'll share some highlights of the second quarter. Then Steve Robb, who has been in his new role as CFO since May 1, will review the financials. Greg will then cover insurance and reinsurance for the quarter. And we will conclude the call with Q&A.","Turning to the second quarter, we are pleased to report solid overall results reflecting our continued focus on executing our strategy. All in, our commitment to disciplined underwriting and capturing efficiencies along with positive performance in our investment portfolio generated another quarter of earnings growth. We also took steps to proactively manage our capital.","Looking at the numbers, our earnings per fully diluted share was $1.14 in the second quarter, compared to $0.15 in the second quarter of last year. And our operating EPS was $0.96 in the quarter, compared to $0.37 in the prior year quarter, representing our highest quarterly operating EPS since the end of 2014. Our total P&C gross written premiums were $3.6 billion, an increase of almost 2%, compared to the second quarter last year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","Our underwriting profit increased to $195 million, compared to $101 million in the second quarter of 2016. Our P&C combined ratios and loss ratios both improved, while reinsurance accident year ex-cat loss ratios ticked up in comparison to the same quarter last year, which Greg will discuss in more detail later in the call.","Throughout the first half of the year, we like the progress we've made and feel good about our ability to continue to execute our strategy. At the same time, significant headwinds remain in the insurance and reinsurance marketplaces, as I'm sure you are all aware. There are inflationary and rising loss cost trends, and we and others are managing them. And as we see continuing rate deterioration broadly while, to be fair, some lines are seeing a flattening or even a slight increase.","Given these challenges, we will continue to pull the same levers we've been pulling: Underwriting and portfolio management, continued expense and efficiency improvement, capital management and improvement through our strong culture and drive for innovation.","First, in terms of underwriting and portfolio management. By the nature of our market presence and our continued discipline in picking our spots, insurance submissions are up 5% in the second quarter and 7% year-to-date when we adjust for certain re-underwriting and portfolio-tuning actions taking earlier in the year. Quote ratios remain up nearly 10% in the quarter and year-to-date, while our hit ratios remain around the same at 36%, consistent with the prior year. So, we continue to see more business and we continue to select the business we want, exactly what we had in mind when we created XL Catlin.","Equally as important is our focus on continuous improvement and efficient operations, and we saw our operating expenses come down approximately 4% in the quarter, excluding integration costs and the benefit of foreign exchange. As we discussed previously, this is a greater degree of expense savings than anticipated post Catlin acquisition, attributable to both our leaders' determination to find every efficiency and the broad program of continuous improvement we've set in motion to remind every colleague that they play a role every day in making XL Catlin better.","In terms of capital management, we repurchased $250 million of XL's stock during the second quarter. At this point, we reiterate that we expect to complete no less than $700 million in buybacks for all of 2017. We still view buybacks, even in our current stock price, as one of the better uses of our capital and we'll act accordingly as long as the right conditions persist.","We also took steps in the quarter to enhance our balance sheet by essentially exchanging floating for fixed rate securities, benefiting from transaction economics and diversifying our fixed income investor base in Europe where we have significant operations. Steve will go into the details in his remarks.","Lastly, on innovation and culture. We continue to push the pace of our ability to introduce new products to the market, while some of what we consider our most mature innovative businesses are hitting important milestones. For example, our North American construction unit introduced in 2010 with a unique vertical approach to its market reached $2 billion in gross written premiums over its seven years of operation and is one of our most profitable businesses. A tremendous achievement. The leader of that unit, Gary Kaplan, and his team deserve strong applause for what they've been able to accomplish. Construction risks are complex, and very few insurance carriers have the ability to address them in a similarly comprehensive way.","In product innovation, we introduced 12 new products and services in the quarter. Greg will share some of the specific details on these. We have long seen our drive for innovation as it being equally about our reputation and our ability to think about the future on behalf of our clients, as it is a real remixing opportunity, pivoting an increasing percent of our portfolio towards better performing and more relevant businesses. We're seeing this played out now, and we are committed to pushing hard, getting the benefit of the foundation we've been laying this past several years.","To sum it up, we see this as another solid quarter. We're pulling on the leverage we have, creating opportunities even in tough markets, headwinds persist and we are fully mindful of it, but we remain committed to fully delivering the value of the franchise we have built.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","Thanks, Mike. And good evening, everyone. I'm excited to be on the call with you all tonight in my new role and it's certainly nice to start with a solid quarter. Consistent with the first quarter, we have posted an earnings presentation in our website to accompany our prepared remarks.","Our net income attributable to commons shareholders was $301.6 million, compared to $43.8 million in the second quarter of last year. Operating earnings per share were $0.96, compared to $0.37 a year ago. Improved earnings were driven by lower capacity losses and higher investment returns, partially offset by accident year underwriting results excluding cats and marginally lower levels of prior year development. Our year-to-date annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI integration costs, was 9% for the quarter and 5.8% for the prior year quarter.","It's worth noting that our 2017 year-to-date ROE includes the negative impact of approximately 140 basis points from the first quarter Ogden rate change in the UK. Our underwriting profitability improved in the quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. Our P&C combined ratio decreased from 96% to 92.3%. However, excluding catastrophes and prior year development, P&C combined ratio increased by 1.7 points from 90.3% to 92% largely in the Reinsurance segment.","Greg will discuss our underwriting performance by segment in more detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll provide some high level comments on catastrophe losses and prior year development.","Our natural catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums for the second quarter were $92.1 million or 3.7 loss ratio points, compared to $240 million or 9.8 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2016. The breakdown of catastrophe losses by segment in the quarter was $79.4 million in insurance and $12.8 million in reinsurance.","The breakdown by geography was $51.2 million of U.S. losses and $40.9 million related to international event. Just over half of the losses resulted from the development on late first quarter catastrophes, including Cyclone Debbie, floods in Peru and certain U.S. storms. It's worth noting that the second quarter of 2016 was significantly impacted by the Fort McMurray wildfire losses of almost $130 million.","Turning to our prior year development. Our second quarter results reflect a full ground up valuation process and reserves. Prior year net development in the second quarter was a favorable $86.7 million or 3.5 loss ratio points, compared to a favorable development of $98.6 million or 3.9 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2016. This reflects favorable development of $7 million in the Reinsurance segment and $17 million in the Insurance segment.","Insurance releases were most significant in North America and were partially offset by strengthening in both Global and International Line. As we continue to enhance efficiencies throughout the Company, our operating expenses decreased by 9.5%, compared to the same quarter last year, which is a decrease of 4% if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and integration costs.","Integration costs for the quarter were $39.4 (sic) [$39.1] million, or $0.15 per diluted share. As expected, this will be our last quarter of integration expenses.","For the full year 2017, we still anticipate operating expenses, excluding integration costs, to be at the bottom of our previous guidance of $1.77 billion to $1.84 billion, assuming FX rates stay roughly where they are today.","Our operating effective tax rate, excluding discreet tax benefits, was 10.3% in the quarter and 6.4% when adjusted for discrete items. Year-to-date, our operating effective tax rate is 10.6%, excluding discrete tax benefits. And we still expect the full year tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 14%, as we previously discussed.","Fully diluted book value per share at the end of the second quarter was $42.15, an increase of $1.05 or 2.6% from the end of March. This increase was driven by net income and positive marks on our invested asset.","Turning to the investment portfolio. My comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income increased by $1 million to $177.2 million, compared to the prior year quarter, despite a decrease in the fixed income volume. Net investment income increased by $10 million, compared to the first quarter of 2017. These increases are attributable to opportunities in the corporate in structure (13:03) sectors, as well as higher short-term rates.","During the second quarter, our average new money rate was 2.1%, compared to 1.7% in the second quarter of last year. And at the end of June, our gross book yield fixed income portfolio was unchanged at 2.4%. The duration of the total investment portfolio increased slightly to 3.5, just short of our liability-based duration \u2013 benchmark duration.","Net income from affiliates was $73.5 million for the quarter, compared to $34.6 million in the prior year second quarter, driven mainly by the sale of one of our investment manager affiliates, as well as positive performance across all categories, in particular, private equity.","Unrealized net gains were $600 million at the end of the quarter. And the total return from investments was 1% in the quarter in original currency.","Turning to capital management. As Mike noted, during the quarter we repurchased six million shares of XL stock for $250 million at an average price of $41.87. We have now bought back $450 million in the first six months of the year at an average price of $40.70 and has $650 million remaining available for buybacks under our current repurchase authorization. We reiterate our previous guidance of anticipated repurchases no less than $700 million in 2017, as long as the right conditions remain. We do not seek to grow capital in this current condition.","Lastly, we are pleased to have taken action to enhance our balance sheet in ways that are both strategically and economically beneficial. Specifically, at the beginning of July, we tendered $420 million of preferred shares across three classes, as well as some of our subordinated debt. To finance this transaction at the end of June, we issued \u20ac500 million of new subordinated debt. These transactions accomplished several key outcomes for us. We reduced our floating rate exposure at a good price, and took advantage of the market conditions in Europe by issuing bonds at 3.25% fixed for 10 years, locking in a natural euro hedge for our European subsidiaries and expanding our European fixed income investor base.","In the third quarter, we expect to see a book value net gain reported through non-controlling interest as a result of securities purchased below their carrying value. For modeling purposes, we have provided a detailed schedule for you on our remaining preferreds and outstanding debt on slide 17 of our earnings presentation.","Due to the timing overlap of the new debt issuance at the end of June and the tender offer completion in early July, our GAAP financial leverage of June 30 temporarily picked up as compared to the end of March. This overlap impact will largely self-correct in the third quarter when the impact of the tender is recorded.","More details of our leverage amounts including pro forma figures can be found on slide 14. As we've indicated in the past, over time, we expect to move our leverage ratio lower towards the industry average. And in the near term, we will evaluate additional capital reliability management activities to address the small amount by which the proceeds from the debt offering exceeded the tender.","Now, I'll turn it over to Greg to discuss the underwriting results in more detail.","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","Thanks, Steve.","This evening I'll start with underlying discipline and portfolio management within our results, provide an update on product innovation, discuss our market presence, and finish with some comments on current market conditions.","Starting with underwriting discipline and portfolio management, page 11 of the presentation contains our results by segment. The Insurance segment's accident quarter ex-cat combined ratio was 92.9%, compared to 92.6% in the second quarter of 2016; and 92.1% for the first half of 2017, compared to 93.8% for the first half of 2016. In the quarter, a slightly worse loss ratio was partially offset by an improved expense ratio.","Insurance segment's recent accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio is 61.4% which compares to 60.8% in the second quarter of last year. This slight increase was driven primarily by attritional deterioration and a few lines resulting from our second quarter reserve review offset by a favorable loss experience in certain property lines.","For the first half of the year, the ratio is 61.1% in line with last year as our loss ratio improvement actions completed during 2016, as well as further actions we're executing on in 2017, helped to offset rate and loss cost trends that Mike noted earlier.","The underwriting expense ratio decreased 0.3 points in the prior year to 31.5% in the second quarter. We have slight uptick in acquisition costs due to lower profit-based commissions on certain ceded quota share contracts.","For the first half of 2017, the underwriting expense ratio has decreased 1.8 points to 30.9%. Insurance reserve releases in the quarter totaled $17 million compared to a $33 million reserve release a year ago. These releases are primarily from reserves in our North American professional and excess casualty portfolios, partially offset by strengthening in our international financial lines, London wholesale property, and energy property classes.","In Reinsurance, the segment produced strong underwriting performance, with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 83.8%, compared with 95.1% last year. The combined ratio improvement for the quarter resulted from higher accident year loss and expense ratios, which were more than offset by lower catastrophe loss activity. The Reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 59%, which compares to the 54.4% in the second quarter of 2016, driven predominantly by mix of business, unfavorable loss experience in short tail lines, and a large loss in our Asia Pacific facultative business.","On a year-to-date basis, the accident year ex-cat loss ratio increased just 2.6 points to 56%. The underwriting expense ratio increased 0.8 points to 31.4% in the second quarter. This increase is driven by higher acquisition cost as a result of product mix change resulting in more proportional business which carries higher ceding commissions relative to excessive loss reinsurance.","Reserve releases in the quarter totaled $70 million, compared to a $65 million reserve release a year ago. Reserve releases were primarily in short tail lines and, to a lesser extent, in casualty classes. Combined, our two segments provide us with a well-diversified portfolio that is better able to withstand catastrophe loss activity.","In the second quarter, our Insurance segment had higher cat activity, partly due to adverse development on late-occurring first quarter events. Reinsurance, on the other hand, had very few catastrophes in the quarter. For the Group, we incurred $92 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premium, down from $240 million in the same quarter last year. The largest events in the quarter were once again numerous U.S. wind and hail events.","Shifting to innovation. The second quarter was another strong quarter for new and expanded products and capabilities, as you can see on page 7 of the presentation. Some of the new product launches included an accident and health solution in United Kingdom which includes a wide range of support and response services, a Real Estate Environmental Protection solution in Asia Pacific to help property owners with environmental liabilities, as well as a new mergers and acquisitions insurance coverage, which include a suite of product to support deals in the global transactional risk market. We also increased our terrorism insurance coverage limits from $200 million to $250 million, and extended our global property insurance capacity by 25% to $500 million.","Turning to our market presence. We have a broad product suite and extensive global reach. We're now fully mature in every line and geography. We are still able to find profitable growth in a difficult market environment, and our accident and health and transactional liability businesses are two good examples of new and growing capabilities.","Page 12 of the presentation shows our largest growing and contracting businesses for the quarter. In the Insurance segment, gross written premiums, normalized for foreign exchange, increased year-over-year by 4.5% in the second quarter and by 6.5% in the first half of 2017. Our largest growing portfolios in the quarter include Political Risk, Global Risk Management, International Financial Lines, and U.S. Programs. Meanwhile, we maintained underwriting discipline in the most competitive markets, with reduced top line in Energy, Aerospace and London wholesale portfolios.","Turning to Reinsurance. Gross written premiums for the quarter was down 4%. The decrease is due to a large international casualty quota share treaty in the prior year that did not renew and cancelled business that did not meet our return expectations. Offsetting these factors was our ability to take advantage of new business opportunities and increased shares with existing client. We continue to show the ability to shift our book of business during the quarter. We grew our property risk treaty portfolios while shrinking the property catastrophe book in the face of continued rate decreases, particularly during the June Florida renewal.","Finally, turning to market conditions. Price in the Insurance segment was down 1.7% on a year-to-date basis. International business lines were up over 2% for the year as mid single-digit rate increases in casualty were offset by modest rate decreases in property. Our North America business lines are down 1.5%, driven by our professional D&O and U.S. program books, partially offset by modest price increases in Global Risk Management and excess casualty lines. Our global lines of businesses continue to be most adversely impacted, with rates down over 3% driven by continued competitive conditions in the Energy and, to a lesser extent, Marine and Aviation lines.","In the Reinsurance segment, we continue to operate in a challenging trading environment in most of our classes, but rate decreases continue to decelerate in most lines and regions. Year-to-date rates across the segment were down approximately 1%, and our global catastrophe portfolio was down 3%, significantly less than 6% decrease we experienced in 2016. And the remainder of the property treaty book, rates were down under 1%. Our casualty business increased by 1% and the remainder of our classes were down low single-digits.","In summary, we delivered another solid quarter of P&C underwriting profitability, and while our organic premium growth was slowed in the quarter, reflecting challenging market conditions, our underwriting teams continue to find new profitable opportunities while maintaining underwriting discipline.","I'll now turn it back to Abbe.","Abbe F. Goldstein - XL Group Ltd.","Thanks, Greg. Shelia, we are ready to entertain questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good afternoon. So, first question is on the core underlying combined ratio on both Insurance and Reinsurance segment. On the insurance side, is there a further room for improvements given the current market condition? And on the reinsurance side, could you quantify the factors you mentioned in your prepared commentary in term of mix and unfavorable development, as well as the back losses in Asia Pacific?","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","On the \u2013 this is Mike, Kai. On the insurance side, again, I'd point to the accident year ex-cat loss ratio for the full six months this year versus last year. I mean \u2013 and noting, as Greg shared, that we did in our second quarter review of loss ratios have some upticks in a few lines. The fact that we had negative rate trend and a few lines worsening and came out roughly the same six months this year over six months last year means that the actions we're taking on the portfolio are fighting off that worsening.","That's a very pleasing sign to us. And so, we don't see any reason to believe that we can't keep fighting. We've already said it won't be quarter-over-quarter but we can't keep fighting off those deleterious effects. And that, of course, allows the expense ratio improvements to expand margin. So, we see no reason to believe we can't continue to do that. It's just \u2013 it's very hard out there, but we're pleased with what we've demonstrated we can do.","Reinsurance is a more complicated story. And there, I really believe that you should look more at the total result than quarter to quarter accident year ex-cat, which isn't as meaningful a measure as it is for interest. But I'll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Kai, I think if you look at the accident year ex-cat, it's up 4.6% in the quarter. But let me step back a little bit and give you three thoughts. One, about how accident year ex-cat intersects with catastrophe in the Reinsurance business, which is what Mike just referred to. Second, look a little bit at this recent history of the accident year ex-cat loss ratio and reinsurance. And then third, directly answer your question and provide some of those drivers in a more quantified fashion.","So, first, let me step back. Within the Reinsurance segment, exposure to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses are often underwritten in the same property treaty. This is particularly true when you're in per risk and quota share treaties in the short tail lines. And as a reminder, reinsurance, we do not record a catastrophe loss until the event is greater than $5 million to the segment.","This is primarily a given that there's a difficulty identifying smaller cats both from an information lack from our clients and the quality and depth of the information we get on some of our participations. Because of this, we will have some catastrophe losses showing up in our accident year ex-cat loss ratio within the segment.","In a quarter with relatively low identifiable cat activity, the accident year ex-cat loss ratio will be higher as some part of our loss ratio has not moved over to the catastrophe side. That's partly what you saw here in this quarter.","A shift to the second part, the history, we went back to the second quarter 2015 and looked at our reinsurance accident year ex-cat loss ratio. We started with that quarter, Kai, because as you know, that's when the XL Catlin transaction closed. The quarters ranged from a low of just under 50% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to the high of 59% this quarter. But I can assure you there's no general trend line to be observed. Roughly, we bounce around between 50% and 57% and back to 50% and up to 55%, and there is no trend line in there. It's always dictated by partial interaction of cat and accident year ex-cat, but also some of the events that happen.","So, let me give you the context for the quarter now, for the third topic. I refer to three main drivers in my remarks: Mix, unfavorable experience in our property treaty, and a large facultative loss. Each of these three accounted for roughly one quarter of the year-over-year increase. The remaining 25% was a number of small items, the largest of one being the beginning of the end finally of the impact from purchased accounting, which was a detriment this quarter over last quarter.","So, let me give you a little more color on the three drivers. Mix of business is the only component that is likely to continue into subsequent quarters, and is driven mainly by the large multi-line quota share we wrote at the end of 2016.","The second piece of unfavorable experience in the property treaty portfolio is mainly driven by a few mid-sized losses in the mid single-digit millions rather than a holistic underlying shift in frequency.","And the third piece, the property facultative loss in the quarter was a result of fire loss at a pharmaceutical factory and is represented as a type of loss than can occur infrequently in our facultative business. Moreover, that business is one of our most profitable on a combined ratio basis.","So, I think, Kai, you look at that, it's about a quarter of that increase in the year-over-year that we think is likely to continue into subsequent quarters. Obviously, it's the risk business and things can happen that can change that outlook, but that's what we see at the moment.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very comprehensive. My second question is on the expense side. So, now you completed the integration program. Will there be further expense savings coming down like in \u2013 we'll be looking out for 2018 and 2019?","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","We do have continuing plans, as we call it, continuous improvement. To say to ourselves, having unlocked as much benefit as we did through the transaction, we should never allow ourselves to see expenses taken for granted, but rather that we should always be looking for ways to lower our cost. So, I don't think \u2013 first of all, we've said as Steve said that we're going to be at the lower end of the range that we put out in our actual expense saves, so that will take us through this year. And as we begun our planning for next year, we're already insisting on continuing to improve.","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","Yeah, Kai. I mean, I think as we look forward, we're thinking less about the absolute reduction in expenses as an imperative and more about a relative reduction in expenses compared to the growth in earned our premium, such that we're expanding our operating leverage around expenses and still having some room to invest in our business and our future.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And so, like a top line growth is not as strong as you've expected, given the market conditions. So, do you have lever to actually making the dollar amounts \u2013 absolute dollar amounts of total expenses going down next year?","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","If that were the case, if we were unable to grow and afford growth in our expenses then that would \u2013 we would reduce our expenses, yeah.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Well, thank you so much.","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","You bet, Kai.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Just an accounting item. Do you still have (30:36) the investment manager affiliates, does that go through the net income line or through the operating income line, and what's the EPS impact?","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","It's going through the operating income line, and the EPS impact would be \u2013 I'd have to get back to you on that, but the total value of the gain was approximately $27 million, so you can determine it from that.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And I mean, should we expect that XL's currently in the process of harvesting some of the investments that was made for sellers as a one-off sort of a situation for the XL Group complex?","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","Well, I think of that gain certainly not as a run-rate gain. We have been decreasing certain of our affiliate positions over the last few quarters, but I wouldn't think of this as a run-rate or as a policy of selling off some of our manager or affiliate positions overall.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And tax rate it came in low, is 10% to 12% still an adequate guidance for the longer term?","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","It is, yes.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Just a question on the acquisition expense on the Insurance segment. That ticked up. You had given a reason, I wish you can go over that a little bit more. And is this the kind of number we should think going forward? So, this is insurance acquisition expense ratio?","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","Yeah, Jay. It's Greg. The acquisition ticked up, it's a couple of ceded quota share contracts, one of which covers a large proportion of the book. And at the first quarter results, we thought it would trigger \u2013 we believe it would trigger a profit commission. With the second quarter results, we don't think it will. So, it was a reversal. That's \u2013 I call it a bit of timing, but that's the one piece of it. And in the prior year, we had a profit commission pay on a particular line of business quota share that didn't pay this quarter. So, that's the main driver. I think the acquisition costs are in about the right place, if you look at the year-to-date number.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your line is open.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Hi. Thank you. I guess, a few numbers ones for you, Steve. The investment income, the P&C-only investment income, while it wasn't up that much year-over-year, it was up a decent amount sequentially. You did mention new money being up a bit. Is where we are a decent run rate at current new money yields because it sounds like portfolio yields kind of stabilized?","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","There was a little bit of adjustment in this quarter for some funds withheld, but I think in the $175 million to $177 million range is probably about right, maybe a little under $175 million.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it, okay. And then, I was going to ask for a little bit more follow-up on the affiliate that was sold. Can you just give us any sense, any color, on sort of what that investment was and maybe what the size of it was? Or just what does $27 million mean? That's sort of \u2013 I'm trying to find some context for it, I guess.","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","(34:00).","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Maybe what the book value of the investment was? Is there any other color you can give us?","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","Yeah. The book value that we had was materially less than the second on the sale. It was less than $10 million that we had on our books, so you can triangulate as to where we got to. It was \u2013 so, it wasn't a material portion of our affiliate book and wasn't a material portion of our investment fund manager book either. But we think it was a nice gain and it was an asset that we thought it was the right time to sell.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it. That's what I wanted. So, is this one that you held for a long time or is this one of the more recent ones and that's why it was smaller?","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","In relative terms, it's one of the more recent ones. But as you know, we haven't been adding things in this portfolio for quite some time. So, it's a decade old.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it, okay. And then, Mike, I was hoping if you can remind me a little bit, or Greg \u2013 either one \u2013 remind me a little bit about how you manage your cyber risk. I believe you have some recent hires area growing, just sort of how you manage limits, tail scenarios, things like that, in that book in light of the RDS-like analysis that (35:18) through recently?","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","Right. So, we \u2013 I'll turn it to Greg very quickly, but I would emphasize this. We keep it at very low limits per risk, we manage our sector exposures as well as the individual risks. And this is a very broad and diversified book, and that makes me very comfortable with what we've got going on there. Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","Yeah. But we run different but similar RDS scenarios to what you've seen published recently. We run it through the entire book, so the growth you're seeing is in what I would call the more identifiable, more quantifiable pieces of the exposure. It's effectively, as you know, in the United States, in Canada, it's data \u2013 recovery of data. That personal data has been hacked and you're putting people's credit back together and you're monitoring that over a period of time. And so, it's not business interruption, it's not property damage.","Clearly, as these reports have identified, the bigger pieces of the exposure are more difficult to quantify in our traditional property and liability coverage. We do go to that exercise. As Mike noted, it's not a just a rule of thumb off a bunch of premium. It's looking at the book, looking at limit sizes, looking at the forms where we think we have coverage, where we don't have coverage, and quantifying that across the entirety of the book, insurance and reinsurance.","Clearly, one of the big discussions after a very large event will be what was excluded and what wasn't. We believe, as we look through these policies, that we have good exclusions on there. Clearly, that will end up being tried in a court of law and there is variability in that outcome where those cases to happen.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","That's kind of what I wanted to follow up on. I guess what caught my eye reading it was \u2013 doing this off the top of my head, but I believe it was about a $50 billion economic and only $8 billion insured. And it felt like maybe there's a lot of room for some surprises on, as you say, if that case goes the wrong way. How much could that $8 billion go to $25 billion? And how significant is the potential \u2013 I'm thinking about just what happened obviously in \u2013 with back to 9\/11 with terror that we \u2013 terror and things like that. How much worse can that be or did you feel that \u2013 I guess, what I'm trying to ask is did you feel that the report was reasonably consistent with how you guys view it or did you feel that maybe it was underestimating the potential for insured loss?","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","A couple of things. First, in one way, your question is impossible to answer because the truth is when the courts interpret coverage to exist when we've never intended it, it's very hard to know exactly in what way they'll do it. Will they do it over time or they do it retroactively? There's so many questions about what they'll do that we would be shooting at a dartboard.","Our own RDS scenarios, and we have done Black Swan analyses of these exact kinds of events. They clearly indicate, as you've already observed, that the exposures in the court's reinterpreting contracts not so much in what we're writing today, which is one of the reasons why the way we're approaching it gives me such comfort.","The other thing that gives me comfort is, as the marketplace for standalone cyber increases, it makes clear the explicit nature of the individual contract and our rejection of the idea that is included in the standard contract, which we do not believe it is at the very existence an uptake of the standalone policies, an important element in how this market protects itself against misinterpretation of our historic intent.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it. I'm sure \u2013 I have more questions I'm about saving for a time when we have more time to talk. Thank you.","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","Sure.","Abbe F. Goldstein - XL Group Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Troisi with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Peter Troisi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I appreciate the disclosure on capital management in the presentation. And you show on page 14 in there a leverage of 29.5% and you said you anticipate reducing that metric. So, can you just give a sense for what your leverage target is? And then I have a follow-up to that.","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","Yeah. We've said that over the medium term, we'd like to get down to the peer medium leverage level, which is around 25%. That won't happen overnight, but we intend over the next few years to directionally move that way.","Peter Troisi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. So, 25% measured in the same way that you measure it in the presentation?","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","Yeah.","Peter Troisi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Great. And then just one other. The liability management that, Steve, you referenced. Would you anticipate prioritizing hybrids and preferreds there or is it \u2013 or versus senior? I know you've said it would be small, but I'm just trying to get a sense.","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","No. I don't think we would necessarily look at the hybrids and preferreds ahead. We obviously have the 2018s coming up and we have a number of high coupon seniors. We haven't concluded on what we'll do. And the difference between what we received and what we are able to tender for is only about $100 million. So, we will work on that over the rest of the year. But I wouldn't say that we will necessarily target the hybrid.","Peter Troisi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks. So, I just had one follow-up. On the 61.4% in the Insurance segment, just looking to drill down on what exactly you found in the reserve review that made that tick up, and what was the order of magnitude on the 61.4% from the reserve review conclusions?","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","Sure, Ryan. Thanks. It was \u2013 primarily the change in the current accident year pick was in the order of magnitude of around $25 million, primarily in our casualty E&S in North America, our international financial lines and in particular our management liability part of that portfolio, and a little bit in our property book in London wholesale market. Those were the main drivers and that's about the magnitude.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And the order of magnitude, I guess, over the remainder of the year. The $25 million capture all four quarters, or is that just the first and the second?","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","That captured the year-to-date. There are activities going on in both those areas \u2013 all three of those areas, that we will see how they play out in terms of improving the underwriting, that may offset some of those increases in the second half of the year. We'll just have to see how they play out and how successful we are predominantly in that management liability line within international bench lines and the ability to get significant rate year-over-year.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. I'm going to stay in the same realm. (42:54) the impact of first quarter catastrophes that bled into the second quarter insurance accident year ex-cat loss ratio?","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","In insurance \u2013 this is Greg. In insurance, zero. The only intersection of cat losses of accident year ex-cat is in the Reinsurance segment. And...","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Oh, okay. I'm sorry.","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","Yeah. In insurance, we capture all of our cats from first off.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Let me ask that on reinsurance then.","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","Sure. On reinsurance, I think it was about $5 million or $7 million roughly.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And could we get the run rate of the income, with the annual income from the affiliate that was sold?","Stephen Robb - XL Group Ltd.","The affiliate that was sold, the run rate would have been very little, less than $2 million a year.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Oh, fantastic. Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","And they are \u2013 sorry, but before we move to the next question, it's \u2013 the actual number is $13 million of reinsurance. I was thinking of just for one particular event. The $13 million was the total in the second quarter in reinsurance from cat development from prior quarters.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Mike, I'm just curious. Your comments about loss trend and starting to see that escalate a little bit, a little bit concerned. Is that a change kind of from what you've been thinking recently or is there something that kind of triggered that?","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","No. I mean, we have \u2013 I think, if you look over the last several years, obviously, loss cost trends have been extraordinarily benign. And our view is that we're starting to see some signs of movement. I don't want to be overly alarmist. Don't get me wrong. But we do see \u2013 we obviously have seen it and I have felt, for example, we've seen it sometimes in the \u2013 in some of the casualty classes, and it's got our attention. But it's too early to say it's going to continue and grow, but we have seen some incipient signs, we've heard comments from others that suggest they are too, and so we're paying closer attention to it as one of the things we have to overcome in this soft part of the market.","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","This is Greg, Thanks. Brian, if I could just add a little bit. It's a very, very diverse portfolio, right? So, it gives us a bit of a hedge against any one particular area spiking up. And just real quickly to add to what Mike said, on the property side, short tail line side of the business, it's reflected in our premiums in terms of the exposure-based drawings, so view that as kind of a wash in terms of the loss ratio impact.","In casualty, we're seeing kind of mid single-digits, slightly higher in the U.S., slightly lower outside the U.S. I know a couple of high points that I'll give you and I'll let you ask a follow-on if you want, but we did a lot of press around trends impact in D&O in the U.S. We view a lot of that. There's a lot of noise, a lot more nuisance, less likely to come to fruition claims there. And as Mike just referred to you, on the D&O side here, we do see a little more of a shift there that's more U.S.-style litigation including class action litigation being allowed in by the courts than before. Again, I would stress, it's not a big wave, but certainly something we're watching and paying attention to.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And just a follow-up. I'm just curious, the big growth in the quarter, it was like the professional lines been kind of highlighted, International Financial, I assume that's where it was coming from. What was that with the attractiveness of that business right now?","Gregory S. Hendrick - XL Group Ltd.","Yes. The International Financial Lines is made of up of three major portfolios, professional indemnity which would be lawyers and architects and that kind of business; what's called financial institutions which is banks and related; and then management liability. And so, where we see this impact coming in is particularly on U.S.-listed \u2013 comings of U.S.-listed or U.S. exposures in the management liability line and very, very large accounts management liability line.","The growth you're seeing is we've been on a drive for a while in that business to reduce our limits that we've been successful at and write a broader spread of risks, which come in that professional indemnity and sometimes in that financial institutions area. And so, you're seeing the growth coming out of those areas as opposed to in the management liability area, which has been the part causing that problem.","However, underneath that, on the smaller risk of management liability where there are more domestic exposures, we are growing there as well and trying to get that diversification. So, it's one particular part of the book being impacted, but growing the other parts to get better spread.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, just a quick follow-up. On the share buybacks, you have done $450 million so far. And the $700 million only have like $250 million left, like the remaining. Does it sort of imply that the pace of buyback will be materially slower in the second half?","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","Well, all we've got to do is to reiterate the guidance we've given all along. There would be a minimum, a floor if you will, of $700 million, as long as conditions persist as they are. Certainly, we're not \u2013 we don't know exactly what we'll do yet this year, but we're monitoring closely. And that's about as much as we can say.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. The other way to think about it is that your total payout between buyback and dividends, you said you were not looking to grow your capital base at the current marketing environment. Would that imply that potential 100% payout ratio?","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","Yes.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","No problem.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mike McGavick for closing remarks.","Michael S. McGavick - XL Group Ltd.","Look, we appreciate the questions and the thoughtfulness of them. We know that because of the stock exchange's requirements, some of the materials got to you a little later compared to the call. We apologize for the way that made you work a little harder. We apologize for that. And I appreciate particularly the ability to dive in on where the loss ratio is going because I think if you look at headlines, it was easy to not understand that the Insurance segment continues to deliver in the way that it should and the reinsurance movements are really kind of unique to its business model and are being handled in a way that doesn't suggest any real trend and in fact is in line with the way we've managed that book as we go along forever, and that's been a very profitable book.","So, you can take from that, we're very pleased with the way this quarter has ended. We're pleased to be continuing to be able to deliver even in this difficult market, and we're going to keep pulling all those levers as hard as we can.","Thank you very much for your time.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you, all, for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised this conference is being recorded.","Now I would like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David Radulski","Thank you, Shirley. Welcome the XL Group Limited's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlgroup.com. We posted to our of website several documents, including our earnings press release, our quarterly financial supplement and presentation slides we\u2019ll refer to in our call. On our call today Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks. Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand and Greg Hendrick, who will review insurance and reinsurance segment results and market conditions respectively, we'll then open it up for questions.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements, including any estimates on losses resulting from recent natural catastrophes, are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. And a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made. And we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","Our call today also includes non-GAAP financial measures including operating net income, operating ROE measures that are based on operating net income, net income excluding the contribution from the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements and fully diluted tangible book value per share. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings materials posted to our website and in the earnings release included as an exhibit to today's Form 8-K announcing our fourth quarter 2016 results.","And with that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Mike McGavick","Good evening and thank you for joining our call. Tonight I'll share highlights of the fourth quarter while giving some overall perspective on how we view the full-year 2016, then Pete will discuss the financials and as this was the last quarter when Paul had responsibilities for insurance, we\u2019ll have the pleasure of hearing him give his insurance perspective one more time. And then Greg will go through the reinsurance highlights. We stumbled out of the gate with a lousy first quarter and it was a tough catastrophe year throughout particularly in the fourth quarter. At the same time as the year developed, our underlying strength continued to emerge and we finished the year feeling very good about where we are going. Let me give you a couple of examples. First, as Paul and Greg will detail, in a tough market, we grew premium in both insurance and reinsurance and we accomplished this growth without sacrificing quality as our grinding focus drove further underwriting improvement. For Q4, our PNC accident year ex-cat loss ratio was 58% and our accident year ex-cat combined ratio was 89.1%. In both cases these are some of the best quarterly results in these metrics in at least 20 quarters. That's a solid trend that we will work to continue.","Of course given the fortuity that can occur in any single quarter as we have discussed, we view our results on an annual basis to be more accurate gauge of our progress. And for the full year, PNC accident year ex-cat loss ratio and combined ratio was a 58.7 and 90.7 respectively. Again some of the best results in these metrics at XL in over ten years. At a segment level, insurance lowered the 2016 accident ex-cat loss ratio to 61.4% and reinsurance produced a 2016 accident year loss ratio of 63% including the noted level of catastrophes. And our focus on efficiency continued throughout the year, with operating expense of 8.3% favorable versus the prior year quarter. So as we review the full year, while we find it frustrating in many ways, we can see the underlying strengths are there and as the year developed grew stronger. Perhaps even more important however is that throughout this challenging year, our colleagues\u2019 dedication to client service never wavered. By the end of 2016, these efforts were recognized in numerous ways, including our claiming the number one spot for industry product innovation from Advisen, earning first place across nearly every metric in the most recent Gracechurch survey of the London market and on being awarded highest in customer satisfaction amongst commercial insurers in the J.D. Power North America 2016 survey.","So in totality and especially with the dedication of our colleagues in mind, we like the way we are positioned for 2017. Before I turn it over to Pete, I want to comment on two other items that I'm sure are on your mind; expectations for share buyback and our plans in relation to Brexit. In terms of buybacks, as we look at 2017 we would expect at this point to complete not less than $700 million in buyback. As you'll recall this was also the amount we forecast for 2016. In reality, we ended 2016 having bought back just over $1 billion worth of shares. So we obviously continued to view buyback as one of the better uses of our capital and will act accordingly as long as the right conditions persist, but we expect to do no less than 700 million. And then second in terms of Brexit, in the last few days, you've seen more clarity on some process and substance and some signs of recognition that a mutual arrangement covering financial services might be in everyone\u2019s interest. It is even possible that the eventual outcome might look like it is today. I personally hope that will be the case. That said the timeline remains in doubt as does the outcome. And in any case there will be a long transition.","To put it simply, we at XL Catlin will not wait to give our clients certainty that we will be able to continue to serve them as we do today. And in this we have some core advantages we can utilize. First is the fact that we have tremendous global flexibility. Second, we had already taken the step a few years back to transition our main UK carrier to an SC making relocation within the EU far simpler. I want to emphasize that we are not announcing a specific plan today, but I want to signal we will not be waiting for an outcome to be imposed with little time to react, better to be on the front foot. We intend to take advantage at the right time of the flexibility we have built. Finally, as I said at the start, this is the last quarter that aligned to the operating model we had been working under since the transaction. I want to thank Paul Brand and Kelly Lyles for their leadership of the insurance segment throughout this exciting and demanding time. We\u2019re really excited to see what Paul will do next in his new role as the Chairman of the [indiscernible], our new innovation program and equally excited by Kelly leading our client and country operation. Our new PNC operating model went into effect January 1 and it is already having the desired impact with a more efficient decision making and closer alignment between the business and our clients. And of course next quarter you'll be hearing from Greg as a leader of our entire PNC underwriting operations. And I know he's going to continue to do great things. So in summ [ph], in many ways this was a humbling year and I know it was deeply frustrating for our shareholders. But with the advantage of doing this past year in totality and seeing how it shaped what we can produce in 2017 we're excited about what comes next.","With that I'll turn it over to Pete.","Pete Porrino","Thanks Mike and good evening. Operating net income for the fourth quarter was $128 million or $0.47 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $195 million in 2015 or $0.65 per share. Operating net income for the full year was $461 million or $1.63 per share. This includes deal related integration costs of $59 million for the fourth quarter 2016 as compared to $73 million for the same quarter last year. For the full year we incurred integration costs of $222 million as compared to $156 million in 2015 bearing in mind that we closed the Catlin transaction in May of 2015. Now turning to our quarterly slide presentation, Slide 5 illustrates the comparison of fourth quarter 2016 operating earnings per share compared to last year. You can clearly see that heightened catastrophe activity masked the improvement in our accident year ex-cat result. And now turning to Slide 6, we provide a normalized view of our full-year operating ROE excluding integration costs and net unrealized investment gains or losses which include adjustments to normalized timing and seasonality as well as naturally varying elements of our results. We start with our operating ROE excluding unrealized gains. Since we are providing a year to date figure at the end of the year, there is no meaningful adjustments of timing or seasonality element. We adjust our income from affiliate assets to catastrophes to normalize the naturally volatile parts of our operation. With these adjustments, our operating ROE excluding unrealized gains for 2016 was 8.9%.","We've also included the progression of this annualized year-to-date metric by quarter for 2016. We recognized this slide has limitations but we hope that you find it informative. And as we said last quarter, our use of analyst estimates in the normalization is not an endorsement of their accuracy. Our net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter was $305 million or $1.12 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $229 million or $0.76 per share for the same quarter in 2015. And for the full year, $441 million or $1.56 per share compared to $1.2 billion or $4.15 per share in the prior year. This variance was largely driven by the impact of our life derivative along with the scale of our interest in ARX in the prior year. As we have previously discussed, our net income is impacted by the mark to market movement of the derivatives that transfer the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance sale transaction. And as always this amount has no impact on comprehensive income or operating results. Our natural catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premiums for the fourth quarter totaled $246 million as we announced on January 9 or 10.1 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to $108 million or 4.6 loss ratio points in the same quarter of 2015. Paul and Greg will expand on this area later.","Operating expenses continued to improve compared to the prior year and remain in line with our previously announced estimates for operating expense levels as provided in our 8-K filed in June of 2016. We continue to believe that our operating expenses excluding integration expenses for 2017 will decline again compared to 2016 consistent with the estimates we previously provided of $1.77 billion to $1.84 billion. If the pound and euro stay at the current levels we expect to be closer to the bottom of that range. As you're aware this is a ground up valuation quarter for us. Prior year net development resulting from the fourth quarter ground up review was a favorable $106 million or 4.3 loss ratio points for the quarter compared to net favorable development of $121 million or 5.1 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2015. This reflects favorable development of $24 million from the insurance segment and $82 million from the reinsurance segment. For the full year, development was a favorable $302 million split $92 million from insurance segment and $210 million from the reinsurance segment or 3.1 loss ratio points compared to $307 million with 3.7 loss ratio points in the prior year.","Property and casualty combined ratio for the quarter was 94.8% or 2.5 points higher than the same quarter last year and the full year\u2019s 94.2% was 2.2 points higher than the prior year, driven by higher catastrophe losses. Our combined ratio excluding prior-year development and natural catastrophe losses for the quarter was 89.1%, 3.7 points lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. This reduction is driven by decreases in all three components; loss ratio, acquisition cost ratio and general expense ratio. The full-year\u2019s 90.7% was lower by 2.4 percentage points compared to 2015. As you can see in the financial supplement, our operating effective tax rate excluding discrete items was 16.6% for the quarter and 10.7% for the year. Both are high than what was expected at September 30 due to our fourth quarter earnings being in higher tax jurisdictions than previously estimated largely due to catastrophe losses. We also had non-recurring tax benefits in the quarter and year that reduces those rates to 0.7% and 4% respectively. Fully diluted book value per share declined by 4.8% in the fourth quarter resulting from negative mark to market movements on our fixed income portfolio reflecting the recent rise in interest rate. Fully diluted book value per share grew by 2.2% in the full year.","Turning to the investment portfolio and as usual my comments will exclude the Life Funds Withheld Assets. Net investment income was $161 million compared to $172 million for the prior year fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our average new money rate was 2% and since election in the US, modestly about that. At the end of December, the gross book yield of the fixed income portfolio was 2.4% and the duration of the total investment portfolio increased marginally to 3.4 years due to the increase in market interest rates and remains short of our liability duration benchmark. We anticipate that net investment income will continue to remain under pressure given the current low interest rate environment and from lower cash flow as a result of our share repurchase program. We are approximately $3.7 billion of assets of book yields of 2.5% rolling off over the next 12 months. Net income from affiliates was $48 million for the quarter compared to net income of $15 million in the prior-year quarter due to positive hedge fund performance compared to the prior year quarter. Results were also driven by a net $14 million benefit resulting from the rebalancing of the investment portfolio as we change concentrations in certain individual positions as part of the normal course partially offset by a decline in value within operating affiliate. Unrealized net gains were $0.4 billion at the end of the quarter. The total return on investments was negative 1.1% for the quarter in original currency and on a year-to-date basis the total return on investments was 2.8%.","And with respect to capital management, we continued to execute share buybacks during the fourth quarter. During the quarter we repurchased 4 million shares for $145 million at an average price of $35.94 per share leaving $449 million available for purchase under our share buyback program. For the full year we have purchased 30.2 million shares for $1.05 billion at an average price of $34.73. As Mike said, we will continue to manage capital in close alignment with economic and operational factors.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance underwriting results.","Paul Brand","Thanks Pete. This evening, I'll cover the results for the segment, provide an update on current market conditions and premiums, and finish with some comments on our new insurance organization. First the results, the segment produced a calendar quarter combined ratio of 98.2 % and a full-year combined ratio of 96.9% which happens to be the same ratio as we produced in the quarter and full year for 2015. Higher cat experience were 126 million in the quarter driven largely by Hurricane Matthew and the recent earthquake activity in New Zealand compared to 68 million in Q4 2015, was offset by prior year reserve releases of 24 million and by material improvements in the underwriting expense ratio of 3 points and the accident year ex-cat loss ratio of 0.5 points. On accident quarter ex-cat basis the combined ratio was 92.3% compared to 95.7% in Q4 2015 and 93.3% for the full year compared to 95.4% reported in 2015.","For Q4, we reported an acquisition ratio of 12.8% compared to 13.9% in Q4 2015, and 13.5% reported for the full year. For the quarter, this is better than the guidance we provided in Q1, driven largely from a change in business mix as we tune the portfolio, more net deals in some of our larger risk management businesses as well as ceded adjustment related to a prior quarter. As a result of this prior quarter adjustments, we would expect future quarters to be closer to full year 2016. In addition, we reported an operating expense ratio of 17.6% for the quarter and 18.4 % for the year. Both of which were roughly 2 points lower than the prior-year quarter and year. Finally, our net accident year ex-cat loss ratio of 61.8% for the quarter and 61.4% for the year, reflecting 0.5% improvement over Q4 2015 or 1.1 improvement over 2015, largely reflecting the re-underwriting work we started last year.","Pricing remained consistent with what we've seen throughout the year at just under negative 3% for the quarter and full year. Our casualty lines were flat for the year as meaningful increases in E&F, North America construction and environmental lines were mostly offset by moderate rate of decreases in our excess casualty line. Our professional businesses were down 2%, driven by our US professional D&O book just partially offset by lower single digit rate increases and outside the lines. Our specialty businesses were down 3% driven by continued competitive conditions in the aviation and marine Lines. And our energy, property and construction businesses were down 6%, driven by a low-double digit reductions in the energy book during the first half of 2016. Insurance gross premiums written in Q4 increased by 6.9% or 160 million year-over-year and increased by 8.7% when normalized for foreign exchange. For the full year, gross premiums written increased by 14.9% or 1.25 billion, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition as 2015 results only reflect seven months of the combined entity.","When we look at both legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange, [indiscernible] in 2015 and it\u2019s a one-off positive during the quarter, our growth was approximately 4% for the full year. Whilst 2016 was a challenging year, we continued to focus on customer service and development of new products and solutions. We know that investing in innovation and talent and focusing our efforts on how we do business are the cornerstones of success over the long term. Being recognized as the top achiever on Advisen's Pacesetter Index, being named highest customer satisfaction on large insurers in J.D. Power Survey of North America [indiscernible] are evidence that we are on the right track.","Moving on to the organizational changes. As Mike mentioned, we adopted a new PNC operating model effective the January 1. I'm very happy to share that the model has been fully executed according to plan. [indiscernible] in its new structure and there's been no adverse impact on our clients or brokers as the majority of their contacts remain the same. And while the impetus for the new model was greater accountability, clearer roles and improved decision making, it had also drive improvements in efficiency. In summary, we have delivered another quarter of underwriting profitability despite market conditions and higher cat activity. We have achieved our strongest quarter of organic growth. Our company and our colleagues were recognized by numerous industry awards and publications and we successfully realigned our operating model to deliver greater flexibility, faster decision making closer to our client. Finally I just want to say on behalf of Kelly and myself that whilst we are both looking forward to our new roles, it has been an honor to lead the insurance segment over the past two years. With the hard work from a great group of colleagues we achieved an enormous amount. Not only did we successfully bring the two companies together, continue to grow the business and achieve several awards along the way, we did so without jeopardizing our long streak of profitability. And as we hand over the leadership to Greg, we feel strongly that the segment team is extremely well positioned to deliver continued improvement in our results.","I\u2019ll now turn to Greg to discuss reinsurance results.","Greg Hendrick","Thanks Paul. Today I\u2019ll discuss the results for the quarter, provide further detail on our catastrophe losses for the year and summarize current market conditions. Beginning with the results, the reinsurance segment produced strong underwriting performance with the calendar quarter combined ratio of 87.1% compared with 79.1% for the fourth quarter of last year. The result of the quarter experienced favorable prior-year development, lower accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio and an improved expense ratio offset by a high level of catastrophe losses. For the full year we achieved an 88.4% combined ratio, up from 81% last year with similar drivers noted for the quarter. Reserve releases in the quarter totaled 82 million compared to 93 million a year ago. As Pete noted, the fourth quarter is a full evaluation quarter and reserve releases were absorbed across all classes of business. In particular, our property catastrophe and casualty treaty portfolios had the largest releases.","The reinsurance segment produced an accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio of 49.4%, which compares to 50.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven by the absence of large loss in the quarter offset predominantly by a small impact from a change in mix of business and market conditions. Expense ratio decreased 3.5 points to 32.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 35.8% for the same quarter last year. This decrease was driven equally by lower operating expenses as the impact of our expense synergies continue to earn through and lower acquisition costs as the purchase accounting adjustment continues to diminish. Catastrophe losses totaled 120 million net of reinstatement premiums during the quarter compared to 39 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The cat activity during the quarter was driven by Hurricane Matthew and the New Zealand earthquakes in November. A number of other small events were offset by reduced estimates of the Fort McMurray fires and China floods from earlier in the year. For the year, property catastrophe losses net of reinstatement premium for this segment totaled 306 million, up from 63 million in 2015. Our loss experience is driven by 60% increase in industry insured losses and a higher portion of these losses due to the reinsurance market. Our market share of the events impacting XL Catlin was unchanged relative to 2015. Despite this level of catastrophe activity, for the year, our property catastrophe portfolio was profitable with a 65% combined ratio.","Turning to topline, gross written premiums for the quarter was $536 million, up from $206 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, with the increase driven by a large multi-line quota share with one of our core clients. Excluding this treaty, our topline would have decreased to 176 million driven by cancel business as we continue to maintain underwriting discipline. For the full year, on the combined portfolio after adjusting for foreign exchange and a large treaty in the fourth quarter, we grew our topline nearly 4%. Shifting to market conditions, we are operating in a challenging training environment in most of our classes. Our rate decreases continue to decelerate in most lines and regions and as noted last quarter, we appear to be reaching the bottom in many classes of business. For the full year, rates across the segment were down approximately 3%. Our global catastrophe portfolio was down 5% for the year significantly less than the 8% decrease we experienced in 2015 and the remainder of the property treaty book rates were down 2.5%. And our casualty business renewed flat over last year and the remainder of our classes were flat to down low-single digits.","Shifting to the recently completed January 1 renewals, rates were down 1.3% across the portfolio. Property cat rate globally were down 3.5% with international rates down more and US rate down less than the compass of 3.5%. Our casualty treaty book was up 1% and the remainder of the business was flat to down 2%. In summary, the fourth quarter and full year results are respectable for the reinsurance segment. Underwriting teams continue to an excellent job growing profitable business and finding new opportunities while maintain underwriting discipline. As Charles Cooper takes over the segment, I'm confident that he and the entire team will continue to build a market leading reinsurer.","I'll now turn it back to David.","David Radulski","Thank you. And Shirley you can open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead with your question.","Kai Pan","First, good luck to Paul for the new position and David for your retirement. My first question is on the cat, you talk about like the underlying improvements that you're making great strides in that. But [indiscernible] have introduced quite a bit of volatility. Do you consider the 6.7 points of cat load in 2016 as your normalize year and are you considering any measures or actions to reduce that volatility?","Greg Hendrick","This is Greg. Let me - I\u2019m going to step back and say given the 16 years, it's reasonable for us to review our historical cat activity and put this year into context. And we find 2016 to be an unsurprising year. Let me share with you some of the observations that provide perspective around three main areas. First a look at our cat loss history from 2006 forward. Second, put \u201916 in the context of that history. And third, some factors that influence the variability of catastrophe losses in a given year. So let me turn to the cat loss history, we combined the reported net catastrophe losses after reinstatement premiums from each legacy firm starting with the 2006 accident year. We started with 2006 as I believe the events of 2004 and 2005 radically changed the market in terms of insurance coverages and reinsurance structures. Over that 11 year period between 2006 and 2016, our net catastrophe losses ranged from zero in 2006 to 1.4 billion in 2011. Now this wide range is indicative of the variability of the skewed distribution of an annual catastrophe loss level.","The mean loss over this period was 443 million. We have not adjusted these losses for numerous factors including subsequent reserve releases, change in exposure of different reporting guidelines. So if I shift over and give you a little context for 2016, we see that 2008, 2010 and 2013 all had a roughly similar annual industry insured cat losses of this year. In those three analog years we incurred between 473 million and 639 million of cat loss. Our 2016 catastrophe loss experience of 636 million fits within the range of outcomes in years of similar industry losses. And to your question, Kai, we believe the industry loss totals from this year are above the median of the industry loss disruption. The variability of a given year of net cat loss at XL Catlin can be affected by any number of factors but four main one. First, the location of events within a given year will drive different results in our book. Events occurring at peak peril territories tend to have reinsurance [indiscernible] at higher industry events relative to non-peak geographies. Second, within our large risk insurance portfolio, specific location losses can vary greatly by event. We referred to this in the past as the pinpoint loss effect. And outcomes are driven by whether a particular location is or is not affected by the event. And third, how we record our catastrophe losses has changed over the years since the acquisition of Catlin. In our insurance segment, we record all weather driven losses, regardless of the event size as catastrophe losses. In reinsurance, we continue to report events that are larger than 5 million to XL Catlin as catastrophe losses given the difficulty of tracking small cat events. And fourth, changes in our outward reinsurance protection will change the shape of the net catastrophe loss distribution. ","Given our recent cat bond issue, let me just briefly pause here and give you an update on our outward cap protection as well. As a reminder, we predominantly buy reinsurance that protects the entire group and make use of quota share, catastrophe occurrence, catastrophe aggregate, accessory bonds to protect our portfolio. For 2017, we have used the reinsurance market to reduce our exposure to certain peak natural catastrophes. This is predominantly achieved by increased issuance of our Galilei cat bonds, which now total 1.875 billion. Based on today's exposure, the increased protection offset by potential NOI and portfolio growth will reduce our North American windstorm tail exposure by roughly 20% to 30%.","Our total reinsurance program for \u201917 would not materially change our net position if applied to the 2016 events. Taking all these observations together, Kai, I think while 2016 was higher than what we would typically expect in a year, it was an unsurprising outcome based on the industry losses and our net cap profile. ","Kai Pan","Well, that's very comprehensive. So, you\u2019re basically comfortable with your current risk profile?","Greg Hendrick","Yes.","Kai Pan","Okay. Then my second question is a technical one. There is discussion about, in the UK Motor, they\u2019re discussing the discount rate, so-called [indiscernible] rates. I just wonder your exposure there if the discount rates are reduced to for example to 1%, what\u2019s the impact on your reserve?","Pete Porrino","Sure. Kai, this is Pete. I\u2019ll take that one. So for the benefit of those of you that are not studying UK Motor trends these days, [indiscernible] tables are used by the UK courts to calculate lumpsum awards in bodily injury cases and are calculated at specified discount rate, discount rates. A reduction in the discount rate translates into an increase in the present value of the lumpsum award. So the general expectations at the current rate, which is 2.5% and has been in place since 2001, will be reduced, it was supposed to be reduced in January. It's been put off so far till February. ","It's been delayed a couple of times, but I would say there is significant uncertainty around how far that reduction is going to go. Classes of business impacted by this, by the lumpsums are UK Motor bodily injury, UK employers\u2019 liability and UK public liability with UK Motor having the largest impact. And we\u2019re not a large rider of UK Motor business. We do have some exposure from business written on a non-proportional reinsurance basis. We scaled this portfolio significantly back, beginning in 2009 and its periodic payment orders or PPOs became more prevalent and more costly. Our UK gross motor premiums are now under $10 million and our undiscounted reserves are about just over $300 million. ","So what the impact right of the reduction in the discount rate? First, I\u2019d say not all reserves will be impacted by a change in discount rate, including all the existing PPOs already in payment. And we would expect some shift away from PPOs should lumpsum settlements increase because of reduction in the discount rate. Taking these factors into consideration, we believe the level of our held reserves to the subject classes of business provides a reasonable provision for UK bodily injury claims, even anticipating a reduction in the current 2.5 discount rate down towards 0%. ","It should be noted that larger reduction to this discount rate are possible, including to negative real rates, right, so that the present value of the payment is actually greater than the sum of the future payments that you would make as counterintuitive as that would be. We view those scenarios as less likely, but they would place a drag on favorable prior year development within the reinsurance segment. Impacts on insurance segment are expected to be modest due to the low level of UK bodily injury claims in our portfolio as well as reinsurance protections.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thanks, everybody. Mike and Pete, I'm just curious, could you give us some color on the potential for kind of corporate income tax reform in US, border tax, what the potential implications are for you, how are you thinking about it? What, as outsider, should we be kind of looking at to evaluate what it could potentially mean for you?","Mike McGavick","Yeah. This is Mike, Brian. Look, it's been said elsewhere and I just completely agree, running these companies isn't just about tax. We\u2019re sure we're thoughtful about it. We should be stewards of our shareholders' equity. But that's not how we compete and it\u2019s not how we win business. And the idea that reform is going to be a huge competitive disruption, I really think that idea is nonsense. Look, we're absolutely for lowering the rates in the US. The US has been at a global tax disadvantage and anything that stimulates US economic activity is a plus. Going to be more to ensure, and of course as it relates to our US taxes, we would pay less.","Other questions that are floating around as you've mentioned like border adjustments or the NEO bill, it just seems to me to be very premature. It's not exactly clear what will be proposed, it's not exactly clear what will result from what will be no doubt a very complex legislative process. I will say this though. The idea of exporting your risks is a good idea and the idea of it making it more expensive and more difficult to do so is not a way to grow your economy, but rather a way to retard growth. It seems to me that that will become evident in the discussion ahead and we're certainly going to make sure that that is clearly understood.","One other point I'd make on this, remember, the companies with whom we're mostly competing are global, not US domestics. And I don't see that changing very much. So overall, we're comfortable with the way we approach tax, we\u2019re comfortable with our competitive position. Absolutely, no matter, what comes.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thanks. And then Pete, I just wanted a clarification here or just make sure we\u2019re looking at the right way. So if I look at your operating expenses for 2017, excluding the integration charges sitting here like $1.794, is that the right number to look at versus where you're kind of guiding to the 1.77 billion?","Pete Porrino","So I think if I go back ex, did you say, ex-integration?","Brian Meredith","Ex-integration, yeah, ex-integration exactly.","Pete Porrino","Right. So ex-integration, I think we're a little bit less than that the way I did the math. I think I had 1.842 [ph] if I remember correctly. And that is the number that you would then use to compare it to what was in the 8-K that we put out, as I said, the 1.77 to 1.84.","Brian Meredith","Got you. So effectively think of operating expenses as the integration is roughly flat \u201917 over \u201916?","Pete Porrino","No. I think that would probably be down. As I said, unless FX changes, I think we\u2019ll be down closer to the lower end of that range. So again, to summarize this year, we\u2019re at about 1.84 and next year, the range is 1.77 to 1.84 and as I said in my remarks, FX stays the same, we'd expect to be at the lower end of that range. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. One quick question with regard to that. Pete, have you done anything for the lock-in current foreign exchange rates?","Pete Porrino","So we did put a hedge on for UK rates. What I would say is the accounting for that will not show up in expenses. We did that on an economic basis. Right. So, but the answer is yes, we did put a lock in.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. If you take a step back now, and you said, look at the ultimate rationale for the cap and I understand it was increased relevance, can you talk how that\u2019s played out so far through in 2016?","Mike McGavick","Yeah. I would note a number of things. First of all, think about the way the year ended and the production we had, the growth that we had in the fourth quarter. We saw that growth strengthening throughout the year. We felt we could see the difference in the quality of risk we're being presented and the quantum of risk we're being presented. And I think I used those statistics on our last call that we saw submissions going up. We saw quotes going up, which says we were finding the business attractive, but we were actually seeing our binding go down a bit, because we weren\u2019t finding the quality of business. That's our underwriters doing a great job and our market presence giving us more to work with and that is now yielding growth. ","And when we have this very efficient base that we have built, which was enabled by the transaction, neither company separately could have gotten to this level of efficiency. We have real operating leverage on that growth. So this positions us to continue to improve our company's results and I think it's really, and I would just also point to all the awards, I mean that is the market telling us, they prefer us, that they find us extremely effective. And then there's one final point I would make and I think this is a really important one because I hear a lot about volatility, Kai opened it with the question around cat. So I thought Greg answered to it. But I would note there's been two other sources of volatility that have caused this, particularly back in the XL past, some real noise. Let me talk about large losses for a second. With regard to large losses, this is where the combination with Catlin has really helped. We have a larger and more diversified portfolio of risks. ","We've been able to design more efficient reinsurance structures. These portfolio changes have resulted in greater capacity to absorb large losses and you all know from some of the other calls that have been held over the course of 2016, there was a lot of large loss activity and we saw too and much of that is syndicated risk, but we were able to absorb, so we weren't immune from what was going on in the sector, but we were able to absorb those large loss impacts and still produce an accident year ex-cat result that demonstrated improvement over the prior year. ","So while we recognize the volatility of business and all underwritten there could be more severe outcomes in 2016, but with the year that was this heavy and large losses to produce an improved accident year ex-cat loss ratio really shows the power of the diversification and our ability to lessen volatility for our shareholders. So we're very pleased with the way the portfolio is performing. Obviously, other sources of volatility would be in the utility side, which is really not affected one way or the other by the transaction. But if you talk about those three areas, affiliates, which is just ordinary market events; if you talk about what we've done on large losses, and we talked about the profitability and the comfort we have with our cap book, it\u2019s a very attractive firm.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question.","Ian Gutterman","Hi. Thank you. I guess first, I was hoping you expand a little bit more on the cap bond purchase and what it means for your capital in addition to volatility, I mean, 20% to 30% reduction in PML seems pretty significant. What does that do to capital flexibility going forward?","Pete Porrino","So, Ian, this is Pete. On the capital side, it does reduce the required capital that we would hold. We've taken that into account when we've talked about what we are committing in the buyback. That would just echo what Mike said. But the cat bond purchase was part of that calculus.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. And then also related, just to follow up on Mike's point about being able to absorb large losses and so forth, does reducing the PML make you think any differently about buying protection lower down?","Mike McGavick","[indiscernible] and its diversification benefit by itself. So, as you know, the lower down you buy, the less efficient the purchase and the more you\u2019re giving up in earnings. So as we look at, we're very confident with the way that portfolio is performing. We're always testing out different ideas and where we find one that's economic, we do it. But in general, we're pleased with the way the portfolio is able to allow us to put out these kinds of limits and absorb the expected losses that come with them.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. And does the cost of buying that cap bond, do we need to think about any impact that might have on the accident year going forward or does that sort of get absorbed with the other rebalancing you did?","Greg Hendrick","Ian, its Greg. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts to -- that's one transaction that would drive the ceded premium. It\u2019s a multi-year transaction. The earned ceded will go up a little bit, but there's other things we're doing that will drop it. So in isolation of itself, yes, it would move it a tiny bit, but all the moving parts, there shouldn't be a material change.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. Okay. And then Greg, just to follow up on and the reinsurance growth in the quarter, can you tell us a little bit more about that quota share treaty you did?","Greg Hendrick","Absolutely not. But, as you know, we don't talk about individual client claims or the specific treaties, but let me give you a little bit generally about this treaty. It's only going to have a little bit of lower margin than the rest of our corresponding portfolio, but also lower downside risk relative to our overall portfolio. So there is a little bit of a good trade there. The result of this treaty, like every single treaty, as you know, is variable. We would anticipate that we have a minimal increase in our overall loss ratio, minimal being less than a point and our acquisition ratio would increase, but would be offset just equally by a decrease in our operating expense ratio. So there isn\u2019t a big change in the economics of our portfolio and that\u2019s why we felt it was a good opportunity to solidify and to Mike\u2019s earlier conversation, I can wholeheartedly tell you we would not have seen this transaction at XL or Catlin, we only saw because we are XL Catlin.","Ian Gutterman","Great, Greg. And just to clarify, is this something that's like a one-off type thing or just something we would expect to renew a year from now or you said it was multi-year. So I guess, there wouldn\u2019t be a renewal next year, but down the road, is it just a one-off thing that we won't see again?","Greg Hendrick","And you\u2019re listening well to what I'm saying. Multi-year was in the cap bond, the cap was multi-year. This is an annual transaction. Customer ordering insurer can decide not to go forward. Certainly, we try to enter into those pure one year trades. We have a belief that we will trade forward, but I can't guarantee that we\u2019ll trade through it.","Ian Gutterman","Of course. But okay, I just wanted to get a sense of expectation. Okay. And then just lastly, Pete, can you give us a little more detail that 14 million of rebalancing in the affiliates, what exactly was going on there?","Pete Porrino","Sure, Ian. There were two things, two parts of the 14 million. One was, in our hedge fund portfolio, we have a philosophy of having concentrated positions for most, but not all of that portfolio and we did have a position that we concentrated more in, in the current quarter and that concentration in the US GAAP rules require that we move it into affiliates from non-affiliates and so that was the one direction. The other one was just a reduction in the value in our operating affiliate portfolio.","Ian Gutterman","Does that change or influence what we would think the run rate of affiliates would be going forward?","Pete Porrino","I don't think it would be enough to move it. I mean when you do move one of those, you take the unrealized and it becomes realized. To give you an order of magnitude, it was slightly under 30 million. But again, that would never be the run rate. That would be the cumulative catch up. And then, there was a equal going the other way on the operating affiliates.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. And is there any updated thoughts, I like to ask this question about the future of the investment affiliates business and whether it might make sense to monetize any more of those going forward?","Pete Porrino","Yes. So we look at all of our affiliates, both the hedge funds and the manager affiliates. I think your question is more on the manager affiliates or was it on or all of the affiliates?","Ian Gutterman","On the investment managers, correct.","Pete Porrino","Right. We look at them all the time, that\u2019s all I could say, Ian. There is somewhere between 6 and 12 in that bucket right now. It is more competitive field than it used to be I would say. And so we're challenged to make new investments in there and we talk about monetization and you will probably see some from time to time, but only one is economically advantageous for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question.","Paul Newsome","Good evening everyone. I've started to look at your company on a all-in combined ratio basis, but what I mean is, I\u2019m just forgetting yourself on that, I'm just looking at losses and expenses relative to premium, everything, operating integration as such. And so, I get the loss ratio commentary. But I'd like to ask a question about what I look at as your all in expense ratio, which for the year this year was about 37%. If my math is right, a couple of points of that is integration expenses which maybe go away in the next two or three years, but I'd like to know where that expense ratio goes all in, in your view, in the long term, not 2017, not even necessarily 2018, but to be truly competitive, were do you want to bring those all in expenses?","Pete Porrino","So, Paul, its Pete. Let me first. I think actually looking at it quarterly is useful or not and when I look at those numbers, I do a couple of adjustments that you may or may not have done. One, I take out the purchase accounting adjustments that are flowing through there and the other thing I do is, as you mentioned, I take out the integration, right. We started this year so the end of last year, the fourth quarter of last year, that number I have is 37.5%. Okay. This quarter, it\u2019s 34.5%. Right. So that's where it's going. We talked about the reduction in the expenses year-to-year right. ","If you use the lower, the lower in that range, that would be a reduction of something in the $70 million range if I\u2019m not mistaken, which is about another 70 basis points. As Mike talked about and Paul and Greg as well, we think that we have room to grow in this franchise, even in today's market conditions. I would tie our expense base. It's not fixed, but it's not hugely variable either. Okay other than the commission and brokerage line on our operating expenses. And so I think we can continue to move that number down over time. I'm not at this point ready to go and give you a number for where we think it will be in a few years, but I certainly think it's going to be less than 34.5.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Josh Shanker","Yeah. Thank you very much. I just want to talk about the 2016 cat experience and how that informs your risk management for 2017. Is the cat protection that you're purchasing a response, is it part of a longer term strategy for a different pattern of volatility of loss merchants?","Greg Hendrick","So Josh, its Greg. No, it's not a response to the 2016 as I noted in the answer for Kai earlier. The purchase that we made, particularly on the cap don't change what the \u201916 year would have been with that in place. There are some other minor changes we\u2019re making that would tweak it a little bit, but not materially. We're constantly growing this portfolio. We\u2019re constantly going to what the risk reward. We saw in that, particular in the cap on market as issuance started to decrease, we saw prices decreasing there. We saw an opportunity to be able to take off a bit of a tail of our distribution in the peak territories at a pretty economic price. ","So we took advantage of that. It definitely was not. There's nothing in \u201916 that informed us about that purchase. It was more about just how we best manage our tail exposure. We're always thinking about things we can do around the whole shape of the curve. Mark van Zanden, who runs our underwriting capital management spends all the time on this topic with his team. At the moment, we don't see anything that we saw that disturbed us that felt we were out of size market share that there was something wrong with that distribution. And so we haven't changed anything in the kind of the median down portion of our distribution. ","Josh Shanker","So if you're being opportunistic, given where the pricing is for protection here, does it make sense to be a less volatile underwriter, I realize XL is in the business of taking on risk. In this part of the cycle, should XL offload as much volatility as possible, given the potential that's cheap to do so or is there some cycle management thoughts here on how you buy reinsurance?","Mike McGavick","So I think it's much around that the opportunity economically exists in that tail of the curve. We don't believe it exists nearly as much down in the mean or the median of the curve. There's a lot less opportunity there to be able to trade opportunistically in that part of the curve. So we think we've got it balanced right, given the current state of the market, given what we can charge on both the inwards insurance and inwards reinsurance pricing and balance it with what we can do on our side. So I don't think it's a universal economic benefit that can be achieved up and down that curve right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question.","Randy Binner","Thanks. Yeah. So back to expenses and the integration expense fall-off going back to the 8-K, that was going to be 60 million to 70 million in the first two quarters of 2017. So I think I asked this question last time, those are still scheduled to fall off in the first half of \u201917. There's nothing that's changed there.","Pete Porrino","That's correct, Randy. It's Pete. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s changed.","Randy Binner","And then jumping to the big reinsurance topline, I guess the only other question I\u2019d have there, did I hear that you said that was with an existing partner, meaning is it -- was that all new or was that kind of an expansion of an existing relationship, just kind of following up on Ian's question.","Greg Hendrick","Sure, Randy. It\u2019s Greg. Yeah that\u2019s expansion of existing relationship with a very meaningful client we already have.","Randy Binner","Okay. And then just jumping to the bottom line of reinsurance, which was really good. So your loss ratio ex-cat and reserves is low, it's lower than I would have thought and I guess I don't, how should we think about that pick in sustainability. Your commentary on rates reaching a bottom broadly seems not out of step, but different than some stuff I read in the trade publications and so I just, I imagine more pressure on a big reinsurance business than what these numbers are showing. So how, what keeps me from running that fourth quarter loss ratio ex-cat and reserves just through the model going forward.","Greg Hendrick","So there's a lot in that one, Randy. Let me see if I can break it down for you. One that tweaks me, the numbers I gave you around what's going on in the book is about our portfolio. So that\u2019s our rate decrease, not what's happening in the broader marketplace. So it's entirely conceivable that a big broker could issue a report that surveys across the whole piece of the market and we don't have certain exposure to certain things that drive rate decreases and so ours are lower. So it's not unusual to see that a little bit of that disconnect. And it's always, to me, there's always a lot of judgment and call around. We just feel that we're near the bottom because we saw not only the rate decreases I cited, but also as we got to the end of the year, there were things coming back to the marketplace to be repriced or to be, not be placed at all. And so it's not a market where you can drop any price in to the market place. ","So that's one piece of that. I would always say for reinsurance, there should always be used in kind of the annual distribution right, there is this we\u2019ve talked about before in our ex and your ex-cat loss for reinsurance, we have those as I talked about in my catastrophe answer, those cats under 5 million end up in that hat bucket and we tend to view like everything else we do here. We tend to be pretty quick takers of bad news and slow realizers of good news. And so in that bucket, there's always the seasonality of the exposure, which tends to happen in the back half of the year and there's a lag in reporting that comes from our clients. So always look at the annual rather than just the fourth quarter, quarter over quarter over quarter accessing our cat for insurance is not a great metric, try and use that annual number. ","Randy Binner","That's perfect. Actually just one more back to expenses, when you say bottom of the range on the 177 to 184, is that the more conservative end of the range or the happy end of the range?","Pete Porrino"," That's the happy end, that\u2019s closer to the 177.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] ","David Radulski","Thank you, Shirley and that completes our Q&A for the evening. And now some comments from Mike.","Mike McGavick","Just a couple of things. First, obviously, we've been pleased with the trends and we're encouraged about next year. Very, very excited and we're just incredibly proud of the recognition that our colleagues have earned. It\u2019s very impressive. I did want to close with two additional observations. Of course, Abbe Goldstein has now joined us to be our future head of IR. I want to thank many of you who took calls and took the opportunity provided to Abbe and through Abbe to Pete, I and others in your candor and your guidance is always appreciated and we try to take it to heart, given that this was not a year in which our shareholders experienced what we believe they deserve to cause them to experience next year. So we are working -- in 2017, so we are working incredibly hard to do that. ","And finally, I want to acknowledge David Radulski. This will be his last conference call as our Head of IR giving way to Abbe. Dave\u2019s been with us for 16 years, provided tremendous and loyal service and we appreciate it very much and we wish you well David on whatever comes next.

Please go ahead.","David Radulski","Thank you, Shirley. And welcome to XL Group's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. And we posted to our website several documents, including our press release and quarterly financial supplement.","On the call this evening, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will review our financial results, followed by Greg Hendrick our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Michael S. McGavick","Good evening and thank you for joining the call. XL had a good second quarter and we are pleased to see our broad-based progress continues to the first half of 2014. This is particularly true given the headwinds in the market, some of which will get into little bit later. But overall we believe we are demonstrating that the levers we have our at our disposal can help to offset these market conditions and we can continue to produce solid results, harvesting both our prior and ongoing work.","In the second quarter, our results included \u2013 total P&C combined ratio of 88.3%, total underwriting profit of $168 million and a loss ratio of 57.6% all of which were better than the prior year quarter. At the same time, as you we feel our progress is better viewed over longer trends and from a year-to-date point of view nearly all of our core metrics are head of the first half of 2013 as well.","Given the market we like where we are. One contrary metric is our operating expense ratio and we will spend some more time tonight going over our expenses in general. As we want to make sure that we are clearly on our expectations of what we\u2019ll develop for the full year. We also experience the one-off benefit in the quarter of some size and we want to make sure that is clear as well. Pete will get into both of these topics during his comments.","Focusing on the insurance segment, we\u2019re pleased with the way the year is developing, specifically insurance underwriting profit in the quarter was $63 million well ahead of the $5 million reported in Q2 of 2013. Overall, we feel we are demonstrating our ability to absorb large losses, including in unusual number of large losses that have already taken place in the first half of this year, while continuing to expand margins.","We\u2019re not out of our goal yet of course, but we like the trends particularly the calendar quarter loss ratio, which was the best result in 5.5 years. We can see that an increasing majority of our insurance businesses, our demonstrating expected performance inline with the market in their particular books. That\u2019s a much different place than were just a year or two ago.","Looking at reinsurance here as well, nearly all of our core metrics are ahead of the prior year quarter as are the year-to-date figures against the first half of last year. Jamie will spend some more time discussing marketing conditions in his remarks, but I\u2019ll just say that we are really proud of the performance for reinsurance colleagues. We are all seeing nearly daily reports regarding the turmoil in the reinsurance market and a continuing lowering of expectations of rate, while expectations are raised for terms and condition on the part of the plans.","You will note that our gross premium written is right about where we\u2019re at the same time first half of last year. This means that with the tough discussions on rate and renewals firms with the distinctive offerings and historic relationships will continue to be better positioned. At the same time, we do expect to feel the impact of the market it is in escapable and we will continue to manage our book to what we feel is the right level of rate for our business and let the chips fall where they may. But we are awfully proud of the way our book has performed to date in this difficult marketplace.","Before turning to Pete, I just want to make one more comment regarding the life reinsurance business. As planned and without surprises the transaction closed in the second quarter. As you recall because the transaction is a sale and retrocession on a funds withheld basis. There are some complex accounting implications we want to make sure you fully aware off.","While we discuss this to some extent last quarter the details are now in the numbers. We are happy to discuss this during Q&A or as a follow up to this call. But in sum we continued to be very pleased both with the transaction and with our counter-parties and are particularly appreciative of our ability to spend our time on the core businesses in this challenging period. Again, through two quarters it has been a very solid start to the year.","With that, I will turn it over to Pete.","Peter R. Porrino","Thanks Mike and good evening. On net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $279 million or loss of a $1.03 per share, including the impact of the life reinsurance transaction. Operating net income for the second quarter was $280 million were $1.02 per share on a fully diluted compared to $222 million in 2013 or $0.75 per share.","Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 88.3% or 5.5 points better than the same quarter last year, while our accident year combined ratio was 94.2% better by 7.6 points. This improvement is largely driven by lower levels of catastrophe losses this quarter at $35 million were 2.4 loss ratio points compared to $134 million or 9.3 loss ratio points in the second quarter of 2013.","As we\u2019ve outlined on previous earnings calls the second is a significant reserve valuation quarter for us. And as a result we\u2019ve reacted appropriately to any development indications identified during our in-depth review. Prior year reserve development in the quarter was a net favorable $84 million or 5.8 loss ratio points compared to a $119 million or 8 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2013.","This reflects favorable development of $37 million in the insurance segment and $47 million in the reinsurance segment. Our operating expenses were higher than the prior year quarter due to the normal underlying expense growth as well as the impact of improved underwriting results on our variable compensation metrics and foreign exchange.","As we\u2019ve indicated in the past we continue to expect that overall operating expense levels for 2014 will be modestly higher than 2013 approximately a mid single-digit increase excluding foreign exchange in variable compensation. As a reminder, the increased use of reinsurance will impact the reported operating expense ratio. As noted by Mike we completed the sale & retrocession of our European life reinsurance operations on May 30, to GreyCastle Holdings for $570 million in cash which resulted in an after tax U.S. GAAP net loss of approximately $620 million.","The change in the reported loss from the estimate provided as of March 31, relates to the mark-to-market and FX impacts on the underlying asset portfolio and exposures between the time of signing and closing, which we indicated would be the case at the time we announced the transaction. The prospected accounting and disclosure requirements will add some complexity to our financial statements. Now we hope the example we provided last quarter as well as our summary consolidated financial data included in our press release will help in understanding those impacts.","The way we think about this is that following the May 30, closing of the transaction and reflect no net underwriting results related to the retroceded business. The investment income and change in market value of the asset portfolio backing the seated liabilities is offset by an embedded derivative expense passing those economics onto GreyCastle with the resulting net impact on operating income and comprehensive income being zero.","In the summarize income statement data included in the earnings release we have combined the various components further to show the net income contribution from the life retrocession agreements of $6.5 million for the month of June and it related will offsetting change in accumulated other comprehensive income of $6.5 million to try and make this point clear. It will across before the details to rather Form 10-Q explaining how the results of this business no longer impact the underlying performance of the company.","Turning to the investment portfolio, the life retrocession transaction restricted on the funds withheld basis with the risks and rewards of the $5.7 billion of related funds withheld assets having been transfer to GreyCastle. Investment performance and net investment income generated by the life funds withheld assets since May 30, peaks with the derivative instrument created as part of the life retrocession agreement.","Given that GreyCastle is now direct trading on those assets presumably to investment guidelines we\u2019ve agreed with them and all of the related economics exploded them. And we\u2019ll be excluding these assets from our investment commentary in this and future quarters. To clarify the XL managed assets now include P&C operations. The assets related to the outstanding structured product transactions and the remaining life assets.","However, with that point made these funds withheld assets due continue to sit on our books, so we added new schedule throughout the financial supplement will be disclose a high level summary of the life funds withheld assets by sector, credit rating, currency and duration. Because we\u2019re 11 of the financial supplement details net investment income generated during the quarter and separates the life funds withheld assets for informational purposes. The asset details on schedules 2 through 10 now exclude the life funds withheld assets.","Further to be above and focusing solely on the assets and which we do return the economics, I\u2019m sorry we do retain the economics. The investment portfolio return 1.9% for the quarter driven primarily by decreasing government rates in our major jurisdictions coupled with spread narrowing.","Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $1.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. The duration of our fixed income portfolio excluding the funds withheld assets, but including the remaining life assets was 3.6 years. To give you a basis for comparison the P&C component of the XL fixed income portfolio is essentially unchanged at 3.4 years. We still remain short duration relative to our benchmark.","At $214 million net investment income on a portfolio excluding life funds withheld assets was $19 million below the same quarter last year. This variance was due to the life transaction with the investment income life funds withheld assets for the month of June it\u2019s now being separately reported. The gross book yield for the portfolio excluding the life funds withheld assets at the end of June was 2.7%.","We still other GAAP between the yields on maturing assets and where we are reinvesting, which will keep downward pressure on net investment income. We estimate that approximately $3.1 billion of XL assets, excluding any funds withheld assets with an average gross book yield of 2.9% well mature in pay down over the next 12 months compared to the average new money rate in Q2 on the portfolio of 1.7%.","Our investment in operating affiliates continued to produce strong results. Net income from investment affiliates was $18 million driven by structured credit strategies and emerging market funds down $29 million from an exceptional prior year quarter.","The overall second quarter return on our alternative portfolio including the non-equity portion of 1.5%. We also had good earnings from our investment manager affiliates of $13 million. Net realized gains were $92 million in the quarter driven primarily by sales of equities this compared to net realized gains of $36 million in the second quarter of 2013.","Our tax rate on net income is distorted somewhat due to the Life transaction on which we recorded a tax benefit of 6.7% of the pre-tax loss on sale. Taxes on operating income, an income for the quarter were approximately 12%. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks an additional contributor to income in the quarter was a one of commutation of one of our remaining structured product transactions that resulted in a $28 million reduction in interest expense.","And with respect to capital management we continue to execute on our share buyback program and during the second quarter we purchased $5.5 million shares for $175 million at an average price of $31.96 per share leaving approximately $718 million remaining available for purchase, under our previously announced share buyback program.","As we noted in our first quarter call our intention as a result of the elimination of the risks associated with the transferred life business, is that our share buybacks for the year will be increased by as much as $300 million. We continue to view these buybacks as good use of capital for our shareholders and an efficient overall capital management tool.","I will now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Pete, and good evening. Tonight, I'll cover the results for the segment provide some comments on our semi-annual reserve review. Give a brief update on talent and finished remarks on current market conditions.","Beginning with the results, the Insurance segment produced a second quarter calendar year combined ratio of 93.8% or 5.8% bearing the same quarter last year driven largely by lower cat activity. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of profitability. On an accident quarter basis excluding cat, our combined ratio of 96% improved by one full point. This year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by the accident quarter ex-cat loss ratio to 64.7% which was 0.8 points better than prior year.","As we have previously discussed, our underlying portfolio continues to improve through our focus on expanding underwriting margins and reducing volatility, we believe this is evident in the fact that we have been better able to absorb large loss activity this quarter without adversely impacting results. Quite simply our underwriting actions and improved reinsurance volume are yielding results. The underwriting expense ratio was 31.3% in the second quarter, reflecting a 0.2 point improvement in the second quarter of last year. As mentioned last quarter, the shift towards quarter share treaties in certain business will distort the comparison of our acquisition ratio which improved by 3.1 points over the second quarter of last year in our operating expense ratio was deteriorated by 2.9 points.","For 2014, this necessary look at the total underwriting expense ratio when comparing results to prior year. Let me give some contexts to increased sessions. For the quarter our exceeded premiums written increased from $423 million to $622 million. This was driven predominately by an increased use of quarter share reinsurance. Given as increased utilization as our reinsurance the first half of 2014 saw a ratio of exceeded premium to gross premium increase from 25% to 33%, with our July 1 renewals complete we expect roughly distortion rate for the remainder of 2014.","Insurance gross premiums written grew by $125 million rate or 8.5 % in the quarter when adjusted for foreign exchange movement. All of our business groups had solid growth in the quarter. North American Property and Casualty premiums grew by over 7% with construction and excess casualty contributing the largest growth.","On new leadership of Louise Dennerstahl our International Financial Lines of business contributed the growth of more than 8% in our global professional group. Our international property and casualty business grew by nearly 10% after adjusting for foreign exchange partially due to a new, large single limit multi-year account in our primary casualty book. And our specialty group was up over 9% reflecting strong growth in both of our political risk and crisis management businesses.","While markets are increasingly competitive for many of our business, we continue to see, increased commission flow will remain a market of choice when clients are looking for help in solving their risk management needs. Shifting to loss reserves as Pete noted we completed our semi-annual reserve review in the quarter. Overall this resolved in a prior year reserve release of $37 million compared to $48 million in the second quarter last year.","Releases in our aero space and marine books along with the favorable settlement in our discontinued pharmaceutical book were partially offset by straightening in our environmental and Lloyd\u2019s middle market portfolios. Our professional reserves, which experiences some strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2014, were unchanged as continued favorable class action loss activity was offset by unfavorable development of regulatory and M&A related claims.","Moving on to talent we continue to enhance our teams throughout the segment. We recruited Kelly Lyles who will be joining as Chief Executive Global Professional replacing Bernard Horovitz will move into a new business development role. We added John Goodloe as President of our Excess and Surplus Lines of Business. And we promoted Michele Sansone as President of North American Property. We also established a separate North American property.","We will also establish a separate North American Cyber & Technology Risk Business that would be led by John Coletti and realigned our Select Professional business under Alex Blanco, who also leads our design professional business. For the quarter we increased underwriting force by another 12 position as we continue to build out new and existing businesses. ","On market conditions, we saw slowing in rate across more lines of business as the overall rate increases for the segment was 1% in the second quarter and 1.5% on a year-to-date basis. I\u2019ve see this now slipped below loss trend several lines as markets particularly the shorter tail lines continue to deteriorate. That said, half of our premium volume did achieve pricing in excess of loss trend in the second quarter. For the year 16 of our 23 businesses are still showing positive rate increase. ","North American business is delivered 2% increase in the second quarter driven by a 4% reduction in property, but nearly all other businesses have positive rate into 3% to 7% range that by excess casualty and environmental. Our international property and casualty in global professional businesses achieved rate in 1% to 2% range. Adversely impacted by property and high excess D&O business, respectively.","Our Specialty business were most severally impacted with an overall rate increase of nearly two points, reflecting the competitive aviation market which we expect to move upward given recent loss activity.","In closing, we had a strong calendar year quarter in the first half of 2014, was almost profitable since 2007. And we benefit from another relatively quite catastrophe quarter our accident year results excluding cat reinforce the need for further improvement as we continue to grow our higher margin business and take necessary underwriting actions to achieve our desired level profitability.","And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance.","Jamie H. Veghte","Thanks, Gregg and good evening, the reinsurance segment had an excellent quarter of underwriting results for the combined ratio of 75.7% producing underwriting profit of $105 million. These results were impacted by prior reserve release of $47 million and catastrophe losses from the quarter of $20 million net of reinstatement premiums, principally from the European hailstorms Ela in June, excluding the impact of cat losses and prior year releases our combined ratio was 82% exactly the same as our 2013 Q2 result on this basis, as respects the reserve releases XL Re-America went through their normal semi annual reserve review in the second quarter and contributed $21 million of the releases. We leased $17 million of casualty reserves this quarter from the U.S. and international business groups, but continue to be very cautious on recent underwriting years.","Finally, we had $18 million of deterioration on 2013 cat losses, the hailstorms in Germany and windstorm Christian, which dampened the overall release. On a year-to-date basis the segment has produced a combined ratio of 76% compared to the 77.3% in 2013. Excluding the impact of cat losses in prior year releases the six month combined of 82.8% compared to the 80.9% in 2013.","For the year we\u2019ve had the benefit of $78 million of reserve releases down slightly from the $91 million achieved in 2013. With respect to top line gross written premiums of the quarter were $493 million a 4.5% increase from the second quarter of 2013. The increases came from our North America and international business groups and resulted from timing differences additional crop premium in the U.S. increased Aviation premiums based on one new treaty and increased premium estimates on treaties written in prior years in Latin America. On a year-to-date basis gross written premiums of $1.35 billion, down 2% from 2013 levels and reflective of competitive headwinds across the market.","Turning to market conditions you have no doubt heard considerable commentary on the mid-year cat renewals in the U.S. and a very competitive environment across the reinsurance market. There is no question there is enormous appetite out there for virtually all classes of business. The mid-year renewals were indeed competitive with risk adjusted pricing down 15% to 20% on U.S. cat renewals.","In addition, terms and conditions continue to come under pressure including increased multiyear placements, expansion of terrorism coverage and broadened hourly causes, we were pleased to see the market resists some of the more aggressive coverage and placing placement strategies with several programs being repriced and remarketed to enable full placement.","While not necessarily clear proof that the market has hit bottom there are number of markets showing encouraging results in this environment. On the international side we also saw a downward pricing pressure at mid-year renewals. Our Australian and U.K. business showed price reductions up 10% to 20%.","Overall the cat market well under pressure remains on an actual and modeled basis a very profitable component of our global portfolio. We did increase our spend on retrocessional protections at mid-year. A significant capacity and attractive product options were available. While we remain in a market that does not depend on retrocessions for its gross capacity needs we have increased our average capacity on European win and bought down our retention for U.S. win in quake to attach at lower industry loss levels. These hedges included both straight and indemnity and indexed products.","In addition, we remain concerned at the level of competition on proportional placements in both short and long-term markets. We continue to see intense pressure on terms and conditions particularly with ceding commissions were buyers are routinely seeking multiple points of improvement in their placements. Of these instances we have reduced or withdrawn our capacity particularly on long-tail business for our top line has reduced by 10% on a year-to-date basis.","So overall, we had excellent quarter on a calendar year and accident year basis. Our reserve position remains strong we are stead fast in our disciplined approach to very challenging market conditions and are confident our team of deeply experienced underwriters will continue to deliver solid results to our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the things back to David for Q&A.","David Radulski","And surely, can you please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. You may ask your question.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","Hi, good evening. The first question is on the primary insurance. And looking at the accident year loss ratio and combined ratio ex-cat for the first six months of this year versus first six months of last year, and those numbers seem to be relatively flat. I would've thought that there would have been some improvement, given the re-underwriting of the business mix. So, if you could help us understand the future trajectory and why it hasn't happened a little sooner, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure, Vinay, its Greg. I think the biggest explanation for us to drill hole a bit down some of the large losses that I referred to in my opening remarks. On the property line of business we look at large losses has been losses larger than $10 million and so I am thrilled that you\u2019re using a longer data points in just the quarter. And so the first half of the year in this year, we\u2019ve observed $62 million of those losses in the six months.","In the first half of last year that number was just actually was zero. And so there is about three points of large loss in the first half of this year relative to the zero, it\u2019s masking the underlying improvement. In fact, if I look when I just give you a little more color. If you look back in the second half of last year, we observed 4.7% of large losses in that half six month period.","So, we go 1.6% better on large losses just first six months to the last six months. In our loss ratio is improved 3.3% from 67.4% to 64.1%. To trying to give you even a little more context went back to the first half of 2011, which was the last six months it looks exactly closing dollars to this six months. We had 4.2% of large losses and our accident year ex-cat loss ratio net six month period was 74%.","So, we\u2019re full 10 points better with only half of point of that coming from improved, half of that by a large loss activity. So, we think there is a lot of good things to go underneath with built a book its better able to observe this loss activity. So, we don\u2019t see has been anything other than reinforcing point they were on the right path.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","So was this quarter's loss higher than average? Or was it plus the average?","Gregory S. Hendrick","","Yes, on the property counted this quarter\u2019s loss was higher. In the last 18 quarters we\u2019ve had three that have been $50 million of greater in this $10 million and above then we\u2019ve had nine would have been zero. So, it\u2019s a quite a wide \u2013 we have quite a wide distribution there and this was much higher than our normal expectation.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","Sure. And for this quarter, how many points in the combined ratio do you think it was? Higher than average? ","Gregory S. Hendrick","Excuse me a second Vinay.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","Sure. While you look for that number, can we just go on to the reinsurance side? So I was pleasantly surprised that the combined ratio was flat year-over-year, product accident year, ex-cat basis. So if you could explain that to us, given what we are hearing about pricing on the reinsurance?","Michael S. McGavick","Well, we don\u2019t have a consistent portfolio of business today. As you know we\u2019ve been pretty adjusted at remixing the business and selecting risk. So, we\u2019re confident we are going to able to perform well year-over-year.","Gregory S. Hendrick","","Yes, Vinay it\u2019s Greg again, roughly speaking about three points to four points above average.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","","I'll give you some comfort that you're not alone. Everyone's having these large losses. And so I always certainly respect that. But the question I have sort of relates to it. It may just be serendipity, but if I go back five or 10 years ago, we were never talking about one-off quarters with large losses. Has the XL book or the industry's underwriting or the amount \u2013 or wave of people buying reinsurance, do you think anything's changed in the last decade that's giving us this problem? I mean, it's not just you guys. Everybody has it. And we've been listening about it for about three years now, with some quarters that are blessed that we don't have them, but many of them do. Do you have any thoughts on this?","Michael S. McGavick","","Josh this is Mike, I\u2019ll start off and ask Greg or Jamie to add in, I would start with \u2013 and so certainly in my time in XL this has been a regular conversation. So I can\u2019t give you the 10 year perspective, I can tell you when they have happened as Greg mentioned those three in the last ten, five years as recorded that really had really excessive large losses we have commented on them.","What was so pleasing to me about this quarter is that we were able to produce an overall loss ratio for the first half of the year that, we think is really a solid result and that we could do that well experiencing one of those quarters as a testament to the improved overall behavior of the XL book of that said I do note that many companies out there and we noticed this from a reinsurance perspective or holding more of their, increasing their attentions and holding more of their risk in that.","And so I think that introduces additional volatility into their book and I notice several of my peers commented in their calls, as that they still think that the economic trade of the greater volatility is better than the cost of reinsurance, that maybe their view, but certainly we find that is always we managed our attritional book well then we are, we should be better able to absorb of these we\u2019re still producing good result which was exactly the effect we had this growth.","So I am feeling pretty good about what this quarter demonstrates about the performance of our book so I do note that industry wide we have seen a lot of commentary around large losses in this particular quarter. Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick","","Joshua, I would say if XL specific 10 years ago we were not as big property player as we\u2019re today. So that\u2019s part of the reason you wouldn\u2019t have heard it from within the XL story. And to Mike\u2019s point we\u2019re actually heading the opposite direction, we\u2019re working hard to buy the right reinsurance to make sure reduce our volatility, we lowered our risk retention at this prior past renewal May 1, and we also bought a risk aggregate cover that will stop the pain of losses in kind of mid-range loss than if we encourage many of them over 12 month period. So, we\u2019re actually taking the opposite approach of taking more of that risk we\u2019re going to try and for at least the foreseeable future by down a little lower.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Okay. And on \u2013 you gave some color on the operating expense numbers. Can we get some numbers to that so we can sort of forecast forward on the moving parts? And in terms of how much, I guess, dollar volume or percentage volume these reinsurance buys were affecting a buy, and except they're one-off in nature? ","Peter R. Porrino","Sure, George this is Pete. The FX impact was approximately $6 million an impact on variable compensation was approximately $12 million when you renewal those two and then do the math on the year-to-year or the quarter-to-quarter change it comes about 5%.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much appreciate it.","","Michael S. McGavick","Hey Josh, before moving on it just thought one of the thing back when the interest rates permitted a number of us including excel worked hard to shift our books to more short tail participation because we were very edgy about casualty rates, that could be another reason that you are seeing more spikiness and because more folks are trying to do write short-tail alliance. The same time in more recent as you know on the last year so we have actually seen some positive rate in the casualty lines making them better performer. So this is a shift back going on, but I just want I\u2019m sure that one of the thing I remembered a lot of the conference calls focused on that back three years or four years ago.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","I appreciate all the wisdom. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanly. You may ask your question.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, good evening. Thank you for taking my call. And first question is again, it's on the insurance side for the combined ratio. Hello, can you hear me? Hello?","Michael S. McGavick","Shirley next in the queue ","Operator","Thanks. The next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanly. Since your line is open. One moment please.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello, can you hear me?","Michael S. McGavick","One moment please when we clear this with Shirley.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan. Your line is open. One moment please.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello.","Operator","Go ahead Kai.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","This is Kai with Morgan Stanley. Can you hear me?","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, we can.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, thank you so much. I'm sorry; I was already asking my question. And so my first question is really on the insurance combined ratio. And if you look back, you're making some \u2013 a lot of improvements. But if you look at the average for the first half, that's still the full load \u2013 fully loaded combined ratio is still around 95%. If you want to achieve your 10% ROE, I believe you've got to get this segment into the low 90%, probably in the 90% to 92%. I just wonder how could you do that in a now more competitively pricing environment? Could you \u2013 I mean, Greg, talk about the business mix? Could you give a little more context to that? ","","Michael S. McGavick","","Sure, I mean as we\u2019ve said before there a number of areas that we\u2019ve been working to improve that we think can keep us able to continue to improve the book even as these headwinds increased.","First I would note that well rate has been deteriorating element it doesn\u2019t mean its across the board we\u2019re seeing pockets of solid rate still and as Greg said more than half of our premium and more and even more than half of our businesses are still in a positive rate relative to trend environment. So that\u2019s good for the \u2013 for that right at the same time between remixing into more profitable businesses between the new businesses that are now up and running and contributing our ability to lower some of our operating expenses over time through investments that we\u2019re harvesting.","And we believe we can continue to expand our operating margins and continuing to nor they combine. And well \u2013 when you think about the explanation Greg just gave about the degree of large losses that we experienced well at the same time improving our last ratio by a point nearly eight tenths of a point in the period over the prior period. I feel really good about that I think that demonstrates for getting the job done and as these large losses normalize it will even more apparent. Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick","","Mike touched on mix \u2013 it\u2019s our relentless search for underwriting actions as well we\u2019ve been delivering on that quarter-after-quarter and there is meaningful impact and therein \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about in the past but or pushing the better analytics in particularly around some of the kind edge predictive model. We\u2019ll also yield further improvements there is all of the things that Mike touched on plus it\u2019s kind of core things you have been talking about for a while.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay. That's great. Then on the expense side, you forecasted this year the operating expense that's going to be mid-single-digits. I just wonder is that \u2013 do you expect that one the dollar amount to flatten out in coming years, that your expense ratio could trend lower to leverage on growing top line, or these ratio will maintain the same going forward? ","Michael S. McGavick","","This is Mike that really depends on were the top line goes our objective is to improve the ratio overtime to that end we\u2019ve been investing in new business, new ways of operating our business more lower cost mainly through harvesting investments and technology but we\u2019re determined to try and keep that ratio either inline or improving and whether the top line goes will guidance us to what our objectives will be I do think though it is wise for us to continue to investment both in the technology that can yield improvements overtime and in the new teams and new businesses that are enabling us to grow and change our mix of business that\u2019s been at the heart of why we\u2019re continuing to see improvements in our core metrics and I think we should continue to try and make such investments.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That\u2019s great. And just last quick question is, do you have any exposure to recent airline losses? And what's your outlook for the pricing in the aviation markets? ","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure, Kai its Greg. As you know we don\u2019t speak specifically about individual clients given some of the confidentially issues. So, let me speak about what wee see in the aggregate since the beginning of the year. So it\u2019s not just for the recent post into the early third quarter activity there\u2019s been five big incidents that we know, we think best guess since very early days, so this is all uncertain.","But, we expect the market loss to be somewhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of insured loss. We looked across all those pieces none of them are going to reach $10 million on an individual basis and we\u2019re going to looking at roughly 1.5% market share of loss, which is well below our premium market share. So, we\u2019re pleased with our book has performed very early day basis with some of these losses literally continue to emerge as we speak.","Jamie H. Veghte","","Yes, on the reinsurance side March 8 as when we can be specific about loss information on the March 8 loss based on the market reserve of $100 million for the whole and 350 for the liability would expect about $5 million gross and $4 million net for the reinsurance segment.","On the most recent mask, a market reserve, I don\u2019t believe has been said yet, but it\u2019s been talked between 450 and 500, we would expect anywhere between 3.5 million to 5 million XL-Re with the lower end achieved gets the whole loss goes into the aviation war market, which is what we would expect.","Gregory S. Hendrick","","Kai its Greg again. As far as with the aviation insurance market will do there\u2019s been some other commentary and clearly I agreed the war the specialist war market will move up dramatically and pricing, we would expect to see that by clearly in the more general airline market, but this has been our market that\u2019s been very competitive for a while. So, it\u2019s a little too early without any renewals right in front of me to look out to point out which right it\u2019s going to move.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much for all the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you. I have a couple of questions as it relates to the life runoff sale and potential impacts to ROE. So the first is, with the proceeds of $570 million, I think that's showing up in cash on the balance sheet. Is the plan to get that deployed near-term into the investment portfolio? ","Peter R. Porrino","Hi, Randy it\u2019s Peter. So, the $570 million approximately $300 million will be targeted as we talked about for share repurchases or the reminder of that would enter into the general investment portfolio. As I mentioned on the last quarter call, we would expect that to be basically the same risk and interest rates as we\u2019re seeing on total portfolio with the one caveat that\u2019s since we\u2019ll be back in specific liabilities you could see some more risk weighted assets in that, but not enough that would materially move the needle.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And then I guess the follow-up then is, so we see $175 million in buyback in each of the first two quarters, and so the $300 million you mentioned was on top of whatever the plan was before. So I guess it feels like that run rate needs to go higher to get to that $300 million higher buyback goal for the back half of the year. I mean, are we thinking \u2013 am I thinking of that right, that that's going to be a number kind of up in the 200's each quarter in the back part of the year? ","Peter R. Porrino","","Right, so Randy, this is Pete again. Your observation is perfectly accurate as we talked about on the last quarter, we were under 10b5-1 plan for the second quarter of the year and so that was all put emotion before the sale of the life business and so. To do the extra $300 million, we know that we would have to do more than the run rate of 175 per quarter for the rest of the year.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","","Okay, that's perfect. And the last one then is, I'll try in the buffer to the buffer topic, but I believe that that was in place to defend against an externality from having the life runoff, which is now gone. So, what's the latest there? When would that potentially narrow to further facilitate capital return?","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike, Randy. The 300 that is in addition these impart an effort to narrow that as a result of what we viewed as the life component of the risk. It is certainly not our goal to grow that buffer reduced to that repurchase action is desire to less net. I don\u2019t think we would very often run the company without any buffer to the buffer. But I do think that, that your observation if you wouldn\u2019t want to grow and that we should take out this related portion is correct.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","","All right. Thank you.","Peter R. Porrino","Randy, this is Pete. Just one other thing on when you\u2019re looking at the cash. Don\u2019t forget that we have a maturity of $600 million of debt coming due on September 15 in this year and so. So that might be the answering the question you\u2019re asking as well.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","I understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Yes. Thank you. You had mentioned that the overhead expenses within both insurance and reinsurance were partly inflated due to compensation issues. Should we expect that essentially to continue? We look at kind of the Q2 run rate \u2013 is that a reasonable number to look at going forward for that line? ","","Michael S. McGavick","Yeah, this is Mike, that is probably reasonable it really depends and how the rough sheet points plays out we have worked hard to create shareholder alliance compensation systems that reflect our results as we have been delivering that these solid results of those programs we will have, as we did in this quarter some increase because our people will share in the benefits our shareholders enjoy from this kind of performance.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question come from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","","Yes, hi Just had a couple ones. First, Pete, can you confirm, is it 28.7 \u2013 profit associated with the structured product, is that in both net and operating or just in net income? ","","Peter R. Porrino","","It\u2019s in both operating and net.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. Appreciate that. And then on the professional liability reinsurance business, I just noticed that you seem to have ceded a bit more this quarter than a year ago. I was just trying to understand kind of what gave rise to that?","Jamie H. Veghte","I think you mean the reinsurance seeded out the insurance segment?","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Well, I imagine you are paying ceding commissions out of the reinsurance? Oh, I'm sorry, yes, yes.","Michael S. McGavick","Yes, we saw this is to be insurance, the professional insurance yeah.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yeah, Mike its Greg that\u2019s the continuing impact of core share we talked about in the fourth quarter of last year with a large seeding commission relative to our cost. So we are able to benefit from that over-ride. It\u2019s just the play through we book quarter-by-quarter we don\u2019t book the whole written premium when we incept that quarter share \u2013 on quarter share reinsurance purchase we book it as we write it in each quarter. So it just the flow out of that, previously discussed transaction.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","","Got it, got it. Thanks. And then I guess on the underlying in the Reinsurance business, at which point should we expect to see, or should we expect to see, the underlying follow sort of \u2013 or be impacted by pricing on a property cat side? Because it looks like premiums there declined a bit. The commentary about pricing that we've had already. At what point should we expect to see the underlying loss ratio in that business sort of follow those trends? ","Gregory S. Hendrick","I mean that will be depend on whether we have cat of answer not, but I can tell you based on the price movements across the portfolio over the last 12 months our modeled loss ratio would have gone up about 4 to 4.5 points.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","","Got it. Great. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. One quick numbers question and then the bigger picture. Were there any impacts associated with the life reinsurance transaction on corporate expenses in the quarter? ","Peter R. Porrino","","Hey, Meyer, this is Pete now. There were no impact.","","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then this is a bigger question, probably for Greg; I'm not sure. We are seeing interest rates sort of drain down pretty steadily over the course of the year. Why isn't that having more of an impact on overall pricing? ","Gregory S. Hendrick","","So Meyer, just \u2013 I would say in some way that is when you look at which lines of business are getting rate over trend it tends to be in our longer tail lines of business I referred to at my opening remarks in North America, Texas casualty environmental. So whether that\u2019s a direct influence of investment low investment yields coming into our lines of business. I can\u2019t speak for every competitor but certainly we do see that longer tail rates holding up better than shorter tail lines.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay.","Michael S. McGavick","","Meyer, this is Mike McGavick I would add I think that\u2019s a great question. We had this kind of smoothly raising rate environment for a fairly brief period of time if I know means under the pricing decreases of the prior handful of years and if you step back and think about the business model the fact that those prices have not remained more resilient it\u2019s somewhat surprising even with the additional capital that\u2019s been focused on narrow places, in the reinsurance marketplace. So we its still relatively logical but we mean to be able to compete effectively in all cycles and this is just another hard one.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","","Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Hi, good evening. Congratulations on the quarter and thanks for fitting me in. So, I had a couple of sort of big picture questions. First for Jamie. So, 15%, 20% down broadly in property cat. And you guys mentioned specific pressure on ceding commissions and other reinsurance lines. I was sort of wondering, I've never heard anybody calculate a number, but it would be really great to get some form of \u2013 or some view of like an all-in measure of changing per pricing per unit of risk for your other reinsurance lines, so we could kind of all have a yardstick to know what the pressure is that \u2013 it sort of sounds like it's still more focused on property cat. But as it broadens, and figure out how material that really is?","Jamie H. Veghte","","So I would spend a little bit of time on that one Josh, but if you are asking what the impact on expected margins are on the proportional business that I mentioned, the pressure on commissions that would really depend on what line of business you\u2019re talking about right. Because even with interest rates low the investment income component of casually proportional business is a lot different than property. And that we are also largely also depend on how much capital to supporting the various costs of business. So, I would need to spend a little bit of time and may perhaps need some more specific guidance from you on which classes of business.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Oh, I'm not trying to be difficult. I guess I just \u2013 I'm just assuming you guys must have some internal way of talking about pricing pressure across other lines, where there just isn't the same approach. And you might \u2013 you can train us to ask the right questions so we can get the useful answer. But if you need to reflect on that, that's fine.","Gregory S. Hendrick","","Well, I can tell you that we use pricing methodology on cat and non-cat that is called rate adequacy level. And the denominator in that calculation is rating agency capital and 100% rate adequacy depends on the line of business, but broadly 100% rate adequacy is about 20% on that. The overall rate adequacy in the portfolio is in the low-90s right now.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","So if you were to just, from a really big picture simplistic way of saying, how much deterioration are you seeing in the broader lines outside of property cat? Or is this still really a property cat phenomenon? ","Gregory S. Hendrick","It\u2019s more on property that the impact on the property tax portfolio is more profound but frankly the rate adequacy level before we saw pricing pressure on property cat was much higher than our non-cat portfolio. The U.S. cat portfolio before we saw a lot of pricing pressure was well over 100%.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Right, okay. Great. Well, thank you guys for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","","Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. I guess I want to maybe re-ask one from earlier just because I'm still a little unclear. On the trend in ceding, Greg, in your business, I think you said in your comments that the cession rate for this Q would be reflective of the second half?","And I guess I just wanted to dive into that a little bit more. Because when I look at Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, with the professionalized treaty, in effect, you see that close to 30% of your business, and this quarter, went up to 40%. And I guess I'm wondering why it should stay at 40%? Sort of what changed versus last two quarters. I thought we already had those treaties in place. ","Peter R. Porrino","Yes, So Ian, so I quoted the six months number which was 25% to 33%, all right there is a lot of individual moving parts in some time in the converted one quarter share and that is a loss. So in this quarter we drag out, we recorded our excess of loss reinsurance as return and seeded return all on the quarter when is incense. But I think that 30% to 33% rate that you just is the right way to look at it for our run rate. And in the quarter for last year it was just a professional fees that we incepted to spend some other changes along the way here that make that Q1, Q2 more reflective of the overall run rate.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Got it, got it. Okay. Because it looked like \u2013 just flipping back between this quarter supplement and last quarter is that it wasn't just professional, let's say, cessions picked up significantly in both casualty and property versus Q1? ","Peter R. Porrino","","That\u2019s correct. Yes, on the property piece that\u2019s more of \u2013 some of our ability to reduced volatility on our global business particularly where were at lead and then what shows up as faculty of our capital reinsurance seeded to our common shares. We decide in some risks we like, we like the client, we love the engineer and we\u2019re able to provider than the other risk services, but we don\u2019t like the net pricing end of the day. And so we\u2019ve reduced our net share nearby having a bigger growth share being see it out. Another casualty piece we think we were able to achieve some more efficiency by combining three programs in one and seeding more business into that one single quarter share North America.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Got it. And within that casualties piece specifically, would a run rate for that also be sort of blended in the first two quarters? Or was Q2 more of the run rate now that there is these new \u2013 you've combined those treaties? ","Peter R. Porrino","On specifically casualty I want to get back to you, because I haven\u2019t done the math on that piece of it. So, let me come back to you.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Fair enough. And then my last part on that topic is, should we expect benefit to the expense ratio going forward? I'm assuming you've probably got positive overrides on the nonprofessional things you reengineered? ","Michael S. McGavick","But, as I said in the top right we\u2019ve got that benefit on the acquisition ratio side and it\u2019s the operating expense ratio side. We\u2019re hopeful to achieving gains there, but as Mike noted and I would reiterate our investment in talent and technology has been the meaningful impact of why we turn things around and we\u2019re continue to invest in that so, it won\u2019t be straight linear, I guess with the over-riders and apply that, but we are still continue to invest in our people and our technology. ","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Fair enough, fair enough. And if I can just ask one quick one on pricing. Just \u2013 is there any \u2013 obviously, you gave a lot of color on sort of my type of business. But is there any sort of difference in competitive pressures, whether it's large account versus midmarket account? Whether it's London versus Bermuda versus US? ","Peter R. Porrino","Sure, absolutely. So that the one if you just start with this International versus U.S., international is just more competitive than the U.S. marketplace. And certainly as I talked about in the past, we see a very big difference between in any given risks that\u2019s syndicated whether the primary layer and then excess structure above it. We see rate being achieved on the primary layer and then being back on the excess layer. In terms of and in that excess basis it just a lot of compensation right now with a lot of capital path. There isn\u2019t anything I see Bermuda London instead of the where your capital source of set that they are equally competitive.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Got it. I think that\u2019s all I have. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You can ask your question.","Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","","Thank you. I want to discuss the concept of operating net income. That's new, I believe, for XL. And one thing that I believe you are backing out is the $19 million of investment income to support the life retrocession agreement. That was about $0.09 a share, correct? ","Peter R. Porrino","That be about right it was $19 million so just this to be clarify the $19 million was one month\u2019s work of net investment income for the life funds with hell block of business. And since the deal closed on May 31, that would be what was separately in there.","Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","","Right. So you are backing that out of operating net income. Correct?","Peter R. Porrino","Yes.","Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","","Now \u2013 so that was one month's worth of investment income. That would be expected to persist, right? ","Peter R. Porrino","Yes absolutely.","Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Okay. So it's in net income. It's a recurring net investment income item but you are backing it out of operating? Do I have that right? ","Peter R. Porrino","It\u2019s being backed out through AOCI so it\u2019s yes it\u2019s out of operating income, right because it is no longer part of the ongoing economics to excel. Right so its in the top line but it get taken out but that derivative the promise I talked about that last time it\u2019s the derivative is in a different place and geographies and things like unrealized game are loss.","","Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Okay. So, just from a modeling standpoint, that's helpful. So, can you talk about the recurring investment income from the P&C business? Was there anything else in there that was unusual or one-time? Or should we use that \u2013 I believe it was $213 million as a run rate? ","Peter R. Porrino","Yes, I think Jay the consistent what I just said I would probably referred you to that $214 million that you mention that and this is in the schedule 11 that I mentioned earlier and then was \u2013 and there would be two quarters growth of the net investment income on the life funds with all the assets.","So for and got a little careful broad numbers like this, but the $214 million the takeaway two months work at the 19, so takeaway 38 that sort of from reward stroke will give some reasonable run rate now you need to change that for maturities coming out of the portfolio what I talked about the $3.1 billion coming out over the next year. Then really wasn\u2019t anything material in this quarter that would have move that net investment income versus an expected one now.","Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Okay. So the starting point is essentially $176 million, and there is the benefit of new cash flow but the offsetting \u2013 partially offsetting impact of reinvesting existing casual lower rates?","Peter R. Porrino","Exactly.","Jay H Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Small with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","David Small \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have a question on the expense ratio. You mentioned earlier that you continue \u2013 you plan to continue investing. And I guess I'm just trying to figure out how much more investing do you have? And when do you think we should start to see the positive operating leverage coming out of the expense ratio? And I guess at this point, what are you still investing in? Is it more talent? Is it technology? Because I would have thought by this point, the level of investment spending might be coming down. Thanks.","Peter R. Porrino","Hey, David, it\u2019s Pete. So let\u2019s split it most of the new what we call it investment dollars or the new spend is on the \u2013 I am trying to remix the book of business. So it is mostly on the people side and entirely on the underwriting side of the business. The investments that we made in technology those are not going up. As a matter of fact they\u2019re flat but over the next couple of years we would expect that those would start to go down, a little bit so that we talk the investments and the reason why the underlying is even mid single digit is because we are still investing in the business.","David Small \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Meredith. You may ask your question.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. So, Mike, this one's for you. You talk about uses of excess capital as far as growing your business I guess organically and through share buyback. Where does M&A fit into that, particularly given that we are heading into this softening market? And I guess if you're going to do any M&A, you probably want to do it fairly soon?","Michael S. McGavick","I\u2019ve always discussed the how we approach capital management as the several part exercise and the first thing we do of course, we look to what we are required the hold by meeting our rating agency and increasingly our regulatory requirements. Then we talk about a buffer that\u2019s appropriate to the risk profile the firm, the risk profile of firm have been declining. ","So I think our effective management and as a result we have been talking about decreasing the buffer to some degree, but we then say if there money is in excess of that. First could we put it to work in a way that would improve our shareholders position, that\u2019s the first thing we think about, that includes the opportunities for growth as we\u2019ve been talking about, where we can find profitable opportunities to which to grow the business. And that would include examination of opportunities to buy as well as our daily effort to add teams into increase the underwriting potential to firm.","So, we consider that along the journey and when we are done with that if we can put it into work in a way that we think is better for the shareholders, we attempt to return into the shareholders that\u2019s how we think about the process. So, we\u2019ve always said that identifying opportunities to create a better firm is one of our first thought process is after we determined how much capital is required for the firm.","And we continue to do so as you know in the six now plus years, but this management team has been assembled, we\u2019ve only made one very small acquisition in the reinsurance the ag space, but that doesn\u2019t mean we haven\u2019t continue to examine opportunities and if ever see anything where, we think it will really improve the firm we would act on that.","Brian R. Meredith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Peter R. Porrino","","You bet.","Operator","","Thank you. At this time I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike, I just want to thank everybody for the time and attention. I know there is a number of companies that are come up tonight and you have very busy \u2013 be very busy long into the evening. So we appreciate there with spend sometime with us. I reiterate where I started we\u2019re very pleased with the way the year as started out.","We feel like the things we\u2019ve been doing to improving the book are showing themselves and in particularly in the period where we\u2019ve had unusual number of large losses to still produce the kind of quality of result we did for the first half of the year it\u2019s truly heartening. And I think it reflects on the efforts we\u2019ve made de-risk the book and to be better able to observe our volatility.","We don\u2019t think the job is done well, we think we can continue to build the better firm and we are driven produced to everyday.

However, due to provisions with respect to the UK Takeover Code and Catlin\u2019s bylaws, the parties have agreed to certain matters regarding the application of the UK Takeover Code to the potential transaction. As we disclosed in previous communication, this puts significant constraints around the party\u2019s statements which we hope you can understand and we have Jason Eisenstadt of Goldman Sachs with us this evening as the city code monitor.","On the call this evening, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, who\u2019ll offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer, who'll review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations and John Welch, our Interim Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. And then we'll open it up for questions.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements, including those with respect to XL and the proposed transaction of Catlin. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations, all of which involve risk and uncertainty, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they're made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response with new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Mike McGavick","Good evening and thank you for attending tonight\u2019s call. Obviously the big event we want to talk about is the pending completion of our acquisition of Catlin and as I am sure you are aware our anticipated close date was is as soon as this Friday, May 1st. It is true that at this point we have received all of the necessary regulatory approvals and the approval of Catlin shareholders. Our last step in fact was sanctioning order by the Spring Court of Bermuda, which we received just today. And while the 1st is so very near it is not yet occurred, so all we can share about the transaction remain limited to what we have otherwise publicly disclosed as per the UK City Code on Takeovers.","Tonight therefore the call will focus on XL\u2019s first quarter results and is our intention to hold the transaction focus conference call currently scheduled for May 28th. On that call on May 28th, we intent to give you a sense of the post call integration process, share with you our impressions of the first month of combined operations and provide you with some information to support your modeling of XL Catlin as head into the second half of the year and beyond. As we will still be only in our infancy as a combine company, it won\u2019t be everything you want, but I think we can at least get to the point where you get the detail that you need to start understanding the company we\u2019re creating.","The only other note I\u2019d offer on integration planning is to say we are very pleased with how the planning process is proceeding, we set ourselves an aggressive timeline and have asked much of our colleagues and from our regulators in the past month and they have responded to me and often even exceeded our expectations. And so to all of the XL and Catlin colleagues listening, thank you and soon we\u2019ll be on to the really exciting work of putting into action all of the plans that we have made.","Now as to our first quarter result. We have said that despite all the Catlin-related activity we would remain focused on delivering XL's 15 plan. Q2 we are enormously proud of how our XL colleague have responded to the solid start to the year made clear by these results. P&C combine ratio for the quarter was 88.9% better than the 89.7% of a year ago. The lost ratio and underwriting profit for the quarter of 58.3% and $148 million were also slight improvement on those metrics from the same quarter a year ago. Gross written premiums were 2.48 billion for the first quarter versus 2.43 billion of a year ago. For the businesses both the insurance and re-insurance segments had strong starts for the year and insurance combine ratio of 94.1% was 1.3 points better than the first quarter of 2014 or even more importantly the accident year ex-CAT combined ratio continue to move in the right direction. 93.2% in this quarter versus 94.6% a year ago. In this his last call of the head of insurance operations pending of course the transaction to close, Greg will get into more of the insurance segment results in a few minutes. In reinsurance while the familiar refrain of being a tough market continued we remain confident in our teams discipline to underwriting in these conditions. ","This was again demonstrated in the segment combined ratio of 74.7% an improvement from the 76.3% in the prior year albeit added by a relatively light CAT quarter. John Welch will provide additional detail in his reinsurance report. A few final notes before turning it to Pete for additional comments on the financials of the quarter. First as you would have seen on Monday we released our global lost triangles which we believe illustrate the continued prudence of our reserving approach. Second you can also now find our 2014 letters to shareholders posted on the Investor Relations section of xlgroup.com. And third we are very excited about the recent announcement of XL Innovate, the XL sponsored venture capital fund we recently launched. The idea which led to XL Innovates launch is pretty simple. We want to be able to identify and move swiftly to create model solutions around the new and evolving risk challenges facing the globe.","And once we have created such novel solutions we want to have the flexibility to marry them to the right sources of capital and to bring them to market in a variety of potential forms. As a result here the scope and the potential for what we think we can accomplish is both broad and very, very excited. In this I'm really pleased that we will be able to have Tom Hutton who has deep insurance and technology expertise to lead the effort of course Tom is a past director of XL as well. So it\u2019s great to be partnering with him again. Most recently, Tom helped create New Energy Risks, new energy and technology and consulting company that partnered with XL uniquely last year to launch an innovative field sell insurance product. That\u2019s the kind of effort we're seeking to replicate through XL Innovate across a variety of different sectors and risks and as just one more example to how we're pushing to drive for innovation at XL and we think by extension across the industry. With that I'll turn it over to Pete.","Pete Porrino","Thanks Mike and good evening. Operating net income for the first quarter was $194 million or $0.75 per share on a fully diluted bases compare to $239 million in 2014 or $0.85 per share. We've excluded $25 million in Catlin deal related transaction cost from operating earnings which I will discuss a little later. Our net income attributable to ordinary sales for the quarter was $36 million or $0.14 per share on a fully diluted basis as we have previously noted our net income numbers are impacted by the mark-to-market movement of the derivatives that trends to the economics of the asset packing, our second quarter 2014 life reinsurance transaction. However that derivative movement is completely offset by investment income, realized gains and losses and a change in the unrealized position of our portfolio and does not impact our net book value operating income or comprehensive income. We continue to show that relationship in the summary consolidated financial data included with the press release. The continued declines in UK and EU interest rate have caused an increase in the value of those assets with an offsetting derivative loss. Our property and cash combined ratio for the quarter was 88.9% or 0.8 points better in the same quarter last year.","Our accident year combine ratio for the quarter was 92.5% the same as the first quarter of 2014. Greg and John will discuss our underwriting results in further detail. For the quarter our natural catastrophes losses totaled $15 million or 1.1 loss ratio points, by comparison net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2014 totaled $17 million or 1.2 loss ratio point. Prior year reserved enrollment in the quarter was a net favorable $48 million or 3.7 loss ratio points, compare to $39 million in 2.7 lost ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects favorable development of 6 million and $42 million in the insurance and reinsurance segments. Our semiannual full actuarial review will be included in our results next quarter.","As I mentioned we incurred approximately $25 of transaction cost related to the Catlin acquisition. These are predominantly made up of legal and due diligence fees relating to the transaction totaling approximately 10 million which are included in operating expenses combined with the cost of bridge financing facility of approximately $15 million which is recorded in interest expense. We continue to expect this transaction to close in the second quarter and therefore we would expect to incur additional deal specific cost in that period. Excluding this cost operating expenses have decreased 8.7% from the fourth quarter of 2014 due primarily to the impacted variable compensation in last year's fourth quarter number. Compared to the first quarter in 2014 our operating expenses excluding this cost have increased by approximately 1.5%.","Turning to investment performance, the XL investment portfolio returned 1.3% for the quarter including a positive mark-to-market of $95 million. Included in the quarterly mark-to-market when net realized gains of $5 million, this compares to net realized gains of $19 million in the first quarter of 2014. At $158 million net investment income on the portfolio was $75 million below the same quarter last year primarily due to the Life transaction but also the impact of reinvestment yields and to a lesser extent foreign exchange on the P&C portfolio. The gross book yield in the portfolio at the end of March was 2.6%. ","During the quarter our average new money rate was 1.3%, this was negatively impacted by the purchase of short-dated treasuries as we started to build liquidity to fund the pending Catlin acquisition. Adjusting for these purchases and more reflective of our ongoing investment activities that new money yield was 1.5%. Given current yield net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we've approximately $2.9 billion of access with book yield of 2.8% rolling off over the next 12 months. ","Unrealized net gains in the portfolio were $1.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. The duration of our fixed income portfolio at the end of the quarter was 3.7 years slightly shorter than the previous quarter. Net income from investment fund and investment manager operating affiliates was $39 million for the quarter, down $21 million from the prior year quarter as incentive fees from our investment manager affiliates were not as strong as they have been in the previous year when they had an exceptional quarterly performance. ","The investment funds particularly the alternatives portfolio continued to perform well generating $35 million in earnings. On April 01st, 2015 we completed the previously announced sale of all of XL shares in American Strategic Insurance to the [Progress] Corporation. On March 31, 2015 the company's carrying value was $223 million. XL received approximately $560 million in proceeds from the transaction and will record a gain of approximately $337 million in the second quarter. ","With respect to capital management, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Catlin on March 30, 2015 we issued $500 million of 4.45%, 10 year subordinate notes and $500 million of 5.5%, 30 year subordinate notes. These notes were designed to meet Solvency II capital standards for loss absorbency. To the best of our knowledge this was the first Solvency II debt financing conducted in the U.S. fixed income market and we\u2019re very pleased with the results. ","The net proceeds from the sale of these notes together with cash and cash equivalents from other sources have been deposited in ESCROW to discharge the cash consideration payable to Catlin shareholders in respect with the acquisition. According XL cancelled the 1.6 billion pound bridge facility effective as of April 08, 2015 to avoid future bridge costs. At December 31, 2014 $268 million remained available for purchase under our share buyback program. We suspended active share buybacks during the first quarter to the close of our proposed acquisition of Catlin. We will discuss capital management in our May 20th quarter call that Mike referred to. ","I will now turn it over to Greg to discuss our insurance segment results. ","Greg Hendrick","Thanks, Pete and good evening. Tonight I\u2019ll cover the results of the segment, provide some color on our progress during the quarter and finish with remarks on current market conditions.","Beginning with the results the first quarter marked our 9th consecutive quarter profitability. With the segment produced in calendar quarter combined ratio of 94.1%, compared to 95.4% in the same quarter last year. Insurance segment produced a strong accident quarter ex-CAT combined ratio of 93.2% compared to 94.6% in the first quarter of 2014. This is our best result on this basis since 2007. ","This year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by 1 point improvement in the underwriting expense ratio as well as an accident quarter ex-CAT loss ratio of 63.2% which was 0.3 points better than prior year. The results also benefited from another quarter of favorable CAT activity, which contributed 0.2 points to the improvement and this was mostly offset by slightly lower prior year development. ","The underwriting expense ratio was 30% in the first quarter, reflecting an improvement of 1 full point in the first quarter of last year. This improvement was largely result of the actions we've taken to shift towards quarter share trades in a number of our businesses improving our acquisition ratio to 8.4% in the first quarter, compared to 10.6% in the first quarter of 2014. ","As we've discussed previously our operating expense ratio increased by 1.2% partially driven by the quarter share usage. We have been actively managing our stocking levels as we've completed the build-out phase for many of our businesses. Our headcount increased by just 1% during the first quarter of the year down from 2.5% increase in the first quarter of last year. ","Insurance gross premiums written grew by 169 million or 10.8% in the quarter, when adjusted for foreign exchange movement. All of this has contributed this growth, led by North American Property and Casualty our gross premiums were up 16%, driven by new business and higher renewal retention in construction, Global Risk Management and E&S. Specialty was up 15%, reflecting higher new business in Marine and Offshore Energy and strong retention in crisis management. International Property and Casualty gross premiums were up 8% to the continued growth in international middle markets an increased new business and primary casualty, partially offset by lower premium in property. And professional is up 6%, mostly due to higher new business in our international financial lines business and continued growth in our cyber book. Underpaying this growth, we continue to see an increase in submissions across the segment and quote a higher percent of these submissions reflecting our positive momentum in the large commercial marketplace.","Shifting to ongoing progress, as mentioned earlier we experience a 1.4 improvement in our accident year ex-CAT combined ratio relative to the first quarter of 2014, despite competitive market conditions which I\u2019ll talk about in a moment. We continue to focus on an improved mix of business and ongoing execution of underwriting actions both of which contributed during the quarter. In addition, our measured use of proportionally insurance to strong [seating] commissions, our efforts to create operating leverage through efficiencies and rigorous expense management and the increase in the scale of our newer businesses have all contributed to the 1 point improvement in our underwriting expense per share. While we continue to pull this leverage and have delivered continued improvement over the past few years, we strongly believe that the XL Catlin transaction will allow us to pull these levels even harder and accelerate our progress towards top quintile performance.","Turning to market conditions, we saw continuation of our reported during the second half of 2014. First quarter pricing is flat and slightly negative across most lines of business, as the overall rate change for the segment was minus 0.2%. As the momentum has clearly continue to slow, 13 of our 23 businesses have price decreases compare to only 6 in the first quarter of last year and overall pricings are now lagging trend by just under 2 points. In the first quarter, our professional businesses achieved rate increases just over 1% driven by our Cyber and miscellaneous professional businesses. Our international P&C were flat with slight increases in cash [indiscernible] markets offset by slight decreases in property. Our North American specialty business continue to be most severely impacted with an overall rate decrease of one to two points, larger reflecting continued competitive conditions in property and aviation lines respectively. Finally, while we once again benefitted from a relatively quiet catastrophe quarter, we delivered another solid quarter of underlying profitability and more importantly, we continued our ongoing trajectory of underwriting improvement.","Had a great run over the past three years, steady improvement resulted from a hard work of a great group of colleagues and while this moment is a little bitter-sweet for me, and I turn over the reins to Paul, [indiscernible], I feel strong as this segment is well positioned for continued success. Combine their leadership with a high caliber of the combined XL Catlin Insurance team, the segment is poised to delivered continued improvement in our results.","Now the John will discuss reinsurance results.","John Welch","Thank you, Greg and good evening. The Reinsurance segment got off to another excellent start in 2015 with the combined ratio of 74.7% and resulting underwriting profit of 90 million for the quarter. This compares with the combine ratio of 76.3% and the underwriting profit of 100 million for the first quarter of 2014. We had the benefit of the light quarter of catastrophe activity and continued favorable reserve runoff. Considering the competitive landscape, we are pleased with how the portfolio performed in the first quarter. Our reserve releases in the quarter were 42 million or 11.9 points compared with 30 million or 7.2 points a year ago. The current quarter release was entirely driven by favorable run-off in short tail lines of business.","The year-over-year improvement was produced by the property catastrophe line. Excluding prior year development, portfolio generated a combine ratio of 86.6%, which compares to the 83.5% produced in the first quarter of 2014. The accident quarter loss ratio rose 1.7 points to 54.7% for the quarter. The primary drivers of the loss ratio increase were one-time premium reductions and prior underwriting years and underlying rate deterioration with a partial offset due to an improved mix of business. There was no impact from catastrophe losses for the first quarter in the current or prior year. Turning top-line, gross written premium for the quarter was 826 million, down from 858 million in the first quarter of 2014.","The impact of FX on gross written premium year-over-year was a reduction of 54 million or 6.2%. Excluding the impact of FX, the 2.5% growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the specialty crop insurance book and a few new opportunities in U.S. casualty treaty for which we are the lead reinsurer. The net earn premium experienced a year-over-year reduction of 63 million or 15%, 18 million or 4.4 points related to the impact of FX with the remainder driven by the decline in net premium during 2014. This decline was driven by the property catastrophe and casualty lines.","Turning to market conditions, we experienced deteriorating rate adequacy across all lines and regions during the first quarter. The largest magnitude of deterioration was experience in the property catastrophe book followed by other short tail lines and finally casualty. Since the end of the quarter the only significantly renewal for XL at April 1, was in the Japanese market. Japanese renewals were competitive with Cat-ex oil rate of 10% to 15% and upward seeding commission pressure on proportional treatises. There were some isolated pockets of increase demand from some large buyers.","In conclusion it was successful quarters from a profitability perspective. Prior year reserve continue to run off favorably and benefited from light quarter for catastrophe. Market conditions continue to be challenging however we have found some pockets of opportunity and are pleased with the portfolio written to date. With that I will turn it back to David. ","David Radulski","Kelley can you please the open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] The first question will come from the line of Mr. Josh Stirling of Bernstein. Sir your line is now open.","Josh Stirling ","So Mike I think I and everybody who reads [Bloodberg] enjoyed your comments about M&A in the shareholders letter. You made some comments about companies historically sometime becoming road kill and I thought -- I know we can't ask you about details on the deal. So I won't try to do that, but big picture as you look back over your history in the industry, when you think about challenged deals that often didn\u2019t work, or were really difficult for the companies to digest. When you look back, what are some of the pit falls that you think M&A presents and then how would you guys tried to design this acquisition and probably -- even more important you are approach to integration to try to think through and prevent some of these promise in the merging?","Mike McGavick","So I'm glancing over at our takeover council as I answer. So that he can hit me directly between the eyes more easily. I do think Josh that you\u2019ve asked an important question that I can answer. Couple of thoughts, first of all we did as a part of our work with our risk management committee and with the full board. We actually did an analysis of all of the deals that have gone before not just in our space but in other space. And went through what we thought were their causes of failure in various transaction to try and understand how if we did any transaction much this specific one we're talking about; how we would approach it. So we had a general rule book of what can happen in transactions and what can be done to mitigate that.","So we went into this knowing that for our sectors specifically and generally there are an awful lot of failures in M&A and I can give you a handful of the things that were very much on our mind as we thought about them. Number one, many of them failed because of the way they are entered into. In other words, the initial pricing, terms and conditions of the agreement and the approach to bringing the companies together. So lot of it's about how you get into in the first place. The second thing is so many failures can be related to culture, were the companies truly comparable, where the leaderships of the company approaching these integrations in the right way. Third category of failures is when there is not sufficient emphasis on the economics of the transaction but just some kind of focused on strategy and our belief that if you get strategy right everything else will follow.","I think I mentioned in my letter that we particularly don\u2019t buy into that notion we believe it has to answer both on the strategy level as well as on the financial level. And finally a fifth category of failure is when you sort of loose control on the integration when in essence the things that you believe will happen whether synergies or retention of key people or business proved to be wrong. And therefore as you go along you cannot create the economic or strategic outcome that you believed was worth the deal in the first place.","So those are some of the big ticket -- there are a good dozen of these if I remember the list. But those were some of the big ticket items that we were very focused on. And here I will only comment on things that we have previously discussed. But as previously discuss we have the advances because we weren\u2019t already in the deals frenzy that has subsequently evolved, we had the advantage of a very long period of run up, in which really amounting about 18 months in which Steven and I and later the broader leadership teams and we and later teams of people, through due diligence across the companies could confirm to our satisfaction that in fact the cultures were compatible, highly compatible in fact. That in fact, the economics and not just the strategy made sense; that in fact we believe we could pull people along to the common vision and there is just been nothing that has taken place since, that has changed any of our view that we are starting with a very advantaged hand as we enter what becomes now, the real integrations. ","As we entered what becomes now the real integration. As we've mentioned before we've had a teams of literally dozens upon dozens -- hundreds of people from the company focused on the integration activities in accordance with the law, while at the same time the vast majority of colleagues from both XL and Catlin have focused on delivering a quarter first quarter which as you can see from the numbers we've managed to do. So I suppose only one last though and then if you have a follow-up I will see if someone can answer.","But the other thought I would add is, this quarter continues to show that this wasn't something we felt we needed to do, our own book of business is performing very well, and I can tell you Greg and I look each other from time-to-time say man it's going to so well, and yet at the same time we believe that respecting the strategic imperatives about which I\u2019ve talked so much and is in the letter as well, these five big things and they need to respond to the write off change in the sector. We continue to believe that the combined company XL-Catlin once it if closed, will even be more effective that positioning our ability to solve client needs and thereby return of an appropriate return for our shareholders. ","So I hope that\u2019s helpful but this was done fully aware of the various pitfalls, in fact with fair amount of analysis around them and in a deep believe that we had done all we could to mitigate against those in both the run up and now in our preparation to jump in the next deal together should it close in fact on Friday. ","Josh Stirling","Mike, thank you. I think that was really thoughtful and complete. I guess my only follow-up would be when you think about -- you may have talked a lot of about culture of the firm being compatible but it is a combination you got into the XL Catlin is new trade name. How does an XL underwriter begin to look at the world differently? How does the Catlin underwriter begin to look at the world differently? And how should we think about you guys long-term. I mean is this XL but plus [indiscernible] company or Catlin starts to look more like Bermuda company or you both look more like a specialty company? I was just trying to maybe get a sense of what you think the longer vision is? And how from an underwriting perspective particular the world changes?","Mike McGavick","Unfortunately, now you really are in the perspective questions. So I can\u2019t talk about how XL Catlin will compete because it doesn't exist yet. But you can presume very strongly based on your intuitive logic is that we didn't spend all this money to then go and somehow make it just one or the other that would be too limited. It's really about how they bring as we've said many times the best of both forward. I do think though there is an implicit element to your question, but I can answer that. That Pete reminds was certainly important to how we\u2019re comfortable with this transaction. And that is -- it is clear to me that one of the other big failure risks is the inability to be decisive and one of the things I would have formulated your question differently but I\u2019ll anticipate that others would want to know this, and believe me we\u2019re not going to spend a lot more time on this topic. So you actually kind of got away with one.","But the bottom-line is I've been hired twice to clean up the mess of under executed transactions before. I could argue that the [indiscernible] of transaction here wasn't complete and that we completed it. And I\u2019d know for sure that when I got to Safeco, one of the big problems was that they bought American stakes and they never fully made the tough decisions to integrate the companies to really bring forward the best of best, they acted like they could just go on as they were before. You can't do that and you have to be decisive and willing to be decisive and make tough choices as to both organizations in order to create truly world class going forward competitor. And I can say that I watched some of that work and cleaned up some of that work when I was at C&A as well. ","So I can just tell you we\u2019re being decisive, you\u2019ve seen the rollout of choices amongst competitive competent people of our various leadership jobs all the down several levels now that have been in the press and we\u2019re going to approach saying we\u2019re absolutely determined and will not be thwarted it our ability to bring the best forward and to deliver on the economics we promised to the marketplace. ","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Cliff Gallant of Nomura. Sir your line is now open. ","Cliff Gallant","You touched on share repurchases and how that you might revisit that question in a few weeks. But I am just wondering how you feel about the capital position of the company today as you head into the merger? And from your perspective Pete do you think it is capacity for buyback and what would your thinking be around that?","Mike McGavick","There is a couple of things that are obvious, because we have not been buying back shares during this period of time and because we had the successful sale of our ownership of ASI, clearly capital is building it, the company. At the same time we've said very clearly that we will talk about capital management as a part of giving you the information necessary to model us into the future and that is referred to the May 28th call and until then we are not going to get into those questions.","Cliff Gallant ","As a follow-up then just on the quarter\u2019s results then, when I look at the insurance progress and you guys continue to have great progress on the underlying combined ratio. And then even 1.4 points this quarter, I didn\u2019t notice all that from the -- in the second half of last year was more like 3 points a quarter and I am curious, are we getting to the point now where you would have expected that the rate of improvement would have slowed, that a lot of the low hanging fruit was sort of -- have been taking care of?","Mike McGavick","Not at all, I would say we would believe there is a lot less [environment] and it turned over to Greg, but the one win that was still somewhat contributing then and is not now of course is rate, I mean that\u2019s why you're seeing some shift in what\u2019s going on between this year and last year, but that doesn\u2019t -- [Rob] as something we\u2019re doing to make progress.","Greg Hendrick","Right, we\u2019re still making progress, Cliff, part of it is on mix, we continue to mix in -- most of the new businesses are kind of higher margin than we\u2019ve had in the past. We continue to be very rigorous as I mentioned in my comments on the underwriting actions that yielded over half a point in the quarter this year. So we have a couple of other levers to pull on. It does get -- the quarter-over-quarter rate of improvement does get little bit harder as you get to the end, but we still feel we\u2019ve got a lot of room to go is what we\u2019ve got in hand.","Mike McGavick","The other thing I would remind you of is, is in first quarter of the year this is really an [A versus E] quarter, PYD doesn\u2019t get looked at hard until you get to the second and fourth quarter which also would add to the accelerating phenomena of some of these benefits in prior years.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Mr. Brian Meredith of UBS. Sir, your line is now open.","Brian Meredith ","A couple of questions here for you, the first one, just looking at field reinsurance during the quarter, anything different that happened there, looked like bought some more retro on the property cap book, any positioning actually for the Catlin acquisition as you kind of look through the summer months?","Greg Hendrick","This is Greg, I\u2019ll start with the -- on the insurance segment, we\u2019ve been running quarter-to-quarter around about 66% to 72% net-written to gross-written retention ratio and it was 66% I believe this quarter. There is a bit of noise in that number, we wrote a couple of sizeable and meaningful transactions on our global risk management which is the -- where we ensure Fortune 1000 companies, they retain a significant amount of it, so large amount [indiscernible] and sometimes to call insurers. There is a little bit of noise there, there is also a true up on one of our quarter shares from prior year. So we don\u2019t anticipate that run rate in the first quarter to do what you would see underneath the insurance segment.","Mike McGavick","Brian on the reinsurance side, what happens in the first quarter as we book the majority of our crop premium is sales closing for especially crops are essentially December through February, that led to about two point bump in the ceded written premium or the gross written premium relationship. But that\u2019s about probably 80% of the premium we\u2019ll book for the year for that business. So I think for the next three quarters we\u2019ll just revert back to a more normal historical ratio of ceded to gross.","Brian Meredith","Anything specific on property [Cato] that particularly look like a sometime pretty significantly year-over-year?","Mike McGavick","No, not really. The only thing I\u2019d add to what\u2019s been said is that that none of it has anything to do with [excel] calendar; obviously given that the transaction hasn\u2019t close, we\u2019ve had to maintain entirely separate reinsurance purchases strategies and won\u2019t get through to work on the benefit said that we have described and we think to our benefits there, but we won\u2019t start being able to bring those to life until the company are actually bought together.","Brian Meredith","And just one quick number question for Pete, Pete what is the impact of FX on the investment income for the P&C in the quarter?","Pete Porrino","It was about $3 million.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Mr. Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.","Meyer Shields ","I was hoping that we could talk a little bit more about the mix shift in the insurance segment and whether the -- I guess year-over-year progress is likely to accelerate from what we saw in the first quarter?","Greg Hendrick","We may to same progress we\u2019ve talked about on a number of calls where kind of in that 70% to 75% were we are at or within five points of our target combined ratio. That\u2019s been fairly steady improvement along the way. I don\u2019t see anything that would cause me to think that progress will continue through the rest of the year, I am not going to forecast where we think it's going to get to, but it's just continuing work and continuing remixing of the business.","Meyer Shields","And I don\u2019t know whether Mike you answer this before, but could you apply any reinsurance for less than the full year 2015 during the first quarter in anticipation of the calendar?","Mike McGavick","No, we really couldn\u2019t approach the world that way, I mean the reality is until its close, it isn\u2019t close and we had to do everything as though we were continuing to operate independently, or as through for some reason, it might not close. Obviously, as we get into these final days, we are feeling very good about it, but that\u2019s not the same as being done. So we did everything to deny to, hey what if it didn\u2019t happen, you have to operate like it would. ","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Mr. Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is now open.","Josh Shanker ","I guess for John and Mike, it's not surprising, I suppose you said that most or actually all lines of business and reinsurance show pricing deterioration. And we had a point obviously where we're not sure there is much of inflation on the claim side but clearly negative is been good on the pricing. Not to take guidance -- I mean directionally is there a way for you guys to improve your margin reinsurance here or to the -- or it's about time to non-renew business in order to minimize that situation?","Mike McGavick","Actually where we certainly went to a process last year trying to change and accomplishing changing the mix of business. When we look at the economic returns we would say casualty would have the worst economic returns at this point for our portfolio and so essentially we pull back faster last year on that than the other lines. Going into this year those lines have been somewhat stable it will be hard I think -- we've had some new opportunities the crop business was one of them, to attempt to offset some of that loss business as the margins deteriorate. But it will be difficult as we go through the year to foresee finding new business that will offset some of that lost business, where the margins aren\u2019t acceptable any more.","Josh Shanker ","Do you think we should expect you to get smaller?","Mike McGavick","Well the way I looked at the premium in the first quarter is, if you back out the crop business the FX one time premium adjustments. We are essentially flat year-over-year that\u2019s not what we aspire to but I think we be happy if that\u2019s the outcome. ","Josh Shanker ","And on tax, the taxes it's hard predict any given quarter and one quarter is not a full year make. Can you give us some thoughts on the second quarter maybe? And relatively you don\u2019t want to take that line of questions, looking at same thing should help us understand tax over the long term for XL has a larger more global company?","Pete Porrino","Sure Josh its Pete, I'm going to answer half of your question directly and the other we'll cover on the call on the 28th. So what you would need to do in taxes -- it is a complicated quarter with the continuing noise in the life transaction impact in the net income. If you looked at on an operating basis you would have saw our tax rate would have been just about exactly 13% which is pretty consistent with what we've been saying in the past we've sort of talking in the 12% range or so. I don\u2019t see anything that would change that as a standalone company Catlin has a lower tax rate than we do. But at this point I really can't comment on what the likely tax rate of the combined entity would be.","Josh Shanker ","That\u2019s as good as I\u2019m going to get, I guess, so I'll take it. Thank you guys good luck.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Mr. Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Sir your line is now open.","Amit Kumar ","Just one quick follow if you go back to Q2, 2014 we spend some time talking about large losses and at that time you had purchased a large risk aggregate cover. Can you remind us if there is anything remaining on that or has that been fully utilized? And how should we think about that piece going forward?","Greg Hendrick","Through the end of the first quarter we have utilized, recovered from a portion of that, covers still has limit left in it. It runs through May 1st of this year, we're in the process of considering what to do with it, that renewal and it's still some days ago. So I don\u2019t have any answer for what we will do going forward, not to least what will be wrapped up within store -- we were not going to talk about our XL Catlin. But there is limit left the first quarter was not anything abnormal in large loss activity. ","Amit Kumar ","Got it that\u2019s all I had. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Mr. Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Sir your line is now open.","Ian Gutterman ","First I'm going to ask that maybe it is a little bit in the grey area but I think the way I\u2019ll ask it, you\u2019d way the ask that you can answer it. As of Monday is there anything that prevents you from buying back stock if you choose to, I'm not asking if you will or you won\u2019t; but is there anything that presences you from starting to buy back stock at Monday if you wanted to?","Greg Hendrick","No.","Ian Gutterman ","Second lot of my other ones has been answered here. The crop you talked about I think a fair amount of that\u2019s in California is there any reason to be concerned about the drought?","John Welch","While it certainly something we monitor, the crops that tend to be the most exposed to drought tend to be rogue crops which is not the target of the portfolio. The portfolio is targeted towards almonds and citrus and grapes which do have the necessary irrigation to have a good year. We\u2019ve had a few good years in a row here. We think given the target crops the draught shouldn't be an issue for us over the next 12 months, we\u2019ll say, I think as we look at what develops over the next three years to five years, if it can become a concern at that point. ","Pete Porrino","This is Pete, just to confirm. Yes indeed it is the vast majority is California. ","Ian Gutterman ","And then just my last and this is asked a little bit; but just to get a little more detail. The drop in the investment income sequentially, are you short from where the run was, I think about 10 million maybe little bit more that\u2019s focusing just on the P&C part, I guess 12 million from last quarter. You said 3 was FX there is about 9, that seems like a lot to explain by just holding cash for Catlin plus the normal maturities versus new money. Is there anything else in there or is this new run rate? The one I made when I backed up just couple of things. ","Pete Porrino","Sure it's Pete. And some of this goes into a new run rate and some of it is one off. There was a one off distribution last quarter and all the numbers I am going to give you are right all around $3 million. And so we actually capped at slightly more than 12 more or like 14 million over drought. So there was a one-off distribution last quarter, I guess about 3 million, in addition to building cash for Catlin acquisition we also sold some of our higher yielding assets, the two of them together I would say that was about 3 million, and then the last one was just a general reduction in yields from reinvesting maturing bonds. ","And so when you add those four up that\u2019s a pretty much get to the money I think you were looking for. ","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Mr. Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Sir your line is now open. ","Ryan Tunis ","My first question is just on the operating expenses, XL Catlin. They are up 1.6% year-over-year. I think you guys have said you think you can do low single-digits, and if I recall correctly I think in the back half of last year when we had more of the difficult comps with the higher variable compensation level. Am I right to think that as the year goes on, it should actually be easier to grow organic over operating expenses less or am I not thinking about that right on the variable expense side?","Pete Porrino","First off and after this quarter, we\u2019re not going to be able to measure them anymore on the same basis. But you are right that in the last quarter of last year we had a significant amount of variable compensation which drove that up which is why we had large decrease this quarter sequentially. The one thing I would is that we benefited from foreign exchange in this quarter in the expenses. So if you would have normalized to that it would have been more in the 5% range. And so if you would have thought about that going for the next couple of quarters and then having a decline in the fourth quarter that\u2019s where you would get to the low single-digit for the full year. ","Ryan Tunis ","Just to be clear, everything you saw this quarter though still makes you feel good about that low single-digit guidance you gave in the fourth quarter?","Pete Porrino","Absolutely, it's completely in line. ","Ryan Tunis ","Just one more, I guess is more general question in insurance, right property I know is an area you guys have been trying to grow in. We\u2019ve heard competitors talk about how that\u2019s a difficult line in terms of rate. I am just curious maybe you could talk about the competitive environment there and any of the challenges turn to grow that line?","Greg Hendrick","Sure Ryan, its Greg Hendrick. It is definitely the more competitive as in general, the most competitive area we see in the insurance marketplace. Property in North America was down about 5 points and internationally down about 2 points. Particularly North America, in North America we\u2019re coming off pricing levels which are generating sufficient margins for us. So there has definitely been more capacity put to work. It's definitely a lot harder and more difficult marketplace but it's one I think we can navigate well and these aren't run away rate reductions that we\u2019re seeing on the insurance side. ","Mike McGavick","This is Mike; I would add couple of things. I was down there, I just got back last night from [Rem\u2019s], which is always very good place to get handle on what\u2019s going on in the market, and I can just tell you that the combination of the underwriting team we've assembled in the property space and the respected commands in the sector combined with the additional we\u2019re able to make around risk management and through our GAAP's offering and the various mitigation program; we\u2019re still able to make some headway in that sector. We are not that bigger market share and that team and that offering are so compelling that we continue to see opportunities coming our way that still need our hurdles. ","If we were a larger player perhaps I\u2019d be more worried about our continuing ability to write but we certainly saw examples when I was down in [Rem\u2019s], of places where we still have [indiscernible] to pick up some attractive business.","That\u2019s my first point, the second point on the question you asked Pete on expenses, I just had one more thought, I think it's really important, not only are we well positioned because of the momentum in improving our broker business that we come into this period with, but I\u2019d much rather be in the position of executing upon a transaction in the midst of it as well because it simply gives you obviously more to work with and more levers to pull. So I like both elements of our positioning should the deal in fact close on time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Mr. Jay Cohen of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open.","Jay Cohen","On your acquisition expenses and you reinsurance business, I guess I would have expected that number to be rising over the past several years just given higher ceding commissions, yet that number really haven\u2019t budged, is this a business mix issue, why is it been so stable?","John Welch","Jay it really is at least for this quarter, Jamie is not here to answer for the other years, but for this quarter it\u2019s a business mix issue, the crop business in particular, the proportion of CAT business that all helps the proportional business as commissions have reason exactly as you describe has been more difficult to write. So as we\u2019ve contracted over the years it's been disproportionately on proportional business side. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019ve manage to control the commission rise.","Jay Cohen","And my other questions were answered, so thanks I\u2019ll talk to you at the end of the month.","Operator","Thank you. At this time we do not have question from the queue. Speakers you may proceed.","Mike McGavick","We appreciate the way in which the questions were approached today. Obviously it's an uncomfortable thing to that there are important items you can\u2019t talk about and I can\u2019t tell you how eager I am to get to the 28th and to Friday to the days beyond to get this hopefully up and running. I do think it's appropriate to take one minutes and couple of thank you. First of all John Welch, thank you very much for your Internship presuming it all goes through when Greg will slide back over, so thank you.","Second to Sarah Street, Sarah has been announced to chosen to take a reduced responsibility and to enjoy little more free time which she certainly has earned through the rather remarkable efforts to restructure our portfolio both during and after the financial crisis and providing what is simply an exemplary leader to the wonderful group of investment professionals that we have and I am thrilled that she will continue to work in the strategy and the XL innovate areas where I think she has enormous contributions to make.","But we should pause and I think it's appropriate in this venue to note in front of the shareholders the remarkable work Sarah has done over these years and finally to Greg, well it's going to be thrilling to see what he does with the excitement that is structural shifts going on in the reinsurance world; it cannot be passed up the opportunity to again -- in front of our analysts and shareholders to thank Greg for the absolutely stellar leadership he has provided to the turnaround of our insurance businesses and I know very well both of them would immediately reflect to their colleagues for all that they have done, but I want to make sure leadership matters and these two are really extraordinary at leadership. So thanks to you both and thanks for the call you guys. We\u2019ll look forward to the 28th.","Operator","Thank you. And that conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

My name Shirley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group plc Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David R. Radulski","Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being simultaneously webcast in XL's website at www.xlgroup.com, and we posted to our website several documents including our quarterly financial supplement.","On our call this evening, you will hear from Mike Mcgavick, XL Group's CEO; Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance operations; Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive Insurance operations; and Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer.","Before they begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they are made, and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I turn it over to Mike Mcgavick.","Michael S. Mcgavick","Thanks, Dave. Welcome to our third quarter call. Obviously, this call comes in a difficult time. We know a lot about the third quarter, and I've been looking forward to sharing it with you. What we don't know a lot about is the event that occurred just last week with Sandy, which I'm sure is on all of your minds.","The first thing to say with respect to Sandy is the most important truth about being in the risk business. It is sadly often about human misery. Our thoughts go out to those who are still suffering.","To respect your obvious curiosity about Sandy, we'll start the call with a brief discussion of what we know. Following this, we'll discuss the third quarter in our usual way, and then we will take your questions.","With Sandy, we know you are working hard to understand the answers to 3 basic questions: how big is the industry loss; what is the XL loss going to be; and is this a market changing event of some kind. I will comment on how we're thinking of the markets after Sandy, Jamie will give our perspectives on the early industry loss estimates as well as what he can on XL Re. And I'll ask Greg to talk more about what we're seeing in our insurance book from Sandy at this point.","Of course, the reality is that no one really knows anything with certainty about Sandy from an overall point of view at this stage. I would point out that even the external risks modeling group we work with most closely has not yet posted its own industry estimate.","In terms of the broader market. I do not think Sandy ends up being a capital event for the industry, at least based on what we are seeing so far. But while Sandy might not change the industry's capital position, I do believe that this may change the industry's perception of risk. When this is all said and done, I don't think any of us are going to feel that people were as well insured as they could have been. I don't think people will feel that the region was as well prepared as it could have been as several leading elected officials have already said. And in the end, I believe the underwriting community will have to we think with care what they should charge for risks in a region with such a complex concentration of values exposed to such storms.","Now I'll turn it over to Jamie for his comments on Sandy.","James H. Veghte","Thanks, Mike. We've had very little specific information from our customer base. Those dialogues are just beginning. We have seen the ranges of industry loss estimates from various sources. And as Mike mentioned, one of the prominent modeling companies has not released an estimate, and it's due out with information for us to work with tomorrow.","Our instinct is that the industry loss will be at the top end of the published ranges, $20 billion or above. This loss really highlights the concentration of values in the region, a loss of perhaps $20 billion to the industry or above from the storm that was classified as post-tropical cyclone as it came ashore is remarkable.","We will have exposure from several sources and clearly a $20 billion market loss. It's a significant loss to the reinsurance market broadly. However, we typically do not provide significant capacity on lower layers of New England mutual companies, principally due to our historic concern over winter storm exposure. Our capacity on those accounts would typically be skewed to the middle and upper parts of the program.","We do write a variety of national accounts. After Katrina, a number of nationwide commercial carriers increased their retention significantly. And given the uncertainty around the impact of flood and BI on commercial carriers, it's too early to predict the precise impact on individual clients. We will also have potential exposure from our North American profit center from both the treaty, which is a non-CAT property treaty book, and some facultative exposures.","We do buy retrocessional coverage but at a very higher attachment point, and our expectations will be that the retro program will not come into play other than some, perhaps, small proportion of recoveries. So broadly, our gross loss will be our net loss. Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Jamie. I'll cover 3 topics around Sandy: our reported notices of loss to date, the reinsurance coverage we have in place and the generic loss example.","First, after 1:00 this afternoon, we have set up 175 potential claims comprised partly of loss notifications from clients and partly based on reports from brokers and the media as a result of Sandy. This covers a wide range of risks from small claims in our general aviation book to reports from some of our large property clients.","As perspective, based on prior catastrophes, of these initial loss notifications, roughly 50% in term to claims payable by XL Insurance, as often the losses have not reached deductible, attachment point or self-insured retention of the policy. We are in the very early stages of the claims adjusting process and have adjusters moving to the impacted locations as we speak.","Next, I'll turn to the reinsurance protection that we have in place for our property exposures. First, we place a property per risk coverage attaches at $25 million and runs to $600 million for our large property exposures. We retain 45% of the first $15 million of limit, which translates into a retention of $32 million per risk, and we have multiple reinstatements for each layer.","In a per-event basis, we buy U.S. catastrophe program, which attaches at $100 million and exhausts at $450 million. Within the first $100 million of limit, we retain 40%. And as a result on losses of $200 million or greater, we retain $140 million. This cover protects all of our property lines of business and has 2 limits available in any one treaty year, none of which have been used to date.","We also have in place various reinsurance covers that protect specific portfolios, which could lower our net loss where they to come into play. Let me be clear, at this point it's too early to tell whether any of these reinsurance covers will be impacted by Sandy.","The difficulty of loss estimation is best brought to light using a specific loss example. As always, our clients' confidentiality is our utmost priority, so I've taken one of our largest loss notifications and made the location and insured information generic. The risk is real estate-driven with a large location in downtown Manhattan and numerous locations in the region. Based on our modeling and post-event processes, we have identified 15 locations in the impacted areas. In total, the insured value for the entire schedule is over $1 billion, and XL's full loss limit is $250 million. As a result of our underwriting approach to flood, we provided $25 million flood supplement and we bought $15 million of facultative reinsurance covering flood and other perils.","In terms of damage, we do know the lower Manhattan location had substantial water in the basement and the recovery process at that location began on Wednesday of last week. We have adjusters at or on the way to all these locations. But at this point, we do not have a loss estimate. It is worth noting that business interruption and contingent business interruption losses resulting from flood are included within the flood limit and not in addition to this sublimit. In short, even in the worst-case scenario, our loss from this risk as a result of flood cannot exceed $10 million. Mike?","Michael S. Mcgavick","Thank you both. With that, we'll turn to our third quarter results. Our third quarter results are solid and in line with what we have been suggesting would happen.","Our margins expanded, resulting from 3 main drivers. First, and this pleases us most, is the fact that our underwriting operations on an ex-CAT ex-PYD basis provided the real substance of our improvement. With our Insurance segment delivering a 70 -- or excuse me a 94.7 ex-CAT ex-PYD combined ratio, this is directionally consistent with our work and what we're trying to do. We are delighted to see it coming through.","Second, we have fewer catastrophes in the quarter, which was of course helpful. This has been true at XL as it has been true around the industry, at least until Sandy.","And third, we have positive PYD. While it's relatively light in this quarter, it was a nice contributor. You'll recall that next quarter is the one in which we take a deep examination of our reserves, and we'll see what that reveals.","Of course, you'll want to know is this how we'll perform from now on. We'd say there's still work to do. But every day, we are moving further along. More of this positive trend is a result of our actions and less of it is fortuity. Still, we'd say that we are not done with our re-underwriting until we are regularly delivering a combined ratio of around 90%. Reinsurance continues to deliver, with an 86% combined ratio in the third quarter. While this is up from the nearly 79% combined ratio in the third quarter a year ago, only 5.4% of this difference is driven by the $26 million in crop losses, an amount in line with what we forecast to you in our second quarter call, in addition to some modest CAT activities. Crop, as we have previously discussed with you, also explains our lower reinsurance premiums written, reflecting the decision last year by a leading agricultural MGA to be purchased by another reinsurance firm.","All in, we reported an overall P&C combined ratio of 92.2%. This is 9 points better than our quarter 3 last year.","We had significant gains in our Investment Portfolio mark-to-market. And as a result, our fully diluted tangible book value per share is now at $32.82. This is up 7% in the quarter and is 16% higher than where we began the year. We think our 7.7% ROE for the year-to-date, given the overall economic environment and the lower turn on interest rates, is solid. Is it where I want -- is it we where we want it to be? No. But again, we're on the right path, and this is directionally consistent with everything we have shared with you.","So all of these indicators are pleasing us. At the same time, you would guess that -- we would guess that you might be curious about what is going on with the top line. This is a bit more complicated, so let me spend a moment on it, and then Greg and Jamie will expand on this further.","We did see good growth in the quarter when you take to account 3 factors that offset it. The first has been mentioned before, the crop book that was sold affecting reinsurance premiums written. Second was the impact of the re-underwriting of our European property operations, where we have been willing to shed underpriced business. And third, foreign exchange. Excluding these 3 factors, our overall growth rate was 5%, and we are growing strongly where we are profitable and thus remixing the business toward more profitable lines.","Turning briefly to pricing. We continue to see improvement across the vast majority of our lines, especially in Insurance. And this progress has accelerated in the quarter. In some lines, we are now seeing the compounding benefits of rate-on-rate year-over-year. So you can see that for the third quarter, XL had a terrific result, we're very pleased and we are driven to continue this kind of progress.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to discuss the financials in more detail.","Peter R. Porrino","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating income for the third quarter was $188 million or $0.61 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to operating income of $89 million or $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2011.","Our P&C combined ratio was 9.4 points better at 92.2% in the same quarter last year. Our accident year combined ratio was 94.7% or 8.3 points better than the same quarter last year due to a lower level of both CAT activity and non-CAT large losses.","Prior development in the quarter was a favorable $37 million or 2.5 loss ratio points, with $36 million of this favorable development attributable to the Reinsurance segment.","As we have outlined on previous earnings calls, Q3 is what we refer to as an actual versus expected quarter for our entire Insurance segment and our U.S. Reinsurance business. The $36 million redundancy in our Reinsurance segment in the quarter related to our non-U.S. Casualty and other shorter-tail Reinsurance businesses where we review reserves quarterly with more comprehensive assumption updates performed annually. We experienced positive movements in our property, marine and aviation lines.","Our operating expenses for the third quarter were up 23.4% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation costs and, to a lesser extent, certain severance costs and costs supporting our strategic initiatives. The overall operating expense increase is higher than the recent run rate almost exclusively due to the impact of improving financial results on our performance-based compensation plans and our pay-for-performance culture. We think this is exactly the right compensation philosophy to drive XL forward and incentivize and reward our colleagues.","It's important to note that in the third quarter of 2011, the exact opposite occurred and compensation costs were reduced due to the same performance-based measures. Excluding these variable compensation cost, we expect operating expense levels to be in line with what we have communicated to you since the fourth quarter of 2011 earnings call.","The total return of our investment portfolio was strong at 2.5% for the quarter. This contributed to book value growth, with a positive mark-to-market of $521 million. This is driven primarily by significant tightening of credit spreads most notably on our structured credit portfolios.","At $166 million net investment income on the P&C portfolio in the third quarter was 20.9% below the prior year due primarily to lower reinvestment rates. There was also significant decline in P&C net investment income of 11.7% from the second quarter. There were 4 primary drivers of this quarterly decline, 2 that you would expect based upon our published book yields: lower reinvestment rates between maturing bonds and new money rates and also higher cash levels held by us given the heightened tail risks emanating out of Europe over the summer.","Two other factors impacting this quarter's net investment income were reduced income on our inflation-protected portfolio due to lower inflation in Q2 and accelerated premium amortization on our agency mortgage-backed securities due to lower rates in an environment of ongoing quantitative easing.","We expect net investment income will remain under pressure given interest rate levels. The P&C gross book yield at the end of the quarter was 3%, down from 3.1% at the end of Q2. The average new money rate on our P&C portfolio was 1.9%. We estimate that approximately $3.8 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 3.2% will mature and paid down over the next 12 months. We've added further details on this in our financial supplement at the bottom of Schedule 3.","Our net invest -- our net income from investment affiliates was $9 million, down $15 million from the prior year. This was driven by a weak second quarter from our investment manager affiliates compared to strong results in the prior year quarter, which have benefited from the sale of our -- of one of our manager affiliates.","As previously discussed, our investment manager affiliate results are reported on a one-quarter lag. The alternative and private investment portfolios had satisfactory results.","Realized losses on investments were $6 million compared to realized losses of $62 million in the prior-year quarter. The third quarter results included $13 million in OTTI charges compared to $67 million in the prior-year quarter. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was lower than historical levels due to both several discrete items and a re-estimation of our expected full year effective tax rate from 12% to 11%.","We continue to buy back our ordinary shares, purchasing and canceling 5.3 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $23.44 in the third quarter. For the year-to-date, we have repurchased 16.2 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $21.63, leaving $400 million remaining available for purchase under the current program.","I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Pete. Tonight I'll cover the Insurance segment results for the quarter, the performance of certain businesses, recent talent changes and current market conditions.","Beginning with the results, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make measurable improvements, as our combined ratio for the quarter is 95.3% or 17 points lower than the same quarter last year. To put this into perspective, this is our best performance since the fourth quarter of 2008.","On the loss side, our reported loss ratio of 63.3%  was 19.2 points better than last year. Limited CAT activity accounts for 7.2 points of this improvement as we incurred $10 million in CAT losses during the quarter, largely from hurricane Isaac, compared to nearly $70 million in the third quarter of 2011.","Prior-year development accounts for 2.4 points of improvement as there was some strengthening in the third quarter of 2011 as opposed to a small release this quarter.","But most importantly, our current accident quarter loss ratio excluding CATs were 62.6%, improving by 9.6 points year-over-year. While much of this improvement is driven by very strong results in our North American and international property books, we continue to see measurable progress in many of our businesses. In fact, our accident core loss ratio, excluding large account property business, improved by 2.5 points year-over-year.","Given the inherent volatility in quarter results, it's important to note that our current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio stands at 66.5% through 3 quarters, an almost 7-point improvement over last year.","Insurance gross premiums written grew by $28 million or 2.5% in the quarter after normalizing for foreign exchange. This growth reflects continued success in our targeted new businesses such as Political Risk, North American Construction and E&S, as well as increase in opportunities in our core Hartford professional portfolio.","I'll say in this growth is our measured underlying discipline where we're reducing writings in those businesses with unacceptable margins such as guaranteed cost workers' compensation, international property and selected programs.","This leads into an update on the 7 businesses we have previously referred to as challenged. The combined ratio for the challenged portfolio in the quarter was 90.1%, benefiting from strong results in our international property book. Excluding international property, the combined ratio of the remaining challenged businesses was 103.3% on a calendar and accident year basis, which is an improvement of what we reported in the first and second quarters of this year.","This improvement reflects our continued execution of corrective underwriting actions, many of which we have discussed in previous quarters, as well as improved pricing of more than 5% this quarter. Both the challenge and the performing portfolios had improved accident quarter loss ratios relative to the second quarter of this year, as well as the third quarter of 2011.","It's important to note that while we continue to improve or surgically remove poor performing sublines, we are strategically growing other components of the challenged businesses such as property, railroad and umbrella lines in our E&S book, large risk management business in our North American primary casualty book, as well as new programs in our select professional portfolio.","As noted last quarter, to be in line with how we manage our businesses, we're going to shift our future discussions away from the collection of businesses we identified as challenged at the beginning of the year and going forward will focus on any sub-portfolio in any business that needs corrective action.","In particular, we've decided to close our upper middle-market business in North America. We have retained the portfolio of environmental-related property and casualty business, as well as a few accounts that will transition to a risk management policy. We will continue to write upper middle-market accounts in many of our businesses. But in particular, any clients that have growing international operations as our global network allows us to deliver a unique offering to the market.","Moving on to talent. We continued to enhance our teams throughout the segment. We added Chris Dougherty as CFO and David Vavrasek as Head of HR to our already strong Insurance leadership.","We appointed Ian Brandt [ph] as Chief Underwriting Officer of our IPC Property business, and he joined us in just 2 weeks. We added Alfred Bergbauer and Barbara Luck to our North America Primary Casualty management team. We also added underwriting talent to our marine team in Chicago, our international casualty team throughout Europe and the U.K. and we opened a new international upper middle-market underwriting office in Leon, France.","Finally, let's turn to current market conditions. In the third quarter, we saw a repeat of the second quarter, with positive rate indications in most of our businesses and overall segment rate increase of just over 3%. North American Property & Casualty continues to show the most strength, with rate increase by almost 8% led by double-digit rate increases in our Excess Casualty and E&S businesses. Our overall professional portfolio also had another solid quarter, with increases of nearly 3%.","In the quarter, 20 out of our 24 businesses generated rate increases, and the only disappointment was a 2% rate decrease in our international casualty portfolio. We remain convinced that positive rates is needed broadly, and in particular our long-tail lines of business, given persistently low investment returns.","In summary, I am proud of what our Insurance team has accomplished through 3 quarters. While a degree of fortuity helped, particularly in our short-tail portfolio, the hard work of the last year has already showed through in our improved results. However, we are still short of our ultimate goal and I can assure you that XL will continue to focus on underwriting diligence as expansion of margin continues to be our utmost priority.","And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.","James H. Veghte","Thanks, Greg. XL Re had a very good quarter with a combined ratio of 86%, producing an underwriting profit of $67 million. This compares to a combined of 78.8% in the third quarter of 2011. Our result was positively impacted by $35.7 million of prior-year reserve releases, which compares to $39.8 million a year ago.","Excluding the impact of both prior-year reserve releases and CAT losses, the segment had a combined ratio of 88%, which compares to the 80% achieved in the third quarter of 2011.","The quarter was also impacted by $26 million from the drought conditions impacting our U.S. crop portfolio. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, the 2 sources of exposure to the drought are from our U.S. and Bermuda profit centers. The loss in the quarter breaks down to $20 million of reserves for the Bermuda stop loss book and $6.1 million from our U.S.-based proportional book, specifically the Heartland Crop account.","In both cases, we've reserved the book at levels above the range as suggested by the impacted clients. We are confident that the potential for significant deterioration in the fourth quarter is unlikely.","Turning to top line. Gross written premiums in the quarter were $417 million, which compares to $619 million in the third quarter of last year. As we have advised, the Heartland program converted from a primary facility with significant reinsurance ceded to a reinsurance assumed treaty this year. So year-on-year gross written premium comparisons are misleading in this case.","If you use the net premium written from Heartland in 2011 to do a like-for-like comparison, our gross written premium last year would have been $436 million, so we reduced by 4% in the quarter year on year. This 4% drop was due to selected cancellations in the U.S. and Latin American portfolios. On a year-to-date basis, again adjusting Heartland in 2011 to the same treatment we currently have, our gross written premium would have moved from $1.73 billion to $1.85 billion this year, an increase of 6.9%.","Turning to market conditions. We spoke of our midyear renewals on last quarter's call and I would again describe them as satisfactory although, candidly, we did not get the level of risk adjusted improvement in the U.S. CAT book that we quoted and expected.","We've attended a number of industry conferences over the last 2 months, and the expectation until last week was for a reasonably smooth renewal season in the property CAT space, with the benign hurricane season potentially having some downward pressure on U.S. pricing.","With the impact of Sandy, there's now some question as to how the rest of the year will develop. If as we expect the upper end of the industry loss estimates becomes reality, I would have to expect year-end pricing to be impacted.","One of the characteristics of the CAT market is it responds very quickly to major market events. While there is abundant capacity available, the typical placement process on large accounts requires a clearing process on the pricing for market leaders to unlock this capacity fully. This is a heavily syndicated market and no one can forecast with precision what will take place at year end, but I suspect assumptions about year-end pricing have been adjusted over the course of the last week. Ours certainly has.","On the long-tail side, I would reiterate Greg's comments. While we see general improvement in the pricing environment based on our audit work and negotiations with clients, there remains plenty of room for additional progress before we would declare the market as rate-adequate based on in-current investment yields. In addition, we continue to see customers absorb additional retention, both vertically, through co-participation or in cases entire treaties dropped. During this particular quarter, our U.S. Casualty team lost an $11 million premium account due to the ceding company absorbing the entire treaty at renewal.","Overall, we are very pleased to produce an excellent underwriting result, and we look forward to an action active renewal season.","With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A.","David R. Radulski","Shirley, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jay Cohen with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One thing, just to confirm, the -- on the Reinsurance side, the CAT losses, those are separate from the crop losses?","James H. Veghte","Correct.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. Second, these are relatively short. The second question, the premiums in the business that you dropped, the upper to middle-market business on the Insurance side, what kind of premiums are we talking about there? Should we be adjusting our models for that?","Gregory S. Hendrick","It's Greg Hendrick. All in, when you keep the business that we wanted to keep, the environmental and the risk management components too, is about $50 million of premium. I don't think -- we will -- we are growing in other areas, I don't think that's a major number, but that's what the previous portfolio of pure middle-market North America business was.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's great. And then just last question. PC investment income. You'd obviously talked about some of those issues that impacted this quarter was a big drop off from the last quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about what an ongoing number looks like? How much of what you saw this quarter was unique to this quarter and would not be ongoing?","Peter R. Porrino","Sure, Jay. It\u2019s Pete. So let me break it into the 4 components that I spoke about. The drop in yields, I mean, that's going to continue to recur. That was about 1\/3 of the decrease. The adjustment on the fixed securities would have been another 1\/3. In essence, the inflation underlying that tips [ph] went from 1% in the prior quarter to just under 0 on average in the second quarter. So that was also about 1\/3. The agency amortization would have been a little bit less than a 1\/3. Again, it's -- I mean, I certainly can't predict what's going to happen, but it doesn't feel like they're going to -- rates are going to continue to drop enough to continue to change the amortization of those. And the last piece, which is the smallest one, was the cash and that cash is already being put back to work in the investment portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So just to clarify on the net investment income once again. Would this quarter's number be the run rate for the future? Or are you seeing that there was some onetime items in that?","Peter R. Porrino","So I would say it's not a run rate, the one caveat that I would give you is that there will be pressure on investment income just because of reduced yields, right. And so the number is going down quarter-to-quarter, but 3 out of the 4, I would say, were not run rate items. So I would expect it not to be -- it would not to be a run rate just make sure you think about the drop in yields and how that's going to flow through.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure. So you're saying that the base number is slightly higher. But from that level, we'll have a lower investment income going forward? I mean, is that the way to think about it?","Peter R. Porrino","It would be higher than the $166 million certainly, right? But at the same time, there will be continued pressure on the net investment income.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Good, that's helpful. The second question is for Hurricane Sandy, and thanks for giving some detail on the Reinsurance program. But trying to wrap my head around on the primary Insurance operations last year for Hurricane Irene, you had about a $200 million gross loss, about $100 million net loss. Just want to get a sense for -- where things are right now the industry loss estimate is about $20 billion for Sandy. It was about $4.3 billion for Irene. Simplistically, just multiplying it by 4 seems too simple. Can you help us understand how we should think of scaling it?","Gregory S. Hendrick","This is Greg Hendrick. First of all, Vinay, you can't scale it. Every event is a unique event, the pattern of the storm, where the exposures are, where the water piles up, in this particular case, unfortunately for so many people. But let me give you a little bit of color, so hope I can explain why I think these are totally unrelated. First, the $200 million and $100 million was from Irene and Lee combined, both. There was -- there were a bit losses that triggered out of Lee that because of all the saturation from Irene produced flooding. Second, it was dominated by 2 large corporate insurance where we were the lead carrier. In other words, we issued 100% of the policy in the United States. We booked as gross the 100% loss from those locations and then cede off to the captive or the coinsurers a portion of that loss. As of this point in time, there aren't any notifications that look anything like what we had on those 2 losses in Irene and Lee. Clearly very early days, that's not a promise or commitment. It's just what the facts are as I have them at the moment. So those are couple of reasons why you really can't draw parallels from one to the other.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I actually was hoping we could step back from hurricane Sandy and just kind of get some big picture comments thinking about the quarter. 7% ROE probably not where you want to be, but the combined ratio is actually, kind of where you are, is not bad at all. So can we talk about steps, longer term, to get you to a cost of capital?","Michael S. Mcgavick","Yes, this is Mike. Clearly, as I said in my comments, 7.7% ROE is not where we want to be. We do think that the -- that it's critical to continue to expand our margins so that we can get back to double-digit ROEs. And that's very much the drive we are on. We have said that we thought we could drive meaningful margin expansion in this quarter and that we thought we could get through more acceptable returns on an absolute and relative basis in the next year. To me, this quarter is a very much in line with that thinking. We've shown a continued willingness to buy a bit more back in on the capital side than we had forecasted at the beginning of the year, which is in line with the stronger earnings we've been able to deliver. We have been able to continue to drive down the combined ratio, particularly in our Insurance operation, where it was not where we wanted, and we very much like the trend there as well especially when combined with what we're seeing in rate across the book. So taken as a whole, these are exactly the actions that we expected to be able to get us back to the levels you described. And there's nothing that I would change in what we're doing to deliver that result. We just have to keep at it with real rigor and real discipline. And then as we work our way back through the book and get the chance at the rate that we've been describing we're getting, the math starts to continue to change in the direction we all desire. So we're very pleased.","Peter R. Porrino","Paul, it's Pete. I'd only add that as these marks continue to -- bad choice of words, but pile up, it's just hitting us and everyone else in the industry. It is going to get tougher and tougher to achieve the corporate ROEs that we've talked about because those were all been sort of ex-AOCI [ph] and the numbers that we're publishing included.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Fair enough. But is this -- could you talk about maybe just as we think about getting to cost of capital, is rate or how much is it rightsizing the business relative to the capital?","Michael S. Mcgavick","I'm going to give you a couple of general comments and then I'll call any of my colleagues to add. The most important thing from our point of view, the thing that we have to make our true north star is our underwriting results. We are driven at this company operating somewhere around 90% as a combined ratio. We believe that is achievable. We believe that we're working on exactly the right things to deliver that. Once you get there, it's possible, I suppose, that the continued diminishment of investment yield, it's slow erosion, combined with if it were to continue, continued adding of capital due to marks, you could get to an equation that doesn't get you there, but I'd be a bit surprised by that. In the end, with the marks having reversed themselves so severely, it seems to me that that's going to be pretty fluid. You still have Europe pouncing around out there. And somewhere out there, who knows where or with what impetus, you're going to have some kind of normalization around interest rates. So we have to plan our life around what we can control. And our best things to control are continuing, as we have said, to not add to capital, it's not our intention over time. And then, at the same time, experience profitable growth at the kinds of levels which we have described here. And at the same time, get ourselves to kind of a nice combine. I think that equation is a very healthy equation over time. And that's what we continue to do bit by bit. But I don't think where we are calls for any change. It calls for continuing to do what we know we're doing.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In regards to the LIBOR issue, we know that at least one reinsurer put up IBNR reserves due to casualty class reinsurance policies. Do you have an updated view on potential LIBOR claims? And related, have reserves been increased in international lines which are exposed to LIBOR? And I have one follow-up.","Michael S. Mcgavick","Yes, Mike, I'll comment. Generally, you've seen some information in the marketplace about programs in recent calls, I know. Just to be clear, we are not participants in those types of programs. Obviously, we write and write a good book direct D&O exposure. And I'm going to turn it over to Greg to comment on our particular book and what -- frankly, we're not seeing it.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, I'll be brief. Mike, as I said last quarter, there's so many variables that play here. We are just -- we're not able to give an estimate of losses. But what loss there is to be covered is very uncertain, as well as how the coverages might apply. We are in the process through the fourth quarter reserve review that we are going down and diving into each insured, the potential exposure and our coverage around it. And we'll work through the process as we go through the fourth quarter. Of course I would not hold that out. There was a promise that we will have it solved in the fourth quarter completely, but that is a process we're going through at the moment. There's unfortunately no update at this time other than we're not able to put out certain number around it.","Michael S. Mcgavick","I would just add that from the time of the financial crisis in 2008 because of the unusual circumstances in line with what we have learned over the years, going back to Sarb-Ox and so on, we have maintained the clash load. We maintained it through Madoff. We've maintained -- and then it seems like every couple of years the industry seems to give us something else to maintain it for. That clash load currently is around 20 points on the loss ratios in that segment of our business. And whether LIBOR will in fact take a bite out of that, it's hard at this stage to tell. It's just -- when you're looking at it risk by risk rather than as a clash event, it is very hard to know how this will play out.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And lastly for Pete, the tax rate looked low this quarter, what drove that? And should we -- what should we think about for 4Q if Sandy losses come through?","Peter R. Porrino","So as I said in the call, there were -- it was a series of discrete items and then it take down from 12% to 11% for the annualized -- for the expectation for the annual, right. So that would be the number that we would say we would have expected for the fourth quarter. It would have been the 11% rather than the 12%. And the other difference would have been discrete items. We settled an open exam favorably and a couple of other smaller items. The complication here, of course, is the way -- is the right question on Sandy, right, and what does this mean. It all has to do with what legal entities the business resides in. So to the extent that the losses would be predominantly in Bermuda, that would take our effective tax rate up for the quarter, right, because we'd have losses without any tax benefit. To the extent that they're in taxable jurisdictions, it would have less of that negative impact. So I can't -- since we don't know what the Sandy losses are, we surely don't know what they are by legal entities. So it's too soon to tell. My expectation all in is that it will drive our effective tax rate up. But to how much, that I can't say.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So this point, given the uncertainty around Sandy, I mean, how are you thinking about buybacks for the fourth quarter and kind of capital deployment in that sense? And I imagine it's sort of a wait-and-see or does this kind of your capital deployment program sort of supersede that? And there's just one follow-up.","Peter R. Porrino","So this is Pete, Mike. So if you go back and look, certainly over the last year or so, you have seen that it is -- we have tried to be consistent with our buyback program. We are very, very comfortable with our capital levels. So we have bought back in quarters when other companies don't, right, when suppose they win quarters. And we've also bought back -- if you look at last year, we bought back $670 million of stock, and that we had significant catastrophe losses impacting our results. So we don't see any -- as of now we don't see this as a stop buybacks.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's really helpful. And then I have one question. I mean, in terms of -- I mean, there's obviously another storm potentially coming, who knows what sort of impact it will have, but I have one question about business interruption. If you have a business interruption event from the last storm. And then before that's cleared, you have another event, how do you account for or how does the industry account for the time if the second event delays the interruption period?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Mike, it's Greg Hendrick. Certainly the answer is going to depend on policy by policy, what the form says. We have some policies written under our own form. We have some business written on broker manuscript forms, and we have some of our smaller businesses in E&S and programs where each policy is slightly different. In general, the history has been that when you're not able to differentiate between the damage that was caused and it's exacerbating existing damage, that will be picked up as part of the original loss event. But it will be a case-by-case, and we saw it in 2004 in Florida with all the intersecting storms. It became more and more difficult to determine what loss went to what storm. You did the best you can and get the adjusters out there as fast as you can, to set the baseline. But by and large, it goes back to the original event if it extends the waiting period.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just one last one maybe for Mike on -- you mentioned the 90% combined ratio goal and you talked about a double-digit ROE. I just kind of looking at the numbers, I find it hard to get to a double-digit ROE with a 90% combined overall. And then maybe I'm just doing something wrong, but is it -- if it's not yield, because the investment income is kind of what it is, is it operating leverage or some other -- is there another lever that allows those 2 kind of data points to meet?","Michael S. Mcgavick","I already answered it. It is operating leverage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Burns with Lane McLaney [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Quickly on your accident year loss ratio, excluding CATs, in the Insurance segment, where there any takedowns from first half of 2012 reserves?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, there was. We had booked, based on what we had seen at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, particularly on our short-tail lines, what we thought was an appropriate loss ratio on the Property business roughly speaking was about 3 points in the quarter for Q1 and Q2.","Unknown Analyst","For Q1 and Q2. Okay, got you. And then, I guess quickly, I guess holistically, obviously, with rate increases and lower loss cost inflation, as well as I guess re-underwriting the books, is there a targeted on accident year loss ratio? Or where is your target, or I guess where's the ultimate goal? Where can you guys drive this do you think?","Michael S. Mcgavick","Well, on a combined overall, we're seeking to push down to 90. When we budget around here, we don't count in PYD. The losses in the past we have reserved to what we think is appropriate, and then it develops as it develops. So when we set our budgets, we have in mind an accident year 90 is the target that we're driving towards.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Pete, can I get one more clarification on the rest of income, I'm still a little confused. The inflation impact in MBS, are you -- it seems you're saying those were sort of catch-ups and that's why they're not run rate going forward? I mean, I would think of inflation is lower going forward too.","Peter R. Porrino","No. So separate -- I'll have Sarah chime in here, but separate the tips adjustment from the agency-backed ones. So the tips adjustment is whatever the inflation rate was in the prior quarter, rolls through that income. So if inflation is 1%, right, you get a certain amount of return, and at 0% you get another amount of return. For us, that delta was about $8 million in the current quarter.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","And why wouldn't it be $8 million again next quarter if inflation stays low? Inflation is not rebounding.","Peter R. Porrino","Well, because -- so quarter-to-quarter we've already recognized the fact that it was at 0. So if it's at 0 again next quarter, the quarter-to-quarter delta would be 0 because it depends.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it. So there's a catch-up then. Okay, got it. And the MBS is similar, it's a onetime adjustment. If it stays where it is, it's not going to cause an incremental?","Peter R. Porrino","If it stays where it is, it would not cause an incremental.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Perfect, okay. And then Jamie, on the $20 billion or more estimate on Sandy, do have any thoughts on personal versus commercial break down of that?","James H. Veghte","Yes. I mean, you've seen a lot of commentary out there that's suggesting it's sort of 60-40, personal and commercial. My own view is that in the end it's going to grow to be more of commercial lines loss than personal. So again, my opinion only flip it, say 60-40 commercial to personal.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Interesting. And then on pricing impact. Obviously, I can understand why you would drive pricing in the Northeast and on national accounts or Northeast-heavy. Do you think it's going to have much of an impact on sort of regional Florida-only, Gulf-only type capacity as well?","James H. Veghte","Who knows, Ian? All I can say is that, as I said before, there was a lot of discussion earlier in the fall in the convention circuit about downward pressure on U.S. rates. And again, as I said, it's a heavily syndicated market. A couple of bad actors can't keep rates down. I just simply think that people are going to reevaluate where their pricing will be now that we've had this episode. And I'm not sure I can forecast what it's going to do region by region. Just suffice it to say that the atmosphere has changed over the last week.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it. And Greg, would you mind answering a question from an insurance perspective? The Fortune 100-type property accounts, I assume, will get pricing. Anything beyond that you're think about at this point?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Well, I think Mike touched on it. Anything with a great deal of uncertainty on the tail will have to be reexamined and looked at and gives you more confidence to your underwriters to go out and seek those rate increases that we need to get. We've had a lot of momentum in our E&S line of business. We expect that to continue now, but it will be a case-by-case. What is of interest to me, Ian, is the read through the -- through to long-tail lines, to everybody starts to wake up that we've been in this low investment return period that we're pricing the risk probably below where we need to be at, and then we get a little more oomph behind that momentum as well. But time will tell.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMC.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jamie, first question for you, just a comment you made on retention. I mean, if you're not the only company to mention that retention trend, to some extent it feels like it's been ongoing for the last several years or just maybe not gotten as many headlines on the casualty side as perhaps on the property side where people were doing it more to mitigate spend and balance out rate increases when they were thinking about purchasing. So I guess with companies having -- being more comfortable writing that business and prices going up, is this a trend you expect to continue to see on the reinsurance side? And if so, should we think about there's something that's coming disproportionately from kind of the large nationwide-type writer? Or is this something you worry about spilling in maybe into some of the smaller regional companies who we might normally think about as more consistent in their buying?","James H. Veghte","I worry less so about those companies, Matthew. They tend to be more conservative in their balance sheet management. But clearly, with larger companies, the retention trend has been there for 5 years or so. And frankly, if you look at loss cost and so forth that hasn't been an irrational decision. I do think we'll have opportunities to write business going forward. There is always new opportunities, companies going into new lines of business trying to buy reinsurance as they ramp up. But I don't view large account, casualty reinsurance, as something that may necessarily bounce back as hard as it has in other past hardening markets.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then when we think about your book at like what percentage of the book is kind of safe versus -- and in plays, so a little bit too dramatic of a word. But is probably -- what part of your book is immune versus to be determined as your going out.","James H. Veghte","Well, let's talk about what happened to our casualty book overall over the last 5 years, and it's for a variety of reasons. And I would say retention is probably been not the biggest one, frankly. The largest recently has gotten smaller, it's because we just don't like the return profile of the portfolio. So we are down, really, particularly in the U.S., to those companies that we believe in the long run have a good earnings potential based on their underwriting expertise and so forth. I don't view those accounts as necessarily more at risk by increased retention. It's not the very, very, very largest national writers. It's a variety of companies. But we produce the portfolio more around return profiles than retention, although retention has been an issue.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And I guess part of my rational for asking this was just I want to get a sense, right. We've seen some business remixing over the last couple of years, which had a net favorable impact on loss ratio and also risk-adjusted return, we would argue. So I guess is that potentially -- is that trend, which I had kind of thought about being potentially played out, is there potentially more room to go there?","James H. Veghte","I'm not sure. We're going to have to see how the market evolve. We love the Casualty business. It's just been -- based on our -- the way we price the business, which is a very realistic view of primary rates coupled with duration matching, the liability profile of that book against investment profile, it's just hasn't been as attractive as the short-tail lines business over the last 4, 5 years. It's not to say it can't come back. If we go back -- again, we've said this before, there's a big difference from the way we view rate adequacy on a CAT book and the way we view it on the Casualty book. And the Casualty market, we're attached to the hip to the primary market because we are writing quote sharing insurance working, et cetera. I don't necessarily -- again, I don't necessarily think we're predisposed to go one way or another. We remix the business based -- the book of business, based on what we see out there. It's just so happened over the last 5 years, shortening the tail of the book has been the only rational way forward as we've seen it.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's fair. And then just on the -- I guess for Greg, just on the short-tail book impact on the first half loss re-estimation, I wasn't quite sure since you've said short-tail specific, how I should translate that just into the quarter, if you could bottom line that. And then would that be all the favorable year-over-year impact you talked about in the short tail? Or was there any other kind of frequency benefit as well?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure. The impact in the quarter from Q1 and Q2 is about 3 points. So we had 3 points better performance based on the reserve that we have put up for Q1 and Q2 on the short-tail lines. There isn't anything else that comes to mind that would have impacted the loss ratio significantly.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Okay. So in the press release, when you talk about improved large loss activity year-over-year, that's -- I should think about that tying directly to 300.","Michael S. Mcgavick","300?","Gregory S. Hendrick","To 3 points.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","To the 300 basis point improvement, yes.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, sorry. Yes, 300 basis points, yes.","Operator","Our final question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So listen, I'd love to just get a sense. When you think about suggesting that your intuition has the modeled estimates rising to $20 billion or so level in the industry, sort of playing out at that level, is there anything in your data that's driving that? Or is this just sort of your intuition having sort of seen this story before in thinking about the various biases of the models with respect to [indiscernible]","James H. Veghte","Josh, it's largely intuition. But based on what we've [indiscernible]","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Then the final question, I think this is probably for Greg. A very helpful example of a typical policy. I was just trying to make sure I understood. So you suggested, I think, that the gross sublimit was $25 million for a $1 billion schedule of insured value? Is that per-facility charge? Or is that for the entire customer and all the potential flood exposures, only $25 million?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Josh, it was $250 million gross sublimit for all risks. It's $25 million flood for all locations sublimit.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So hypothetically...","Gregory S. Hendrick","And then we further bought that down with facultative reinsurance of $15 million down to $10 million.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I see. So as a practical matter, when a policy like that, assuming it's not all non-wage and you'd be thinking of that the $10 million -- for net to you guys, $10 million of exposure, but you might see an industry loss associated with something like hypothetically a $25 million in each of the facilities assuming they all weren't in the same place is the right way to think about how that might that stack up?","Gregory S. Hendrick","$25 million across all the locations, not each and every.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I'm sorry to be slow here, but so you're saying that even with all $1 billion of exposure, there would only be sort of 2.5% of the total amount would be available for flood even if multiple exposures were impacted -- or multiple locations?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Correct. And Josh, sorry to interrupt, let me -- I just want to make sure I'm clear. This is an example from the largest loss notification that we have so far. So it is not meant to be typical of the risks that we have reported as part of the $175 million, right? This is the largest of the bunch. So don't read across $10 million each and every loss notification.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, actually I was impressed it was so small.","Michael S. Mcgavick","I think you\u2019re listening [ph] now, Josh.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, is that the net -- is this what's driving -- is this driving your thought that people are going to come out of this and feel like they've been underinsured and even large commercial accounts that probably thought they were on top of these issues?","Gregory S. Hendrick","This is certainly a case for the large commercial business. The personal lines, which of course is the more tragic of the story because it affects so many more people, is a combination of what's going to be covered by the flood program, what's going to be covered by private carriers. And when that's all added up, how much of the loss will actually be reimbursed by some form of insurance.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. And just for clarity, this would cover business interruption and similar purchases, CBI, where you sell that as well?","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","As a result of -- of losses resulting from flood, yes.","Operator","And at this time, I'll turn the call back over to speakers for closing remarks.","Michael S. Mcgavick","Well, it's a feeling I've had many times in our industry, and I know those of us at this table are feeling it now. It's a strange set of emotions, on one hand we were looking very much forward to reporting this quarter to you because it is -- it speaks, I think, well to the progress that the firm is making and the trajectory that we're on. At the same time we have this new event, and that event has a number of really terrible elements that we're watching around the region and even some in this room are experiencing, so it's a difficult effect. But at the same time, we just want to give you our views because as clearly as we could. We appreciate that you've been patient with us with respect to Sandy. I've just -- it isn't that much that one can know at this stage. And we can promise that we will be back to you as soon as we feel confident we have our arms around it with as much clarity as we can give.","So thank you very much for your time tonight, and we look forward to paths crossing soon.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David R. Radulski","","Thank you, Shirley, and welcome to XL Group's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlgroup.com. We've posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement.","On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO, will offer opening remarks; Pete Porrino, XL's Chief Financial Officer will review our financial results; followed by Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions. Among those also available for questions are Susan Cross, our Global Chief Actuary; Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer and Steve Robb, our Controller.","Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates, and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.","Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified on our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date at which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments, or otherwise.","With that, I'll turn it over to, Mike McGavick.","Michael S. McGavick","Good evening. Tonight, we are pleased to discuss XL's second quarter results. Results with intermediaries have us greatly encouraged, and make no mistake. We are not yet where we want to be across the board, but our actions are taking hold and we are beginning to see emerge the target book we have discussed with you before. So while our work continues in absolute and relative terms this is a very solid quarter.","To give you a sense of what you can expect from this call. First, I'm going to give you a high-level look at these results, including a brief discussion of our reserve releases, I'll then briefly touch on pricing in the quarter, and then we'll turn to two noteworthy topics; the effect of drought impacting so much of the United States and the developing issues around LIBOR. I'll then turn it over to Pete for a closer discussion of our financial results and to Greg and Jamie to get more granular on our insurance and reinsurance performance.","Now, first to our overall results. As you saw in our release for the second quarter we reported fully diluted operating earnings of $0.71 per ordinary share and an annualized operating ROE of 9.1%. Again, this is a solid result, especially at this point in the cycle and at this point in XL's improvement. All of this translates to fully diluted tangible book value per ordinary share of $30.65, which is up 3.6% in the second quarter and 8.3% higher than where we began the year. We improved our loss and combined ratios in both insurance and reinsurance and reported a total P&C combined ratio of 90.8% more than four percentage points better than the second quarter last year.","And most notably, our insurance results continued their recent improvement. The Insurance segment combined ratio ex-cat, ex-PYD improved 98.5%, which is obviously still higher than we would like, but trending in the right direction.","It is also good to observe that this is the sixth consecutive quarter in which insurance produced a better accident year loss ratio ex-cats. So, as I say, we are delivering on the margin expansion, we expected. Meanwhile, Reinsurance delivered a combined ratio of 72.6%, another really stellar result.","Turning briefly to pricing; broadly, we continue to see improvement across the vast majority of our lines, especially in insurance and this progress has accelerated through the quarter.","On reserving, as you'll recall, the second quarter is one in which we regularly perform an in-depth reserve review, and you've already noted in our materials this review again resulted in sizable releases totaling $101 million a positive development in the quarter.","Now I'll touch on a couple of issues of note. First, with respect to the ongoing drought conditions; as you'll recall our exposure to risks in crop insurance have reduced over recent years, and while we do have some exposure that exposure is manageable and even in extreme conditions for us being unpleasant, but modest earnings event. Jamie will have more detail. Second with respect to LIBOR, I know there are a lot of questions on this topic, particularly as we are [writing] of relevant coverage both in the U.S. and abroad. Unfortunately, the reality is it's just too early to tell how this will play out.","And finally, I do want to recognize one change in our leadership team that's the addition of Eileen Whelley as our new Chief Human Resources Officer. Eileen has a deep resume, including top HR leadership positions both inside and outside of the Insurance sector and she is already taking a principal role in our ongoing mission to build on what I truly believe is the most talented group of risk professionals in the industry.","So, as I said at the start, we are encouraged by the results we've reported today. They demonstrate our continued progress and are directly tied to our focus on improving margins, while meeting the needs of our clients.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to discuss the financials in more detail.","Peter R. Porrino ","Thanks, Mike and good evening. Operating income for the second quarter was $222 million or $0.71 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to operating income of $243 million or $0.75 a share in the second quarter of 2011.","Fully diluted tangible book value per share grew $1.07 in the quarter and $2.34 year-to-date. Our P&C combined ratio was 4.1 points better at 90.8% in the same quarter last year. Our accident year ex-cat combined ratio was 93.7% or 5.7 points better than the same quarter last year, due to a reduction in non-cat large loss activity. Our Catastrophe losses decreased by $8 million from the second quarter of 2011 and totaled $61 million in Q2 2012, mostly in the Insurance segment.","Top line growth was slower in the quarter due to the impact of FX in certain areas of targeted non-renewal. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange the Insurance segment gross premiums written increased by 4.2% and the Reinsurance segment decreased by 3.4%. The same percentages on a net premiums written basis were an 8.1% increase for insurance and a 1.9% decrease for reinsurance. The Insurance segment movement includes a positive shift in business mix towards top performing lines, which Greg will expand on. The reinsurance decrease is due primarily to selective cancellations and the timing of renewals.","During the second quarter we completed our normal semiannual detailed review covering virtually all of our loss reserves across our Property and Casualty business lines. There were no material changes in approach or methodology. Prior year development in the quarter was a favorable $101 million or 7.2 loss ratio points. This reflects favorable development of $43 million and $58 million in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments respectively. ","Positive movements came from the Casualty and U.S. Professional Insurance lines, as well as casualty reinsurance lines, partially offset by strengthening mainly in Insurance International Professional, and excess and surplus lines. You will note that our interest expense for deposit liability accretion in the consolidated statements of income in the financial supplement increased by $19 million this quarter. This is due to an annual review of our runoff structured products business, which resulted in higher interest charges due to changes in expected cash flow timing on certain structured workers compensation contracts that are accounted for as deposits.","The net loss this quarter related to that reserve review was less than $10 million since there was positive reserve development on contracts accounted for as reinsurance. That positive PYD is included in the $58 million, I previously mentioned for the Reinsurance segment.","Our combined $299 million of operating expenses for the second quarter was up 12.4% or $33 million year-over-year. This is on track with the full-year expectations we communicated earlier in the year. The year-over-year increase arose principally from cross supporting our strategic initiatives and higher compensation costs from both, growth and headcount associated with new business initiatives and certain severance costs. ","At $188 million net income on the P&C portfolio in the second quarter was 12.2% below the prior year, due primarily to lower new money rates, as well as cash outsourced from the investment portfolio.","The P&C gross book yield at the end of the quarter was 3.1%. We achieved an average new money rate on our P&C portfolio in the quarter of 2.2%. We expect net investment income will remain under pressure given interest rate levels and our estimate that approximately $3.4 billion of P&C assets with an average gross book yield of 2.8% will mature and paid down over the next 12 months.","Our net income from investment affiliates was $17 million, down $34 million from the prior year. This is driven by an especially strong prior year quarter from our investment management affiliates compared to solid results this quarter.","Realized losses on investments were $12 million compared to realized losses of $10 million in the prior year quarter. Our realized losses include $28 million in OTTI charges, which is consistent with the prior year quarter.","The total return of our entire portfolio was 1.4% for the quarter and contributed to book value growth with the positive mark-to-market of $131 million. This was driven by decreasing rates, particularly in the U.S. which were partially offset by widening credit spreads.","The P&C fixed income duration decreased by 0.2 years from the end of the first quarter to 2.9 years due to the accumulation of cash and cash equivalents in the portfolio given the heightened risks associated with the continuing turmoil in Europe, at least the end of the first quarter the life portfolio duration increased by 0.1 years to 8.6 years.","Our fixed income holdings in Eurozone countries are again listed in our financial supplement. We continue to have negligible exposure to sovereigns, and financial institutions in the peripheral countries. Our $400 million exposure to Eurozone banks, including $143 million in covered bonds remains largely to national champions in northern Europe. Through targeted sales and maturities, we reduced our Eurozone holdings by $173 million during the quarter, principally in the financial sector.","We bought back $125 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter purchasing and canceling 6.1 million ordinary shares at an average cost of $20.44, leaving $525 million available for purchase under the current program. We continue to balance new business opportunities with the attractive economics associated with share repurchases and we are not looking to add to our surplus capital position.","I'll now turn it over to Greg to discuss our Insurance segment results.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks, Pete and good evening. Tonight I'll cover the Insurance segment results for the quarter, provide an update on the corrective actions we're taking in our challenged businesses, comment on our recent talent changes and provide a summary of current market conditions.","Starting with results, I'm happy to share that we made progress again this quarter both on profitable growth and more importantly on continued improvement in accident year combined ratio. And while I'm pleased with our improved performance, we remain focused on operating Insurance segment at a lower combined ratio.","Insurance segment's combined ratio, excluding cat and prior year development of 98.5% improved by 5 points relative to second quarter of last year, driven primarily by the current year loss ratio. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 99.1% or 1.2 points higher than the same quarter last year, driven by 1.6 point increase in the operating expense ratio. This is largely due to increased compensation costs related to continued upgrades in our talent as well as expansion in a number of our businesses.","On the loss side, the current accident loss ratio excluding cats was 65.8% improving by 6.8 points year-over-year. As Mike mentioned, this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improved accident quarter ex-cat results.","Our reported loss ratio of 66.2% reflected cat activity of 4.9 points as the second quarter of 2012 was impacted by $49 million in cat losses and reinstatement premiums compared to only $13 million in the second quarter of 2011. This was largely driven by a single risk loss in each of the Midwest tornadoes and the China earthquakes. This cat activity is partially offset by prior year reserve releases of $43 million or 4.5 points in the quarter compared to $64 million last year.","Insurance gross premiums written grew by $114 million or 8.9% in the quarter after normalizing for foreign exchange and the planned non-renewal of one large foreign account. While this growth reflects success in our targeted new businesses, such as political risk and North America construction we also had strong growth in some of our higher-margin businesses including U.S. Professional and Marine & Offshore Energy.","The second topic is an update on the businesses that we have been referring to as challenged. The combined ratio for the challenged businesses in the quarter was 125.7% and in the remainder of our book we reported a 90.6 combined ratio. Prior year reserve changes namely strengthening in the challenged businesses and releases in the performing businesses explained much of this variance.","If you look at performance on an accident year basis, excluding cats, the second quarter combined ratio in the challenged business drops to 105.6%, while the remainder of the book reported 96.2% combined ratio. As we indicated earlier in the year, the quarterly improvement of the challenged businesses will have some volatility given the nature of large risk insurance.","Our shift towards businesses with the higher margin has resulted in the challenged businesses representing a smaller portion of the segment. In fact for the second quarter on a net premium written basis, adjusted for foreign exchange, challenged businesses shrunk by 11%, while performing businesses grew by 15% as compared to this quarter last year. This was not by accident.","Some of the corrective actions we discussed last quarter. Management of cat capacity, deemphasizing guaranteed cost, workers compensation and re-underwriting our New York contractors\u2019 general liability portfolio are having the intended consequences from a top line perspective. And we expect the benefits from our activities will lead to continued margin expansion with time.","Clearly, we still have work to do, but with new leaders and disciplines in place for many of these businesses we\u2019re confident that we are implementing the right strategies to turn these books around.","Moving on to talent, we further enhanced our teams throughout this segment in the quarter. We added to our already strong insurance leadership with the arrival of Jason Harris, Head of International Property and Casualty. We expanded our regional excess casualty team with the addition of new underwriting talent in Dallas, Philadelphia and Kansas City. We recruited a cyber liability team with underwriters in New York, Atlanta and Chicago. We also broadened our E&S capabilities by adding umbrella and excess casualty underwriting expertise. In our distribution network team added new talent to improve our local presence in Mexico and Spain.","Finally, let's turn to current market conditions. In the second quarter we once again saw positive rate indications in all of our business groups, with an overall segment rate increase of 4%. To put this in a context, we haven\u2019t seen a rate increase of this magnitude since 2003. Further 20 out of 24 businesses in the Insurance segment saw large rate increases in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter of this year. Not only did we see 6% rate increases in our North American P&C portfolio, led by double-digit rate increases in our property and E&S businesses, but our international P&C portfolio was also up nearly 3%.","In specialty lines, we saw an increase of 5% led by marine and offshore energy, and in our professional book rates were up 2%, including 3% in our U.S. D&O business. As we indicated last quarter, this return to gradual sustained rate improvement is something we've been expecting and we believe it must continue given the industry's insufficient investment returns, particularly in long tail lines of business.","And while we are pleased with these pricing improvements, we still face a competitive marketplace where underwriting experience and discipline coupled with improved analytics, are critical to selecting the best risks. While rate continues to be a very important factor, expansion of margin is our ultimate measure of success.","And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance results.","James H. Veghte ","Thanks, Greg, and good evening. The Reinsurance segment had an excellent quarter of underwriting results with a combined ratio of 72.6%, producing an underwriting profit of $120.9 million. These results were impacted by prior year reserve releases of $58.4 million and cat losses in the quarter of $11.2 million, net of reinstatement premiums. Excluding the impact of these items, our combined ratio was 83.2%, which compares favorably to the combined of 90% in the second quarter of last year on the same basis.","During this quarter, $46.6 million of prior year releases were released from our U.S. business unit which does a major reserve review in the second and fourth quarters of each year. While $34.9 million of these releases were from casualty lines, we remain very cautious on recent underwriting years and the majority of these releases were from the 2005 underwriting years and prior.","On a year-to-date basis, this segment has a combined ratio of 77.4%, which compares to the 112% combined last year. Excluding the impact of cat losses and prior year development, the six month combined of 85.9% compares favorably to the 88.9% in 2011.","With respect to top line, gross premiums written in the quarter were $452.4 million, a 4.2% reduction from the second quarter of 2011. Our year-on-year premium saw reductions in our North American, European and Latin American business units and a significant increase from XL Re Bermuda driven by increases in our Japanese cat portfolio and a changed inception date on one large treaty. The reductions in our other profit centers were driven by selective cancellations, share reductions and some timing differences.","Turning to market conditions, we were broadly pleased with the mid-year renewals, though the rate of increase on Southeast wind renewals were below our expectations. Our risk-adjusted improvement on this book was 5% below the 8% to 10% we expected and quoted going into the renewal season. There was abundant capacity available in both traditional and non-traditional forms to play substantial programs in the market. ","Notwithstanding this we would point out that this is a portfolio that had a very healthy increase in the 2011 mid-year renewal and remains the most attractive component of our cat portfolio as measured by rate adequacy in our pricing system. On the long-tail side our position remains highly defensive as we continue to navigate through an improving, but still competitive primary and reinsurance market environment.","Finally with respect to our crop book you'll recall 2011 was our final year as the fronting carrier for the Heartland Crop program due to the sale of the agency. We continued this year as a quota share reinsurer of the new owner and through the second quarter this year we have booked $11.6 million of net earned premium at a technical combined ratio of 82.7%, which does not include operating expenses. This was driven principally by the solid performance of the winter weak component of the portfolio. Our projected premium for the year is $58 million from this source and we do protect the book with stop-loss reinsurance attaching at a loss ratio of 110%, we buy 40 points to cover with 5% co-participation up the pillar.","In addition, we write a book of aggregate stop-loss business on this class out of our Bermuda business unit. There our total aggregate limits are $41 million with just over 50% of the book attaching that loss ratios of 130% or higher.","With that, I'll turn it over to David for Q&A.","David R. Radulski","Shirley, please open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks and good afternoon. Mike before everyone goes out and starts raising their estimates dramatically that insurance combined ratio underlying of 98.5%, I think it was the best in eight quarters. What\u2019s your expectation in terms of being able to repeat that level going forward?","Michael S. McGavick","Well. First, Jay thanks for the question. Your perspective is a good one. I think I mentioned on our call last quarter that well I feel that things are going directionally correctly and we\u2019re very pleased with the progress. If I go back kind of in the fourth quarter, I felt that well some of the long-term issues in some of the challenged businesses were coming home to roost, that we were actually a bit on the unlucky side. ","In the sense that a lot of stuff all happened at once, and I think I would put this quarter in the same context in the reverse. I think this was a favorable quarter. I think, at this point we are well on the way in a lot of the corrective actions we\u2019ve undertaken and we would expect results to be improving and we have said so. Could this one have been a bit luckier just as the fourth quarter of last year was a bit more unlucky?","Could be, so our attitude is look, as long as we\u2019re continuing to deliver on the activities that we plan, as long as we continue to see the margin improve in the way in which we would expect we will be pleased. And given that we\u2019re in the large loss business we should expect some volatility quarter-to-quarter, but directionally this is consistent with our actions, we would just say that it'll take a bit more time before we say there is less luck and more of our actions really taking hold in the book. Greg, you might want to add something to that, but that\u2019s the basic sense we would have around here we feel good, would we say this is absolute proof? No, we wouldn\u2019t say that yet.","Gregory S. Hendrick","No, I totally agree Mike.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. And then a separate one on crop, Jaime, for the reinsurance exposure, what's the potential maximum possible loss in the second half of '12 from the crop reinsurance exposure?","James H. Veghte","Okay. Thanks Jay. Maybe I'll give you perhaps a bit more information than you just asked, so some of the information others may be wondering about will get answered as well. There are two components to our crop exposure, the first is Heartland, it\u2019s the only proportional contract we write. We write at 30% quota share on that book of business with a 7.5% commission. ","We expect $57.8 million of premium on a gross basis to be booked during the year. We buy stop-loss cover of 95% of [40x] of 110. So assuming that we totaled the stop-loss cover, the exposure would be the 10% retention, which would be $5.8 million, the 5% co-par up the stop-loss which would be another $1.15 million and the 7.5% commission, which would be 4.3. So that would be $11.25 million of underwriting loss. ","The book is 50% corn, 18% soy, 20% wheat and 12% cotton and other. The largest states are Minnesota at 21%, which is a very good yield state so far; Texas at 12%, followed by South Dakota at 11%, Nebraska at 11%, Illinois at 8.5%, and Kansas at 8%. The book is split 50-50 between states in the Tier 1 category and Tier 2 and the way the government program works with the 500% gross loss ratio Tier 1 is capped at 194 and Tier 2 at 150. I'd also remind you as I mentioned in my opening remarks 20% of the book is in the winter wheat category which is already done and performed very well. ","We also overlay both the corn and the soy states against the U.S. state progress report and mapped our portfolio with states that have greater than 50% rating of poor or very poor. And in corn our book is 19% in that category versus what we believe in industry number of 24% and soy is 19% versus 21% for the industry.","So, bottom line on this book as we think it will be extremely difficult to go through the top of our stop-loss program and therefore the answer to your question is the downside risk is about $11.25 million to $11.5 million depending on when the premium comes out for that part of the portfolio. The stop-loss portfolio out of Bermuda is a little bit more difficult to measure at this point in the growing season. As I mentioned, we have $41 million of total in-force aggregate, ranging in attachment points from just over 100 all the way up to 140, 150 but I picked 130 as sort of key demarcation retention for what I kind of view as maybe the downside in the industry.","So, about half the book attaches at 130 or above and about half below. We have got no noticeable loss on a provisional basis for many of our customers. We have nine customers in that portfolio and frankly most of them are very reluctant to give us much information at this point. So, we will know a lot more by the end of the third quarter, but if you wanted the total Armageddon downside it would be the in-force aggregate on the stop-loss and the figures I have quoted on Heartland.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","The 41 plus an underwriting loss of '11?","James H. Veghte ","Right.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks. And if I can sneak one more and Mike on the LIBOR exposure, I understand it's early days on D&O, but maybe you can give us a perspective on the mix of business in terms of exposure to large integrated financial companies as a percentage of the book?","Michael S. McGavick","Yeah let's have Greg walk through some of the details that we can give, but again I just want to underscore this one is going to take a while to sort out and it's going to be really interesting to see how much if any winds up being covered loss as opposed to a big market mess. Anyway, Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks Mike. Thanks Jay. We know at this juncture the government investigations and resulting litigations involving the finance institutions are ongoing, and in some instances at very early stage. Because it's a developing event, it will take some time for us to come up with any kind of precise loss estimate. ","However, let me give you a brief macro perspective some general coverage observations and some facts around our professional portfolio. From a macro perspective, the uncertainty begins the lack of clarity around how many of the institutions engaged in the saying of LIBOR, were not following established guidelines. That uncertainty is amplified by the inability at this point in time to establish the specific culpability of a particular insured.","And further the amount of U.S. securities exposure through U.S. exchange ADRs would also impact any loss potential given they follow the level of class actions outside of North America. If we shift to the general coverage observations standard D&O policies issued to public companies typically exclude coverage for regulatory fines and penalties.","In addition, entity coverage in a public D&O policy does not protect against antitrust allegations. And finally, Side A coverage response only if a company cannot indemnify an individual director or officer, and looking at our professional insurance portfolio, our mix of business helps us navigate any potential exposure as well. We have a blend of primary and excess as well as the strong geographic distribution.","As with the case of our entire portfolio, the financial institutions book has a blend of Side A, full coverage D&O and E&O. In fact, over half of our large financial institutions exposure is Side A only, which is a far more limited coverage potential. Specifically, to our international financial institutions business, we reduced our average limit by 20% over the last few years, which will mitigate any potential loss severity. The only thing I can add is, as you would expect Jay, we are monitoring the situation very closely.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, thank you. Good evening everybody. First question is just, could you may be quantify just the large, how much of the improvement year-on-year you would attribute to the large loss side and then we can kind of do our own math in terms of the mix shift and kind of reworking the portfolio?","Michael S. McGavick","I am going to turn that over to Greg in a moment. But it isn't just large loss that\u2019s improved here. Without question, we are seeing the impact of our re-underwriting and the mix shift as every bit is important as what's going in the large losses. The other thing I would add is our improvement in a large loss performance wouldn\u2019t all be arbitrary. We've been changing the way we\u2019re underwriting, changing the way we\u2019re putting limits into the market and changing the way we\u2019re using reinsurance. So the difference between large loss performance in the quarter or a year ago in this quarter wouldn\u2019t only be fortuity, it would also be actions that we have undertaken.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yes, there is a lot of moving parts ins and outs, the main drivers last this quarter last year were in our satellite and our marine portfolio, and this year there's one in property and one in upper middle market, but roughly two points of benefit quarter-over-quarter.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks for that. It wasn\u2019t implying that there it was just luck, in the question.","Michael S. McGavick ","No, no, I was just essentially the fact that I said there is luck in there somehow, or at least we feel that way and we didn\u2019t want to think it was \u2013 that\u2019s all that\u2019s going on here, sorry.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan","That\u2019s fair. I guess just with respect to the life, I mean this is something I think we revisited from time-to-time over the past couple of years, but just with the life reinsurance portfolio, with kind of the financial system or companies within the industry starting to repair their balance sheets little bit. ","Any new thoughts in terms of kind of end game for that business and I'd just be curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about the equity you've allocated to that, when we think about what the returns how much that might be dampening the returns that are being generated on the P&C side or kind of obfuscating those from coming to the surface?","Michael S. McGavick ","Yeah, I'll start, this is Mike and I'll turn it over to Pete. The bottom-line is there are some improvements, as you say there is some rationalization going on among the life players and that really has our attention. We would love to think that as conditions become clear or improve that there would be alternatives to just a slow run up. At the same time, we want to be very thoughtful, economic oriented stewards of your money and this thing has some particular challenges with respect to GAAP and in terms of sort of true economics that we have to pay very close attention to as we consider alternatives. ","Now, we have always said, hey, if someone has a great idea, we are all ears. We continue to have folks reach out and share their ideas with us, none of those has yet caused us to go forward, but we are going to keep pushing, because we do see it as something that in the end is not a part of our future and the sooner that's true I think the better for all of us. And obviously, the portfolio that is connected with being in this run-up is part of what gives us this very unfortunate and I think to some degree unfair nexus to what's going on over in Europe and the sooner that misimpression is shed the better the firm will be. But to get a little more specific I'll turn it over to Pete.","Peter R. Porrino ","Thanks Michael, you have covered the most of it extremely well, you covered all of it very well. But I will try and add just a little bit more there. So, one thing Matt that is difficult to see from what we put on the financial supplement is what's there is a total, is a total amount of capital that's been ascribed to the life book, but we use that capital in our P&C business as well. ","So, it isn't as simple as just taking the return on the $1.9 billion and saying I can go and if I remove that the impact on the ROE would be easily calculated. So, we've taken a look at it. If you look at a rating agency capital, if you look at an economic capital derivation you'll find that it is materially, materially less than the $1.9 billion. ","That being said, I mean, I will just echo what Mike said, it is not something that we are looking to keep long-term. We do think right now with all that's going on in Europe it is a difficult transaction to see happen in near term. That being said, we've got our doors opened for as Mike said, interesting conversations.","Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jay Cohen. You may ask your question. And you are from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thank you. Just two maybe smaller number questions. First, I guess it was Pete, you had mentioned that there were some severance expenses in the overheads. Can you quantify that for us?","Peter R. Porrino","Sure Jay. It's year-to-date about $5 million.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Evenly split in the quarters roughly?","Peter R. Porrino","Yeah, roughly.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And on the reinsurance side I believe you mentioned there was one large treaty where there was I guess a timing difference or the inception had changed. And I'm wondering does that impact the comparison in the second half of the year?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Certainly in the Latin America it will Jay because, actually just a couple of accounts change their anniversary date from June 30 to July 1, so they become Q3 events, so that's all about $11 million.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","So if those are renewed as it would obviously aid the comparison in the third quarter from a top line standpoint?","Gregory S. Hendrick ","Correct.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great. That\u2019s all I got. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. As a follow-up to some of the earlier margin questions would you say a majority of the underlying improvement is from business mix changes? I know Mike earlier in the prepared remarks you said that the challenged businesses, I'm not sure if you meant premiums, I'd have to read back through it, but it fell by 12%. Did that accelerate from last quarter or from previous quarters?","Michael S. McGavick","Yeah. First of all, I think the basic answer to your question is yes. I would say it's more than half and I would say I expected to decelerate over the course of the last half of the year. And we have talked about this before. The reality is that as you start working your way through the book, it all depends on the timing by business, by line, by account, and when you get your mix on that renewal and get to work it. And obviously those things that you don't like that you get off, you get an immediate reduction in your risk and those things that you feel you can modify to have better terms you get a reduction in your risk going forward from that point. And as the book works its way through, we would expect to be able to confidently say that more of it has to do with our actions than with simple flow of fortuity during the quarter. ","Again, one of the things I emphasized when we talked about all this at the end of the year and called out ourselves on this idea that we had a handful of challenged businesses was, one, I think unfortunate results of doing that was that people thought maybe we were just getting started on this work when in fact we've been working and focused on these businesses and all of our businesses throughout last year. ","So some of these we would have already started the process of re-underwriting going back now more than a year others got more attention over the course of the last half year So you kind of almost have to and we do by the way internally, we chart it out by business, by action and by expected benefit of that action over the timeframe of getting to the renewals and having those actions take hold in the market.","And so every quarter we would expect to be able to more confidently say that a still greater percentage of the result is due to our actions and where we think we've been fortunate, we\u2019ll say so, where we think we have been unfortunate, we\u2019ll say so. That\u2019s the nature of the large risk we take on. ","I guess I'd only make one other point, by the end of the year I don't expect to be talking anymore about challenged businesses as a separate reporting item. All of our businesses go in and out of favor depending on market conditions that are unique to them and depending on the new issues that may arise in the industry. We view it ourselves as governing these 35 separate businesses and where they'll each stand at any moment, will be something we'll discuss with you as much transparency as we can, but through the end of the year we'll keep you up-to-date on our progress, so that you can track it, after that I think it just all goes back together it's XL and hopefully by then we are all as excited as we are about this quarter.","Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, then one follow-up then on the challenged businesses and hopefully we won't be talking about this going forward, but in the prepared remarks, I thought I had heard the delta, the combined ratio delta between the challenged and the performing businesses being wider versus last quarter, was that correct or maybe the challenged businesses are just smaller, so even today is wider, didn\u2019t have as big of an impact?","Michael S. McGavick","It\u2019s true, it\u2019s wider all-in, but that\u2019s because the movement that we saw that was meaningful in the quarter really had to do with prior year development. We had positive prior-year development on our better businesses, but on the challenged businesses we did have some adverse development, so you saw a widening perception of GAAP, but on an accident year basis, they are actually coming together. ","Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And lastly\u2026","Michael S. McGavick","On an accident year, ex-Cat, basis they are coming together.","Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And lastly, is there anyway for us do you think about alternative investment income in the next quarters, is it too early to tell?","Michael S. McGavick","I would say it's too early to tell, but you can look at our information we've disclosed what\u2019s disclosed either on a month or a one-month or a quarter lag, so you can, you know the market better than we do, so you can predict that probably as well as we can if not better.","Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you very much, for your answers","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much. I don\u2019t know want to use the word challenged businesses, so maybe I want to talk about the business that you allowed leave the company. Everyone's talking about prices going up here. What do you think the rate increases could have been on the businesses that you let go off and would those have a better rate increases than the business that you are keeping that you think is a better quality business in general?","Michael S. McGavick","Well. I am going to just give a general observation and turn over to Greg. The general observation would be that if we thought we could get rate and if we thought that rate was the cure, we would write the piece of the business. We believe though that there are accounts out there that have been a part of the portfolio that we simply think the best answer is that we part ways. When we see it that way we are going to call that chart and move on and that\u2019s why you see part of the remixing coming from business we are walking away from as opposed to simply care by a rate. Often the way that happens is we'll put the price out there in the market that we think is appropriate to the risk and the market will take the risk at a lesser rate than that and so it goes. I'll turn it over to Greg for specific color.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yeah, I break it into three parts one would be our international property book where we know for a fact that rate's not there. So we are gaining about, we got about 3% in the quarter the business that we shared was flat to down 10% and so we know that we are not missing out on rate. Shift a little bit to our E&S book where we are getting rate in fact double digit rate. And there I would say we've kept a few pieces of the business, but within that business is a mix of things that rate can cure and things that rate can't cure. So we are keeping the business where we get the rate and shedding it out. There some is just structurally not efficient which rate doesn't really matter and I would say in our US MR business the guaranteed workers' compensation book would be an example there. The only thing that matters there is getting the right level of deductible and the right coverage for us. And so they could put 30% more rate on it, it doesn't matter. It's not going to be a profitable piece of business in our opinion.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Is there any way that you can quantify retention among large accounts in a way that I would understand?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Well, our retention overall, I'll give you the color, our retention overall for this segment is 82%.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","How does that compares with the past?","Gregory S. Hendrick ","That's down from the prior year of about 86% in the quarter and most importantly, particularly in our international property book we are down below 60s there. So we would spend all day doing every business, but that's kind of a marker of the spread and the further spread point I gave you is also E&S, which is probably most of you know, we usually run in the 40% or 50% retention ratio if you're running a good book because there is a lot of turnover there. We're down in the high teens on that book. So it's a widespread by business, but we're down and I think that's the right sign, because as you know, when you are getting down on those low 80s you know you're pushing the rate just about the right amount, you're not going too hard, you're not going too soft.","Joshua Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Well. Thank you. That\u2019s all very helpful, great quarter.","Gregory S. Hendrick ","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good afternoon. And congratulations on the progress you have been making, no doubt a lot of heavy lifting. I was hoping that we could talk a little bit more about the business you have been growing in and just the two questions are on casualty professional lines. ","If I am reading this correctly it's something up like 17% year-to-date, and I would love to get a sense of your view of sort of the current profitability and attractiveness of this business given some competitors seem to be taking and also talking about taking prices up dramatically in some segments, including D&O and perhaps some areas of E&O, and some concern about just whether recent vintages have been as profitable as everyone had originally thought?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Thanks Josh. Let me start with the professional piece and the 17%, I believe you're quoting the net number.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Yes.","Gregory S. Hendrick","So the biggest portion of the book that we have is our U.S. D&O business and while I cited a 2.5% rate increase, we don't follow a practice of underwriting here where there is a blanket rate increase mandated on an entire book of business. So it\u2019s a very lumpy rate increase. There is great risks that are renewing at flat and there is also risk that we are getting a lot more than the 2.5% I said. As we get that rate, we\u2019re hitting our benchmark of where we want to be on that business. So part of it in the professional lines is business on our biggest book coming in at the right profitability level. ","The other piece of it is we are retaining more of that business now. From April 1, we changed our session on our professional reinsurance to keep more of what we think as a profitable book. So you get the two pieces acting together there on the net premium number.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That\u2019s great. That\u2019s was going to be one of my other questions. So have you guys made similar changes across a lot of your other businesses, because to drive some of these net to gross differences?","Gregory S. Hendrick","That\u2019s the main driver of where we\u2019re retaining more in the quarter, that the property reinsurance also renewed and we paid more money, but ceded the same expected margin away, but it isn\u2019t of a dramatic variation like you saw on professional.","Peter R. Porrino","But Josh, the one thing I would add to Greg, if there was, I think Greg mentioned one contract that was a large program that was 100% ceded that was, so that also drove our ceded ratio.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That's great and if I could just ask sort of the color question that comes to mind on other specialty which has a similar maybe net-to-gross issue, but even our earned premiums base is growing relatively materially. I'd love to get some color around sort of the political risk business you are putting on as well as surety and trade credit and if you guys have any sort of European exposures on that liability book we should be thinking about anticipating or you have been frankly underwriting around to avoid? Thank you.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Sure. On the other specialty, the political risk business is the biggest piece, it's not adding, we haven\u2019t written anything with exposure to continental Europe to answer your question directly. It\u2019s more spread around countries that are transitioning, in my language from emerging to merged economies. So it's a very well spread book, it's very early days of course as well, but it\u2019s a very well spread book in terms of exposures. We have also started up the inland marine line of business as well in North America, which I believe falls into the other specialty as well, so those are the two biggest pieces of that bucket.","Michael S. McGavick","And again, the one comment that I would make Josh, we made it last quarter as well, those lines do not map to when we talk about our specialty business, for example, they don't necessarily map. That is more of a, I'll call it a U.S. statutory line of business than it is the way we actually run our business.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great, thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney. You may ask your question.","Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney","I think this is related to Josh's last question. Good evening everyone. Your press release yesterday Barbara Luck joining you highlighted that you are touting a new risk appetite for large primary casualty accounts. I didn't know whether there was more of a PR press release or a signal to the analyst community that you are in more of a growth mode on large primary casualty. If you are in a growth mode, I'd like to hear that amplified?","Peter R. Porrino","Sure. Thanks Bob for the question. We are and this is one caveat I'd give to and I have another strong reason why we need to stop just trying to segment out challenged businesses from perform and just talk about what's going in XL Insurance as a whole. U.S. risk management and primary casualty is one of our challenged businesses, and the challenges come from the prior underwriting activities. ","We added Ken Riegler and Jay Lefkowitz late last year, Barbara is part of that team, I am a pretty frugal person, I am not fond of paying for people that aren't going to produce on the bottom line so that is a very deliberate growth mode for that business where we are looking to the right kind of risk management in primary casualty business where on the risk management side you get the right kind of structures around captives and self-insured retentions. ","On the primary casualty there will be a flavor towards kind of the companies that have international exposure where we can add value with our global network so that's a deliberate growth that we will execute on.","Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney","Okay, so it is a change in this little segment that you want to be more aggressive?","Michael S. McGavick ","This is Mike, Bob. You and I would have talked about these lines of businesses even go back to days at C&A. I think that the risk managed account business is an attractive business and one that fits very naturally with the kinds of clients we take on around the shop. ","And the fact is that our risk management operation, our U.S. risk management operation had previously I think missed a couple of important themes to the plot; number one, generally speaking stay away from guaranteed cost business it isn't that attractive and I certainly think that would have been something we would have talked about in the past you and I; and second that if you're going to be in the risk managed account business you need a couple things. ","First, you need a lot of people with proven track records in the space who have both the knowledge and the relationships to execute the business plan and that we have been attracting and we are very pleased to have these folks having joined our team with the kinds of track records that they have. And then second you have to look at your own portfolio and your own unique skill set and say what is that we can do uniquely for clients with these folks on board and there we looked at the kind of innovation and the global footprint that we have and we say there are clients in the house who already like XL where we can make a big difference for now that we have this expertise.","So, that's where we're headed and that's where it's all done. So, in the narrow context it will be a chain story away from one kind of business toward another and as the netting effect of that goes into the past it will be a growth story overall.","Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney","Thank you very much.","Operator","","Thank you. Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners. You may ask your question.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi, good evening. See first question is on the margins in the so-called challenged business. Do you think you are pretty close to reaching your profitability by the year-end or do you think some more actions will be required for next year?","Gregory S. Hendrick","Quite simply, Vinay, the answer to that one, this is Greg. The answer is no, they're not, at 105.6 combined ratio we're not where we need to be. That's not the target combined ratio we have for these businesses. So, there is still actions that we've already taken that need to earn through and some further actions that we have planned to happen in subsequent quarters need to have us and move us, much lower than we are now.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. Fair enough. And just as a follow-up to that seems that the top line growth is slowing and that's a good thing because you are pulling back the amount of underperforming businesses, should we expect that slower top line growth to continue for the next one year as you [reaching] the portfolio to a more profitable business.","Michael S. McGavick ","I would say and as part of the commentary from the last question from Bob was there are businesses that are in the challenged category at the moment whereas this U.S. risk management and primary casualty we just discussed were submission flow by the way is much higher than its ever been before and we are winning the accounts as we speak. As you pull down guaranteed comp business you are pulling down high premium items and you are putting on U.S. risk management business where the net premium impact also is going to be lower, but as they are successful they'll move.","So that I would not project a fixed growth pattern based on what you are seeing. I will end by saying absolutely that right now for us in the insurance segment. If given the trade between top line and profitable margin we are going for profitable margin. Where the market goes I don\u2019t know, that's another component of why I can't give you a direct answer on what we see for the quarters ahead.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","Sure. Fair enough. And just on the expense part of that equation since we are seeing the global economy slowing and then the significant portion of your premiums are in Europe. Do you have some levers on the expense side that you can pull to reduce the expense ratio? Thanks.","Michael S. McGavick","Yeah, this is Mike. The answer to that is yes, as we've been making these investments which we have been doing for the last couple of years. We've been constantly looking for how the investments allow us to operate in a more efficient way, and we believe as we get into the back half of the year, it's time for the reasons you cite the continued economic uncertainty, what's going on and the difficult challenges our European client space, and just the need to get to the level of returns through expanding margin that we've promised we'll be taking a very hard look in the back half of the year as to what we can do in addition to accelerate the benefits and advantages that are created by these investments, some of which are about inside and we'll be continuing investments.","Some of which were about enhanced leverage of our platform, and those would be places where we might be able to start capturing some of the advantage, so that will be an intense examination that Pete and others in the firm will be leading in the back half of the year.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. First off, Greg, thank you so much for that additional disclosure on a crop, that was a granularity was really helpful, so thanks for that. One question I had is on non-cat property insurance, what sort of rate change are you seeing there right now and just a quick follow-up?","Michael S. McGavick","You are looking for that from reinsurance or insurance or both?","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Mostly on the insurance side, because it looked like that\u2019s where premiums fell a bit on a year-over-year basis.","Gregory S. Hendrick","Yeah, you have to split it into two pieces, in North America we were just over 10% ratings.","Michael S. McGavick","Positive","Gregory S. Hendrick","We just are over 10% rate increase. ","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Right, okay.","Gregory S. Hendrick","And in the international property piece we are at the 6% rate increase in the quarter, so both, one in North America far exceeding any increase due to trend. And in international, a very positive sign, and this is the first quarter, I'm happy to report that we actually had some very meaningful positive rate in the international book.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. I guess a question as to, rate was higher, but the premiums you wrote in that business were down and then whereas in a line like professional liability, and I totally understand the comment about a big large mostly ceded contract, but on a net and gross basis it look like professional liability premiums were higher and rates there seem like they were maybe not as good. So, I am just trying to understand we can't see on the insight the decisions that you are making there just trying to understand contextually what's happening in those two areas that's causing that kind of disparity from the outside to be there?","Peter R. Porrino","So, if you look at the gross basis on the other property ","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah.","Peter R. Porrino","That's almost entirely driven to the dollar most by that one large contract that we referred to before. When you get down to net line it is lower that's related, partly there is a bit of net premium associated with that contract, but also there is as I did refer there is an increased cost to the cat cover and the risk cover that we bought at May 1, as well as some re-instatement in premiums associated with both of the losses in the quarter the Midwest quake and the Italian earthquakes.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. So on the PL for professional liability for a second, so where is that business now on sort of underlying combined basis like is it kind of where you wanted to be or are you still a few quarters away from the rate action that will get you there? Thanks for the answers. ","Peter R. Porrino","So, the professional book, as you break it apart, particularly for D&O would be in the mid-90 combined, mid low-90s to mid-90 combined ratio. We have other smaller niche books that we've talked about before which fall into these challenged business categories. Our design and select that will be much closer to 100% combined ratio so that's kind of the split of the book by the combined ratios.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Great, thank you.","","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Mike, you mentioned when you were talking about capital management, I guess, balancing share repurchases with other opportunities and I was wondering whether you could discuss if the opportunities that are being presented now compared to a year ago are shaping expectations for how the overall insurance market is going to play out for the next couple of years?","Michael S. McGavick","That's a really hard question. I have been generally pleased with what we're seeing reported by primary carriers in terms of rate change. So I think there is a positive story continuing there. I have been a little bothered as you heard Jamie say by the fact that the reinsurance marketplace in terms of rate didn't meet our expectations in this most recent period and I'm hopeful that the Reinsurance community will remain disciplined given that our absolute returns remain very difficult given the interest rate environment and that's the piece that yield environment, depressed yield environment remains the most important fact that seems to me it is still be not sufficiently addressed by the insurance and reinsurance marketplace. ","So that piece will continue to give me pause on performance. At the same time, it is the case that we have pockets of very profitable activity that we would like to grow and we have opportunities to remix our book to a more profitable level that we think are already starting to influence the results. So, for us maintaining some investment in those activities is very intelligent positioning of the firm for what we hope will be an improved market over time, maybe not spectacularly improved but moving forward with I think some appropriate discipline.","In balance though, we can't get away from the fact the trading where we're trading, buying in our shares is a very positive economic benefit to our shareholders. You saw us increase our repurchase in the quarter beyond what we would have forecasted at the beginning of the year and as a result the net will keep balancing those out. Sorry my voice is starting to go, but we\u2019re pleased with the progress we are marking. We're going to continue to invest in businesses where we see good margin.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","","Okay, that was very thorough. Thank you. And one quick numbers question if I can. Did foreign exchange contribute at all to the reserve releases in the quarter?","Michael S. McGavick","No.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR. You may ask your question.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Hi, thank you. I guess just as a follow-up on the buyback question. There was an incremental increase, but it still seems very small relative to our estimate of capital capacity. And so I kind of wanted to get some color on how we might think about that in the back half of the year and in particular if the hurricane season is something that you want to kind of way to see passed before that allocation would get bigger or if we would continue to be kind of this very gradual increase?","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike with my new voice. One of the things that I've noticed in working with Peter since you have to shout to be heard your voice goes a little quicker in the day than it used to. So I am going to turn it over to Pete since I blame him for that fact. The one, what I would tell you is look we said that we viewed the 400, which we had forecast as a four, assuming things went according to plan. We\u2019ve said that as margin expands if we continue to see margin expansion that that would give us additional flexibility and we\u2019ve said that we will continue constantly to evaluate the trade-up to try and make the right decision for our shareholders now and in the future and by that we don\u2019t mean just immediate future but the medium term future as well.","Peter R. Porrino ","So Randy, the only thing I would add two things to that, first we do not typically stop buybacks because we are entering winter season. So I would be view as likely to continue and I would also say it is likely to be incremental we don\u2019t see we have, we are working hard to try and be a little bit maybe predictable is not the right word, but just a little bit more even handed and how we go into buybacks and so without getting into too much on specificity I expect that we\u2019ll do something in the third quarter and I would expect that going forward to the rest of the year it would be comparable slight \u2013 possible slight increase but that\u2019s it.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I want to sneak another one in, just because I thought it was interesting, Mike you mentioned that there is, in the life business, one of the previous questions had to do with offloading that run off risk, which is always difficult and you mentioned there is challenges at kind of economics versus accounting and I want to understand your comment better is it a challenge that you might lose the DAC associated with that business or are you saying that you think the economics are better than what you get with accounting. I\u2019d be interested for more color on kind of what that comment meant kind of accounting versus economics and challenge of offloading that risk.","Peter R. Porrino","Yeah, Randy, this is Peter, let me try and take that. The issue is not DAC per se. DAC is fine. We haven\u2019t seen any material changes in our expectations of how that book is running off clearly as Mike said it\u2019s a book that does has no future at XL. The question about economics and GAAP has to do what I said little bit early as well with what the economic capital is, right and there literally is $1 billion difference between what some would say economic capital is and what you would see us disclose as our GAAP capital.","So, when you think about economic returns versus accounting returns you have to take that basically into account, right. There is $1 billion difference. Well, that\u2019s two different things. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be at a type of place that we\u2019ll make decisions based on accounting results, we\u2019ll make them on economic results, right but the pure fact is it\u2019s a life reinsurance portfolio it\u2019s an annuity reinsurance, it is very different than a primary portfolio, right. There are costs that are different for to buy a reinsurance block in order to buy a primary block. So, again, we are welcome to have conversations with people, but at the same time we do look at the economics of any transaction that we would enter into.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","","Our final question comes from Ian Gutterman, Adage Capital. You may ask your question.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.","","Hi, great. Thanks. I just want to clarify one more time what\u2019s going on the accident year and the Insurance businesses because I guess it feels like there are two different things going on where you\u2019ve obviously shown a lot of overall improvement and you said there was some good luck helping out, but when I look at the challenged business at [1056] that actually got worse from last quarter and I would have thought if anything the luck would have helped that businesses given some of the lumpy stuff in there. So, what made that part of the business actually get a little worse sequentially?","Peter R. Porrino","Ian, this is Pete, sorry. Just I\u2019ll turn to Greg, but my first comment is when you start looking at a block of business the size of what our challenged businesses are we are going to have noise all over the place, okay. And that really, that has a lot to do with what happened in this quarter versus a prior quarter. Greg?","Gregory S. Hendrick","","The accident year loss ratio ex-cat was 69.9 this quarter, up just slightly from 69.2 in Q1 of 2012. So, minor deterioration and none it had any one chunk it\u2019s a lot of little things.","Peter R. Porrino","Yeah. There was actually a change in the allocation of expenses as well in Q2 versus Q1 that drove that a little bit. But again, that I think is more because of just the absolute size of what\u2019s in the challenged businesses.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.","","That makes sense and then similar question. The reinsurance improvement obviously you had excellent quarter. Was that, I guess, two things, I know one is the expense ratio came down a lot from sort of a normal Q2 type level was \u2013 and given the investments you are making, I guess, that\u2019s surprising a little bit. Was there something one-time in the expenses or you are doing better than expected and on the loss side was that just very favorable large losses?","Gregory S. Hendrick","","Let\u2019s take one at time. On the expense side, Ian, on the operating expenses, our actual expenses went down by about 3.6% principally from compensation and professional fees and our net earned premium went up by 10.8%. So that drove a significant reduction in the operating expense. On the acquisition expense, there was a lot of small things, but the biggest was you are absolutely correct a one-time event, but that was a Q2 2011 event where we paid a very large profit commission to one of our large North American customers.","On the loss ratio side, about a two point improvement and that\u2019s broken down really between two items, Griffin last year at $6.4 million and a warehouse loss in Latin America again in the second quarter of last year for $2.2 million that equals about a two point improvement in our combined ratio and our loss ratio.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.","","Okay. So that roughly 30% expense ratio for the first half, is that a reasonable run rate?","Gregory S. Hendrick","","It\u2019s hard to say, a lot of that will depend on business mix. We have written a lot more cat business, which should reduce the acquisition expense ratio overall. But it\u2019s a very lumpy portfolio, we could write one large deal with a large commission and it would move things slightly. It doesn\u2019t mean there is necessarily a massive change in either our strategy or the market environment.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.","","Got it, got it. Okay. And Peter, I\u2019ll try on one more and if this is a long answer I\u2019ll take it off line, but it\u2019s a short answer, hopefully, you can give it quickly. Can you one more time do the deposit book business caused that $90 million of interest expense, is essential because that was \u2013 that you saw what we would normally call adverse development instances booked as a deposit, it shows up as higher interest expense or are you seeing something else?","Peter R. Porrino","So that\u2019s pretty much what we are saying, the loss amount is cat and has been cat and so there is no increase in the total amount of losses that we are going to pay into the contract, but since the ultimate underlying that are going up. We will be paying our share faster than what was assumed previously. So it literally is an acceleration of payment, the amount of payments has not changed.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.","","Okay. So it\u2019s just a discounting issue, a PV issue?","Peter R. Porrino","Yes.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you, and at this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Michael S. McGavick","This is Mike. I just want to thank everybody for taking the time and the interest especially as the Insurance and Reinsurance sector earnings season winds down. We obviously are feeling very good around here about the progress we are making, this is as I said at the beginning, a solid result whether that \u2013 at on a relative or absolute basis, and well the call has focused on some of the reasons that we \u2013 none of us should get ahead of ourselves as we would not because we believe in the end we can do still better and we are absolutely driven to deliver that result.","We are pleased with the progress, but we are nowhere near satisfied and we won\u2019t be satisfied both until the results are wonderful and until we can tell you and look you in the eye and say that and the results are exactly what we\u2019d expect given everything we are up to. So we are pleased with the progress and look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","","Thank you and this does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines."],"22837":["XL Group plc (NYSE:XL) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call August  4, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","David Radulski - Director, IR ","Mike McGavick - CEO","Pete Porrino - CFO","Paul Brand - Chief Underwriting Officer & Chair, Insurance Leadership Team","Greg Hendrick - Chief Executive, Reinsurance Operations","Analysts","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","Clifford Gallant - Nomura Securities","Brian Meredith - UBS","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research Equities","Dan Farrell - Piper Jaffray","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management","Ryan Tunis - Credit Suisse","Operator","Good morning. My name is Shirley and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the XL Group PLC second quarter 2015 earnings call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to David Radulski, XL's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David Radulski","Thank you, Shirley and welcome to our call. Our call today is being simultaneously webcast at www.xlcatlin.com and www.xltgroup.com. We have posted to our website several documents including our press release and quarterly financial supplement. On our call this morning is Mike McGavick, XL Group's CEO who will offer opening remarks, Pete Porinno, XL's Chief Financial Officer who will review our financial results, followed by Paul Brand, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team, and Greg Hendrick, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations who will review their segment results and market conditions. Then we'll open it up for questions. Also with us is Kelly Lyles, our Chief Regional Officer and the Deputy Chair of our Insurance Leadership Team.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations all of which involve risk and uncertainty and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our most recent reports on forms 10-Q and 10-K as well as other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements speak only as the date of which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I turn it over to Mike McGavick.","Mike McGavick","Thank you each for joining our call. Today, we're very pleased to discuss our second quarter 2015 results. The first results period for the combined operation of XL Catlin. And although the quarter includes only two months of joint operation, in that short time we're already seeing the many positive indicators supporting the rationale for our joining forces and for the quality of are integration work.","I'll give some of the highlights of the quarter and Pete Porinno will have further details on the numbers and then, for the first time since the close of the transaction, Paul Brand will discuss the insurance operations while Greg Hendrick will handle reinsurance. In terms of the quarter, as you have seen from the release issued last night, our results included an operating ROE of 10% excluding unrealized gains and losses, a P&C combined ratio of 89.9%, an underwriting profit of $209 million, gross written premium of just over $3 billion and operating earnings of $0.84 per share.","Impacts to these results in the quarter included higher levels of cat in medium to large losses as you've already heard broadly from the market, as well as $28 million in integration costs. Overall, these are solid results and we like our positions. We're particularly pleased with these results we're delivered during a quarter that was messy for the industry and when we're fully into our integration work.","I also think these results bespeak progress toward a goal we've had for a long time of an increased ability to better absorb volatility. As I have said, we had a few large cats and higher than expected levels of losses and nonetheless, the overall result is quite solid. Now, this could be luck. We're in the fortuity business, but this is something we've been striving to deliver for a long time and we have believed that the combination with Catlin would create an even more resilient and better spread book of business. This could also be a result of that progress. We will see.","Before turning it to Pete, I also want to give you a quick update on the three areas related to the ongoing integration, our current thinking regarding top line, second, our expectations for expenses and then third, capital management. First, as to the top line. As we all know, the market faces plenty of headwinds. We intend to maintain our discipline and the continuing guidance to all of our underwriters is that as much as we intend to grow, our primary focus is and will always be on the bottom line.","The simple truth is, for us, bringing the two firms together is not the difficult thing. The difficult thing for us and for everyone else in the market for that matter, is the market itself. And yet, in the quarter, we actually grew our top line and can only identify less than 1% of the business that was lost as a result of the deal. That is far better than we had modeled going in. Second, regarding expenses, we remain on track to achieve our synergy target of $250 million by year-end 2017 on a run rate basis and the ratio of cost to savings remains the same. ","Roughly $1.25 in expenses for every $1 we can achieve in synergies. That said, we're in fact a bit ahead of this schedule in getting to our goal. In addition, we're also on track to gain the non-operating expense savings from areas like reinsurance, purchasing, claims adjustment expenses and investment management fees as discussed with you on our previous call.","And then, third, turning to capital management. Since restarting share buybacks following the May 1, close of the deal, we have followed the rate previously shared with you of a bit more than $50 million per month. Here again, we like being in a position to resume our capital management program and to continue to create additional value through buybacks.","Lastly, I just want to emphasize once how pleased we're with the overall progress we have made on our integration. Integration work is by its nature very hard and there are many changes that our people around the world are adapting to. Yet they are anticipating and solving issues that arise and the market reaction remains well beyond our hopes. A great example of what we've already achieved would be come from their quarterly results review that we recently held with all of the key leaders of our underwriting divisions, regions and major functions.","My expectations for the meeting were very high because I believe these two cultures are innately aligned. However, I can tell you that for many of the people in that room, they're meeting together for the first time. To see the camaraderie and to see the command that people already had of the numbers and operations under their responsibilities was simply astonishing. I know everyone in that room left heartened at the likelihood of success for what we're bringing together. I was simply blown away by what I participated in. This speaks well to the distinctive cultural we each had and to the unique way it will now fit together.","We're not claiming victory and we're not done by any means. Our focus on speed to close the deal and I'm bringing these two companies together as quickly as possible, has put us in a fantastic position to build on, especially in a market that is experiencing a high level of subsequent M&A and turmoil. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.","Pete Porrino","Thanks, Mike. Our consolidated results for the quarter reflect the addition of the Catlin Group for only the months of May and June and reported prior year figures include only legacy XL results. Most of our prepared remarks will be on that basis. As promised, we have included segment information for the first six months of 2014 in our financial supplement which combines XL and Catlin to help you with your analysis.","This table is in response to many of your requests. Please note that the presentation does not represent pro forma financial information in compliance with GAAP and the combined June 30, 2014 information has not been audited. Operating net income for the second quarter was $246 million or $0.84 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $280 million in 2014 or $1.02 per share. As we indicated during our May call, we exclude direct transaction costs from operating income while including integration costs. During the second quarter, we excluded $37 million in Catlin deal related transaction costs from operating income and included $28 million in integration costs. Both of these are recorded in corporate expenses.","On net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for the quarter was $915 million or $3.11 per share on a fully diluted basis which included the gain of $340 million on the sale of our operating affiliate, ARX Holdings which closed on April 1. Additionally, as we have previously noted and I'm sure by now you are expert in this matter, our net income numbers are also impacted by the mark to market movement of the derivatives that trends through the economics of the assets backing our second quarter 2014 Life reinsurance transaction and which have no impact on net book value or operating income.","We recorded a derivative gain offset by a book value loss in the quarter due to the increasing interest rates on the underlying assets. Our P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 89.9% or 1.6 points higher than the same quarter last year. Our accident and combined ratio for the quarter was 95.2%, 1 point higher than the second quarter of 2014. Natural catastrophe losses this quarter was $60 million or 2.9 loss ratio points. By comparison, net losses from natural catastrophes in the same quarter of 2014 totaled $35 million or 2.4 loss ratio points.","As we've outlined on previous calls, the second quarter has been and continues to be, the significant reserve valuation quarter. As a result, we have reacted appropriately to any development indications identified during our in-depth review. Prior year reserved development in the quarter was a net variable of $109 million or 5.3 loss ratio points compared to a net favorable $84 million and 5.8 loss ratio points for the same quarter in 2014. This reflects favorable development of $38 million and $71 million in the insurance and reinsurance segments.","We completed the GAAP purchase accounting process and made fair value adjustments to the required balance sheet. These adjustments will earn into income over the next number of quarters. Overall, the impact is relatively small. However, certain line items can be distorted in each quarter. For example, we advertised the fair value adjustment from deferred acquisition cost to value business acquired into acquisition expense, thereby increasing that ratio slightly, particularly in the reinsurance segment.","This is offset by the amortization of the fair value adjustment to reserves which decreases loss ratios slightly, particularly in the insurance segments. To the extent that these are meaningful, they will be noted by Paul and Greg. Operating expenses have increased materially in the quarter as a result of the consolidation of the Catlin Group. Overall, however, the run rate operating expenses of the company are significantly lower than the baseline levels we discussed with you in May. If you recall, we indicated that we intend to measure our synergy levels against the run rate cost baseline on a combined 2014 expense level from the two companies, increased by low-single digits for XL and a slightly higher rate for Catlin.","During the second quarter, our expenses, excluding deal and integration costs, were approximately 3% lower than the two companies' combined costs in the prior year. We expect the integration costs to increase significantly over the next two quarters then begin to decline through 2016 and 2017.","Our operating tax rate has declined slightly from approximately 13% to approximately 11%. This relates to the actual and projected profits of the company by jurisdiction as well as the slightly lower overall historic rate that legacy Catlin experienced. On a net income basis, the tax rate really jumps around given the impact of items that don't impact operating incomes such as the Life derivative and the sale of ARX Holdings.","Turning to the investment portfolio. Net investment income excluding the Life fund's withheld assets, was $176 million or $37 million below the same quarter last year, primarily due to the Life transaction having taken place mid-quarter last year, along with the impact of lower investment deals. These were partially offset by the addition of two months of investment income on the legacy Catlin portfolio. The gross book yield of the portfolio at the end of June was 2.4%. During the quarter, our average new money rate was 1.2%.","Given current yields, net investment income will continue to remain under pressure as we have approximately $4.1 billion of assets with book yields 2.4% rolling off over the next 12 months. Net income from the investments fund and investment manager of operating affiliates was $40 million for the quarter, up $9 million from the prior year quarter driven by higher earnings from our private investment fun affiliates. Net income from other operating affiliates was down from the sale of ARX Holdings on April 1. Net realized gains on portfolio assets were $4 million, down $77 million from the prior year.","We had large gains on sale of equities in the same part of last year. Our unrealized gain position declined by $319 million for the quarter driven primarily by rate increases in all our major jurisdictions. Unrealized net gains were $871 million at the end of the quarter. All together, the total return on investments was a negative 0.5% for the quarter. In general, we anticipate a transition to a rising rate environment and while we expect this to be handled sensitively by the central banks, we assume this will be accompanied by bouts of volatility in the market. In light of this view, we have not yet extended the ratio on our newly combined portfolio. However, the ratio on the overall portfolio decreased by 0.2 years to 3.5 years at the end of the quarter due to the inclusion of the legacy Catlin assets.","This kind of an environment can provide opportunities for a long-term investor like XL Catlin but it will likely create a little more volatility in both net investment income and book value as we navigate our way through this. We've integrated the legacy Catlin assets into the combined portfolio. There has been no fundamental change in our investment policy or approach as a result of the Catlin acquisition, although the combined entity is expected to benefit from expanded capabilities including internal fixed income portfolio management.","Now with respect to capital management, we resumed active share buybacks during the second quarter after the close of our acquisition of Catlin. During the second quarter, we purchased 2.9 million shares for $110 million at an average price of $37.57 per share, leaving $158 million available for purchase under our previously announced share buyback program. We continue to view these buybacks as an effective capital management tool and have continued purchasing at similar levels in July in line with the philosophy we laid out in May. I will now turn it over to Paul to discuss our insurance segment results.","Paul Brand","Thanks, Pete. Let me start by saying that both Kelly and I are really excited to be leading such a talented team of insurance professionals and that we look forward to sharing our continued progress over the coming quarters. Today, I will cover the results for the segment, provide an update on our integration and finish with remarks on current market conditions.","First, the results. The second quarter marked our tenth consecutive quarter of profitability for the segment producing a calendar year, calendar quarter combined ratio of 97%, compared to 93.8% in the same quarter last year and a first soft combined ratio of 95.8% versus 94.6% during the first half of 2014. Increased cat activity, largely due to the eight ball Sydney hailstorm, compared to a low cat quarter in quarter two 2014, accounts for 2.7 of the 3.2 point quarter two deterioration. Lower prior year development as a percentage of net earned premiums account for another percentage point deterioration.","This was partially offset by an improvement in our operating expense ratio reflecting changes in our expense structure as a result of the transaction. On an accident quarter ex cap basis, the combined ratio was 95.4% compared to 96% in quarter two, 2014. While this results reflects some improvements year-over-year, it is slightly higher with the 93.2% reported in quarter one primarily due to some medium-sized losses that occurred in the quarter. For the first half, we reported an accident year ex cat combined ratio of 94.5% compared to 95.3% to 2014 further demonstrating the resilience of our growing book of business as we were able to resolve these losses without jeopardizing profitability.","For quarter two, reported an acquisition ratio of 12.9% which was three percentage points higher than quarter two 2014. This is because the legacy Catlin business included a larger share of wholesale specialty business largely from the lowest platform where the acquisition costs are higher than the legacy XL business. This is offset by lower loss ratios reflected in our quarter two net accident year ex cat loss ratio of 61.9% which was 2.8 percentage points lower than quarter two 2014. Insurance based premiums written in quarter two increased by 37% or $600 million year-over-year, driven largely from the Catlin acquisition. This growth occurred in all four of our underwriting divisions with the biggest growth in our energy, property and construction specialty divisions.","When we look at a full quarter for both legacy organizations and normalize for foreign exchange and other items, our actual year-over-year growth is roughly 2% in quarter two and 4% year-to-date. We're clearly pleased with the business is growing despite the challenges of an integration and whilst the rate of growth has slowed when compared to recent quarters, in my view, this is for more indicative of market conditions than anything else.","Shifting to progress and integration. Let me just share a few highlights from the insurance segment perspective. First off, the market response to the deal has been very favorable. We're seeing increased dialogue with our brokers, giving our greater market prominence and these brokers have been providing support to our one plus one equals two or more mantra. As a result, we tend to tracking ball with historical trends and new business is trending up despite market conditions which I will discuss shortly.","Second, our leadership teams are now fully in place across the insurance segment as we carefully selected the best talent from both legacy organizations with minimal disruptions. Plus we successfully executed our legal day one plans, we're now hard at work executing our longer-term plans, including the realization of synergies which Mike mentioned earlier and we will share more on our progress in future quarters.","Turning to market conditions, we saw even stronger headwinds in quarter two than we reported during the past three quarters. Pricing was negative across most lines of business as the overall rate change for this segment was down 3% in the quarter and 2% year-to-date. Our casualty and professional businesses were down 1% with only our Cyber and North American Environmental businesses achieving material rate.","Our Specialty business was down 3%, largely reflecting continued competitive conditions in the aviation lines and our energy, property and construction business were most severely impacted with pricing down in the mid-single digits. That by reductions to the energy book driven largely by the recent fall in oil prices. Given the reality of the markets, we continue to focus on an improved mix of business and our ongoing execution of underwriting actions, measured use of reinsurance and effort to create operating leverage through efficiencies and rigorous expense management. These leaders have delivered continued improvements over the past few years and as XL Catlin, we will have ability to pull these levers even harder.","In summary, we delivered another solid quarter of underwriting profitability despite the internal focus required to complete the acquisition. With much of this now behind us, both Kelly and I look forward to picking up where Greg left off, continuing our trajectory of underwriting improvement towards top quintile performance. Now to Greg to discuss reinsurance results.","Greg Hendrick","Thanks, Paul. Today, I will discuss the results for quarter and provide a few comments on current market conditions. Beginning with the results, the reinsurance segment got off to a great start in our inaugural quarter as XL Catlin with a calendar quarter combined ratio of 74.5% and resulted underwriting profit of $166 million. This compares with the combined ratio of 75.7% and underwriting profit of $105 million for XL's second quarter of 2014. We had the benefit of another quiet quarter of catastrophe losses and continued favorable reserve runoff. The large increase in underwriting profit is a result of our new scale as XL Catlin. Concerning the competitive landscape we're pleased with how the portfolio performed this quarter.","Excluding prior year development, the portfolio generated an accident quarter combined ratio of 85.3% which compares to the 86.7% produced by XL in the second quarter of 2014. The accident quarter loss ratio decreased 7 points to 50% for the quarter. The primary drivers of loss ratio decrease included 4.8 points related to lower catastrophe activity and 2.3 points due to favorable attritional loss experience.","Offset improve loss ratio was an expense ratio of 35.3%, up 5 points of expense compared to the second quarter of last year. This increase is a result of purchase accounting adjustments Pete noted earlier which contributed 3.3 points with the remaining increase due to a change in business mix as a result of the Catlin acquisition. Our reserve releases in the quarter were $71 million, compared with $47 million a year ago which benefited a combined ratio by 11 points in both years. The current quarter release was driven primary by favorable runoff in North American and European casualty lines of business as well as favorable prior year catastrophe losses.","Turning to top line, gross written premium for the quarter was $782 million, up from $493 million in the second quarter of 2014, driven by the Catlin acquisition. Looking at the full quarter for the combined XL Catlin, gross written premium fell 11% relative to the second quarter of last year. Most importantly, just 0.5% or $6 million is part of the 11% drop resulted from aggregational concerns from the XL Catlin combination. This drop was more than offset by increased participations with a number of our core clients.","Over 60% of this quarter's drop results from the accounting treatment of multi-year premiums written by legacy Catlin. This treatment increased the prior year premium while decreasing the 2015 premium. The remainder of the drop is driven by our underwriting discipline in the face of competitive market conditions and the timing of certain treaties.","Turning to market conditions, we continue to experience deteriorating rates across most lines and regions during the second quarter and into the July 1 renewals. In general, global property catastrophe rates fell roughly 7.5%, other excessive loss covers fell 5% and steam conditions on pro rod trees grew by 1% to 1.5%. However, we did see a slowing on the rate of a decreases on U.S. property cat. And in particular, roughly $4 billion of increased demand in U.S., primarily in Florida, but due to a number of covers being repriced or unable to be completed at the initial firm order terms. While this may not be a definitive floor, we're encouraged by the pricing discipline emerging in both the traditional and I-loss markets over the last few months.","In summary, from both a financial and market momentum perspective, we're off to a great start. Our second quarter financial results were strong and while marketing conditions continue to be challenging, strong support from our clients and brokers allowed us to find profitable opportunities. The integration of our two teams into XL Catlin has gone very well and our reinsurance operations are well-positioned for the rest of the year and into the January 1, renewal cycle. I will now turn it back to David.","David Radulski","Shirley, can you open the line for questions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Kai Pan","First question, is on the expense ratio. Just wonder, how much is that the accounting adjustments impact overall for the company, as well as how long will it last? Is that a few quarter phenomenon or is that ongoing?","Pete Porrino","There is about a $15 million adjustment in the amortization expense that hits the commission and brokerage line for the quarter. I think it would be safe to say that I would expect that to decline slowly over time until it expires in quarter five or six.","Kai Pan","And then, maybe this is a bigger picture is that, wouldn't you guys now three months into integration, do you see anything surprise you to either the upside and downside? Given now you have some experience with accounting now, do you have a more detailed in term how do you plan to have the $250 million cost savings by 2017? What I mean is that do you have more granularity, for example, savings for 2015 and 2016?","Mike McGavick","I will start with the more general bit and then turn it over to Pete. I would say that, I personally have experienced one negative surprise. That is, having been through a fair amount of large scale corporate activities that have involved job loss, you start to think that somehow you'll get used to it. You never do.","These things are painful. We're dealing with people and families' plans and lives and we're hard at work at things that are very unpleasant. I would say that I find it just amazing that it is every bit as painful now as it was the very first time I was ever a part of something like this. The second thing though, I would share two positive surprises. One is, we believed that because it was in the -- because these actions were taking place in the context of a merger, that people would be more understanding, that they'd be aware these things kind of go along with it.","And there, it has been true. Our colleagues have stayed very focused on their clients, very focused on supporting one another even through difficult times and it's just a really remarkable thing to watch. That has been a good thing to experience, I think, for all of us. Finally, I would tell you, the most positive thing of all is, while we thought that the market would really like a company in the shape of XL Catlin, with a deep focus in specialty and deep flexibility around loyds and the globalism and all of the rest, we intellectually knew what the arguments were but to actually see the reaction of our colleagues and to see the reactions, most importantly, of our clients and of our broker partners, it has just been amazing.","They are excited by what we're building and that excitement has translated into the kind of top line support that we've been able to achieve despite what is a very difficult market. Those things are exhilarating. You realize that, at least some of what you were thinking, is coming true. Whenever you are dealing with strategy and ideas, you're truly exciting to see it translate to numbers. And that's been a really gratifying part of this process.","In terms of synergies, a couple of high-level comments. Number one, as I mentioned, we're seeing it come together even faster. This suggests that some of those costs that go with the achievement of synergies will take place at higher levels earlier than we originally would have modeled. Of course, that all attaches to the already higher promised $250 million in run rate savings by the end of 2017. I think Pete already referenced that you'd see it climb and then decline. Pete, you might want to give a little more color.","Pete Porrino","Well, on the two things, on the synergies just exactly what Mike said. I think we all feel more comfortable every passing month that goes by but I don't think we're at a place now where we would change the overall timing that we've talked about back in May 28. I would say the integration cost, again as Mike said, are coming in quicker than we expected. If I had to sort of ballpark it, I would say for the next couple of quarters, we probably expect them to go up by about 50% each quarter and then drop off after that.","Kai Pan","Lastly then maybe for Paul. Given the pricing commentary, clearly is a more competitive marketplace now. Do you see room for underlying loss with your improvements? Do you think the overall combined ratio improvements more coming from the expense side rather than from the loss ratio side? Thanks.","Paul Brand","Absolutely, we've got something we can deliver on expenses. I think we could also do some stuff around reinsurance benefits, get a bit more organized around that. And then, generally, underwriting actions and tuning the portfolios and pulling the business properly together. I think we've got quite a lot of tailwinds. Mike referred to the support from brokers and clients, that's tremendous. That really does help. The job is, is making certain those more than offset the headwinds of rate decreases, that's what we got to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Jay Gelb","In terms of level settings over the foreseeable future, I think it would be helpful to get a perspective on what gross written premiums for property-casualty could be given we've got Catlin coming in. I'm modeling around $11 billion of gross written premiums of P&C in 2015 and just approaching $14 billion in 2016, taking into account the full year of Catlin. Is that a decent starting point?","Mike McGavick","Jay, I'm sorry to be unhelpful but we have not given guidance on top line in that way. We've always tried to talk about the things we can control which is why we're willing to give sort of more explicit guidance around how we view expenses at the end of the year, each year. We have given commentary around how we will treat capital markets, assuming nothing changes in the terms of buybacks.","Those things we have control over so we can forecast them with a bit more accuracy. What the markets are going to do and how the top line will perform is something you'll have to model based on your assumptions and we'll treat according to ours.","The one thing I would observe is as we have already said, we have this mantra that one plus one should equal two or more. Meaning that we're not accepting that bringing together two well-run organizations must lead to some kind of dissynergy at the top line. We just don't accept that.","We think that with the greater balance sheet strength, with the greater capabilities, we should be up to grow, not shrink. The countervailing fact, as I described in the call a couple of months ago, is you've got tremendous headwinds in terms of pricing and we're a bottom line driven shop. And how those two things feather together is what will decide the matter. This quarter and the way each company functioned separately through the six months until the two months that we were together, both indicate that there is a good bias to the idea that we can grow our business, subject, particularly in reinsurance today's market conditions.","Second, we have from my point of view, looking at new business and submissions, the kinds of activity we're seeing which speaks to the support I've described from the brokers and others, I really like our position. But giving you an absolute forecast is just something we don't do.","Jay Gelb","With regard to the return profile with the company generating what I would characterize as a very solid 10% annualized ROE this quarter, do you think that's a reasonable run rate here or perhaps something XL can build on?","Mike McGavick","Again, we have said our objective is to run double digit or better ROEs. We had a strong year last year. We've had a good start to this year. We always look at it -- we encourage looking at it by looking through the unrealized gains and losses which we believe is important at a time when the unrealized are high. We also think it's an important at a time when unrealized gains are shifting around and lowering. I think you should always view on some kind of a constant basis to the core performance of the company. We have said that we expect, looking through all of the distortions that will go on, we have said that with that basis in mind, we have expected this transaction to be meaningfully accretive to our ROE. We have no change of view.","Jay Gelb","Right. And that's on book value ex AOCI, not just on tangible, right?","Mike McGavick","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cliff Gallant with Nomura. You may ask your question.","Clifford Gallant","Just one question on the comment you made. A number you gave, Mike, in your prepared remarks. You talked about, I think you said 1%. You identified 1% of business that was lost due to the direct impact of the combination. I'm just wondering, how do you derive that number? Because I assume that there's always some turn in normal lost business that needs to be replaced but all the time.","Mike McGavick","Absolutely. What I said was less than 1%, actually. I'm going to ask each, Paul and Greg to comment on their own segment's experience. What we mean by that, at some level, you are right. There is some opaqueness to it but we're looking for the client that says to us, you know, you already were a significant part of my program from both the legacy Catlin and the legacy XL. I can't stomach that much exposure to you combined. I'm either going to cut you back or do something like that. We're looking for direct effect of the transaction on a buyers decision-making.","I can tell you, overwhelmingly, the direct effect of this balance sheet is clients wanting more connection to us, not less. We even saw that, I mentioned that in the meetings that we held with our brokers at RIMS and our partners at RIMS, people were already offering us additional business. Now whether it's priced to our standards is where we get into challenge. ","And that's why we have found, absolutely, that it's market conditions that are challenging, not what the transaction has done. The transaction has done nothing but help us with the exception of, as I said, that less than 1% that has something that bothered them that caused them to either cut us back or some other such effect. It's only if it's related to the transaction that we're going to put it in that bucket. Paul?","Paul Brand","Yes, I mean we've already carefully monitored risks. We've insisted that eventually we can recapture data on every risk that renews with us saying essentially, has our line been squeezed because of an addition of XL plus Catlin? Or has that happened absolutely correctly as we would expect? As I say, again, this is risk by risk.","We've got all the underwriters completing this data. We monitor it on a monthly basis. It's one of the first, one of the key metrics that I wanted to institute in terms of measuring process and progress against that goal. We've also been very clear, I think, with the market and with our client by what our ambitions are here. There's no confusion there and there's no confusion internally about what we're trying to achieve. I think if you put those things together, the clarity of the message and monitoring and keeping the metric, again, that just really helps you drive for the right result.","Greg Hendrick","Yes and in reinsurance, Cliff, it's the same. We were able to code treaty by treaty, client by client exactly what was lost due to any concern. Over 0.5% was what the number was for reinsurance. I think also we got, like Paul just noted, we were after the client and brokers very early on to make sure that could communicate deeply with them whenever they had concerns. And quite often it ended up the conversation turning from I'm a little concerned to actually, that makes a lot of sense and all things being equal, if there's room, you can have more.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.","Brian Meredith","A couple of quick questions here for you. The first one, just on the peak app adjustments you mentioned, you said what the impact was on the expenses were, Pete. I thought you said there was offsetting on the loss ratio? What was that and where was that?","Pete Porrino","Yes, that would've been pretty much the same percentage on the overall book. As I said, more of that was on the insurance side. So that would've been about 0.8% on the insurance loss ratio for the quarter.","Brian Meredith","Mike, I'm just curious, to date, you see reading the press reports of some people leaving Catlin. I'm curious, were any of the people that have departed unexpected? When did you -- would rather not have left?","Brian Meredith","First of all, let's put it all in context. If you look at the first half of the year, we're only running slightly above the same level of attrition, the level of attrition that we experienced when we add the two firms together in the first six months of last year. The fact that we're going through a major integration and are only seeing slightly more turnover speaks volumes. I will say, that is slightly higher when you reach the underwriting ranks and that we expected because you are bringing together teams of people.","Sometimes those people have history with each other. There were hot spots that we identified well before the transaction closed. In fact, in some of our earliest meetings, where we knew of people who had used to work together and didn't anymore for a variety of personal reasons and all of that kind of stuff. If I step back and say, are there people we've lost that we'd rather have not lost? Sure, a handful. If I were to step back and say, are there teams we've lost that we would have rather have not lost or not expected? I'd say, maybe one. That was kind of five people. Other than that, no. They were the anticipated hot spots. They played out pretty much as we expected.","But are there a handful of levers that I wish were excited and had stayed? Sure. This is a big integration. But as against any of our metrics that we had in mind before going into this, it's lower than we expected in that count. In fact, that just makes it a little harder because we have to get to our synergy goals. And if they don't leave voluntarily, sometimes it has to happen another way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie. You may ask your question.","Amit Kumar","Just two quick follow-ups on Catlin. Number one, can you disclose if there was any reserve release benefit from Catlin or not?","Pete Porrino","As you know, we closed on May 1 and did a full review at that point in time. The answer would be, no, there was no reserve release. We did not expect one. It will be part of the full reserve review that we do in the fourth quarter.","Amit Kumar","And I just quickly related to the discussion on what I guess Cliff was asking regarding aggregation and what was lost. Excluding that, if you look at the legacy book, do you have some sense as to the percentage that was non-renewed which did not meet your return thresholds or is that number not available?","Greg Hendrick","Yes, I would say on the reinsurance side, as we went through it, it was roughly about 7.5% to 10% offset clearly by new business and other things going on. That would be both legacy books. We're operating now as XL Catlin, so I don't track what Catlin business we lost or what XL business we lost. It's just what we lost in the aggregate for the quarter.","Paul Brand","Overall for insurance, on our retention ratio which is how we measure it year-on-year, is broadly consistent in the mid-80s mark. It varies a bit as you get into different business lines. We're clearly lower retention in those most and negatively affected by pricing. As I said in my prepared remarks, very consistent retention levels year-on-year.","Amit Kumar","And if I could quickly sneak one more. Can you broadly talk about, obviously you've seen the Ace-Chubb deal. How does that impact XL going forward? Or how do you view the changing scenario out there with all these acquisitions taking place around you? Thanks.","Mike McGavick","We have said for some time and it was certainly what prompted Stephen Catlin and I to begin talking about this in the first place is we see a broad set of industry conditions that are leading, we believed would lead to a broad set of M&A. At the time that we announced the transaction, that was something of an original thought. It isn't anymore. There's been quite a number of subsequent transactions.","The way to think about a couple of things. One, when you have something like Ace and Chubb come together, I think of that as being one less larger competitor. I think of their as being the same kind of work that we've been going through is about to be gone through by them. Even when I see companies coming together who are more our sites, I kind of have the same reactions. It's one less competitor and another set of two organizations that are going to go through challenges. That is just a marketplace that, to my mind, is pointing towards more companies like the one we're building. The thing that we really appreciate and will try to maximize the value of is going first is good. It gets you through the hoop faster.","We think we're turning out, at least the early indications are, we're pretty competent at managing this kind of thing and that is showing up. Every day that we get further through the hoop and that others are finding their way through it with all the challenges that goes, every bit of that I like. The market is the market. I think there's going to be more, not less, of this kind of activity. I don't think we're at all done with this wave of M&A because these underlying conditions have not changed and there is a lot of firms that have not yet reacted. I think many may think they like their position.","I think they are going to find themselves more and more wishing to be part of something broader and deeper. As those realizations come, there will be less and less partners. All of that argues for early, not late and for us liking our position, realizing with all humility, that these are difficult things and they'll be difficult for the other guy. They're difficult for us and that's just the way it is. It's a convulsion of activity the market's growing through. We just feel particularly well-positioned having started early.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Farrell with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Dan Farrell","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you think the balancing buyback and debt reduction as we head into 2016 and 2017 and likely ramping of cash flow in those years? What I'm getting at is, you talked about a goal of wanting to get the debt and preferred down to the low 20s. At the same time, it doesn't seem like there would be a pressing need to get to that level given a lot of that preferred. I'm just wondering how you would balance the two?","Mike McGavick","I will start and Pete may have some additional color commentary. This is Mike. First of all, our general approach to share repurchases remains the same as it has always been. Many of you are long-time regulars so I'm not going to bore anybody, but the basic concept is, meet your highest required capital. That's going to usually be asking, at least in this day and age, that could change. Once we're done with that, we have a buffer. That buffer is generally equated to our largest most likely source of loss with a little cushion to that just for the normal vagaries of competition.","Once were there, we look at how much we got and we say, okay, if we've got capital in excess of that, what's it's best use? For every quarter saved, the quarter of this transaction, the answer was, buy back shares. So we bought back shares. Obviously, we used some of that excess capital in this transaction. As we see, again, the Capitol building up and, obviously, by virtue of buybacks, position of excess to those first two requirements, we've initiated buybacks again at the level we've previously described and are quite comfortable with that.","Now, the question with respect to mixing debt repurchase in, the transaction, when all got said and done, we wound up a bit better on the leverage ratio than we had forecast going into the transaction. We maintained a goal of being middle of the pack. Middle of the pack is not a stagnant notion because with all of this M&A, you're going to see some of that number move around over time and probably move toward us a little bit. But nonetheless, its clear to us that over time, the flexibility that is gained by some reduction in the debt is wise.","I think what you are going to see is a continued appreciation for the value of buybacks. You are going to see a continued attention to how we could, perhaps, opportunistically think about the debt level but you're not going to see a sudden drive to get it down. This is the same approach we used the last time that got us to our goal over a handful of years. I have the same mindset here. There's no urgent drive here. We'll just look at how the flexibility it creates for us and keep it in balance with the share repurchases.","Pete Porrino","The only thing I would add to that is if you do look at our debt maturity schedule, you will see the first debt coming due in 2018. We talked about very modest repurchases of debt. I think that would continue to be the right guidance there.","Dan Farrell","And then a quick question on how to think about components of expense management. The corporate segment costs to be well controlled this quarter. As we think about costs getting taken now, if there is more coming out of corporate first and then some of the operating segment costs follow a little later or if there's no time to think about there? Thanks.","Pete Porrino","As you all know, we manage our costs on a total basis irregardless of whether they are corporate or in the insurance or reinsurance segment. That continues to that day. Corporate expenses as a percent of our total expenses went down this quarter after taking out the integration costs and transaction costs. I think it would probably make sense to you that you would expect to see that, right? We continued the push on retaining every underwriter that makes sense for us to retain. Clearly, there's more pressure on some of the more functional areas. I think you would see that reflected in, what I said, the corporate expenses being a lower percentage.","Mike McGavick","And corporate expenses also contain some of the larger strategic investments that we have made over time. Some of those are rationalized during the course of the transaction.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question.","Ian Gutterman","I guess to start, first, Greg, you went a little fast for me. I missed it. Was the 11% decline number you talked about, was that premium decline for the combined Catlin and XL reinsurance? What was that?","Greg Hendrick","If you took three months of 2014 XL Catlin together and three months of 2015. So it's XL Catlin to XL Catlin.","Ian Gutterman","That's what I thought. In the press release, I think it said down 3% ex Catlin. Does that imply to be a total 11 that Catlin was down well more than 11?","Greg Hendrick","Yes. That was where, as I refer to in my remarks, that was the impact of that multi-year accounting.","Ian Gutterman","Can you give a sense of what Catlin only was then ex the multi-year?","Greg Hendrick","I cannot do that at the moment. I will have to come back to you.","Ian Gutterman","Okay, got it. What I'm getting at big picture is, was there more pressure just based on -- not reception to the merger, but just business mix and the market conditions on the Catlin reinsurance top line than XL or was it similar for things were kind of apples to apples?","Greg Hendrick","Absolutely similar to both. The books have some nice diversification to them but they also have some overlap. This is purely how you book a three-year reinsurance treaty pre the May 1 acquisition and post the May 1 acquisition. Nothing to do with anything of a client or brokers view of the Catlin book.","Ian Gutterman","Pete, this is a request more than a question. The last two pages with the first half 2014 performance was helpful. Can we get that for second half of 2014, hopefully, before the third quarter call?","Pete Porrino","What I can tell you that you can't get, this is Pete again, is the third quarter. One thing that we're limited to is only to release those periods at which Catlin had released it publicly. They only released six months results and so we would not be able to do a nine-month number. To be honest, Ian, we haven't concluded. We'll want to talk to you and others and understand the value of that last two pages of the financial supplement.","Ian Gutterman","Okay, we can maybe discuss it offline. But I think it would be helpful to have -- maybe if I can ask this? I assume I can't take the reported Catlin 2014 numbers, subtract the first half Catlin you show and get to their second half because of accounting differences?","Pete Porrino","Right. You wouldn't be able to do that for one reason. For example, differences in corporate reporting. The other would be, former Catlin did not separate insurance and reinsurance.","Ian Gutterman","Right. We can follow-up on that offline. And then, the other one that I want to understand a little bit better, is there invested assets, invested income leverage is much lower than not just your P&C book but I think your traditional P&C book? Is there any color you can give on why the invested asset leverage is so low there?","Pete Porrino","There are two things. One's invested the leverage is lower because they wrote a shorter tail book of business than historical XL wrote. The other question, I think implied in that is the yield. We talked about it before. It was a very short duration asset book, even shorter than what the liabilities would have indicated.","Ian Gutterman","And then, Mike, I want to ask you sort of a bigger picture question I asked on another conference call about tangible book. This is becoming obviously a bigger issue for folks with all the deals going on. I want to get your thoughts on why tangible book's the most appropriate measure for XL because you seem to highlight that over reported book.","My premise of why I would disagree with that is, first of all, it seems every 8-K or proxy that comes out along the way, the goodwill's moved up or down $100 million, $200 million at a time. It seems just a concept of tangibles is a bit fuzzy to begin with as far as what the right number is. Isn't the better way to look at it, obviously XL in its past has had some deals that did not work out and it wasn't that the market didn't know and so you took a goodwill write off five years later.","We knew because your ROE wasn't good on reported book. If the Catlin deal works well, we'll know because you earn an appropriate ROE in the total capital invested. Not just the tangible capital invested. Why isn't ROE on total book and growth in total book a better measure for the company's success than tangible?","Mike McGavick","First of all, of course, you have all of those measures and you can judge as a shareholder which you are going to value the most. We have found, we think that the tangible book, the tangible capital is the better measure of what we're controlling and doing and a lot of the rest of this is the usual vagaries of the accounting rules around transactions. You can do it whatever way you want, Ian and I'm sure you do. I think the reality for us is that I think the tangible remains a better core measure of what decisions we're making with the capital available to us.","Pete Porrino","Other than enjoying reading the transcripts as this gets argued from company to company, we look at it both ways. When we do an acquisition, we look at it both ways and when we look at our reported results, we look at it both ways. I don't think one is better than the other. I think they serve two different purposes and you use them accordingly. I have been enjoying reading the transcripts.","Ian Gutterman","I will be happy to discuss it offline if you want. Thanks.","Mike McGavick","This is just more of a commentary on Pete than the rest of us. And Ian, on your earlier question, I've had a number of conversations with our finance group about how to report and a number of conversations with Pete. This is a very difficult thing. On one hand, we're always devoted to doing all we can to help you understand what is really going on in the book of business.","On the other hand, when we create reports that don't give us any insight, if in managing the company, it becomes very difficult to justify the expense, especially at a time of extreme imposition on our finance department and others to try and get the work done and the insight we need to actually judge the business day to day.","I'm sure you appreciate the tension that's created and we're doing our best we can to create what we think is meaningful information for you to use within the legal constraints of how companies actually report it over time and we'll continue to. But we're also mindful that we've got a finance department that is stretched and that will be stretched until the systems all come together over the next year or so. We have to be mindful of that too. And that's the direction I've given Pete is to balance it as carefully as possible. Do what we can but let's not create a lot of stuff that in the end, isn't useful as to us managing the business.","Operator","And your final question comes from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Ryan Tunis","Just one for Pete following up on Ian's question about the investment portfolio. It sounds like the asset duration there is a little bit lighter than liability duration. I was wondering if you could quantify what you think you could be running that duration at if it were matched? Along those lines, Pete, you also said that the pro forma portfolio will benefit from internal management. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that if that pertains to mix or anything along those lines?","Pete Porrino","Sure, Ryan, it's Pete. If we match duration, you'd probably be somewhere around 0.3 years, maybe slightly more than that. But I think that's a good ballpark. And then as far as the question about the internally managed, that really would be on the same assets that we have today. It would be taking and it has been pro forma Catlin, it has been doing it and we will be doing it at former XL. We haven't transitioned it quite yet. But it would be taking the more of the vanilla type of investments that are in the fixed income portfolio and managing those in house.","Ryan Tunis","And I was hoping for maybe for some help on thinking about a run rate for large losses. I'm not sure what you can give us there but is there a way to quantify what we can expect as a quarterly run rate? I know that was sort of an issue for Catlin. Any help there? Appreciate it.","Mike McGavick","We've looked at that question time and time again and never being able to come up with something that we thought would be very useful. We continue to have our own experience to show the kind of volatility we should expect in a book like this.","What we concentrate more on is making sure that our reinsurance strategies and our limit strategies are well meshed to create volatility the book can absorb. That I think we're having success around. But actually predicting a level across the various segments we have that have a propensity towards volatility, the volatility is too little spread across too many places that wind up yielding something that we think is very predictable our useful.","Operator","Thank you. I'm going to turn the call back over to the speakers.","Mike McGavick","Great. This is Mike. First of all, thank you very much. I know very well that given all of the noise that goes into the numbers at a time like this that you all are working even harder to try and understand this. We know that that complexity will decline over time as the results become clearer and become measured against themselves instead of against pro forma numbers.","We look forward to working through this with you as well as we can. We really do appreciate your for forbearance and thoughtfulness as we work through it. At the same time and I know here I'm particularly conscious that we always have a lot of our colleagues on the phone as well, we simply couldn't be prouder of what our colleagues are doing to get us through this transition in an effective way to make sure that we're fast and fair with our people and to make sure that our clients and brokers understand the strength of what we've created and why it is that we knowingly are going through something so complex to deliver something that we think is really special.","It's clear, the early reports are clear to me and I think clear in the numbers and clear across the market, that XL Catlin has been well received. It's viewed as a thoughtful and well-structured transaction. We're incredibly excited about what its potential is and we think we're starting to see some of that potential in this very quarter.","The real credit to that goes to the thousands of people on the ground dealing with clients and brokers and with each other's needs. We're very grateful for their hard work every day. Thanks everybody for the call and we'll look forward to the next report.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines."]}}
