All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers\u2019 prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself through asking one question during the Q&A session (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I hope the blizzard for those of you in the Northeast wasn\u2019t too disruptive. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We accomplished a lot during 2014 on many fronts, and we look forward to delivering once again for our shareholders in 2015. While 2014 was characterized by significant clinical data flow, 2015 will be characterized by regulatory submissions and new product launches.","So leading the call today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic report on our performance in 2014 and outlook for 2015. Following Bob, our CFO David Meline, will then review our Q4 and full year results and address financial guidance for 2015. Tony Hooper, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, will discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that we see going forward. And finally, Sean Harper, our Head of R&D, will provide a pipeline update. After Sean\u2019s comments, we should have ample time for Q&A.","We will use slides for presentation today. These slides have been posted on our Web site and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says, that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bradway","Thank you, Arvind. And thank all of you for joining our call this afternoon. 2014 was really an outstanding year for us. And let me start with the financial highlights, which include revenue growth of 7%, enabling us to eclipse $20 billion for the first time. Consistent with our international expansion objectives, sales outside of the U.S. grew by double-digit rates in 2014.","Our adjusted operating income growth of 22% reflects our commitment to generating operating leverage from our business. As you know, one of our objectives for 2014 was to deliver to shareholders $800 million of improved profitability from Enbrel. We exceeded that objective in 2014. In addition, our free cash flow grew by 40% to $7.8 billion. This strong financial performance and our confidence in the longer-term outlook enabled us to increase our dividend by 30% in 2014 and by 30% again for 2015 while increasing our stock buyback plans as well.","Turning now to our progress with innovation. We had an extraordinary flow of data from our pipeline of 2014. We generated positive pivotal data for six innovative programs and submitted four of them for regulatory approvals. To remind you, this includes filings for two immuno-oncolocy molecules, BLINCYTO and T-VEC and two cardiovascular molecules, evolocumab and ivabradine.","In December, we received FDA approval for two products, including BLINCYTO and our on-body injector for Neulasta. BLINCYTO is an immuno-oncolocy agent, which addresses an important need for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, who currently have very limited options. More generally, we\u2019re excited about the proof-of-concept represented by this approval and look forward to progressing our BiTE programs in other forms of cancer as well. On our on-body injector for Neulasta also represents an important innovation for cancer patients, and one which will help improve patient experience for those undergoing chemotherapy and at high risk of infection.","I\u2019d like to point out of course that launches are now already underway for both of these products. But 2014 was a watershed year for us in research and development, 2015 is sure to be another important year starting with the prospects of launching three additional innovative products, including evolocumab of course for hypercholesterolemia, ivabradine for heart failure and T-VEC for metastatic melanoma. And in addition to these launches in 2015, we expect regulatory submissions for Kyprolis, which we announced earlier today, blinatumomab and potentially AMG 416 as well as the start of a Phase 3 program for AMG 334 in migraine and Phase 3 readouts from two of our biosimilar programs.","As we discussed in July and October, we began last year the process of transforming our Company. And importantly, we initiated this from a position of strength. David will update you momentarily on our progress with that transformation and the benefits achieved in 2014. We\u2019re on track, as reflected in our $1.5 billion growth in operating income and 6 point operating margin improvement last year, even while absorbing the full year impact of Onyx and investing in our launch opportunities. Across our Company, we\u2019ll continue our transformation efforts in 2015 and deliver more progress against our long-term objectives.","Before I hand it over to David, let me thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call for their unwavering focus on delivering for patients and for shareholders. David?","David Meline","Thanks Bob. Turning to the fourth quarter on page five of the slide deck, revenues grew to 5.3 billion, by 6% year-over-year, with 8% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues at a 187 million decreased by 55 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting a reduced level of partnership payments received for Brodalumab compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Adjusted operating income at 2 billion grew 15% from prior year. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.9% improved by point 1 points. Research and development expenses at 1.2 billion were flat versus prior year and included the 60 million upfront payment to Kite Pharma for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration.","SG&A expenses were flat year-on-year. On October 31, 2014, the Company passed the one-year anniversary of the first step-down in Enbrel related payments. This resulted in a year-over-year expense decline of approximately 100 million in Q4. This compares to year-over-year expense declines of approximately 250 million per quarter in the first three quarters of 2014. Additionally, we incurred incremental expenses in Q4 in preparation for new product launches. These increased investments were offset through savings from our transformation to a more focused operating model as well as through the reduced Enbrel related payments. Other income and expenses were flat year-over-year at 173 million in the quarter.","The tax rate was 10.2% for the quarter, a 2.5 point decrease versus Q4 2013. This decrease was primarily due to the favorable tax benefit from the extension of the 2014 Federal R&D tax credit, which occurred in Q4 of 2014 which was offset partially by unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income increased 20% and adjusted earnings per share increased 19%.","In summary, our fourth quarter results from operations were in line with our previous expectations, while overall results in the quarter benefited from the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was approved in late December and has been removed from our previous guidance. You\u2019ll find a summary of our 2014 full year results on page six of the presentation.","Our 2014 full year revenues grew 7% to 20.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $8.70 per share. Product sales grew 6% year-over-year and other revenues increased by 252 million over the same period a year ago, primarily driven by our Nexavar and Stivarga partnerships.","For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to 8.5 billion, a 22% increase based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with stable operating expenses, which were down 1% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, cost of sales margin was flat at 15.8% year-over-year; research and development expenses increased 5%, driven by the addition of Onyx and support for later stage clinical programs. These increases were offset partially by lower spending associated with marketed product support.","SG&A expenses were down 10%, driven primarily by reduced Enbrel related expenses, offset partially by the addition of Onyx and increased commercial expenses in preparation for new product launches. Other income and expenses were unfavorable 7% year-over-year due to higher interest expense and portfolio rebalancing, partially offset by higher interest income.","The tax rate was 14.9% for the full year, up 5.7 points versus 2013. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable resolution in 2013 of our federal income tax audit, as well as the retroactive extension of the 2012 Federal R&D tax credit in 2013. During 2014, the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax was 1.9 points higher in cost of sales and 3.3 points lower in our adjusted tax rate. We would expect the similar impact to continue through 2017.","Turning to page seven, I would like to take a moment to provide an update on Amgen\u2019s transformation initiatives, which we previously discussed at our July and October 2014 investor events. 2015 marks an exciting year as we are in full execution mode towards our focused operating model. We are advancing a number of key initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiency and improve operating performance. We also have completed and largely implemented the first phase of reductions and workforce announced in July, which will total approximately 3,000, and have made significant progress on reducing our facilities\u2019 footprint towards the 23% goal.","In terms of the 2014 impact, all areas of operating expense benefited as our transformation to a focused operating model began to generate cost efficiencies. In 2014, we realized approximately 300 million of cost savings towards our 1.5 billion goal. This includes lower labor cost from workforce reductions and sales force optimization. It also includes lower external expenses from improved contracting and sourcing and rationalizing discretionary spend categories.","In 2015, we expect incremental savings of at least 400 million. This will in large part be driven by the annualization of savings following the reductions in workforce, which occurred in late 2014. It also includes greater use of shared services and further external spend improvements, resulting from the rigorous transformation initiatives developed over the past year. These savings will be redeployed to underwrite launch investments and one-time transition cost incurred as part of the transformation implementation.","As a result of revenue growth and expense discipline in 2015, we will further improve adjusted operating margins on the trajectory to our 2018 target of 52% to 54% through improved operating leverage. We will continue to provide periodic updates on our transformation progress going forward.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page eight. Based on our confidence in the performance of the business going forward, we announced a commitment to return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018, while continuing to invest strongly in our business. For the full year 2014, we generated 7.8 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 2.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher sales and profitability as well as improvements in working capital, a portion of which are permanent.","As a result of this strong cash flow performance total debt outstanding declined to 30.7 billion and total cash and investments increased to 27 billion; as a result, net debt improved by 5.6 billion to 3.7 billion at year end 2014. Additionally, for 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 30% to $0.61 with payments totaling 1.9 billion. We also announced another 30% increase to the dividend to $0.79 per share, starting with our first quarter 2015 payment.","Finally, at our October meeting, we indicated the intent to accelerate the re-initiation of our share repurchase program with up to 2 billion of repurchases by the end of 2015. In the fourth quarter, we took a first step towards this commitment with 153 million deployed to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped up level in 2015. At the end of 2014, we had approximately 3.8 billion remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program.","I will now turn to guidance for 2015, please turn to page nine. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2015 guidance at our October business review. In terms of what has changed since that time, we completed 2014 with solid in line operating performance with full year results of 7% revenue growth, 22% adjusted operating income growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth. With this background, we remain confident in the outlook for 2015, despite additional potential foreign exchange headwinds.","Today, we are reaffirming our 2015 revenue guidance of 20.8 million to 21.3 million, adjusted tax rate of 18% to 19%, which excludes the benefit of the Federal R&D tax credit in 2015 and adjusted earnings per share of $9.05 to $9.40 a share. Finally, capital expenditures are planned at 800 million this year.","This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Hooper","Thank you, David. And good afternoon folks, you\u2019ll find the summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter starting on Slide number 11. The underlying prescription demand remains strong as we enter 2015. In 2014, the majority of products grew in volume terms across both the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets in quarter four as well on a full year basis. Globally products sales grew 8% year-over-year and 6% for the full year. Our international business grew 11% in the fourth quarter excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.","Our new and emerging markets delivered just over 1 billion in sales in 2014. So far the first quarter of 2015 is playing out as anticipated. We\u2019re on track for the full year and let me remind you that products like Prolia and Enbrel historically experienced slower first quarters. In accessing quarter-over-quarter performance, it\u2019s important to note U.S. wholesale inventory dynamics. On average wholesale inventory levels return to normal from rather low levels at the end of quarter three. There are some exceptions on the product basis which I\u2019ll cover later.","Let me now turn to the fourth quarter performance beginning with Enbrel. Enbrel delivered strong growth of 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Underlying demand remains strong as both the rheumatology and dermatology statements grew on a value basis by 24%. As expected in the fourth quarter, we saw inventory level increased from the relatively low levels reported in quarter three. Quarter four ended with approximately $40 million higher wholesale inventories a month.","We expect to see the drill down of the slide build along with the typical seasonality in the first quarter. We remain confident in the value potential of Enbrel and expect to continue to drive meaningful growth during 2015.","Now turn to our Filgrastim franchise starting with Neulasta. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 7% in the fourth quarter. The growth was driven mainly by price and to a lesser extent unit demand which included the benefit of the commercial rights we\u2019ve acquired outside of the U.S. from Roche as part of our international expansion strategy. As Bob said, the FDA recently approved the Neulasta on-body injector and we look forward to bringing this innovative product to patients in the U.S. shortly. The Neulasta on-body injector better serves patient needs and provides important differentiation from the potential future competition.","Next NEUPOGEN, which declined 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to banded short-acting competition in the U.S. as well as unfavorable changes in inventory levels and foreign exchange rates. Like Neulasta this was partially offset by the benefit of the commercial rights we acquired from Roche. In the U.S., 15 months since the launch of its first new competitor NEUPOGEN has obtained over 8% share of the short-acting segment. The balance of the market is split between Granix and Leukine. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN\u2019s long track record of clinical efficacy and reliable supply to patients.","With potential competition from bio-similars expected in the U.S., we will leverage the success we\u2019ve had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN bio-similars in Europe.","I\u2019ll now move to our Denosumab franchise starting with Prolia. Prolia delivered 33% growth year-over-year as we continue to capture share in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., unit share grew 6 percentage points over the year exiting at 19% in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong response from our DTC campaign with 1 in 3 patients who start postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment being prescribed Prolia.","In Europe, we completed the buyback of the Prolia rights from GSK and transitioned the entire business to Amgen. We now also have reimbursement across all EU countries. Unit share grew 4 percentage points over the year exiting at 13% in the fourth quarter. Both the U.S and Europe have opportunity for continued growth. XGEVA continues to capture share in the U.S. and EU markets and we expect to see continued segment share throughout 2015. U.S unit share increased 4 percentage points over the year and is now just under half segment. In Europe unit share increased 8 percentage points over the year and is now just over one-third of the European market.","Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA\u2019s superior clinical profile. Vectibix grew 29% year-over-year and continues to show strong unit growth across all regions, gaining share in first line metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe.","Now let me turn to Kyprolis which delivered year-over-year growth of 25% following the acquisition of Onyx in Quarter 4 2013. Quarter-over-quarter we saw continued unit growth at 6% in the U.S. but overall med sales declined slightly due to an inventory drawdown. Kyprolis continued to maintain leading share in the third-line of multiple myeloma setting.","As announced earlier, I am delighted that we completed the submission of the regulatory applications with treatment relapse multiple myeloma in both the U.S. and Europe. Getting this into the label in the U.S. and launching in Europe would be the next major inflexion point for Kyprolis. We look forward to enabling more patients to benefit from Kyprolis following these regulatory approvals.","Next is EPOGEN, which grew 3% year-over-year, increases in price were offset by year-end declines. Fourth quarter 2013 volume included a few large customer buy-ins that did not occur in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our net sales grew 2% year-over-year, with unit growth from a few large customer buy-ins in the U.S. Sensipar for year-over-year growth of 3%, as 10% unit growth and higher prices were offset by low inventory levels. Nplate continues to grow in both the U.S. and European markets driving 7% unit growth, quarter four was negatively impacted by inventory declines.","Lastly BLINCYTO, we are pleased with the initial launch of BLINCYTO following a swift FDA approval in December. Physician and patient responses are indicative of the significant unmet need for patients with relapsed and refractory ALL. Regarding our coming launches, I\u2019d like to share with you that our cardiovascular specialty sales force is now in place. Focusing on disease state awareness and profiling target statements.","We look forward to launching Corlanor, the new brand name for ivabradine in U.S. and Repatha, the new global brand name for evolocumab later this year. We see a significant opportunity to address unmet need with these two medicines. In the U.S., over 1 million medically eligible chronic heart failure patients could benefit from Corlanor treatment once approved. In the U.S., Europe and Japan over 25 million people had risk for cardiovascular disease have LDL above a 100 grams per deciliter despite current treatments and could benefit from Repatha once approved.","In closing, I am confident in the strength of our underlying business. I\u2019d like to thank the Amgen teams around the world for their outstanding performance in 2014. Looking forward, our focus in 2015 will be three fold. Firstly, to build on the performance of growth product such as Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. Secondly, to successfully defend our mature brands for potential new bio-similars and branded competition. And thirdly, to launch several important new medicines.","Let me now pass it to Sean.","Sean Harper","Thanks, Tony and good afternoon. 2014 was a very productive year for R&D. And the last several months have been eventful as well with one regulatory highlight being the FDA approval of BLINCYTO in a remarkable 2.5 months after initial submission. I\u2019d like to thank the FDA and Amgen staff who worked tirelessly to drive this outcome. BLINCYTO will provide patients with a breakthrough therapy for a terrible disease relapsed\/refractory, acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL and clearly validates our BiTE immune-oncology platform. We look forward to introducing our next BiTE AMG 330 into the clinic directly that acute myeloid leukaemia later this year.","We were also very pleased to receive FDA approval for the novel On-Body injection system for Neulasta, which will help address the issue of having to administer Neulasta no sooner than 24 hours following chemotherapy, which can be difficult for cancer patients and interfere with optimal use of the product. As we announced today, we have submitted marketing applications for Kyprolis in the U.S. and Europe for relapsed multiple myeloma, based on the inspired which as you know was presented in detail at the ASH meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine late last year. We look forward to working with regulators to make Kyprolis available to patients with earlier stage relapsed multiple myeloma global.","Two of our submission is under review by FDA did receive three month extensions to their target action dates. T-VEC for metastatic melanoma and Corlanor or ivabradine for chronic heart failure. In the case T-VEC the agency requested additional manufacturing data for this very unique product, which may require additional review time. In the case of Corlanor the agency requested more of the existing clinical data and we originally agreed for our heart failure specific submission, also potentially requiring the additional review time.","We provided the data for both programs as requested and we continue to work productively with regulators to bring these innovative medicines to the patients that need them as soon as possible. For Repatha or evolocumab, our coronary Intra Vascular Ultrasound study which is critical for the product has completed enrollment. And our outcome study continues to enroll very well. We\u2019re also working closely with regulators on our filings. We\u2019ll also be presenting some new analyses from our evolocumab clinical program at the upcoming American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions including analyses of cardiovascular events in our ongoing open label extension studies.","AMG 334, our CGRP receptor antibody performed very nicely in the Phase 2b dose ranging study in patients with episodic migraine is taking our decision to move aggressively into Phase 3 later this year. This data will be presented at the scientific forum in the first-half of this year. Our Phase 2b dose ranging study in chronic migraine is currently enrolling. We feel AMG 334 has the clear potential to be a best-in-class agent for migraines prophylaxis with a favorable dose and the schedule as a result of locking receptor rather than the ligand. We generated positive data from three Phase 3 psoriasis studies of Brodalumab our IL-17 receptor antibody in 2014 including two studies that demonstrated superiority to Stelara and we and our partners at AstraZeneca plan to file this data later this year. We also expect Phase 3 head-to-head data for AMG 416 our intravenous calcimimetic again Sensipar in the first half of this year.","This year we will also be viewing the results of our Phase 2b study with the oral formulation in AMG 423 or omecamtiv mecarbil, the innovative cardiac myocenyte data that we are developing with cytokinetics. These data will be critical in informing our decisions on advancing AMG 423 into Phase 3.","Turning to our oncology pipeline. In addition to our T-VEC combination study with Ipilimumab, we\u2019ve initiated a combination metastatic melanoma study with T-VEC and Merck\u2019s PD-1 antibody and are in the planning stage for additional such combination checkpoint inhibitor studies in other tumor types.","We presented BLINCYTO Phase 2 data from both minimal residual disease positive patients with ALL and our pivotal relapsed refractory study in ALL at ASH along with Phase 2 data from our lymphoma study. We also presented data from Vectibix Phase 2 peak study and Phase 3 prime studies supporting our approval for first line use with FOLFOX and metastatic colorectal cancer at the ASCO annual meeting and ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. And we terminated our Trebananib program directed against the angiopoietan axis in recurring ovarian cancer as well as our rilotumumab program directed against stomata access in gastric cancer due to disappointing results.","Our recently announced collaboration with Kite Pharma on CAR T-cell technology complements our existing BiTE and oncolytic virus platforms, broadening our overall immunotherapy capabilities. We have a very robust damage and discovery program in Amgen and the tight collaboration provides another modality we can employ against these targets in both liquid and solid tumors.","Our bio-similars programs are advancing with Phase 3 data for our Humira bio-similar in moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis expected this quarter and Phase 3 data for our Avastin bio-similar in advanced non-small cell lung cancer expected in the second half of this year.","Finally I\u2019d like to recognize the strong execution of the R&D organization in delivering for patients. 2014 was an unprecedented year for Amgen in terms of the volume of pivotal data and regulatory submissions with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones ahead of us 2015. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Thank you, Sean. Marvin I think we\u2019re ready for Q&A if you\u2019d like to remind our callers of the process for the question-and-answer session please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","So I have two things I want to ask. So first on NEUPOGEN, I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about Teva having single-digit shares, sounds like they\u2019re down to double-digits and if I look back on some of the other quarters where you\u2019re doing this unit growth the second and the third quarter you were down maybe 7 to 8 percentage points in unit growth and you\u2019ve grow to 11. So just wonder what\u2019s happening there? Are you seeing additional traction from competitors?","And then separately can you just comment a little bit on FX? I know you said you\u2019re keeping your guidance in light of increasing FX. Just walk us through from a top line and bottom line perspective any hedging that you do? And any offsets that you have there?","Bob Bradway","Sure Matt, why don\u2019t we take that two part question in two parts? We\u2019ll start with Tony and then David can answer your FX question.","Tony Hooper","So Matt it\u2019s Tony. Some of the discussions we have in the past have referred to Granix\u2019s market share as a percentage of the overall Filgrastim market which was within the low-single digits. This quarter we\u2019ve actually split out the both, short-acting and long-acting. So there has been no dramatic change in the fourth quarter the same trend has continued as we\u2019ve seen throughout the year.","Bob Bradway","And on FX, David.","David Meline","So framing the FX question a couple of context points, one is Amgen has about 75% of its sales currently are in the U.S. and 25% are non-U.S. So, these are the other global companies we have a relatively more limited level of exposure. Secondly, we have a three year rolling hedge program. So, we\u2019re able to significantly offset in the short-term foreign exchange movements in plus or minus. And if you then look at where we are in terms of rates on a current basis, if you look at the year-over-year effect on revenue if we were to stay at the current exchange rates through the balance of 2015 that would have about $250 million impact unfavorable year-over-year. So about 1 percentage point in revenue and about $0.05 a share versus what we\u2019ve given as our original guidance. So with that in mind, we felt that it would be appropriate given the range that we\u2019re working with and other developments that we felt it appropriate to maintain our existing guidance, despite those potential headwinds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","If I might for Sean on the migraine antibody 334, I noticed during the prepared comments you said that you thought you may have a better dosing interval or schedule than competitors. I think Teva, they are targeting the ligand. I think Teva also has a two monthly dose ongoing. So I was wondering maybe if you could expand on your rationale for that statement if possible, Sean please. And then also the filing strategy for that molecule, can you discuss what the FDA requires for episodic versus chronic, if those need to be linked in the filing or if you think you can do it separately?","Sean Harper","Yes, I think -- I don\u2019t know the details of course of the Teva program beyond what\u2019s in the public domain. But the bottom line is it\u2019s just that this client here is very clear in terms of the relative potency of these approaches. And this has been true kind of on first principles. It\u2019s true in animal models. We\u2019re seeing the same thing in clinic. So it\u2019s likely that that is difficult to overcome. There is a receptor antagonist that's just a more efficient and potent way to address this particular biology, and I think that will translate into a situation where the amount of drug that has to be administered presumably subcutaneously will be an issue for the final product profiles, and I expect us to have the most favorable profile with respect to that, just basically on those dose principles. So we\u2019ll see how it plays out. But that\u2019s what I would expect.","We haven\u2019t had our end of Phase 2 discussions with the agencies yet because we just saw the data quite recently. It\u2019s clear that both episodic and chronic migraine are separate regulatory entities and that you can have an approval. For example Botox is approved in chronic and not in episodic. You can have separate approvals. Whether the programs can be prosecuted together with some kind of efficiencies, and how to coordinate those activities is something that we will be exploring with regulators. So it\u2019s a good question. We just don\u2019t have the advice from those interactions yet.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt ","Another one for Sean. It sounds like you\u2019re getting fairly deep in the FDA review prices for Corlanor, pvec and even Repatha. Have you been informed for any of those three molecules that you\u2019ll need an ad comp to it?","Sean Harper","Yes, so we have discussions with the agencies about the possibilities of ad comps. Generally speaking when you're doing innovative new mechanism work in the United States, you can -- the default would typically be to have, but we always agree with the agencies not to disclose anything about their intentions until it's in the federal register. So we can\u2019t comment on the direction they're going with those right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee ","Obviously topical of mind is a lot of context around pricing and what managed care is doing these days. So to the extent we have a multi-billion dollar [indiscernible] product in the future, maybe you could comment to us on how discussions with payers works with that type of molecule pre-outcomes versus post-outcomes and so called value or non-value of the so called exclusive contracts? Maybe you can offer some perspective around those debates.","Bob Bradway","Yes, thanks Michael. I'll let Tony, address that question. ","Tony Hooper","Michael, Amgen sees both payers and providers as being essential part of our customer base and we interact with them on a daily basis, both about our products and about the contract with our products. The payers often request information about Amgen\u2019s investigational products in anticipation of upcoming launches so they can make coverage decisions. In these situations, appropriate personnel from our medical team respond to the enquiries in a balanced scientifically rigorous manner, consistent with the FDA guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terrence Flynn ","Maybe just wondering -- it's a two part question. Just wondering if you can offer your perspectives on the bar for interchangeability following the FDA panel on about the biosimilar NEUPOGEN product earlier this month, and wondering if that's something you pursue for your drugs. And then any thoughts on indication extrapolation for both Humira and Avastin, your biosimilars and what can you tell us there? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay, thanks Terrence, Sean why don\u2019t you get those questions.","Sean Harper","Yes, so I think the interchangeability in the United States is clearly going to take a little bit longer than achieving biosimilarity through regulatory files and the agency has been pretty clear about that. I think that all companies, including will of course seek to have that kind of status for the product. It's just a question of what are the rules and guidance and onerous is it go through the process of trying to achieve that.","The indication extrapolation is something that we do expect to be up in the general rule. So there may be exceptions to it, but we found generally in Europe that it was the way that things shook out and it is a reasonably scientifically sound concept to have an extrapolation across syndications. But sometimes there are indications in which the pharmacokinetic exposure response relationship is not as clear, and in those cases some additional data can be required.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Company Representative","Robyn are you there?","Robyn Karnauskas","All right. So one house keeping. Is PCSK9 included in your guidance and how do we think about Enbrel given the color you gave going into the fourth quarter. And the big picture question for biosimilars. There is a company discussing how you haven\u2019t had IP around your Humira drug and manufacturing process and that you could hurt you on the filing against ABI during the 180 day period where you can -- they could assert their IP. How do we think about your filing timelines for Humira and how you decided to protect yourself against -- finally against the formulation? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Well, there's lots of questions in there, Robyn. Let\u2019s see whether we can get those. First, is PCSK9 included in our outlook for the year? Yes it is. Second, I wasn\u2019t clear when you were asking for on Enbrel. Can you reframe the question? You said how we should think about Enbrel given what we -- the guidance we gave from the fourth quarter. Is that right, Robyn?","Unidentified Company Representative","Robyn, did we lose you again. ","Robyn Karnauskas","By our map Enbrel sales were positively impacted about $200 million this quarter owing [ph] the inventories. So where does the inventory stand for Enbrel versus normal ranges sort of what was I asking about for the year.","Tony Hooper","So let me answer that one Robyn. It's Tony. As I said we think there was about $40 million of additional inventory that happened in the fourth quarter, and that $40 million will work its way out of the first quarter. But we continue to have very positive views on Enbrel 2015. ","Bob Bradway","With respect to our biosimilar programs for Humira and the other molecules that we\u2019re seeking to advance, the other eight molecules, we\u2019re obviously very attentive to the intellectual property and the statutes that exist to enable us to advance a biosimilar program, and you should expect we'll be complaint with those statutes first statue some, and we provided a guidance and we think we would be launching our first biosimilar by 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America.","Ying Huang ","First one to which extent does your 2015 guidance bake in the potential biosimilar competition for NEUPOGEN? And then with will your litigation against Novartis Sandoz delay or even prevent marketing of [indiscernible]. And then another question is, for pieces came out even larger amount. During your discussion with the payers, would you actually go down to path of pursuing exclusive formulary against the other player? ","Bob Bradway","Okay. Ying, again, let\u2019s take that in two parts. Why don\u2019t I take the first part? Our 2015 guidance includes our expectations across the product portfolio, including the prospect of competition for NEUPOGEN. With respect to your specific question about the lawsuit versus Novartis and Sandoz, our subsidiary Sandoz, we\u2019re not going to speculate on the outcome of that litigation. As you know that\u2019s going to make it way to the court. And Tony if you want to address the PCSK9.","Tony Hooper","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going be talking about our rebating strategy or contracting strategy at this particular stage. We come to market with a drug as a unique and definitive value proposition. We're price accordingly and obviously the rebating complex are essential to get a preferred position on formulary.","Bob Bradway","So Marvin let\u2019s take the next question. But before you do I would just like to request that everybody limit themselves to one question, just to be sure that we can get through with everybody that's lined up. Let\u2019s go ahead with the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. ","Geoffrey Porges ","The question, David, could you just comment on your tax rate guidance for last two years? You've kind of had a windfall in the fourth quarter from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit? Could you give us a sense of what your full year tax rate guidance would be, if we assume that the R&D tax credit was indeed reinstated?","David Meline","Sure. So if you look at the impact on the annual basis of the R&D tax credit, it\u2019s about a percentage point for Amgen. So hence this quarter the gross positive impact was about 4 points, which then netted the 2.5 as I mentioned in the call. Vut I think from a planning perspective we said 18% to 19% for 2015 ex-R&D. So that would a point less if the R&D credit were to be approved again this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matt Roden","Tony you\u2019ve mentioned your confidence in Enbrel outlook for 2015. Maybe can you talk a little bit about the dermatology and rheumatology market share, where it stands; how its changed on a year-on-year basis and how you would expect the Enbrel could be potentially impacted by the IL-17 launching in derm?","Tony Hooper","Okay, so as you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, the market continues to grow double digit. Enbrel has been losing market share in both rheumatology and dermatology. From an actual unit perspective we continue to show positive unit growth and we\u2019ve been in a position to drive some of the pricing in the marketplace. From a derm perspective, we take all competition seriously, but the Enbrel as you know has been in the market for 15 years now. And when you treating psoriasis, it\u2019s a long-term chronic disease, and then both efficacy and safety are important for patients. And patients do switch backwards and forwards. So we continue to see a clear place for Enbrel in the marketplace, in spite of the new competition.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","Following up on this derm subject, this morning we heard Novartis talk a lot, at least relatively speaking about the potential of Cosentyx and the IL-17 pathway. So can you just remind us the differences you see between it and Brodalumab and how you see the competitive dynamic playing out there?","Bob Bradway","Sean, why don\u2019t you feel that question.","Sean Harper","I think that the data that we generated with Brodalumab will be included in our filing. Both head to head to Stelara and in placebo controlled trials have generated the best kind of skin clearance data that's significant for any agent and that\u2019s been tested in the disease. Now that said, we don\u2019t obviously have head-to-head data against the other IL-17 molecules, but I think that the general impression that people -- the experts in the field that look at the datasets have is that efficacy of Brodalumab is unmatched in the class so far with the data that\u2019s been generated. So I think that\u2019s probably the key kind of differentiating. Remember this of course is a receptor blocking antibody rather than a ligand sequester and we know there are multiple ligands for the receptor. So it is possible that one we see differences in efficacy. That was always our hope, was that would be the most efficacious approach to this particular access. So we\u2019ll have to get all our data packaged together into a label and then I'll just leave Tony to talk about the competitive environment. But my sense is there may be some differentiation largely on efficacy.","Tony Hooper","I think once we see the labels of all products in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber","I have a question sort of on the epo-franchise. So Roche is now currently testing Mircera at [indiscernible] Clinic sort of what [indiscernible] did back in the days, and as ASPIRE just filed their generic epo for approval. So can you just remind us your agreement with DaVita, does it, if I remember correctly guarantee them? Is this a best price in the market for the epo based on share to 2018? If you don\u2019t mind, just refresh us from that? And then just your thoughts on what have been for biosimilars when you\u2019re looking at two different indications like CKD dialysis and oncology? Is that something that they can get a single label across all through diseases? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","So let me answer those questions one by one. Probably I'll ask Sean to take the last one. From a contract perspective we haven\u2019t made the details of our contract with DaVita, public but the contract is an exclusive contract which extends to 2018. As regards to Mircera, we understand from public statements that Roche had said that they made the product commercially available; but we have not seen any impact on our business yet as regards to the Mircera entry to the marketplace. Sean?","Sean Harper","Again, I think it will differ case by case by different molecules, what the agency holds as approval standards. In general again the default would be indication extrapolation, but it won\u2019t be true in all circumstances.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.","Josh Schimmer","I was hoping you could discuss the expected cadence of adoption and the eventual penetration levels you may be looking for? But [ph] in the last auto injector and for Corlanor, is there respective markets? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","He was asking penetration from the On-Body injector for Neulasta.","Sean Harper","So let me take those two together. As we look at the marketplace, we know that there are a number of patients that really struggle to come back for injections of Neulasta post chemo, including patients who receive drug on a Friday. We estimate -- I think patients get in the region about 4.4 cycles for chemo, which is way beyond what it should be. So there's fairly large group of patients who benefit definitively from access to the On-Body injector. We\u2019ll be launching this in the not too distant future and will be looking to switch as much of the business is possible to the injector. When I think about Corlanor, Corlanor as you know is an interesting product that will be used as an add-on to existing standard of care. Irrespective of what the standard of care is the product will augment the value and help manage patients with heart failure. So we know exactly where the heart failure clinics are and we know how large the unmet medical need is, and the cardiovascular team that are presently in place are busy segmenting the market as we speak.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Sean, I have a couple of related ones on Kyprolis. When you look beyond the label expansion, would you say that endeavor represents the next inflection point for the product and does recent data at the ASH meeting change your view on the hurdle for that study or other head-to-head studies?","Sean Harper","Yes, I think ASPIRE was of course really an important study for the molecule in and of itself and it performs as well as we could -- one could reasonably expect. Always the question has been how do they compare head-to-head to velcaid. And I think it never will be the first example of that question. And then of course we\u2019ll see clearing, which will look at that same question in the first line setting. I think we continue to have the same point of view that we've since we acquired Onyx -- even before we acquired Onyx which is we believe that Kyprolis is the best-in-class Porteous inhibitor and so we\u2019re looking forward to seeing the results of these studies overtime.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird and Company.","Chris Raymond","I wanted to just expand a little bit on your comments to an earlier question on the ESA franchise and specifically on Epo. I know you guys have talked pretty openly about the Fresenius pilot program that\u2019s going on right now, but it seems from what they're saying that they're moving on pretty quickly here. And I can\u2019t imagine you'd want to talk about specific customer discussions, but given that they are such a big player in the U.S., I wonder if you could maybe frame the situation for us. I know it's probably within the realm of your guidance, but come July 1, is there any scenario perhaps where you might want to revisit sort of what your thinking is on Epo? And maybe just again put some brackets around the range of outcomes here?","Tony Hooper","So this is Tony. The guidance we gave in October included the knowledge that Mesaro will be coming to market. We have competed with Mesaro in the European market now for about five years. They hold between 8% and 10% of the marketplace. As I said we saw no impact yet on our business in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.","Eun Yang","In 2011 you guys expected total [indiscernible] sales to be around $3 billion to $4 billion in 2015 and current sales run rate is tracking below $3 billion. So can you comment on what changed sort of your original expectation?","Bob Bradway","Sure, we\u2019re taking it in two parts Eun. Obviously as you know, we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making with [indiscernible] both in fully Prolia setting for [ph] osteoporosis and of course XGEVA in oncology. I think the international pricing took longer than we thought for Prolia. So if anything has changed since the original guidance, it was that. Fundamentally we still think this is going to be a big product that continues to grow in the way Tony described, and Tony I\u2019ll invite you to elaborate on the outlook for Prolia initiative in there. ","Tony Hooper","So as we continue to watch the marketplace and look at the new na\u00efve or by na\u00efve patients, our market-share on new patients to drug is continually higher than our normal PRH share. We see our share of new patient at about 30% of the market and our actual in market-share of about 19% in the U.S. So as you extrapolate those two, there continues to be room for growth as these patients move in and get their second and third injections.","Bob Bradway","And furthermore the long-term safety and efficacy data continue to be very encouraging for the products. So we continue to think this is a source of growth on the way we outlined earlier on the call.","Tony Hooper","We now have a [indiscernible] safety data in the label, just concerning what Bob just said. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra","Which regard to biosimilars, given your relatively unique decisions being [indiscernible], I'd be interested in your view on the defense mechanism of the originator and regulatory and legal perspective and then flipping that on it's head, how your biosimilars programs could circumvent these defense mechanisms, and linked that very specifically on Humira, there has been a little bit of chatter on the frequency of dosing patters, that I believe [ph] has your comment [indiscernible] defense mechanism would be appreciated as well.","Tony Hooper","Okay Ravi, I guess the couple of points. First, we\u2019ve said for some time that we felt there was benefit from -- for both our innovative products and for our new potential biosimilar products that we participate in both aspects of the market. So through time what we have found is that we continue to learn about our own innovative process development efforts et cetera by virtue of the work that we\u2019re doing in our biosimilar program. And I think our dialog with the regulators around the world is enhanced by the fact that we\u2019re recognized to be both an innovator and the Company that\u2019s seeking to advance biosimilar molecules. So we\u2019ll continue to work both sides of this. We have nine biosimilar molecules that are advancing successfully through the clinic and we continue to believe that this will be a large revenue opportunity for us.","So, again with respect to any individual program and the biosimilar to Humira, in particular as we\u2019ve generated Phase 3 -- positive Phase 3 data already. We added on this call that we expect another dataset early in the year and we look forward to having all of that data and filing that as a projected biosimilar alternative to proprietary evolocumab. So, we think we're in good shape there and we look forward to having the data and being able to file it with the regulators.","Bob Bradway","Hey Morgan, as we are going the past the hour, why don\u2019t we take two more questions?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities.","Ian Somaiya","Just a question on the biosimilars, maybe versus typically on potential for interchangeability. I think you had mentioned couple of weeks ago that the FDA might require switch studies in the originator drug to the biosimilar drug to get comfortable on ImmunoGen, sort of your potential for ImmunoGen. I was wondering if there any other clinical trial requirements that you feel the FDA could place before allowing a drug to get interchangeability claim?","Sean Harper","This is Sean. I think that the agency is still very much working internally on their thoughts about interchangeability. That\u2019s the sense I had. They have not put out the same level of clear written guidance that they have for example for achieving biosimilarity. I think that they are in discussion about this with various sponsors. And the switching issue is one that they\u2019ve identified and that make certain first principle sense. It\u2019s hard for me to speculate really about what other requirements they might put in place beyond demonstrating it is possible to switch patients back and forth between the agents without any untold effects.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink.","Howard Liang ","Thanks very much. I have a question on the Proteasome inhibitor franchise. With regard to [indiscernible] they will likely would put data sometime this year. How do you -- do you see impact on Kyprolis and then how do you feel about your own oral Proteasome inhibitor, oprozomib?","Sean Harper","So, this is Sean. I think we\u2019re interested in pursuing oprozomib as an agent that may deliver a level of efficacy in chronic maintenance study. Particularly that would be above and beyond what we are imagining is going to come from the [indiscernible] product. So I think these are difficult molecules to develop as oral molecules because of the GI toxicities that can be associated with them. So there is dose limiting toxicities and it can be difficult to manage around that. We\u2019re working on that problem. Tony, obviously you'd be the appropriate person to comment on the competitive environment.","Tony Hooper","Sure, so I think when we think about multiple myeloma we\u2019re talking about a disease that patients will die from and if I think every single physician and patient in this setting thinks about efficacy first. And our belief and commitment to Kyprolis, has it been around the deep science of this product, where we truly believe it will be the best in class in this category, and I think our ability based on the ASPIRE data and potentially elevated coming to show the definitive improvement on progression free survival, with regimens including Kyprolis, stand us in very good stead to maintain a large part of the market.","Bob Bradway","Excellent! Thank you, Tony. I\u2019d like to thank all of you for your participation in our call this afternoon. Of course if you have any follow up questions or comments, the Investor Relations team will be standing by. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen\u2019s fourth quarter and financial results conference call.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, vice president of investor relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Okay, thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating results for the second quarter. Our new CFO, and my new boss, David Meline, actually picked a great quarter to join us, as our business performance was strong across the board.","Our CEO, Bob Bradway will introduce David formally in just a couple of minutes, and will also review our strategic progress and actions we are taking to position ourselves for long term growth. Following Bob, David will review our second quarter performance.","Our head of global commercial operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that we see going forward. Following Tony, our head of R&D, Sean Harper will provide a brief update on the many late-stage opportunities we have in our pipeline, as well as progress we are making on regulatory submissions. After Sean\u2019s comments, Bob will make a few concluding comments, and then we should have plenty of time for Q&A.","We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. You will notice that we have made some significant additions to our quarterly slide deck. This change was made in the spirit of providing more disclosure to further your understanding of our product trend drivers. And of course this will give my friend Mark Schoenebaum something to talk about in his next few weekly videos. ","Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Bob Bradway ","Thank you, Arvind. Let me begin by welcoming David Meline as our chief financial officer. David joins us from 3M, and his financial leadership and broad international experience will be very helpful to Amgen as we execute our strategy for long term growth and launch our pipeline of medicines in a number of new geographies. I\u2019d also like to thank Michael Kelly for serving as our acting CFO prior to David\u2019s appointment. ","Our performance was strong across the board in the second quarter, and our confidence in the business is buoyed by our 11% revenue growth, 30% operating income growth, and 25% earnings per share growth for the period. Our recently launched and legacy brands performed well in the U.S. and in internationally, and we exercised expense discipline across the business to drive these results.","Based on our progress through the first half of the year, and our confidence in the underlying trends of the business, we\u2019re raising guidance, as David will explain shortly. ","Because we\u2019ll be talking on this call both about our quarterly results and some restructuring activity, I\u2019d like to take just a moment to set some strategic context. Our strategy for long term growth begins with a commitment to developing a robust, differentiated pipeline of new medicines addressing serious illness.","This strategy is beginning to bear fruit. We\u2019ve talked about our substantial portfolio of 10 late-stage molecules delivering pivotal data by 2016. So far in 2014, we\u2019ve reported positive pivotal data for five of these molecules and we have submitted two of them already in the U.S., ivabradine for chronic heart failure, and TVEC for malignant melanoma. ","In Q3, we expect to submit evolocumab in the U.S. and Europe, TVEC in Europe, and later in the year, blinatumomab in the U.S. with a breakthrough therapy designation. This presents us with the prospect of several high-potential new product launches beginning in 2015.","To capitalize on this opportunity, we announced today the first steps of a restructuring plan designed to improve our focus and proactively reallocate resources ahead of the commercialization of our many promising molecules, on a cost-competitive basis.","Our initial efforts include streamlining our organization, reducing layers of management, increasing managerial spans of responsibility, and beginning implementation of a revised geographic site plan. In this regard, we\u2019ll reduce our workforce by between 2,400 and 2,900 positions, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2015, predominantly in the United States. This represents approximately 12% to 15% of Amgen\u2019s global workforce of some 20,000 staff members. ","A significant element of our current restructuring plan involves optimizing our sites in the United States. As part of this, we plan to close all of our facilities in Washington and Colorado before the end of 2015. We\u2019ll begin the process of exiting these sits in the third quarter of this year. These sites were primarily research and development and manufacturing facilities.","Going forward, we see opportunities to concentrate more of our research and process development activities in our sites in South San Francisco and Cambridge, Massachusetts, obviously two key biotechnology hubs. We will retain our headquarters in Thousand Oaks, albeit with a reduced number of staff and overall, we anticipate approximately a 23% reduction in our facilities footprint as part of this first step in our restructuring.","These actions will result in pretax accounting charges in the range of $775 million to $950 million, primarily incurred in 2014 and 2015. The combination of these actions will reduce operating expenses by approximately $700 million in 2016 as compared to 2013, although most of the savings will be reinvested to support global launches of our new products. These actions were contemplated as part of our 2014 guidance, and the financial benefit will be modest in 2015 due to the timing of these actions during the calendar year. ","Let me just point out that the initiatives I\u2019ve described represent the first steps in our strategic resource reallocation efforts. For much of the past year, teams across Amgen have engaged in a coordinated effort to reengineer our company for the future. They are focused on ensuring that we build exactly the right capabilities to deliver on our strategy and our aspirations.","As part of this, we\u2019ve been evaluating our overall expense base: our fixed costs, our variable costs, our labor-related expenses, and our financing costs. Our next steps, which are well underway, include evaluating additional efficiency initiatives, particularly in the shared services area. We\u2019ll discuss our full program with you together with an estimate of the resulting cost savings, pipeline progress, and our commercial plans during a business review meeting that we will be hosting in the fourth quarter.","I want to emphasize today that we begin these actions with a strong underlying confidence in our business. Our confidence is bolstered by our strong operating performance and the widespread positive reception to our evolocumab data and by our expectations for the well-designed ASPIRE trial for Kyprolis, the results for which will be announced as soon as they are available.","Let me now turn to the call over to David Meline, who will walk you through the financials for our second quarter.","David Meline","Thanks, Bob. I\u2019m pleased to join Amgen at this pivotal time. I look forward to working with the team in order to support the global growth of the company while helping to prioritize the best opportunities for products and programs which will serve the company\u2019s mission.","We will also ensure that the company is efficient and lean in order to maintain competitiveness and support our capital allocation plans. I look forward to expanding on these themes during the fourth quarter business review.","Turning to page five of the presentation, Amgen\u2019s revenue grew by 11% year over year, with 8% product sales growth, driven by strength across the product portfolio, both in the U.S. and internationally. We also saw a nearly $150 million increase in other revenues, primarily due to our Nexavar and [Stivagar] partnerships.","On a quarter over quarter basis, revenues grew 15%. This is consistent with our product sales pattern in recent years. However, the increase was a bit sharper this year in part due to inventory build for Enbrel of about $60 million in Q2, which Tony will discuss in more detail shortly.","Operating income grew 30%, based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with reduced operating expenses, which were down year over year. Within operating expenses, cost of sales increased by 0.4 points to 15.9% of sales, due to the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax.","Research and development expenses increased by 4% year over year, driven by the addition of the Onyx programs, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with support of marketed products. ","SG&A expenses decreased by 12%, driven by significant reduction in Enbrel related expenses. Other income and expenses were $144 million in the quarter, which was flat year over year. Tax rate for the quarter was 16.2%, a 4.3 point increase versus the second quarter of 2013, due primarily to the geographic earnings mix and the absence of the R&D tax credit versus the year ago period. As a result, adjusted net income increased 26% for the quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased 25%. ","Now, turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page six. We generated $2.1 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2014, a $600 million year over year increase due primarily to the impact of higher sales and improvements in working capital. ","Dividend payments in the quarter totaled $0.5 billion, reflecting the 30% year over year dividend increase.","At quarter end, Amgen held over $26 billion in cash and short-term investments, up over $4 billion versus a year ago, and our debt balance was $33 billion. The quarter end debt and cash balances include the impact of prefunding a majority of our $2 billion debt maturity later this year.","Turning to page seven, Amgen is increasing its revenue guidance for 2014 to $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, and adjusted EPS guidance to $8.20 to $8.40. We are reaffirming our tax rate guidance of 15% to 16% for the year, which assumes that the R&D tax credit will be extended in 2014, and applied retroactively to the full year.","At this point, our best view on timing is that the R&D tax credit extension would happen in the fourth quarter, which would result in a lower tax rate in Q4 as compared to the first three quarters of 2014.","Our guidance on capital expenditures remains unchanged.","Finally, on slide eight, we see a summary of the financial impacts from the restructuring announced today. Specifically, we will be incurring pretax GAAP charges of $775 million to $950 million in 2014 and 2015. In the second half of 2014, we expect an EPS impact of $0.36 to $0.45 per share on a GAAP basis, with the balance occurring substantially in 2015. Roughly 40% of total expenses will be on a cash basis. ","Based on the timing of the program, savings for 2014 are reflected in the full year guidance, and as a reminder, operating expenses tend to be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, and we expect that again to occur in 2014. ","While capital investments will also be required as part of these restructuring actions, we are maintaining our capital investment guidance for 2014 and in the future, expect to fund these investments within the capital expense run rate of approximately $800 million.","We look forward to discussing our full program in greater detail at our business review meeting in the fourth quarter. Let me now turn this over to Tony.","Tony Hooper","Thanks, David. You\u2019ll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on slide number 10. The strong underlying demand we saw in quarter one continued into quarter two as our legacy product franchisees remained stable despite new competition and our growth phase products continued to increase demand from both share and market growth.","As a result, we delivered 8% year on year sales growth in quarter two, driven by solid unit demand, and to a lesser extent, price, as shown on slide number 11. You will recall that last year, we realized the benefit of a Medicaid rebate adjustment in the amount of $185 million, which [inevitably] impacted the year on year comparison this year by about 4 percentage points. This adjustment mostly impacted our [unintelligible] and [filgrastim] products. ","Our performance was particularly strong in the international markets, with 15% year on year growth driven by strong performance in Europe, and we also benefited from the acquisition of the filgrastim rights from Roche in several new and emerging markets.","Now to slide 12, where on a sequential basis, sales grew 14% due to the rebound of the inventory dynamic for quarter one and solid unit demand. We exited quarter two with wholesale inventory levels within our normal range.","Let\u2019s review our second quarter product performance, beginning with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN, on slides 13 and 14. Neulasta sales were relatively flat year on year. Positive contribution from price was partially offset by the positive Medicaid rebate adjustment in quarter two of last year.","This Medicaid rebate adjustment also negatively impacted NEUPOGEN sales, as they were down 9% year on year. To date, we\u2019ve only seen a slight impact from the new filgrastim competition in both the U.S. and Europe.","Turning now to Enbrel, on slides 15 and 16. Underlying demand continued to be strong, as sales were up 7% year on year, primarily driven by price. Most of the inventory dynamic we saw last quarter has worked its way through the channel. At the end of quarter two we did see a slight inventory build of about $60 million that we expect to be drawn down in quarter three.","We continue to see strong segment growth in both rheumatology and dermatology at 19% and 21% respectively. And we held value share in both segments quarter on quarter, as shown on slide number 17.","Now to slide 18. EPOGEN sales were up 2% year on year, as price were partially offset by last year\u2019s Medicaid rebate adjustment. Unit demand has been relatively stable, as we continue to monitor average hemoglobin levels and dose utilization under the bundled payment system.","Aranesp was down 1% year on year, as shown on slide 19. Underlying demand for Aranesp continues to decrease slightly due to practice patterns in both oncology and nephrology in the U.S. and due to price competition pressures in Europe.","Turning now to slide 20, the combined denosumab franchise grew 29% year on year with a 31% unit growth. Prolia grew 40% year on year, due to strong unit demand, as we continue to grow share in all markets.","In the U.S., our improved sales force focus on high-prescribing physicians continues to drive both [unintelligible] and [unintelligible] prescriptions. In fact, new patient Rx is up 33% year on year, and our DTC programs are driving increases in patient awareness and patient requests.","As a result, in the U.S. we grew market share as measured by days of therapy by 3 percentage points in the quarter, up to 17%, shown on slide 21. U.S. repeat injection rates are over 60% on second injection and over 70% on third injections, leading to a 50% increase in repeat patients versus a year ago.","XGEVA grew 20% year on year, due to strong unit demand. XGEVA continues to capture market share in a growing market, despite competition from generic zoledronic acid, as shown on slide number 22. Our focus with prescribers on the superior clinical efficacy profile of XGEVA continues to drive growth. ","Now to Sensipar, which continues to grow, and is now annualizing at a run rate of about $1.2 billion. As a result of increased patient penetration, Q2 sales grew 15% year on year. Growth included both unit demand and price.","Nplate grew 12% year over year, mainly due to a high unit demand and strong market growth across all regions. Vectibix sales grew 42% year on year, driven by strong unit demand across all regions. Vectibix is now the only EGFR agent approved with improved overall survival data for first line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with an [unintelligible] based regimen of [unintelligible], in [unintelligible] patients, and will address an important unmet need in these patients.","Finally, Kyprolis sales were up 15% globally, and 23% in the U.S. on a sequential basis. In the U.S., roughly half of this growth is due to unit demand, and the other half due to return to normal inventory levels versus last quarter.","Kyprolis continues to maintain a dominant share in the third line multiple myeloma setting. We expect the next major inflection point for Kyprolis will be upon the inclusion of second line data in the label, and look forward to reviewing the Aspire data in the near future.","As we enter into the second half of the year, we\u2019ve made very good progress on a number of fronts. I will conclude my prepared comments where I began. Our legacy products remain stable, despite new competition, and our growth phase products continue to benefit from higher demand and increased market share. Let me pass you to Sean. ","Sean Harper","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. We continue to advance our pipeline, so let me begin with an update on cardiovascular programs, beginning with evolocumab our PCSK9 antibody. We\u2019re busy preparing our evolocumab submission for dyslipidemia and are targeting submissions in the U.S. and E.U. this quarter.","These submissions for evolocumab will include both Q2 week and Q2 monthly dosing. However, in order to maximize the probability of a first cycle approval for evolocumab delivered via our auto-injector, we\u2019ve decided to not include our automated mini doser device in the initial submission. Rather, the plan is to submit the device file as a supplement shortly after the initial approval of evolocumab.","We also had the opportunity to present data from our evolocumab Phase III Tesla study in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and our Phase II\/III [unintelligible] study in severe familial hypercholesterolemia at the European Atherosclerosis Society meeting last month. These data generated a lot of excitement, and we continue to explore the potential for evolocumab in these severely affected patient populations.","In addition, we have completed our submission of ivabradine in the U.S. for chronic heart failure, an epidemic condition with a high degree of unmet need, based on a large data set including outcomes data. We anticipate that the successful launch of evolocumab and ivabradine will meaningfully benefit many patients at cardiovascular risk.","We are look forward to new Kyprolis data including a review by an independent data monitoring committee of an interim analysis of the Aspire study in relapsed multiple myeloma patients and the final analysis of the Focus study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. In both of these event-driven studies, our current estimates are that these analyses will occur in the third quarter. ","We\u2019ve also completed enrollment in Endeavor, our Phase III head to head comparison of Kyprolis with dexamethasone to VELCADE with dexamethasone in relapsed multiple myeloma. Our immuno-oncology programs continue to advance, and we had several data presentations at ASCO. ","We presented the overall survival data from our Phase III TVEC study in metastatic melanoma, which demonstrated a 4.4 month improvement in overall survival, which closely approached statistical significance. We believe this trend, along with the successful result of our durable response rate primary endpoint, make for a very compelling data set, and we recently submitted a BLA for this agent in the U.S., and are planning a European submission in the third quarter, for regionally and distantly metastatic melanoma.","In addition, we continue to believe that there\u2019s the compelling opportunity for TVEC to prime the immune system with checkpoint inhibitors. We\u2019re currently investigating TVEC in combination with [unintelligible], or [unintelligible], in a Phase IB\/II metastatic melanoma study. The Phase IB portion was presented at ASCO, and while a small study, the encouraging response rate we reported, along with no new or unexpected toxicities, generated a lot of interest.","We\u2019re also move forward aggressively with our collaborative efforts with Merck on PD1, and expect to begin combination studies later this year. We also presented the blinatumomab confirmatory Phase II results in relapsed refractory adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia at ASCO. We\u2019re preparing a submission in the U.S. where we were granted breakthrough therapy designation this year, and are also in discussions with regulators about our E.U. submission.","Our Phase II study of Vectibix versus Avastin in first line wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer suggested a survival advantage for Vectibix in this population, which also garnered interest at ASCO. As you will recall, we recently received U.S. approval for first line use with [unintelligible] in wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer. ","Our accelerated approval for monotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer was also converted to full approval at that time. ","Regarding the ongoing Trebananib Phase II study in recurrent ovarian cancer, our latest estimates for the results from this event-driven overall survival secondary endpoint is now the fourth quarter of this year. Recall that Trebananib is a peptibody that inhibits Ang 1 and 2, and the primary endpoint of progression-free survival was met last year.","Our psoriasis program for brodalumab, which we\u2019re developing with our partners at AstraZeneca, consisted of three Phase III studies, one placebo controlled and two head to head studies comparing it to ustekinumab, or STELARA. The efficacy data we will be reporting from the placebo controlled study was very positive, and the other two studies will read out in the fourth quarter.","The results from our Phase II study in psoriatic arthritis with brodalumab were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and as we have announced, we and our partners have initiated two Phase III studies in psoriatic arthritis to evaluate the impact of brodalumab on improving clinical signs and symptoms as well as the ability to prevent joint damage.","As you heard from us earlier this month, AMG 416, the intravenous calcimimetic we gained access to via the acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals, had a very positive top line result from the first of three Phase III studies in secondary hyperparathyroidism. We look forward to seeing the second placebo controlled study in the third quarter, as well as the result of a head to head comparison to Sensipar in the first half of next year.","Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be a challenging disease to manage, and we believe there\u2019s an important role for an effective calcimimetic that can be administered intravenously coincident with hemodialysis.","Turning to a couple of our earlier stage programs, we were pleased to see Phase I asthma data from our anti-TSLP, or thymic stromal lymphopoeitin monoclonal antibody AMG 157 also highlighted in the New England Journal recently. We\u2019re developing this molecule in partnership with AstraZeneca MedImmune, and we believe this program has the potential to help address the large unmet need in asthma.","And as a quick update on our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, we\u2019ve completed enrollment in our Phase IIB dose ranging study in episodic migraine patients and expect to see these data later this year. Our Phase IIB chronic migraine study with AMG 334 continues to enroll.","Finally, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank my Amgen colleagues for our continued progress toward advancing these new potential medicines for patients in need. Bob?","Bob Bradway ","Okay, thank you, Sean. Before turning to questions, let me just take a moment to put the many parts of our business into a single perspective as we move along the strategic path that we first outlined for you in 2011. ","First, we\u2019re focused on bringing forward a substantial portfolio of innovative molecules that address significant unmet medical needs in areas of grievous illness, and molecules that demonstrate large, clinically relevant effects and are supported where possible by human genetic validation.","Second, we\u2019re building our business infrastructure to bring medicines to patients all around the world, shifting resources to areas of highest value and growth. And finally, we\u2019re making these investments for growth as we continue to meet our commitments to grow revenues and earnings and return capital to our shareholders. ","And we\u2019ll look forward to providing more granularity on our progressing pipeline, our commercial plans for launching new products, our expansion activities, and so forth, when we\u2019re together for the business review meeting during the fourth quarter.","So with that, let\u2019s turn to the question and answer session and Marvin, perhaps you can remind our callers of the procedure that will follow. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. ","Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to ask specifically about the restructuring and what you indicated was potentially its impact on the guidance for this year. If I go and I look, you, at the low end, had about a $0.30 improvement in EPS and at the high end you bumped by $0.20. And if I take a look at that based upon your margin structure, that you didn\u2019t change in your guidance, it looks like on an annualized basis that\u2019s around $30 million to $165 million. Of that $700 million, is that what you expect will actually fall through to the bottom line, and the rest is, you know, in terms of increased R&D or SG&A expense, to launch these new products? ","Bob Bradway ","I guess a couple of things perhaps to help you think through the modeling. First, as I said in my remarks, the restructuring announcement that we made today was contemplated when we gave initial 2014 guidance, so I wouldn\u2019t expect that you\u2019d be adjusting your 2014 guidance as a result of today\u2019s announcement, because as I said, we had these in mind when we provided 2014 guidance.","And I\u2019d just reiterate what David said, which is bear in mind that it\u2019s typical for our second quarter operating margin to be the highest for us of the year, and we expect that there will be some increase in operating expenses, as normal in the third and fourth quarter, and perhaps a little bit more than usual, as we begin investing in the prelaunch activities for the medicines that we\u2019ve filed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank ","I have one question regarding AMG 416. Regarding the head to head study you are doing comparing to Sensipar, what do you expect to see from this trial, apart from the primary endpoint? Which other secondary endpoint should we look at as well? And then do you expect to conduct an outcomes study for this [unintelligible].","Sean Harper","I would say that the comparison to Sensipar is important because we need to understand both at an efficacy, a tolerability, and an adherence over time, how the products compare. And I think all of those are important, just understanding the sort of biochemical activity of the dosing that we\u2019ve chosen for AMG 114 versus the current Sensipar dosing, understanding the tolerability issues, which as you know, are quite limiting for Sensipar, given the large [unintelligible] that these hemodialysis patients face. And finally, the adherence issue, which of course is related to tolerability, but not directly. ","So these are all the things that we\u2019d be looking at to try to understand where AMG 416 should be positioned to help patients and physicians manage the issues associated with these patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company ","Maybe for Bob, on the restructuring, I guess I understand that you don\u2019t want to be too specific until the business review meeting, but should we generally take it to mean that you\u2019re redeploying investment in R&D toward SG&A? And if that\u2019s the case, do you think you can bring Amgen\u2019s targeted R&D down to more in line with your large biopharma peers?","Bob Bradway ","Let me just make clear that the changes we announced today are company-wide changes. So while the facilities, particularly in Washington and to an extent in Colorado, that we\u2019re closing, are primarily research and development and process development related. The cuts themselves are companywide, and some of the launch investments will relate to research and development activities, and obviously the bulk of it over time to commercial activities. ","So we\u2019re reallocating away from some of our lower return areas into what we expect to be higher growth, higher return opportunities for us. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d characterize it. And you\u2019re right, in the context of our full business review we\u2019ll able to, I think, spend enough time with you to elaborate on how we expect the cost structure to evolve as we reshape the business. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs ","Was just wondering if there are any new pieces of clinical data that you\u2019re expecting that might change the level of reinvestment either up or down that you\u2019ve cited in your restructuring. And then another question, Bob, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the well-designed Aspire trial. I was wondering if you would care to expand here, as we feel that there are a number of questions on some of the limitations of the trial design and just wondering if you could help us out there. ","Bob Bradway ","I\u2019ll perhaps take your question in two pieces. Why don\u2019t I take the first part and then Sean can elaborate on the R&D question and the Aspire question in particular. Our expectation again is that the reception to our evolocumab data has been very positive, so we look forward to continuing to advance that, and to begin investing in the kinds of activities that would be typical before the launch of such a medicine.","In addition, we shared incremental information with you on this call about our other cardiovascular medicine, ivabradine, and Sean, I think, was pretty clear about the steps that we\u2019re taking with our oncology medicines and AMG 416. ","So on the basis of those molecules, and the progress we\u2019ve made against them, we feel it\u2019s time now to reallocate resources, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re preparing to do. But Sean, if you want to elaborate on any of the specific incremental programs that we\u2019ve embarked on, or talk about Aspire?","Sean Harper","Of course, fundamentally, we look at each of the clinical trial results that we get on major late-stage programs, and the emerging pipeline as well, and make investment decisions accordingly. So that\u2019s kind of the name of the game. It\u2019s a little bit hard to anticipate. You can get disappointed and invest less, and things can look better than you think and you invest more. So I don\u2019t know how else to address that.","In terms of Aspire, I think that Bob is reflecting this sense that the R&D organization has about the Aspire study, in general terms, which is I would agree entirely, and do agree, that the study is well-designed. It\u2019s always possible to criticize study designs, and many different ways to design studies for the same basic objectives. Obviously, Aspire is designed to help us to understand the incremental benefit that occurs by adding Kyprolis to a [rev dex] standard of care background in this population.","So I think likely, if there are real specific questions around the study design, we could talk about that offline. But I would agree that it\u2019s a well-designed study.","Bob Bradway ","It\u2019s a large study, 800 patients.","Sean Harper ","And I think we expect it to provide a pretty good window into the truth about the molecules. That\u2019s what I would expect from a well-designed study. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein.","Geoffrey Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein ","I hate to come back to this, Bob, but I\u2019m still confused about the effect of the restructuring. And could I ask you, are you suggesting to us that the operating expenses net will be flat in 2015 and 2016 because you\u2019ll take R&D down and SG&A will go up to prepare for these cardiovascular launches? Or are you suggesting that the operating expense ratio will be constant in 2015, 2016, with that same reallocation. Because I\u2019m struggling to understand what it means.","Bob Bradway ","What we were trying to convey is that the changes that we\u2019ve announced in this first step of restructuring would aggregate to $700 million of operating expense when compared to 2013. So the things that we\u2019re eliminating, for example, were [$700 million] dollars of operating expenses in 2013. Now, what we\u2019re planning to do is to reallocate much of that to the activities associated with the molecules that we\u2019ve begun filing. ","So you\u2019re right, what we\u2019re saying is first, in 2014, we had contemplated these actions, and they take place late in the calendar year, so this doesn\u2019t really affect the outlook for 2014. With respect to 2015, again, the actions will begin to accrue benefits for us through the course of the year, and by 2016, we think we will be through the actions that we\u2019ve disclosed.","And so the full benefit of these actions would be available, therefore we\u2019ll have an order of magnitude of $700 million in that year, some portion of which, most of which, we expect to invest in launch activities for the molecules that we\u2019re filing. So assuming those activities continue to proceed as we expect them to, we would plan to reinvest most of that in the business, in that year.","Now, one of the things, just to reiterate, the restructuring that we\u2019ve announced is company-wide, so we\u2019re reallocating resources away not just from research and development, but from across the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.","Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray ","I guess just on a high level or conceptual basis, as we think about 2015 and 2016, do we think of these as transition years between the mature franchise and the emerging pipeline? Or are you confident you can still deliver meaningful EPS growth over that time?","Bob Bradway","Yeah, as I said in my remarks, our objective is to continue to grow the business and to continue to increase our returns for shareholders, including to increase our dividend during this period. So that\u2019s our objective, and this restructuring doesn\u2019t reflect any change to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citi ","If you don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s sort of two quick ones. One, just for you, Bob, when you look at Amgen historically, Amgen has had really a great franchise and very much monopoly dominant position. This company historically has not had to compete in a lot of markets maybe outside of inflammation. You know, the markets you\u2019re going to go into are going to be a lot more competitive, and I just want to understand how you sort of position the company for that. ","And then secondly, if you don\u2019t mind, just evolocumab, the decision to sort of split up the two formulations, what was the reason for that? The filing of the two formulations.","Bob Bradway ","Why don\u2019t I take the first part of the competitive dynamic, and I\u2019ll ask Tony to add in his thoughts. And then Sean can reiterate his comments on evolocumab. But you\u2019re right, we\u2019re entering a new era in the sense that we will be entering into more competitive spaces than we have in the past, and that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been talking about here at Amgen over the course of the past couple of years. ","And we\u2019re excited and looking forward to having the opportunity to show what we can do and competing in some of these competitively intense fields that we\u2019re entering. And again, we think we\u2019re entering these spaces with molecules that have large effect size, which are differentiated, and which form the basis of a clear approach for our developing these new product areas. ","Tony Hooper","You\u2019re right that initially Amgen specialized in building markets, as we did with both filgrastim and [unintelligible] franchise. But as you look back at the legacy portfolio, now our European team have been defending against a number of competitors in the market the last seven years. We truly have built a competitive skill and ability.","When we look at Enbrel in the U.S. we compete on a daily basis against at least nine other competitors. And when we launched denosumab, we went into launch against a branded Zometa, which became generic at six competitors. We still grew market share against those.","So I think we have built a skill over time to really be competitive, and this is what we\u2019re honing with the team now, again, as they go into new therapeutic areas, building therapeutic competence, understanding the relationships, and ensuring that we can be maximally competitive as we go to market.","Sean Harper ","And let me clarify on the issue around the evolocumab device. This is not a formulation issue. The formulation is the formulation that\u2019s going to be registered along with the every two week and every month dosing data. The auto-injector, which is the SureClick auto-injector, which we have many, many patient years of exposure and the regulators are very familiar, will also be registered.","What we are not initially registering is the automated mini doser device, which administers the entire volume necessary for monthly injection as a single infusion. And the reason for that is to not take a chance, given the novelty of that device, as compared to our auto-injector, delaying the entire drug submission by including that rather than get it approved, get the auto-injector approved, get the product ready for launch, and then submit shortly after approval the device, which will be reviewed on a device clock, not a drug review clock.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group ","I just had a question for Bob, and then just a quick clarification. There\u2019s been a lot of activity in the large pharma and specialty pharma space, which you guys kind of straddle that with biotech on the inversion front. And I know your tax rates are very low, but much of your cash is generated ex-U.S. and getting access to it is maybe a bit more complicated under ideal situations. So as a former and well-known banker, I\u2019d love to just know how you\u2019re thinking about inversions in general and whether or not Amgen might be interested in something like that, whether it makes sense or not.","And then just a quick clarification for Tony. Tony, there\u2019s a lot going on with inventory this quarter, but I just want to be very clear. If one looks at the data on a year on year comparison, the increase in inventory year on year was negligible and you remain within the normal range, correct?","Tony Hooper ","The answer is, we ended the quarter within our normal range, with the only exception being Enbrel. There was about $60 million over the normal range, sequentially.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group ","And on a year over year basis, the build was very, very modest, correct?","Tony Hooper ","Correct. Yes.","Bob Bradway ","On your question, you\u2019re right, there\u2019s an awful lot of activity at the moment related to tax structuring. I guess the first thing I would observe is that our focus strategically is to try to advance molecules that we think we can add value to that address grievous illness. So that\u2019s where our energy is focused from a business development and capital allocation standpoint when we think outside of our own four walls.","My take on the inversion activity is that unfortunately our country doesn\u2019t yet have a globally competitive corporate tax system or structure, and until that changes, I think there will be tax financial engineering related to transactions like those that we\u2019re seeing now.","I hope that Congress will take action, and enact broad, sweeping corporate tax reform, but I\u2019m not optimistic that that will happen, certainly not this year. And again, I hope that even if corporate tax reform doesn\u2019t happen, that there may be a window for repatriation. But I think those two steps, corporate tax reform and repatriation, are important in order to create a level playing field for corporations, particularly like ours, in innovative industries. And I think that\u2019s what you see in biotechnology and pharmaceutical activity right now. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. ","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Maybe a question for Sean, going back to some [unintelligible] data, which is coming up. Maybe you could clarify for us, and I know there\u2019s multiple interims, so just wanted to clarify, is this a 50% or 75% interim? Did prior wins not stop? And should we have the full expectation that this one would stop, since you\u2019re so positive on the overall design?","And then secondly, when this data comes out, what do you think is clinically meaningful here in second line, understanding it should be positive, but what would you be very pleased with?","Sean Harper ","This particular interim on Aspire comes up with a reasonable number of events and power. It\u2019s not, of course, fully powered, as the final analysis would be. And whether this study is well-designed or not has, in my view, nothing to do with the question of whether the result is going to be positive in an interim. It\u2019s the question of the statistical power that you have to detect the effect size.","So depending on whether you\u2019re very ambitious and you\u2019re thinking about an effect size for the molecule on top of Rev Dex. You might imagine a positive interim at this stage. If you\u2019re more conservative about the effect size, you could imagine the study might have to run through to completion to show that effect size.","You know, I hate to blurt out a number, because I\u2019ve had so many conversations with so many experts in this field, and I\u2019ve heard such a large range of answers from people about what they think would be meaningful. And largely, it\u2019s because they\u2019re doing some kind of back of the envelope comparison in their minds to what one might see in such an experiment with VELCADE. And this is not a VELCADE comparison study. That study\u2019s just enrolled fully, Endeavor, and will come later. ","So we\u2019re going to see the data very soon, and I think I\u2019m just going to look at the data when it comes, and we have access to most of the really key opinion leaders in this disease around the world, and we\u2019ll have them help us understand how they feel about the results, assuming that we do get a read out, because the study is stopped early for efficacy. That may or may not occur at this [DSMB] review. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan ","What can you tell us about the pace of commercial investments in evolocumab, just especially given the earlier filing? ","Tony Hooper ","As Sean said earlier, we\u2019ve filed now for ivabradine, the drug for cardiac heart failure, which obviously will be the critical path to Amgen moving into the cardiovascular space. Clearly, that drug will potentially approved sometime early next year, and we\u2019re setting up the commercial launch to ready ourselves for that.","That team of specialists, plus the medical organization, will be the same organization that then takes evolocumab to market a bit later during 2015.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","And then on the restructuring, the facilities footprint, is this mostly for legacy products? Does this change your view on the biosimilar opportunity, or other, let\u2019s say, more legacy kind of assets, in terms of their revenue potential?","Bob Bradway ","Great, thanks for asking that question. I want to make sure to be clear in my response that this doesn\u2019t, in any way, diminish our enthusiasm for the biosimilar portfolio that we\u2019re developing. I\u2019ll just remind you, we have six programs advancing, three of which are already in pivotal trial. So we\u2019re excited about the prospect of developing and launching those beginning in 2017.","And you\u2019re right to point out that this gives us an opportunity to rationalize some of our manufacturing capability. And let me just, at a high level, remind you that we\u2019ve talked over the past couple of years about our investments in manufacturing technologies and new processes that we think will enable us to make protein therapies more reliably and at lower cost than what we currently do.","And as we progress our investments in that area, we would expect that to free up some of our legacy manufacturing capacity. So we\u2019re exiting 20 year old manufacturing technologies and continuing to invest in what we think are state-of-the-art, cutting-edge technologies that will enable us to rationalize and, we think, make product more reliably and more cost effectively.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matt Roden - UBS ","I have one for Tony on the EPOGEN and dialysis market. As both branded and potentially biosimilars begin to come to market in the U.S., we wanted to get your thoughts on how you view the impact of some of the large dialysis providers and potential volume deals, and how you see that moving forward once Roche comes in and the biosimilars as well.","Tony Hooper ","So just to remind you again that Roche have the right to enter the market at present with MIRCERA, and then patent will expire during 2015. The market is divided into three large chunks. Obviously, [DaVita] and [FMC] each holding about a third of the business, and the other third being held or managed by some of the small providers.","As regards DaVita, we have an exclusive supply contract with them that runs until 2018. And with FMC, we have a nonexclusive agreement at present. So obviously, all the experience at both FMC and a few of the others have had in Europe, which include a number of other alternative products, is something we take into act. We have continued to maintain a fairly large portion of the dialysis market share in Europe. So we\u2019re modeling ourselves on that, but the market, of course, in the U.S., is fundamentally different.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.","Eun Yang - Jefferies ","Question on romosozumab 4785. In [Phase III], patients are treated with 785 for 12 months, then followed by 24 months of Prolia. Wouldn\u2019t that be less favorable for a primary outcome measure like 24 months compared to 24 months continuous [unintelligible] treatment?","Sean Harper ","I think that the science of this novel pathway really led us to that approach, and what we found in our Phase II work with romosozumab was that while one does see the most rapid increase in bone marrow density that has been seen with any agent that\u2019s been introduced into humans, it does plateau by a year. And by a year, essentially what one is experiencing with continued use of romosozumab is a antiresorptive effect, a kind of magnitude effect, that\u2019s generally similar to that which you would see with [unintelligible] resorptives.","And so at that point, it didn\u2019t seem prudent to continue to dose people with an anabolic agent which has a novel mechanism, etc., when we had the ability to adopt a paradigm of rapidly building bone in patients who require that, and then kind of locking in those gains with an antiresorptive such as Prolia. So that was a surprise to us, of course, because this is completely novel biology and it wasn\u2019t until we got into the clinic and worked with an agent in Phase II that we found that it really wasn\u2019t sensible to use the product on a chronic basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities ","Just a question on the restructuring. Should we expect any sort of pipeline reprioritization, when we get to the business review meeting at the end of the year? And just as you think about 2016 and beyond, how much of the shift in spending, the SG&A, is sort of one-time, in support of launching of these products, and how much of it should we assume is recurring?","Bob Bradway","I\u2019ll just remind you that we\u2019ve been doing a fair amount of reprioritization of the pipeline over the past two years, but Sean, you can reiterate the actions that we\u2019ve taken there if you\u2019d like. And of course we\u2019ll talk about where we\u2019re focusing our efforts when we\u2019re together for the full business review. And we\u2019d like to give you an update on our approaches in discovery research as well as the molecules that we\u2019re excited about at an earlier stage of development that we haven\u2019t had as much time to talk about, given the bolus of advanced molecules that we\u2019re currently developing.","And similarly, I\u2019d ask that rather than getting into the details now of our investment in competitive molecules, that we\u2019ll use the business review at year-end, or in the fourth quarter, as an opportunity to update you on our thinking. But you\u2019ll appreciate that the initial stages before launch of a molecule include considerable amount of investment prior to actually generating revenues. Sean?","Sean Harper ","I think it\u2019s obvious to folks that we have an unprecedented number of late-stage programs rolling through at the moment. And this is the nature of R&D at any given company. It tends to be lumpy in this way. And so as you\u2019re absorbing, first, enormous amounts of Phase III clinical trial expenses, those, of course, as a bolus like this moves through, they begin to roll off. But the R&D expenses associated with supporting commercialization and the pharmacovigilance and regulatory activities, etc., in addition to supporting the new geographies that we\u2019re moving into, are substantial investments. ","And then while we may not have this number of molecules at any given time, at steady state, in late-stage development, we certainly want to have plenty. And so we\u2019re going to be continuing to make significant investment, both in internal innovation, as well as to be looking externally to make sure we\u2019re capturing innovation appropriately. If you look at our late-stage portfolio right now, it definitely represents a mix of those two capabilities. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse ","Sorry, another one on the headcount reduction. Thanks for all the color. You\u2019ve partly answered this. But let me ask from a very philosophical perspective. Is the headcount principally being driven to squeeze out operational inefficiencies, or with a greater goal of gaining new structural advantages with a view of dominating select R&D and operational domains?","And if it\u2019s the second of these, are there any subtleties in the restructuring that you can highlight which we may miss in just the headline headcount reduction numbers?","Bob Bradway ","Ravi, I think in our disclosure of the reductions, we were clear and transparent about what our objectives for the move are. And again, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re carefully, selectively reallocating resources away from some of our legacy investment areas to some of these new areas that we think offer higher growth and better returns. ","And again, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of subtlety to it. We try to be quite clear and transparent about what we\u2019re trying to do, both as regards the numbers, the locations, and what we\u2019re trying to do with our fixed costs from a site standpoint.","So again, I expect when we\u2019re together in the fourth quarter, if there\u2019s need for more insight on the actions that we will have taken, or will be in the process of taking, we can provide that for you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann ","Can you talk about what additional commercial infrastructure you think you\u2019ll need in order to launch evolocumab and other products? And with the $700 million benefit from the restructuring, would that be sufficient? Or do you think you\u2019ll need more buildup from other investments to build the infrastructure?","Tony Hooper","It\u2019s clearly a very sensitive and competitive debate we\u2019ll have about this now, but we are looking at putting together a definitive cardiovascular team and that team will evolve over time as we then go from ivabradine to evolocumab. The other products we\u2019ll be launching fall pretty much within our existing organization in terms of the oncology skills. But that\u2019s about as much as we would want to disclose at this point in time.","Arvind Sood","Thanks, Tony. Let me thank everybody for your participation in our call this afternoon.

I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Ian. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for calling in to review and discuss our business performance for the third quarter. Consistent with the tradition that we have now established, I would like to acknowledge those who are new in their coverage or have changed firms recently, including Chris Raymond, who recently joined Piper Jaffray; Laura Chico of Raymond James and Kennen Mackay of RBC. Each of us are very much looking forward to working with you.","Turning to our quarterly performance and keeping with the theme that we articulated at the beginning of the year of growing volumes, our growth products are all benefiting from solid unit volume growth, which is a key component of our long-term growth strategy of effectively transitioning from mature products to the more recently launched products.","To discuss this, together with other topics, our Chairman and CEO Bob Bradway will lead the call today, followed by our CFO David Meline, who will review our financial results for the third quarter and our revised and tightened outlook for the remainder of 2017. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will review our product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update.","In addition to posting slides that we plan to use for presentation today on our website, we have also posted an updated statement on progress we're making with our manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico following the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.","We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2017 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Our operating results through the first nine months of the year highlight that we are effectively managing our business during a period of transition as our recently launched products begin to gain traction around the world. Based on our ability to effectively manage costs, we've been able to raise our earnings outlook for the full year 2017, even while absorbing the costs of Hurricane Maria and continuing to direct investments towards long-term growth.","As I've said before, growing volumes will be key to driving future revenue growth. Our growth brands, including Prolia, Repatha, KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO are all exhibiting solid unit volume growth. I'd like to highlight Prolia in particular. Prolia is a unique asset in the bone health area and has an extremely strong value proposition. As you can see in our results, it continues to generate strong volume growth. Osteoporosis remains an under-diagnosed and under-treated disease with serious consequences and we will continue to educate physicians and patients on the established clinical profile of Prolia and the obvious benefits of preventing fractures.","I remain optimistic that Repatha will become a significant product for Amgen as it also brings a compelling value proposition to patients. Repatha's cardiovascular outcomes data are under priority review by the FDA, as you're aware, and this underscores the significant unmet medical need in cardiovascular disease.","These data have already been incorporated by global professional societies into treatment guidelines and pathways, including the recent update from the American College of Cardiology. As I've said before, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death around the world and it's a disease that costs over $600 billion a year in the U.S. alone. Improving patient access to Repatha remains a top priority for our team.","Looking ahead to next year, we expect to begin tackling another significant unmet medical need in migraine. We're pleased to be pioneering the new CGRP class of medicines. We continue to receive positive feedback on Aimovig and patients and physicians are excited by the prospects of a new, safe and effective preventative therapy. And that's exactly what we expect to deliver with Aimovig.","Given our core capabilities in biologics, I think biosimilars will become an important growth driver for us as we continue to make progress in this area. As has become increasingly apparent, achieving biosimilarity is challenging, and our expertise in biologics development and manufacturing is a clear differentiator.","This quarter, we received our second biosimilar approval with MVASI, a biosimilar to Avastin. We've also submitted our biosimilar to Herceptin to regulators for review. And importantly, we gained clarity around the launch timelines for AMGEVITA, our HUMIRA biosimilar, including an opportunity to launch in Europe starting next year.","We expect our biosimilars business to be an attractive source of revenue growth for us and one from which we expect to earn a strong return on investment for our shareholders.","We're taking steps to develop our pipeline to sustain long-term growth. In addition to pursuing Phase 3 trials for omecamtiv mecarbil in heart failure, and of course CNP520 for Alzheimer's disease, we're excited about moving Tezepelumab into Phase 3 for asthma. We have a leading position in the TSLP area and we're excited about the prospects of treating a broader population of asthmatics than other biologics on the market or in development. Sean will address this in more detail shortly.","Let me just say a few words about our manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico following the recent direct hit of Hurricane Maria on the island. Amgen has more than 2,000 staff members in Puerto Rico and I'm delighted to report that all of our staff are accounted for and nearly all of our staff are now back at work. In fact, just five weeks after experiencing what was a 100-year storm, we have substantially resumed operations, serving patients in Puerto Rico and around the world.","While we did experience some damage in Puerto Rico, generally speaking, our facilities weathered the storm well and are in relatively good shape. As we've said before, we expect no impact to product supply for patients around the world, a real tribute to our team on the island and to all those at Amgen who've been working together to help us manage through these challenging circumstances.","We appreciate the FDA's focus on Puerto Rico while the island recovers, and we've also been reaching out to many other pharmaceutical and medical device companies on the island to see if there are things that we can do collectively to help Puerto Rico get back on its feet as quickly as possible. We will continue to provide updates on this situation as appropriate.","Before I turn to David, let me just say that all-in-all, we feel we're in a strong position. We feel that we've positioned the company for the moment that we find ourselves in, as reflected in a balance sheet which is very strong, as reflected in the cash flows that you see in our business and as reflected in our ongoing tight control of expenses.","As we look to the future, we feel we have improved clarity on our opportunities for 2018 and beyond, with the inclusion obviously of Repatha outcomes data in our label, which we think is set to happen in a matter of weeks; the prospect, as I've already mentioned, of launching our first-in-class migraine therapy Aimovig; clarity around prospective launch of Parsabiv in the U.S. for patients with kidney disease; two new opportunities for our denosumab franchise including for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis for Prolia and for multiple myeloma for XGEVA.","We're also encouraged to have clarity now around our biosimilar franchise with, as I said a moment ago, a clear path for launching AMGEVITA internationally in 2018. And finally, following on our great success with Onpro for Neulasta, we're excited to be introducing our new AutoTouch injector for Enbrel as well.","With that, let me turn to David.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Bob. We are pleased with our solid overall results and earnings growth in the third quarter as our transformation efforts continued to enable investment in our core business, while also delivering operating leverage in a period of portfolio transition.","I also want to take a moment to provide an update from a financial perspective on our Hurricane Maria recovery efforts at our Puerto Rican manufacturing facilities. First off, I want to recognize the staff for their tireless efforts which have ensured our patients a stable supply of Amgen's medicines even in the face of devastating personal loss and disruption across the island.","As Bob mentioned, while we did experience some damage, all things considered, we weathered the storm in relatively good shape. Consistent with our approach to all other aspects of our business, we hold ourselves accountable for managing a disciplined and effective recovery effort.","We incurred $67 million of pre-tax expenses, or $0.07 a share in non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter related to inventory, idle facilities, repairs and support for our Puerto Rican staff. In the fourth quarter, the company expects our manufacturing facility recovery effort to drive pre-tax expenses in the range of $75 million to $100 million or $0.08 to $0.11 a share. At this time, we do not expect the recovery to have a significant impact on our full-year 2018 results. We will provide further detail when we share our 2018 guidance in January. We're working with our insurance providers but these estimates do not yet include insurance recoveries.","Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck. Worldwide revenues at $5.8 billion in the third quarter are flat year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX. This quarter we saw worldwide product sales at $5.5 billion, also flat year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and 1% lower on a reported basis including FX. Strong unit demand growth for our newer products was offset by declines in our mature brands.","Other revenues at $320 million grew 8% versus the third quarter of 2016, driven by higher IBRANCE royalty revenue. Non-GAAP operating income at $3 billion grew 4% from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by 2.7 points to 55.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment.","As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the fourth quarter of the year, driven by the timing of expenses with the compare this year being especially challenged due to the $75 million to $100 million of incremental charges related to our hurricane recovery efforts. We will also pass the one year mark since the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment at the end of October.","On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased by 0.5 points to 13.5%, driven primarily by the impact of Hurricane Maria on our Puerto Rican operations, offset partially by manufacturing efficiencies and reduced royalties. Research and development expenses at $858 million were down 11% year-over-year, driven by several upfront payments for in-licensing transactions in Q3 of 2016, lower spending required to support certain later stage clinical programs, and continued benefits from transformation initiatives and process improvement efforts.","SG&A expenses decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment, partially offset by increased investments in product launches. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year, reflecting additional transformation savings, while investing to build the business globally, support new product launches and investing in the long-term pipeline for the business.","Other income and expenses were a net $58 million expense in Q3. This is favorable by $51 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher cash balances and gains from our venture investment portfolio.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 19.4% for the quarter, a 0.5 point increase versus the third quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to adjustments to certain federal tax credits and deductions, offset partially by favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings.","Non-GAAP net income increased 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 8% year-over-year for the third quarter to $3.27 per share.","Turning next to cash flow on the balance sheet on page 7. Free cash flow was $3.3 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2016, driven by improved collections and lower cash expenditures.","We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments as we deployed $0.8 billion to repurchase 4.4 million shares at an average of $177 per share and are on track to achieve our total share repurchases for this year in the range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion.","Additionally, our third quarter dividend of $1.15 per share is an increase of 15% over last year. This reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation with significant investment in innovation in support of the long-term growth of the business as well as return of cash to shareholders.","We continue to maintain financial and strategic flexibility as a result of our strengthening balance sheet position. Cash and investments totaled 41.4 billion, an increase of 3.4 billion from the third quarter of last year. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow generation. Our debt balance stands at $35.8 billion as of September 30, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and leverage maturity of 12 years.","Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2017 on page 8. Overall, our revised 2017 guidance range for revenue is $22.7 billion to $23 billion versus previous guidance of $22.5 billion to $23 billion. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are raising and narrowing the outlook to $12.50 to $12.70 per share. Our improved 2017 guidance reflects our continued conviction in our strategy as well as business performance over the first three quarters of the year.","As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in operating expenses in Q4 versus Q3, reflecting the typical pattern for the business. Also included in this guidance is an incremental $75 million to $100 million of expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery in the fourth quarter.","Further, we are revising our non-GAAP tax guidance to 18% to 19% versus prior guidance of 18.5% to 19.5%. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.","In summary, our 2017 performance remains on track as we continue to invest to grow the business while transforming to a more efficient operating model. We will provide 2018 guidance on our January call.","This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you, David, and good afternoon folks. You'll find the details of revenue starting on slide number 10 of your deck. Strong and continued volume growth by Prolia and our more recently launched brands like Repatha, KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO helped offset declines in our mature brands. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales growth was flat year-over-year as reported sales declined 1%. The U.S. declined 2% year-over-year, and sales outside the U.S. grew 5%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by a robust 8% volume growth.","Let me start with Prolia. Prolia continues to deliver exceptional performance after being on the market for over seven years. Prolia grew 22% year-over-year with double digit volume growth in all markets, primarily from share gains. Quarter-on-quarter, we saw a slight decline, which follows the typical pattern for Prolia in the first and the third quarters.","Prolia, as Bob said, is a unique asset with a very strong value proposition. There remains a large underserved osteoporotic population at risk for fracture. These fractures often cause loss of independence for patients and place a large burden on caregivers and society. We remain focused on improving diagnosis and treatment rates in order to bring Prolia to more of these patients in need.","With share around 20% in most markets, there continues to be a lot of room for Prolia to grow and we are investing accordingly. As I mentioned before, there are some countries such as Australia, Switzerland and Ireland with better diagnosis and treatment rates for osteoporosis where Prolia has a 50% share or better. These are countries that truly understand the societal costs of nonintervention.","KYPROLIS grew 13% year-over-year in a competitive multiple myeloma segment with several new entrants. Outside the U.S., we continue to see strong growth from both existing and new markets. KYPROLIS is a unique product in a competitive position having two compelling sets of overall survival data in relapsed multiple myeloma patients.","Our most recent market share data in the U.S. shows an improvement in new patient share in second line setting. This is an important leading indicator for sales growth into future quarters. KYPROLIS also continues to have a prominent position in the NCCN Guidelines for all lines of therapy.","XGEVA declined 2% year-over-year, primarily due to a shift in timing of purchases from some larger end customers. We believe XGEVA's positioned for growth in 2018 with the addition of a multiple myeloma indication.","Neulasta declined 6% year-over-year due to a shift in timing of purchases by some larger end customers as well as a small decline in the number of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens.","The Onpro kit grew share to 56% of Neulasta units and we expect to continue to drive additional Onpro adoption into 2018. Our most recent in-market data shows that Onpro drives better adherence to therapy, which leads to lowering of rates of febrile neutropenia, and in fact lower rates of hospitalization. Simply put, Onpro is a better value to the healthcare system and this is an important point of potential differentiation for the future.","With NEUPOGEN, the impact of short-acting biosimilar competition was consistent with prior trends. We exited the quarter with 41% share of the short-acting segment and we have continued to maintain pricing discipline despite the competitive pressures NEUPOGEN has faced over the last several years.","Enbrel sales declined 6% year-over-year, in line with prescription trends. We expect these prescription trends to continue into 2018. Segment growth year-over-year was in line with last quarter across both rheumatology and dermatology segments, confirming the rebound from the slower growth seen in quarter one.","Enbrel lost less than 1 point of share in both segments in this quarter, consistent with prior trends. Quarter three saw a low single digit year-over-year decline in net selling price. Overall, we expect there to be a very slight year-over-year decline in net selling price for the full year 2017. Most formulary decisions for 2018 have now been finalized and we expect the net selling price trends of 2017 to continue into 2018.","You may recall that we noticed some potential excess end-user inventory at the end of quarter two. End-user inventory levels are estimated by deducting the value of prescriptions from the value of wholesaler shipments to end customers. Based on this data, we did not see a depletion in the third quarter. And if prior fourth quarter patterns hold, we would not expect a depletion in the fourth quarter either. We continue to make investments to maximize Enbrel's long-term value such as the imminent launch of our Enbrel AutoTouch, a reusable auto injector that is ergonomically designed to meet the needs of rheumatoid arthritis patients.","Lastly, we look forward to extending our information franchise into Europe next year with the launch of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to HUMIRA.","Aranesp saw modest declines of 3% year-over-year. We had a small unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and unit volume declined slightly globally.","EPOGEN declined 21% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower net selling prices, in line with quarter one and quarter two as a result of our extended DaVita agreement. In the third quarter, we did not see any underlying changes in the EPOGEN business, did have some unfavorable inventory changes which added to the year-over-year decline.","Sensipar increased 10% year-over-year, primarily due to net selling price. We've now launched Parsabiv in over 10 countries in Europe and our partner ONO has had a very successful launch in Japan. We're preparing to launch in the U.S. when CMS reimbursement code for Parsabiv becomes effective on January 1, 2018.","Now to Repatha. Our cardiovascular team continued its strong competitive execution, reaching 60% of total prescription share in the U.S. and 57% in the EU. In the U.S., new to brand share, which in my mind is a forecast of future sales, in the U.S. reached 74%. Sequentially, our Rxs grew by 20% in the U.S., however, sequential sales growth was tempered by changes in inventory and accounting adjustments that benefited the second quarter.","We continue to work hard with payers to improve access for appropriate patients. And we look forward to the FDA's priority review of Repatha's cardiovascular outcomes data, which will allow us to start promoting Repatha's ability to reduce heart attacks and strokes with both physicians and patients in December this year. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number one cause of death and disability in the world and it's a top priority of Amgen to ensure that appropriate patients have access to Repatha.","So in conclusion, we are focused on a strong finish to 2017. As we prepare for numerous launches in 2018, which include our Repatha outcomes label, the Enbrel AutoTouch device, Aimovig for migraine, Parsabiv, the XGEVA multiple myeloma indication, as well as large opportunities from our biosimilar franchise.","Let me for a moment stop and say thank you to all the Amgen staff, who have worked so hard and tirelessly this quarter to get our important drugs to patients around the world.","And now let me pass you to Sean. Sean?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. I'll begin with our cardiovascular therapeutic area. On Repatha, we continue to work with regulators towards incorporating cardiovascular outcomes data on our label and we are looking forward to our PDUFA date of December 2. In September, the American College of Cardiology issued their updated expert consensus decision pathway for non-statin therapies based largely on our cardiovascular outcomes data. It's clear that if these recommendations were followed in the United States, millions of patients would be treated with PCSK9 inhibitors.","We also recently completed a Phase 3 Repatha LDL lowering study in diabetic patients, an important population at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Repatha demonstrated efficacy and safety data consistent with that seen in our broader Repatha program and we'll be presenting the results at an upcoming medical meeting.","After reviewing the recently presented outcomes data from Merck's CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib, we feel the value of our CETP inhibitor, AMG 899, would be best realized through potential out-licensing opportunities, which we are exploring.","I'd also like to provide an update on one of our exciting Phase 1 cardiovascular programs, AMG 986. AMG 986 is a small molecule agonist of the apelin APJ receptor, which is associated with the body's biologic stress response to heart failure. Consistent with our strategy to pursue novel targets with human validation, administration of an endogenous peptide agonist of APJ has been shown to improve cardiac function in heart failure patients.","Preclinical data support clinical testing in the setting of heart failure with both preserved and reduced ejection fraction. We're actively enrolling healthy volunteers and heart failure patients in Phase 1 and appear to be in a significant leading position around this exciting axis.","Turning to inflammation and our TSLP antibody Tezepelumab, which we're developing in collaboration with AstraZeneca, the results of a large Phase 2b study in patients with uncontrolled asthma were recently published and presented to a very enthusiastic response.","TSLP is an upstream epithelial driver of inflammation in asthma and the data supported the potential to address a broader population of patients, essentially all comers, then targeting individual cytokines such as IL-413 or IL-5. We're currently working with our partner and regulators on the design of our Phase 3 asthma program and we'll provide updates as we progress.","Finally, results from a small exploratory short duration Phase 2a study of Tezepelumab as an add-on treatment to medium and high strength topical glucocorticoids in atopic dermatitis were recently posted. 111 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis received 280 milligrams of Tezepelumab or placebo every other week for 12 weeks.","Statistical significance on the primary endpoint of 50% reduction in eczema area and severity index at 12 weeks was not achieved, though positive trends were observed across a number of disease activity endpoints, suggesting that Tezepelumab may deliver clinical benefit as add-on treatment to topical glucocorticoids. The evaluation of Tezepelumab in atopic dermatitis may require further study and we continue to consider this indication among others in our lifecycle development plan.","I'll begin my comments on our oncology efforts with KYPROLIS. In the second-line, a relapsed multiple myeloma setting, we now have an April 2018 PDUFA date for the ENDEAVOR overall survival data, and we're busy preparing a submission for the ASPIRE overall survival data.","In the frontline, or newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, we're supporting high-quality evidence generation through randomized Amgen-supported studies, sponsored by investigators and large cooperative groups with a focus on the KRd regimen, KYPROLIS, Revlimid and dexamethasone.","We're particularly interested and excited about the potential of KYPROLIS plus DARZALEX and will begin to support KRd plus DARZALEX study along with Janssen in the frontline transplant-eligible population to build on the ongoing KD plus DARZALEX study we're running with Janssen in the relapsed or refractory setting. We believe the combination of these two highly potent therapies could significantly improve patient outcomes and drive patients into deep, durable remissions.","Lastly, on KYPROLIS, the Phase 3 A.R.R.O.W. study of KYPROLIS administered at 70 milligrams per meter squared weekly versus 27 milligrams per meters squared twice weekly in combination with dexamethasone met its progression-free survival primary endpoint at a pre-specified 75% interim analysis by demonstrating superior efficacy of the 70-milligram weekly regimen with similar safety findings.","Turning to our bispecific T cell engager programs, we recently announced the collaboration with CytomX to expand our immuno-oncology capabilities with an additional and complementary bispecific technology. As part of the agreement, we will co-develop a T cell engaging bispecific antibody against epithelial growth factor receptor, or EGFR, employing their Probody technology. And we've also have exclusive rights to develop up to three additional undisclosed targets.","In our BiTE platform, we have several extended half-life BiTEs moving into Phase 1: AMG 673, directed against CD33 for AML, AMG 596 against EGFR Variant III for glioblastoma and AMG 701 against BCMA for multiple myeloma. Importantly, we have also seen data recently that markedly increased our confidence that BiTEs can have impressive activity in solid tumors.","Turning to IMLYGIC, our oncolytic viral therapy, in collaboration with Toni Ribas at UCLA, we recently published positive clinical and impressive biomarker data from a Phase 1b melanoma study of IMLYGIC in combination with Keytruda, a checkpoint inhibitor. To the best of our knowledge, these were the first clinical data published in the journal Cell, and generated much enthusiasm among clinical investigators. These results, along with our other Phase 2 data, of both biomarker and clinical endpoints in combination with the belimumab, add to the growing body of evidence supporting the systemic effect of IMLYGIC and its considerable potential for combination with checkpoint inhibitors.","A word on Aranesp, after many years of intense effort, our final post-marketing requirement study on tumor progression and overall survival has read out. This was a prospective 2,500 patient double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aranesp in anemic populations with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Recall that this was one of the tumor types that had suggested potential tumor progression effects in a small study.","The data monitoring committee determined that the primary endpoint would be met with near certainty and recommended that we stop the study early. After discussion with global regulators, we ended the study and the data indeed showed that the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of Aranesp to placebo in overall survival was successfully achieved as were the secondary endpoints of non-inferiority to progression-free survival and non-inferiority to objective tumor response. As expected, transfusions were lower in the Aranesp arm.","In bone health, our Prolia submission for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is under review with a May 2018 PDUFA action date. Results of the Phase 3 ARCH study with romosozumab, or EVENITY, compared to alendronate in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were recently published and presented. We continue to believe from our interactions with experts in the field and regulators that there may be a patient population at high risk for fractures for whom EVENITY could provide a positive benefit risk and we're evaluating all of our Phase 3 clinical trial data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the cardiovascular safety results that were observed in ARCH, yet not observed in our placebo-controlled FRAME study.","In our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, we recently presented the results from a unique dedicated study that demonstrated that Aimovig did not aggravate ischemia in patients with stable angina, contributing further to the growing body of evidence supporting the safety profile of CGRP receptor inhibition with Aimovig.","In our second migraine program, I am pleased to report we're currently enrolling migraine patients now in a Phase 2b study of our PAC1 antibody AMG 301. PAC1 inhibition is a novel approach to migraine prevention that is mechanistically differentiated from the CGRP pathway.","And finally, I'd like to highlight our second U.S. biosimilar approval, in this case, for all eligible indications of Avastin, and the U.S. submission of ABP 980, our biosimilar Herceptin. Achieving biosimilarity in the U.S. regulatory environment has turned out to be more challenging than many expected and our continued success is a testament to our unsurpassed biologics development and manufacturing capabilities.","As always, I'd like to thank all of the staff at Amgen that make it possible to wage war against the worst forms of disease. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, thank you, Sean. Ian, can we open up the lines for questions now and would you remind our callers of the process?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Christopher Raymond - Piper Jaffray","Hey, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. So just a question on the Neulasta Onpro Kit, if you don't mind, I'm noticing that quarter-on-quarter share ticked up about 1%, it looks like, to 56%. I think that's a little bit of a leveling off from what you've seen in previous quarters. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what you think a steady-state share would be for that presentation of the product ahead of any biosimilar Neulasta launch? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So, Chris, this is Tony. Clearly, I'm not happy with 56%. If I look at the product value that this thing brings in terms of enhancing patients' ability to go home, the value to a large institution in terms of how they treat patients, we will continue to drive hard to increase that share beyond 56%.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much and congratulations on the solid results. A question for David. Look, you highlighted the operating margin uptick in the quarter and then the potential step down in Q4. But as you look ahead, you must have gone through your sort of long-range planning exercise, David. How do things look in terms of your ability to maintain those operating margin as you change the mix of products and pivot over to partnerships and collaborations? Is this 55% looking sustainable to you, or should we be anticipating that there will be some reduction over the next few years?","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. So yeah, so if you recall, we set out a plan for the company a few years ago to get to 52% to 54% objective by 2018. And the good news for the company is we've been able to certainly move that forward and achieve that type of performance upwards to a year in advance of our original goal. So we've been quite pleased with our ability to deliver on that performance.","And I think importantly during the period, while we were accomplishing that, we've had record levels of investment in R&D. We've stood up a cardiovascular franchise. We're about to stand up a neuro franchise here next year, built the biosimilars business and increased our footprint from 50 to 100 countries.","So if I look at that performance and I look at our ability to continue to invest, I think it's quite encouraging. And while we haven't given guidance post 2018 yet, I think suffice to say we feel very good about the sustainability of that type of margin performance for the company.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. It's two parter for me on Repatha. I guess, maybe could you comment on what your view is on the market share for that product going forward? Obviously, you pointed to NBRxs that are quite high, though your competitor products obviously may remain on the market longer than you originally thought. And then any comments on how formularies for Repatha are shaping up into 2018? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, Matt, so Tony, let me respond there. So, the market share we've achieved to date has been in the presence of a competitor. So as I think about going forward, we will continue to be competitive. And I think getting more and more patients on Repatha is our objective, which we've been quite successful with. We are working extensively with payers at the moment in terms of improving potentially the utilization management criteria and working on trying to reduce the onerous bureaucracy that takes place and frustrates physicians at the moment. We look forward to being able to pull some of these things through potentially in 2018.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, Bob, if you could just give us your view on tax reform as we head into 2018? I know there's a lot of moving pieces there, but do you anticipate that Puerto Rico would still be advantaged relative to the U.S.? And then on the capital allocation front, how do you think about the potential for use of capital if there is a repatriation allowed under the deal? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Sure, Terence, thanks for the question. Obviously, we think tax reform makes sense for the country. We've been advocating for that for some time. We continue to advocate for it and continue to advocate for the need for that tax reform to reflect the reality in Puerto Rico which is that a number of organizations, including Amgen, have major investments in Puerto Rico that were made there to capitalize on the tax advantages created by U.S. laws.","So we're keen to see that as tax reforms plays out, the important role of manufacturing in the island is reflected and that the appropriate language is included in the tax reform to continue to maintain the incentive for us and others to invest on the island. So we're watching the process closely, Terence and interested as no doubt all of you are to see exactly how the language will be written to address the needs in Puerto Rico.","And then more broadly on capital allocation, obviously we have a track record of returning significant capital to our shareholders and to the extent that tax reform happens and provides greater flexibility for us, we'll take that into account in our capital allocation plans. But as you know, from our track record over the last many years, we've been actively returning capital in the form of growing dividend and buyback and I'd expect us to continue that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you. So, you tend to have had \u2013 one of the few people who have had a lot of success getting biosimilars approved and through. There's been a lot of other rejections or delays. And we have noted that NEUPOGEN really was impacted by biosimilars while Remicade was not. So I was just wondering if you could help us understand given what you seen in the biosimilar space, how to think about how you will launch your biosimilars. How do we think about the Remicade analogy and the NEUPOGEN analogy and how to model your biosimilar business?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, Robyn, I'll ask Tony to comment on the specifics of how we're looking at going to market. But your general point is noted. It has proven difficult for our competitors to get biologics approved and biosimilars approved on time. And we're not fully surprised by that. We expected that there would be difficulties and we expected that the capabilities we had would be helpful for us to differentiate versus some of our competitors. And I think that's what's playing out. But I think the gist of your question about how we're planning to go to market is one for Tony to address.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. So, Robyn, clearly we think that the market in the beginning will be a branded biosimilar market. And therefore, the value we bring as an organization about the quality and the continuity of our supply is really important. The relationships we have with large institution, with small community clinics is really going to be important as well. So we will focus very clearly upon our relationships of the past, our skills of the past, as well as the value of the product we bring to market.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have one on Enbrel, maybe for Tony. So one, I'm curious on your comment that you do not expect further depletion of Enbrel inventory in Q4. And I was wondering why that could be. And then secondly, can you comment on 2018 net pricing trend for Enbrel now that we're kind of like late 2017 already?","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Ying, so as I've said, the end-user inventory is a triangulation we do in an attempt to give you guys as much visibility as possible about what we know to allow you to run your models. But fundamentally, we do the calculation based on what the Rxs are in the marketplace, which I'm never 100%, minus what we know our wholesaler have sold to the end users and the balance we assume is an inventory build. When I look back five years, I've never seen an inventory burn in the fourth quarter, so we're making the assumption that there wouldn't be an inventory burn this fourth quarter as well.","As regards to 2018, as I said in my earlier comments, most of our contracts have been negotiated, although that doesn't mean that there won't be negotiations that continue going forward during 2018, but we do expect the net selling price for Enbrel, the trend you've seen in 2017, we expect that to continue to 2018.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. It's on Sensipar and Parsabiv. I guess first, are we expecting generic Sensipars in March of next year, or were you able to extend pediatric exclusivity I think is what you were looking for another six months? And second, can Tony talk a little bit about the switching strategy to Parsabiv starting January 1? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, so let me just take your question on Sensipar, and then Tony, you talk about Parsabiv. We have litigation, as you know, Eric, underway, regarding the pediatric extension, so I don't want to comment on that while the litigation is pending. But Tony, why don't you talk about Parsabiv.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So we are bringing Parsabiv to market based on the clinical data we have at present, right. So by definition, secondary HPT is a very difficult thing to treat and adherence is a real problem. I think we have about 150,000 patients on the drug at the moment which is only about a 26% penetration. The head-to-head data we have shown great levels of efficacy of Parsabiv and without doubt in our mind, we will see a better level of adherence as physicians are back in control.","All feedback we have had to date from nephrologists in the marketplace has been very good. They are looking forward to having this drug available. So whether it's a switch or replacement or usage during a treatment period will be dependent upon the physician or the dialysis unit in terms of their guidelines.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I actually had a strategy question today, if I may. And I'm curious, has there been any consideration or deliberation internally on possibly extending the Novartis partnership to include the CV franchise also? And I'm just thinking out loud about Novartis' increased presence in cardiology with ENTRESTO as well as their new CANTOS data. I wasn't sure if this something that has been dealt with previously, and\/or how you'd think about pushes and pulls on a possible setup like this? I mean it doesn't have to be necessarily a 50\/50, but just perhaps thinking about margins and taking advantage of their presence now. Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","With respect to our partnership with Novartis, we're very happy with how we're collaborating with each other. And neuroscience, as you know, we were really attracted to their BACE program because we liked the clinical experiment that's being run there. We believe strongly in BACE and we believe that the appropriate way to test it is by getting to patients early, and together that's what we're doing. And they liked our CGRP program and our commitment to migraine, so that we think we have a good partnership there.","We have pioneered a lot of new ground in the cardiovascular space and we're excited about our intellectual property there, excited about what we see in the pipeline and so we're content to continue to own all of that franchise certainly in atherosclerosis. And as you know, we have partnerships already in heart failure. So we're generally optimistic and upbeat about what we see happening in cardiovascular. And as David said, we've fully invested in the standing up of that franchise.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Hey, great. Thanks for the question. I know that you're prepared to give I'm sure 2018 guidance in due time, but many years ago you gave longer-term guidance. As you think ahead over the next few years, which I think the Street remains uncertain about, what are the push and pulls that you think need to happen to be able to have visibility to provide that, or should we stay tuned? How do we think about that? Because that seems to be something I think that's weighing on people.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, Michael, as David said in his remarks, we would expect \u2013 we'd normally give guidance in January for 2018, so we'd expect to do that. As David also said in his remarks, we've made great progress on achieving the objectives that we established for 2018. In some areas, obviously we're moving more quickly to achieve those objectives than we had expected, so we're looking at the options to what makes sense when we get to providing the next batch of guidance and talking to our shareholders about that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, thanks a lot for the question. A real quick one. Sean, on the migraine program, maybe just can you go into a little bit more on 301, what you'd be looking for in a Phase 2 above and beyond what you see with erenumab? I'm just trying to think about kind of cost\/benefit and risk\/benefit?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question. I think initially, we have a form of human validation for this pathway and that if the ligand for this receptor is infused into migrainers, they experience migraine, and this is what was seen with CGRP as well. And we also have a pharmacodynamic assay that we look at in Phase 1, which is very similar to what we did with erenumab, where we know that we're covering the target and peripheral tissues.","So the next step for this is to achieve clinical proof-of-concept for the pathway and in terms of the ability to prevent migraine and to understand the dose that's required for that. And then I believe that we need to begin to understand, since these are such different neural circuits in the brain, whether there is a situation in which we can see additive or synergistic activity between PAC1 inhibition and CGRP inhibition, where there are certain patients who respond to one but not the other, or whether we can get again a kind of a synergistic effect in patients who do already respond to CGRP inhibition.","So I think that's all work that remains and we of course have the option to pursue that either through fixed dose type combinations, but we also have a bispecific program where we're actually able to inhibit both these targets in a single molecule. And that's all work that's going to be done, as we've mentioned, collaboratively here at Amgen but in collaboration with Novartis.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question, which is on erenumab as well, or Aimovig. I wanted to ask about the progress of your prelaunch activities, how they're going and the early reception you're seeing on the part of physicians and especially payers in terms of the level of enthusiasm for the class in general and this product in particular. And maybe how are the responsibilities towards these activities being divided by you and Novartis? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So this is Tony. Thanks, Cory. I just came back from the International Headache Conference (sic) [International Headache Congress], which was in Vancouver, where I was meeting with a group of key opinion leaders and individuals who run headache clinics together with me with my counterpart from Novartis, Paul Hudson. So he and I, we're working this together. So as we think strategically, the two organizations are doing a lot of strategic thinking together.","We both jointly agree that we probably saw more enthusiasm from this set of neuro physicians than we've ever seen in many other physicians in other congresses. People are talking about this is the first time they are being able to potentially prescribe a migraine drug for migraine patients in two decades. So I came away feeling much more positive about the scientific understanding, the clinical need and the large population that is waiting for this.","The work we've done at the moment with migraine bloggers and patients who are suffering from migraine has also been very beneficial. We understand much better now the patient's journey, the importance of the work we have to do with patients and their willingness to work with us to spread this good message once we have our drug approved. Obviously, we continue to work with payers in strategic discussions, but we haven't made any final decisions around pricing as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Another one for you, Tony, on the migraine. I guess, can you maybe talk about parallel learnings from PCSK9 since they are kind of similarly big, and like how to think about the migraine market in light of what the payers could do and strategies you have there? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Sure, Alethia. So I think first of all, the magnitude of the market is different, right? In the U.S., we estimate about 3.5 million patients right now are being treated for prophylactic treatment of migraine. A lot of those patients fail. A lot of those patients go off treatment because of side effects. A lot of those patients find the treatment is not effective. I think we believe that we will clearly be positioned for patients who failed existing therapy.","And last but not least, I think patients are much more aware of the disease. This is a symptomatic disease. When you have a migraine, you're very much aware of it. So I think patient mobilization in terms of their voice around the need to have access to drug is going to be important.","The value these drugs bring to the marketplace too, when you think about how debilitating migraine really is in terms of stopping people from going to work, preventing people from being mothers or caregivers, there is huge value to society to allow these people to get back their independence and to become normal citizens again.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Ian, before you go to the next question, let me just note that we're getting up towards the top of the hour, but I gather there are a few questions still queued up, so just wanted to alert the listeners that we'll go a little longer than usual. Go ahead to the next question.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening, and thank you for fitting me in. Two questions. First, CMS seems to be contemplating a single J-code for biosimilars innovative product. How do you guys feel about it? Would that help or help the biosimilar market? And second, one of your peers appears to be pushing up the pricing band for oncolytics. What is your take on this as the current investment in oncolytics justifies gradually raising the price band on those products?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. So two questions there, Ronny. I'm not sure we're going to want to talk about pricing. But with respect to J-codes, this is an important issue that we've been active in trying to help legislators understand. So Tony, go ahead.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Right. So we clearly believe that having a single J-code is not what you want, right? If you believe that a biosimilar has to be a decision made by a physician, you want clarity around each single product has to be able to reflect in the marketplace. So we're working hard to ensure that we have actual J-code by product as we go forward. On the pricing one, I'm not quite sure what the competition is doing and that's their decision.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","We launched our oncolytic antiviral product or viral therapy with a very, we think, compelling value proposition, as you perhaps recall, Ronny. So we were trying to help institutions and patients understand that we were willing to cap their exposure from a price perspective. And I think that's been well received in the marketplace.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Kennen Mackay from RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen Mackay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much for taking our question. And, Arvind, thank you for the recognition of our initiation and, Bob, it's a huge relief to hear that your Puerto Rico staff is safe and accounted for here.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Kennen.","Kennen Mackay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I actually had one quick question on Hurricane Maria. David, you'd mentioned the $67 million in one-time quarterly damage associated with the Hurricane was partially due to inventory. And was just curious if this was inventory lost in Puerto Rico. And had also been looking at the product slides Tony had in the slide deck, and it looks like there were inventory drawdowns across the board with the exception of Sensipar. Is that a function of hurricane disruption, or is that just sort of quarterly reflection there? Thank you.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. So it is true, what happened as a result of the hurricane is we had some product that was in process that it turned out was contaminated and so we had to scrap that product. So that was the inventory impact which was a portion of the $67 million of cost for the company. In terms of other disruption within the context of Puerto Rico, we have ample inventory for such interruptions, and so it hasn't impacted obviously our ability to supply. And Tony will probably comment, but I think as to the second part of the question, that's your normal dynamics of the seasonality, right?","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, I don't think any of the inventory movement had anything to do with the hurricane. Most of the discrepancies were as a result of contracts ending early and buying in that took place in the second quarter which would normally happen in the third quarter. There was sufficient inventory both in our supply chain here as well as in the wholesaler supply chain during this period.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank.","Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. And I guess just another biosimilar one. So regarding the overall portfolio, while regulatory timelines appear relatively straightforward, I'm wondering if you can provide a little bit more context regarding potential launch timing. I know it's kind of on a case-by-case basis relative to I guess legal negotiations, et cetera. Just wanted to understand if you have any sense of where we are in the process for the various products and how you think about timing overall to coming to market? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Well, Andrew, I guess the premise that it's relatively straightforward to develop these is one that people are struggling with in the industry. But as I said earlier, I think we expected that some of our competitors would struggle to achieve biosimilarity and we would observe that that's been playing out. So far we've been fortunate to be able to advance molecules that have passed the test with not just regulators here in the U.S., but globally, and we're committed to continue to try to do that.","Obviously the first step along the journey is getting our products approved. We have now, as you know, two of them, AMGEVITA and MVASI, which is our biosimilar to Avastin. And we now have clarity around our launch plans for AMGEVITA and we're excited about that. We have ongoing litigation with respect to MVASI, so I think it's probably inappropriate to talk about that now.","But generally, I think that since in the U.S. anyway, this pathway is still so new, there probably are still some regulatory paths to be made more clear. And I think certainly on the intellectual property front, there's still more work to be done in the field before we can all start to predict launch timetables accurately. So I'd like to resist trying to do that on this call, but I would remind you that we continue to be transparent about where our products are when they enter pivotal Phase 3 trials and when we file them with regulators and we'll continue to do that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah, hi guys. Congrats on the quarter. I had a question on Repatha. So we're getting the ODYSSEY outcomes data early 2018. And if we get the scenario here where the data looks optically better, right, because of the longer duration trial, but it still falls along the CTC (01:04:10) line, how do you guys view that? Is that a good because it grows the market you think, or a bad, because that's competitor data. I was just curious what your thoughts are there. Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Sounds like you're trying to draw us into a discussion of hypotheticals there, Salim. I think, Sean, if you feel you want to be drawn to that, fire away. But I hope you'll take a moment just to reiterate what we've learned about our products in the outcomes trial.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah well, I mean, my view would be that we've already seen with bococizumab, although they had their immunogenicity issues, which caused the molecule not to be able to be commercialized. We've already seen two PCSK9 inhibitors clearly fall along the CTCC (01:04:57) line.","And so is it good for the science and for the field to have a third outcomes result? Sure, I mean, the reason there's so much confidence in statins, for example, is we have a couple dozen outcomes trials that all more or less show the same thing. And I think, so from a scientific perspective, I think it will reinforce a number of the issues. And so in that way, I look forward to seeing the additional data. Tony, obviously.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","I think if you were at the ESC recently when we presented some of the subcuts of the Repatha outcomes data and we looked at the cohort where you had patients who entered at LDLs below 70 and how as you drove LDL down to levels way below 70, you actually got a higher reduction in myocardial infarction and reduction in stroke, and our data alone showing up to about a 33% reduction in MI. I can't understand why you wouldn't want to do anything other than drive LDL down as low as you can. So our drug does that, other drugs don't.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions on Puerto Rico. Can you just give us a sense for your ability to continue to sort of manufacture in Puerto Rico? Is that based on resumption on some semblance of normalcy? And when would that need to occur? Or can you continue to manufacture based on sort of the contingency plans that you have in place?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, we have very robust contingency plans in place, Ian, and we're up and running. We're virtually all of our activities are up and running. We have astonishingly almost all of our 2,000 staff are back at work despite enormous disruptions in their personal lives. They're back at work making product for patients around the world. So we're, I must say, we're humbled and incredibly proud of what we've seen from our staff down there over the last five weeks. So we're up and running.","We are dependent on our own sources of power right now and we're looking forward to the island getting the electrical grid restored. We're looking forward to the communications grid getting restored, looking forward to a reliable water supply. We think we're in pretty good shape there at the moment though and the roads. And gradually, things are getting back to normal for the families who work at companies like Amgen. But the good news is we're up and running.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's right. As of this week, all of the plants that where we have demand requirements are fully ramped up and are producing. So, and that's very recently that's happened, but we don't see any, as I said earlier, we don't see any risk of disruption of supply. And I think importantly, we're back up and running and feel very good about that. And the one thing that's not as convenient is the fact we're running on our own power and we look forward to that being restored. But that's doesn't create any risk of our ability to produce. So yeah, so it's come out very well, I'd say.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Hey Ian, being sensitive to the fact that it's past 6:00 PM on the East Coast, why don't we take two more questions.","Operator","Certainly, sir. Our next question is from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities.","Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I guess just a strategic question and given your focus on bispecific T-cell engagers in BLINCYTO, and given the acquisition of Kite by Gilead and your relationship with Kite as well, can you maybe speak to your interest in the cell therapy area to complement what you're doing with bispecifics? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, good. Thanks for the question. I think we do have an interest in cell-based therapies and we're very happy that we have the collaboration with Kite, now Gilead, around the six targets that we set up in that original deal. And we're learning a lot there and we're progressing those programs.","I think our perspective remains, as we've looked at the technologies that the bispecific T-cell engaging approach, both in hematologic malignancies and increasingly in solid tumors, particularly in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, is appearing to be a very powerful technology. And these are off-the-shelf products that can be administered virtually immediately to patients and may offer a benefit\/risk profile that would allow them to be used in earlier lines of therapy than in the current benefit\/risk profile for CAR-T therapies, for example, tends to limit them to later stages of situations where patients are rather deep into the relapsed and refractory phases of their disease.","I also think that we have a significant opportunity here now that we have the sense from accumulating data in our own hands and seeing what's going on out in the rest of the industry of the opportunity for BiTEs to have activity in solid tumors. And so I think we have a very large number of programs that we are pushing through the pipeline right now against both hematologic and solid tumor products.","I think cell-based therapies do have a role and that role will probably increase over time as some of the technology matures. And it may be possible to use them in earlier lines of therapy, as I mentioned. And we're tracking that closely. But right now, for the immediate kind of foreseeable three to five year period, we remain very enthusiastic about the bispecific T-cell engaging platform, particularly now with the half-life extended protein engineering.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould from UBS Equities.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in guys, and congrats on the quarter. One for Sean, real quick. How should we think about AMG 986 development in the context of omecamtiv? Should it be perceived more as a backup or complementary? And if there's any sort of just natural patient segmentation that might follow from the mechanism for these two assets, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, this is really a completely different mechanism of action than myosin activation. And while they're both targeting patients with heart failure, that's kind of where the obvious similarities end. I would say that what's been particularly exciting with apelin is the fact that we're seeing not only enhanced contractility, so systolic effect, but we're actually seeing enhancement of cardiac relaxation or diastolic effect. And that is unique in our knowledge to this particular mechanism.","So it allows us to consider pursuing add-on therapy presumably to standard-of-care in the reduced ejection fraction setting as we are doing with omecamtiv mecarbil in our experiment right now in Phase 3, which by the way, is enrolling extremely well. And, but also to explore the situation where there is absolutely no registered therapy available for the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction population, which is a very large population and is currently very underserved. So it's still reasonably early days in the clinic, Phase 1, but this is one of the more exciting programs we have in the cardiovascular arena.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, well thank you, Sean. I think we probably should break now but let me just say a couple quick thoughts in conclusion. First, I hope you can see that we're executing on our strategy and that we've put the company in a strong position for dealing with the realities of the environment that exist in our industry today. I'm pleased with our efforts to drive growth products as well as with the lifecycle management of our mature brands.","And I wanted just end by thanking our staff globally and particularly once more our colleagues in Puerto Rico for driving results and delivering for patients.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Bob. And I would like to thank all of you for your participation. Of course, if you have any follow-on questions, comments, that you would like to discuss, feel free to reach out to me and my team. We'll be around for several hours. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's third quarter 2017 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect."],"1660":["Amgen, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Okay, thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter conference call. I believe through our prepared comments today, you will consistently hear the message of the progress we are making on our full-year objectives as well as steps we are taking to deliver long-term value to shareholders. To discuss the quarterly performance and our full-year outlook, I am joined by several members of our leadership team.","Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway will begin with a brief strategic overview. Our Chief Financial Officer, Jon Peacock, will then review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our guidance for the year. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss product performances and trends followed by Sean Harper, our Head of R&D, who will provide a brief pipeline update.","After Sean's comments we should have ample time for Q&A. We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bradway","Okay, thanks, Arvind. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter call. As you can see from our results through the first half of the year, we are carrying good momentum into the third and fourth quarters and are on track to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth for the year, as indicated by our increased guidance. Reflecting on our second quarter performance, I would highlight the growth of our two largest products, Enbrel and Neulasta, as well as the continued success we are experiencing in launching Prolia and XGEVA globally.","While we are on track to deliver for the year, we are making strong progress as well on our long-term growth objectives. Our strategy for growth starts with innovations. So let me talk first about our pipeline.","As you may recall, we expect eight of our pipeline programs to generate registration enabling data by 2016. We announced positive Phase 3 data from the first two of these, T-Vec in malignant melanoma and trebananib in ovarian cancer in the second quarter. Sean Harper will have more to say about each of these in a moment.","In the cardiovascular arena, our innovative PCSK9 program, AMG145, is advancing well and we announced today that we expect pivotal data for this program in the first quarter of 2014. This will obviously be a significant event for us and, we hope, for cardiovascular patients as well.","In June, we announced a couple of business development initiatives in the cardiovascular area that we are touching on here. Per subject to the customary regulatory clearances, we plan to acquire the U.S. commercial rights to a novel heard drug, ivabradine, developed by Servier and approved in the EU and a number of other market for chronic heart failure in stable angina. Sean will talk about our plans for filing this drug with the FDA in his remarks.","As part of this transaction, we will partner our heart failure molecule, omecamtiv mecarbil, in the EU Servier and then separately we would acquire rights to develop omecamtiv mecarbil in Japan. We see development and commercial benefits to working with Servier in heart failure area and expect that the benefits of engaging cardiologists in the U.S. ahead of any launch of AMG145 will be attractive as well.","With respect to our international expansion efforts, we announced important progress during the quarter. We are excited about our collaboration in Japan with Astellas through which we now have clear path forward for innovative medicines in the world's second largest market.","We expect our collaboration with Astellas to result in a wholly owned Amgen affiliate as early as 2020. Additionally, we have formed a joint venture in China with Zhejiang Beta Pharma to commercialize Vectibix, which we expect to be our first new product for China in the 2015 timeframe. These collaborations clearly augment our presence in these large and growing markets and allow us to bring our medicines directly to patients who can benefit from them.","I can imagine there maybe questions about our M&A strategy at the moment, so without talking about any specific opportunities, I would like to highlight that our acquisition strategy continues to focus on assets that we think offer attractive prospects for growth and return on capital, in areas where we can add value for our shareholders through our capabilities, infrastructure and experience.","Our strategy is aimed at targets that are additive to the progress that we are making operationally and with our own pipeline. As we look at opportunities, we will remain disciplined and committed to growing our dividend and maintaining our solid investment grade credit rating.","Before turning over to Jon to review our financial highlights, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of my Amgen colleagues who once again this quarter delivered for patients and shareholders. Jon?","Jon Peacock","Thanks, Bob. Overall growth in total revenues of 5% for the quarter was supported by solid product sales growth of 9%. This was driven, as Bob as mentioned by strong performance across the portfolio, including Enbrel and Neulasta, our largest products and continued progress with Prolia and XGEVA. It also included a positive adjustment of $185 million to previous estimates for managed Medicaid rebates on prior period sales and this was based on recent claims experience. These adjustments primarily affected filgrastim and ESA franchises. And, overall they had an impact on the EPS of around $0.16. Others revenues in the quarter were lower compared to 2012, reflecting the $200 million payment from Takeda that we recognized in the second quarter of last year.","Operating expenses were up 8%, driven by the increase in the Phase III clinical activity, particularly related to PCSK9 molecule AMG145. Now that our Phase III trials are up and running and progressing well, you should expect that R&D expenses in the remaining two quarters of the year will be broadly in line with the expenses that we have reported for the second quarter.","SG&A expenses were 3% higher, within this Enbrel profit share expenses were up 15% to $425 million. As you may recall, one of the Enbrel royalty comments expired during the first quarter resulting in a higher increase in Enbrel profits relative to the increase in sales compared to a year ago. Excluding the Enbrel profit share SG&A costs were slightly downs' a year ago. Also, sales margin excluding the Puerto Rico excise taxes were flat at 13.9% of product sales.","Other income and expenses were $145 million in the quarter. This is broadly representative of what you should expect for the remaining two quarters of the year. The tax rate on the quarter of 11.9% benefited from a different jurisdictional mix of cost and revenues and the 2013 federal R&D credit. Overall, adjusted earnings per share increased 3% to $1.89.","Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 5, we generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion in the quarter. The higher cash flow of $2.2 billion that you will see on the page in Q2 of last year, was driven by two discrete items, specifically the termination of interest rate swap agreements and a one-time payment received in Spain to settle several older receivable balances last year. In addition to our quarterly dividend this quarter, year-to-date we have repurchased shares for a total cost of $800 million and at an average cost of $85 per share. We didn't repurchase additional shares during the second quarter.","At the end of the quarter, we held $22 billion in cash or liquid investments and $23.9 billion in debt. As Bob mentioned earlier, we remain committed to increasing our dividend meaningfully over time and through our solid investment grade ratings.","Turning to guidance for the full-year on page six. We now expect full-year revenue to be at the upper end of our guidance of $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion. We are raising our guidance on adjusted earnings per share to a range of $7.30 to $7.45. Within this, we now expect our tax rate for the full-year to be between 9% and 10%. Finally, our guidance on capital expenditures remains unchanged at approximately $700 million.","Let me hand over to Tony now, who will give you some more insights on product sales during the quarter.","Tony Hooper","Thanks, Jon. You will find a summary about global performance in quarter two on the slide number seven. As expected, we had a strong quarter two with product sales growing 9% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter. We remain focused on executing against our commercial strategy. Our underlying business excluding the impact of the Medicaid adjustments delivered 5% year-over-year growth and 6% quarter-over-quarter. We also saw sales growth from all our regions. The U.S. was up and the rest of the world was up 9% year-over-year, or 12% excluding foreign exchange.","I would like to review our Q2 performance for our portfolio, starting with Enbrel. Enbrel continues to be recognized by rheumatologists and dermatologists with its track record of efficacy, safety and long-term experience. We are committed to investing in Enbrel over the long-term. In quarter two, Enbrel sales grew 9% year-over-year primarily due to price. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw increased unit demand of 9%. Underlying market demand in both rheumatology and dermatology segments remains strong.","In rheumatology, Enbrel continues to hold share while in dermatology we saw a slight decrease in share due to increasing competitor activity. Our direct to consumer advertising continues to emphasis the benefits of using Enbrel. Enbrel consistently leads to total brand awareness in the rheumatology segment. Additionally, physicians continue to augment over 90% of Enbrel patient requests. With Enbrel we remain the value share leader in both rheumatology and dermatology segments and I am confident in its further growth potential.","Moving now to Neulasta and NEUPOGEN. As you know, Neulasta represents approximately 80% of this franchise. We continue to emphasize first and every cycle of treatment as the best way to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia in appropriate patients. Year-over-year global sales of Neulasta increased by 10%. This was driven by price, wholesale inventory and the impact of Medicaid that Bob mentioned previously. Worldwide, unit demand was down 3% year-over-year but flat quarter-over-quarter. In the U.S., we actually saw penetration levels increase in quarter two. NEUPOGEN sales were down 2% year-over-year. Declines in unit demand in the U.S. and the rest of the world were positively offset by price and the impact of Medicaid adjustment.","EPOGEN was up 50% quarter-over-quarter due to increased unit demand as a result of the Peginesatide recall as well as the impact of Medicaid adjustment. We continue to work with the dialysis clinics to ensure uninterrupted supply with dialysis patients.","Aranesp global sales were up 12% quarter-over-quarter and were flat excluding the impact of Medicaid adjustment. In both, the U.S. and Europe, demand appears to be trending slightly down driven by dose reductions in the U.S. and continued pressure and tight steps and competition in Europe.","Sensipar sales increased 12% year-over-year due to increases in overall unit demand driven by strong penetration. Sensipar is an important product addressing a significant unmet medical need. We are confident that Sensipar will remain a growth driver for Amgen.","Nplate and Vectibix sales in aggregate were higher year-over-year. For Nplate, market demand continues to grow in both the U.S. And in Europe. For Vectibix, we saw unit demand increases in both, the U.S. and Europe. Over 50% of our sales were in Europe and we continue to pursue reimbursements with payors across Europe in both, first-line and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer consistent with our label","Denosumab delivered strong results in quarter two. For Prolia, we saw the seasonal uptick that we have come to expect in the second quarter, we expect the third quarter to emulate the seasonality seen last year too. We continued to grow our share in the U.S and in Europe. In the U.S., since launching the new direct-to-consumer campaign with Blythe Danner business to prolia.com are up more than five-fold. Average monthly patient requests have increased 25% and over 90% of Prolia patients requests are honored by prescribers. We are improving repeat injection rights in the U.S. and our latest data shows that 63% of patients returning for their second injection. In Europe, we have recently finalized reimbursement negotiations in France and will be launching soon.","XGEVA global sales grew 12% quarter-over-quarter. In the U.S, our value share grew by two percentage points in the quarter. We now hold 61% share in the segment. Outside the U.S., XGEVA grew 33% quarter-over-quarter driven by share gains. Recent launches in Europe continue their strong trajectory. In France, we already achieved 40% segment value share since launch in Q1. Our commercial focus is the superior clinical benefit of XGEVA for the benefit of patients.","Moving onto inventory, for the U.S., I would note that our portfolio ended the quarter with wholesale inventory within the normal range. Lastly, let me comment on our business outside of the U.S. We saw solid growth in Europe 6% excluding impact of foreign exchange driven by continued growth of both, Prolia and XGEVA. We are also pleased with the contributions of both, our MN and Bergamo acquisitions in Turkey and Brazil.","Additionally, let me take a moment to comment on our recently announced Servier partnership that Bob talked about, which is subject to normal regulatory approvals. To us this is an important step as we build and expand our cardiovascular capabilities and relationships for the future potential introductions of AMG145 and other cardiovascular drugs.","In summary, I am very pleased with both, the competitive strategies our team have developed and their focused execution against these strategies. Our underlying business delivered a strong quarter and I believe we are well positioned to achieve our full year revenue growth objectives.","Let me pass you now to Sean. Sean?","Sean Harper","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. It's been a quarter for the R&D organization. Our pipeline continues to march forward. We recently presented the results of our Phase III study at T-VEC in the setting of metastatic melanoma at ASCO. We have already engaged in discussion with regulators based on this data set, which demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit in durable response and a strong trend in overall survival. Keeping in mind that the trigger for analysis is event-driven, our latest estimate for the primary overall survival analysis is now the first half of 2014.","Beyond monotherapy in melanoma, we remain very excited about the potential for pursuing T-VEC in other tumor types, in particular as a priming agent with other cancer immunotherapies such as PD-1 antagonist, an enthusiasm which is shared by other companies with whom we are building such collaborations. As you know in Q2, we released positive top line on the primary endpoint of progression-free survival from the Phase III study of Trebananib, our peptide antagonist of the angiopoietin axis in recurrence ovarian carcinoma. The final overall survival analysis, a secondary endpoint, is currently estimated to occur in the second half of 2014.","Turning to Vectibix, we are engaged in discussions with worldwide regulators on potential label changes based on recent studies and analysis in first and third-line metastatic colorectal cancer. XGEVA received an additional indication in giant cell tumor, which addresses a serious unmet need in this rare condition which affects pediatric and adult populations.","Data from a key study was recently published in Lancet Oncology. Data from Phase 2 studies from brodalumab in psoriatic arthritis resulted in a decision in our collaboration with AstraZeneca\/ Medimmune to proceed into Phase III for this indication. In addition, within this collaboration AMG 139 a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-23, also known as MEDI2070 has entered Phase 2 for Crohn's disease.","We terminated our small molecule inhibitor, the GlyT1 transporter, AMG 747, which was in Phase 2 for schizophrenia due to unexpected severe skin reaction. As we announced last quarter, we have initiated our biosimilar Herceptin pivotal study. Due to a delay in the availability of biosimilar trastuzumab, manufactured by a contract organization, enrollment in this study is being suspended temporarily and will resume when continuous supply is ensured. We continue to expect to initiate launch of our biosimilars portfolio in 2017.","Turning to our cardiovascular disease therapeutic area. The AMG 145 Phase 3 program is proceeding nicely and we expect the LDL cholesterol data from our four Phase 3 studies as monotherapy in combination with statins in statin-intolerant patients and in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in the first quarter of next year.","I also want to comment on how pleased I am that we anticipate gaining rights in the United States for ivabradine, a novel ion channel antagonist through a partnership with Servier. We feel this partnership can bring unique value to heart failure in stable angina patients with elevated heart rate, despite treatment with available therapies. This will increase our engagement with the cardiovascular community an area of great focus for us.","Servier has generated an impressive of clinical outcomes data, including the recent outcome study in heart failure supporting registration in Europe and elsewhere. We look forward to working on U.S. registration with FDA.","Staying with cardiovascular programs, our phase 2 study of intravenous omecamtiv mecarbil in acute heart failure that we conducted in collaboration with Cytokinetics recently completed. These data will be presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in September.","Finally, just to share with you some thoughts on our earlier stage efforts. Around six months into it, we are finding our scientific integration with deCODE Genetics to be even more productive and tactful than we had hoped. We now have multiple cases in which advanced human genetic analysis have allowed us to establish programs against new novel disease targets as well as to prioritize the existing targets within our early and new stage pipeline.","As part of a future R&D review, I will look forward to elaborating with some examples. I am more confident than ever that the strategy of guiding our R&D efforts needed this advanced human genetics will meaningfully improve our productivity. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Clearly. Thank you, Sean, and now I will turn it over to Arvind and Marvin for the question-and-answer session.","Arvind Sood","Yes. Marvin, would you go ahead and review the procedure for asking question again?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","I will first start with the base business questions since that progressed nicely this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the unit declines that you are seeing with Neulasta and is there any concern that that might be due to the upcoming NEUPOGEN similar product launch by Teva? Also on the XGEVA side, what kinds of trends are you seeing in the face of generics, if you don't take much share at all in this space? Thanks.","Tony Hooper","Okay, this is Tony. Let me respond to a couple of those. One, we have looked deeply into the Neulasta business, looked at the chemo regimens. We see nothing specific that's impacting the business at the moment. I think it would be too early to be looking at any type of impact of a competitor to NEUPOGEN. Just a reminder, any other products that come after, it will not be a biosimilar but it will be a separate BLA.","Turning to XGEVA. It looks like there are about seven generics now competing for the Zometa business. That has declined quite dramatically. XGEVA has maintained about 40% unit market share. There was a slight decline in new bio-naive patients in the first couple of months and that's due to pick back up again to where it was in the past. Okay?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert W. Baird.","Chris Raymond - Robert W. Baird","Just on this Medicaid accrual. I know you guys explained that you basically had some claims experience that drove the decision but could you maybe give a little bit more color? Specifically what was exogenous event or set of circumstances that led to taking it this quarter?","Jon Peacock","Chris, it's Jon. We have been keeping track of the claims we have been receiving against the reserves that we set up over the last two to three years for Medicaid patients being processed through the managed healthcare systems state-by-state across the U.S. We made a judgment that the claims that were coming in consistently over that period since we started the accrual were coming in somewhat lower than the reserves that we had set, and so it became clear that the net revenues were higher than we had estimated at the time we set up the reserves, so the adjustment we are making is really to recognize that there is net revenues based on the actual claims experience that we have seen over the last couple of years, the net revenues were higher than we had estimated when we set up those reserves, so we were at a point where with our auditors we felt it was appropriate to recognize that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS Securities.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities","Great. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually a non-Onyx question. It is an Amgen question, but it seems that you do have an appetite to do a sizable deal if it makes sense and I was just wondering if you could talk about your flexibility to finance a larger transaction like this. Can you talk maybe about how you view your own balance sheet in terms of what debt ratios you are comfortable with, your ability to access offshore cash, your appetite to include stock in a transaction? Again, this isn't necessarily with respect to current process, but in general just trying to understand your willingness and ability to go big if you feel that it's right thing to do? Thanks.","Tony Hooper","Matt, thanks for the question. Perhaps Jon and I can both take pieces of what you have asked. As I said in my remarks, our M&A strategy is very much focused on assets that we think offer attractive growth potential, assets that we think we can earn an attractive return on capital for our shareholders and we are very much focused on things that we think line up well with our capabilities, infrastructure and experience, so that's the focus.","With respect to the financial size, Matt, I think we have tried to be pretty consistent and clear that first we have a strong balance sheet, which is reflected in our solid investment grade rating and it's important to us to maintain that strong balance sheet and the investment grade rating that we have, so that's clearly something we look at and think about really carefully.","Our focus has been and is likely to continue to be [add] on transactions that we think we can finance with cash. And, to the extent that the acquisitions are on shore with the onshore cash, to the extent that we find opportunities internationally as we have from time-to-time been able to do, we use international cash for that purpose. Again, we are looking at transactions that we think enable us to grow that are additive to what we are otherwise doing with the business that enable us to maintain the strong balance sheet and continue our track record of growing the dividend for our shareholders.","Jon, I don't know whether you want to add any specific flavor on the debt ratings to Matt's question?","Jon Peacock","No. I would just reiterate that we are committed to continuing to increase the dividend meaningfully overtime. We said and have continued to say since 2011 over the five-year period to 2015 we are committed to returning on average more than 60% of net income to shareholders and I think we are well on track to doing that as well, so I think those are all important commitments to us and they all fit alongside our acquisition strategy.","Arvind Sood","All right. Next question, Marvin?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse","Simple on the Astellas deal, post 2020 buyout, what proportion of the economics does Astellas retain? Thank you.","Sean Harper","We are not sure we heard the beginning of that question Ravi, but Jon you have to take a crack at this.","Jon Peacock","Yes. There's really two elements to the deal Ravi just to sort of explain how it works. We have five pipeline assets around which we have arranged a profit share agreement with Astellas. They are co-funding the development of those assets and we will also co-commercialize them through which there is profit share agreement over the life of each of those assets.","Alongside that, we are working with Astellas to set up a joint venture. Through that joint venture, we will build the Amgen affiliates. We will take full ownership of that affiliate by 2020. There were no significant economics that passed through that joint venture. So the only economics that flow to Astellas are through the profit share arrangements on those five products.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","Thanks. A question, maybe for Jon, on the tax rate. Could you talk a little bit about this jurisdictional mix that drove down the guidance and is that specific to 2013 or is that going to carry over into future years?","Jon Peacock","Yes, Eric. I won't get in to too much detail about that, except to say that as expense base and R&D increases in support of our clinical trial activity, a lot of that expense base is U.S. based and a lot of that is fully deductible and against the full U.S. taxes and that is one of the mix issues of the driver.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Just two quick questions. For PCSK9, you talked about when you will get data. Should we expect you to file a couple of months after that or are there other studies that you will need to support a filing? Then, on the 185 Medicaid benefit, it looks like about $56 million or so is in the R&F line. Could you just quantify how much, if any other products, in EPOGEN versus the new EPO franchise? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Yes. Well, we will split that into two parts. Jon, why don't you address the Medicaid question first and then Sean could dive in with PCSK9.","Jon Peacock","Yes, Rachel, of the 185, it's predominantly in the filgrastim and the ESA franchise, as you noted from the comments Tony made on R&F. It's about 50 in the R&F space. The rest is largely spread across the other three. I don't want to get into much more detail on that. Thanks.","Bob Bradway","On PCSK9, Sean?","Sean Harper","Yes. I don't want to get into specifics of when we are going to file but these are the pivotal data sets that we are thinking about for initial registration.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein.","Geoff Porges - Sanford Bernstein","Question for Tony. Tony, could you talk a little about the Enbrel and your loss of franchises which is pretty dominant right now and give us a sense of what proportion of business for those two products is now contracted with payors or other entities and potentially subjected to rebates and price negotiations?","Tony Hooper","Geoff, the question is complex. We have access in reimbursement across some old channels for Enbrel and for Neulasta. They are specific rebates that are built into some of these. So that's about as much we have disclosed to-date. Am I missing a piece of your question?","Arvind Sood","Geoff, are you there? I think I lost Geoff. Marvin, let's go on to the next question and then maybe Geoff can get back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Chris for Yaron. I had a question about the EPO franchise. I know that you no longer have a competitor in the space. Can you comment how you are thinking about franchising the second half of 2013 and as we head into 2014?","Bob Bradway","Sure, Chris. We can take that. I will ask Tony to address it.","Tony Hooper","So the way we look at it at the moment, is it's pretty much the way we have for the last 20 years or so. We have looked to bring the highest value to patients, to make sure all patients who are available to get access to EPO and that we continue to build the strong record we have around both the efficacy and the safety profile of this drug for future when someone else tries to enter the market","Sean Harper","Chris, the only other thing that's perhaps worth just commenting on, is obviously CMS has proposed a cut in the reimbursement rate to dialysis providers and we are in the common period with CMS and obviously we and the providers will work to make sure CMS understands the risk that the cuts, if implemented, might have on patients having access to appropriate quality care. So it's still early days. We won't know for some number of months what the likely impact of that proposed cuts is going to be. But that's the other thing that we are working with the providers on when it comes to the EPOGEN prospects.","Arvind Sood","All right. Let's go to the next question, Marvin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein.","Geoff Porges - Sanford Bernstein","Jump back in the queue now, but I just wanted to clarify Tony on the case of Enbrel, we are hearing a lot that you are in preferred position with payors in quite a number of situations, so I am just wondering how much of your Enbrel business is driven in that way as opposed to more or less open formularies? Thanks.","Tony Hooper","I think, we are that way between one of two or one off three in most of the situation.","Geoff Porges - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thanks very much.","Arvind Sood","Okay. Marvin, let's take the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann","Was there a specific reason why there was no share repurchased in the second quarter? And how would a acquisition the size of Onyx impact the share repurchase program?","Sean Harper","We will avoid talking about the specifics related to Onyx, but Jon if you want to talk about the quarter just complete, go ahead.","Jon Peacock","Yes. I think we said at the beginning of the year that the share repurchases for this year and into next year would be more modest. We had a fairly heavy share repurchase program at the beginning of the year as we saw stock price hovering around $80 a share. We got about $1.6 billion remaining on the share repurchase program that we have said we expect to have lost those into well into 2014, so this isn't the sort of smooth quarter-by-quarter process. We will gauge it appropriately. Then in terms of in acquisitions, I will just sort of restate that we are committed to the capital allocation commitments that I highlighted earlier on.","Tony Hooper","Just perhaps a little bit additional color, Howard. As you know during the quarter, we had couple of big clinical events, we had a couple of important business development transactions that I have already addressed, so it's not unusual for us when we have that much activity to be out of share buyback market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","I got one for Sean on AMG145, so given that the data is coming in 1Q, just want to get your sense as to what you would view as a meaningful result for the Phase 3. Then, you guys said earlier that you thought outcomes data will ultimately be the key driver for adoption of this class. Just curious if you had any update on that?","Sean Harper","Yes. I think that we had a very robust Phase 2 program for this molecule given how enthusiastic we are about the pathway and the opportunity to clearly help patients with cardiovascular disease, so I suppose that's what I am anticipating from the Phase 3 studies is going to reflect very closely what we saw in Phase 2. Populations we are studying are the same, drug dosages and the approaches were the same and I would hope we continue to see quite a significant 50% to 70% kind of reduction in LDL cholesterol whether it's used in monotherapy or on the back of the existing statin therapies and I would hope to see continued similar well-tolerated profile.","I think that the outcomes data will be important despite the tremendous amount of human genetic elevation that exists for the pathway and the view by virtually every expert that I have interacted with that the outcomes data is kind of a predictable positive result. You still need the data and the data will be important when they come. I think in the meantime, for patients with particularly high risk and elevated LDL cholesterol, this will be an important intervention.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital","Hi. Thanks. Investors consistently say that biosimilar risk or at least [branded] products seem to be part of the overarching issue for thinking about Amgen over the next one or three years and sort of what is reflected in maybe the PE multiple, so maybe you can comment as you why products that are possibly coming this year or in the future would not take a lot of market share and why you think that would be or would not be similar to the experience in Europe? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay, a couple of question there. Tony, why don't you address?","Tony Hooper","Okay. So let me just talk a little about it. I think the market has clearly understood that these are not generics coming. These are biosimilars. When you look at what's happened in Europe, one realizes that we have spent 20 years building a very good history around both the efficacy of these drugs and the long-term safety data around these drugs. In addition, and probably as important, that over that 20 year period, we are one of the few companies who have continued to supply high quality product without exception. We have not, at any stage shorted a patient. So as we view this as a set of higher hurdles in Europe to run our business, this will be the same set of hurdle that will be applied and we will be using in the U.S. when potential competition comes to the market. That's why we, at the moment, are doing the extrapolations and projections we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","I would just like to know please what you paid for Onyx. I am just kidding. Can I ask maybe a question to Sean Harper, perhaps that isn't protocol, but it is something that I am really interested in. Maybe the cardiovascular drug in your pipeline that doesn't get as much attention as omecamtiv. I think there is an important Phase 2 study coming up, Sean. I would love if you could walk us through the recent blue print fashion, the design of the trials we are going to see data for and what the expectations maybe should be on the street? What exactly do you need to see to move into Phase 3? I know, in the past you characterized this is as a high risk program. I just wondered if your view on that's evolved at all? Thank you very much.","Jon Peacock","High risk, high reward there.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Fair enough.","Jon Peacock","So I think that just comes with operating in the heart failure space. I don't think it's anything about this mechanism that makes it bad. That is just, as we all know, while there are a number of therapies that have very clear proven mortality benefit in this disease, there are quite a few that have turned out to have various effects and so on. So it is a difficult area to work in, requires an upfront morbidity, mortality outcomes type of trial before one can gain registration in most jurisdictions. But because of that, it requires a lot of investment and until you see those outcomes data, you are not going to be absolutely sure of what you have got.","That said, if you look in this space right now and we validated this very much with our colleagues at Servier, when you look in this space, there is virtually nothing out there in systolic heart failure that's really interesting as a chronic treatment. In that context, if you think about the experiments that we are doing, they really fall in to two groups.","One is into intravenous studies which are done very short-term in hospitalized patients and this is much more of a PK\/PD kind of a study to try to understand in that laboratory type of environment in which you can use intravenous drug, measure concentrations in patients, monitor them real-time over a 48 to 72 hour period. We can learn a lot about the safety and the concentration exposure range we need at activity.","In that context, that experiment is the one which has three different cohorts with increasing levels of exposure that you will be seeing at the European meetings. But a very important study is going now which is an oral study that chronically doses patients over several months. This is where the real potential value of this kind of therapy is. It's really about keeping these patients from having six to ten hospitalizations per year for flares [ph], making them more functional and, of course, possibly increasing their actual outcome in terms of survival.","I think that we will have to see data from those chronic studies with the oral presentation of the drug before we could understand that we have something that's worthy of going into a large morbidity mortality trial and pursuing that goal. I think this remains, as you appreciate, a program that's really of great interest, given the epidemiology of heart failure, which around the world is rising and is really a true public health threat around the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","First on AMG145, I was just wondering if you can comment about any IP that you or others might have with respect to the target itself. Then the second question I had was, I missed the comments on the biosimilar Herceptin program, the delay. I thought that you said it was due to a delay at a contract manufacturer, but I guess I was under the impression that you guys would be manufacturing this yourselves, so could you just clarify that for me? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Sure, Terrence. This is Bob let me take those questions. First with respect to IP on 145. As you know, we don't comment at this early often about IP, the [offers] is that we don't see any barriers for us in developing and commercializing AMG145. As you know, as you heard us say repeatedly, we are very excited about this access and what we think it can do for patients.","With respect to comments on biosimilar molecule in the process of transitioning this molecule that we perhaps recall licensed in, we are relying on a contract manufacturer to supply clinical material and some of that clinical material hasn't been at the high quality standards that we require and so we are facing a little bit of delay there. But as Sean pointed out, we don't expect any delays to our ultimately launching our first biosimilar molecules in 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. It's Matthew actually on for Ian. I just want to go back to the conversation around biosimilar bio generic, branded generic NEUPOGEN and Neulasta, and see if you wouldn't mind being a little bit more specific on the steps or the actions you are taking to prepare the market or customers or payors in order to defend the business and event or protect the business in events of the sort of fourth quarter November timing when (Inaudible) Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thanks, Matthew. Tony, why don't you take a shot?","Tony Hooper","First of all, we don't believe there's any such signals that biogeneric, I mean it is very generic or it's a biosimilars and the biosimilars are pretty different to the generics. A lot of potential future competition will be BLAs, so we have to be establishing themselves as separate independent new entities with no history around efficacy and safety in the market place. We have had seven-plus years of experience in Europe, understanding a multitude of players have come to market, we are using all those experience, all those knowledge as we prepare for potential competition in the U.S. I am not going to go into details around what we are doing in the U.S., but we have been relatively successful outside the U.S. and we will be applying the same type of tactics. Thank you.","Arvind Sood","Marvin, let's take the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.","Eun Yang - Jefferies","Well, thanks very much. A question on AMG145, in the second part of TESLA study in the [patients], are you testing for LDL receptor functionality to select the patients with the some residual activity, receptor activity, but not those with negative activity?","Sean Harper","It's difficult to make those predictions and so I think that as we see responses to the therapy in individuals, it will be then much easier to ask those kind of biochemical questions about why. And, of course if you see a response to a therapy, you are going to know that to some extent there are some kind of functional LDL receptor being expressed on the service to the [parricide] and you can begin to work out some of that, but it's right now not a case where we are doing all of that kind of biochemical analysis upfront in choosing patients to treat, but kind of the other way around.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel.","Joel Sendek - Stifel","So I just have a question about the revenue guidance, because certainly if you look at what you delivered this quarter and that set up with the guidance would suggest flat or maybe even slightly down. I am wondering why you didn't increase the guidance for us? Thanks.","Jon Peacock","Well, I think if you adjust for the one-time events that we have seen yesterday, you will see a different trend. So do bear in mind the adjustments we made in the first quarter on the Enbrel returns and the adjustments we have made this quarter on the Medicaid rebates which are adjusting revenues from prior periods. So I think if you take that out, you will see that actually we are expecting to carry some good momentum into the second half of the year.","Bob Bradway","So, Marvin, I think they have covered a lot of topics here and I think most, if not, all of the major analysts have had a chance to ask some questions. So why don't we take two last questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays.","Tony Butler - Barclays","Briefly with PCSK9 coming soon, I am making assumptions that payors will try to have some step added. Do you actually today engage in discussions with those payors about that upcoming potential product in the market? If you haven't, when would you, assuming that you would do it well before you will actually file the program? Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Tony, this is Tony. The rules are pretty clear. We may not engage with payors around pricing strategy prior to registration.","Arvind Sood","All right, Marvin, let's take one last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","I really appreciate the follow up. It's a bigger picture, maybe R&D question for Bob. I think a couple of years ago either you or your predecessor had talked about trying to target 18% to 20% of sales or revenue being reinvested in R&D. You run a tad higher than that in the first half of the year. Is that still a longer term goal? That 18% to 20%?","Bob Bradway","Well, you are right to note that we are running a tad higher and that's one of the reasons why Jon tried to provide some clarity for you in his remarks. Obviously you can deduce from our comments about 145 that we are excited about that program and doing everything we can to deliver the results that we have talked about for the first quarter of the next year. It's an important product what we are spending money on now are these late stage Phase 3 programs. So we are not far off the guidance we gave you but we wanted to be clear and that's why we addressed it in our prepared remarks today.","Arvind Sood","Okay. Thanks, Bob, and the rest of the team. I would also like to thank you, all of the analysts and shareholders who participated in the call.

Mr. Sood, you may begin.","Arvind Sood","Okay, Brian, thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the first quarter. After you\u2019ve had a chance to assess our performance I think you\u2019ll concur you\u2019ll agree that we are off to a great start. To further discuss our performance today our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Bradway, will lead the call. Bob will provide a brief overview of our strategic and operational progress followed by our CFO David Meline, who will review our Q1 results.","Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, who will discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a brief update on our pipeline. We will give slides for presentation today, these slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email.","Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says, that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay, thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon everyone, thank you for joining our call. As you can see from our results we\u2019re off to a solid start so far in 2015. And our performance during the quarter is a good indication that we\u2019re on track to deliver our long-term objectives as well.","Financially, we delivered strong quarter really across the board. Our U.S. business delivered 15% growth and internationally we were up 10% at constant currency. Product performance was solid across the portfolio and I was especially pleased with the strong growth we delivered for Prolia, XGEVA, Kyprolis, Enbrel and Vectibix. Heading into the balance of the year, we have good momentum in our base business and Tony will have more to say about that in a few minutes.","Our earnings growth of 33% reflects the benefits of our transformation initiatives and our discipline in controlling expenses ahead of the launch investments that we\u2019ll make later this year. As David will share based on the strong performance in the quarter we\u2019re raising our 2015 earnings guidance. With the Corlanor approval last week we\u2019re excited to bring the first new heart failure medicine to the market in the U.S. in almost a decade.","Corlanor was approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure, which is you know is a significant economic burden on our society.","Through Corlanor, we look forward to establishing our presence in cardiovascular field as we prepare to launch Repatha later this year. In addition to Corlanor, we are launching BLINCYTO for patients with relapsed\/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and our Neulasta on-body injector which addresses a real clinical problem with an innovative solution that enables the administration of Neulasta the day after chemotherapy.","R&D as you know is a core focus at Amgen and our pipeline continues to deliver results that position us well for future growth. We reported the third successful Phase 3 study for AMG 416, an intravenous calcimimetic for use in kidney disease. And a second successful Phase 3 study for our lead biosimilar product adalimumab. In oncology Kyprolis delivered impressive results showing a doubling of progression free survival versus bortezomib in relapsed multiple myeloma patients in our ENDEAVOR study and of course these data come on the back of the unprecedented progression free survival data that were generated in our ASPIRE trial.","Kyprolis is currently under accelerated review in both the U.S. and Europe for multiple myeloma patients who relapsed and we are excited with the opportunity to bring this important medicine to many more patients globally. Sean, will speak more about progress in our pipeline in a few moments.","In summary, there is lot to be pleased about with our progress so far this year. Our strategy is working and it\u2019s delivering results. We are executing effectively across the company, controlling the things that are ours to control. Our focus and priorities have never been more clear. Our launches are proceeding well and we are ready to launch Repatha later this year. We continue to grow key products including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate.","We have strong momentum as we defend our base business against new competition and our transformation efforts are delivering efficiencies in cost savings across the company and we are being very disciplined about capturing them. Finally, we continue to advance our robust pipeline of important medicines setting the stage for long-term growth.","Before I hand over to David, I would like to thank my Amgen colleagues many of whom are listening to this call for their unwavering commitment to delivering for patients and for shareholders. David?","David Meline","Okay, thanks, Bob. Turning to the first quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5 billion grew 11% year-over-year with 12% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Total revenue in product sales were impacted 2% unfavorably due to foreign exchange headwinds.","Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 32% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 50% for the quarter, reflecting strong growth and continued progress from our transformation initiative. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved by 0.6 points driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price offset partially by product mix.","Research and development expenses at approximately $850 million, were down 14% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area. SG&A expenses were flat on a year-on-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.","Total operating expenses declined 3% year-on-year and 22% sequentially. This performance reflects the combination of the first quarter being typically the lowest expense level during the calendar year, plus a share of the $400 million of incremental savings expected during 2015 from our transformation initiative. Going forward, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical trends, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015.","Other income and expenses improved 9% on a year-over-year basis at a $146 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, a 1.6 point increase versus Q1 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a state audit settlement in the quarter. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 33% on a year-over-year basis.","Turning next to cash flow in the balance sheet on Page 6. For the first quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a higher sales and profitability. Total debt outstanding ended Q1 at $30.3 billion and cash and investments totaled $27.1 billion. Additionally our first quarter 2015 dividend increased to $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior period.","Finally in the first quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity with over $450 million of share repurchases or approximately 3 million shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped up level in 2015 consistent with the commitment to complete up to 2 billion of repurchases by the end of the year.","Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7, we remain on track with our plans to continue supporting growth of the business, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue we are raising the bottom-end of the range resulting in a revised guidance of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion for 2015. This reflects solid revenue performance in the first quarter partially offset by the effects of foreign currency headwinds, which will exceed $200 million for 2015 at current rates versus our original planning framework, versus 2014 results we expect over a $300 million revenue impact or 2% in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates.","Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics. We are also increasing our 2015 earnings per share outlook to $9.35 to $9.65 from the previous $9.05 to $9.40 forecast.","The increased earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong first quarter performance along with an incremental expected headwind of $0.05 per share from foreign exchange, versus 2014 results we expect to $0.12 EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates.","We would also expect our quarterly tax rate to increase throughout the balance of the year to be more in line with our guidance range of 18% to 19%, which has a remainder, excludes the benefit of the Federal R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $800 million this year. This concludes the financial update I will now turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Hooper","Thank you, David. And good afternoon folks, you\u2019ll find the summary of our global sales performance for the first quarter on Slide number 9. I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019re off to a strong start in our first quarter of 2015. We select some execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, launching products, growing on newer products and defending our mature in line brands.","Globally product sales grew 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, our U.S. business delivered outstanding results of 15% year-over-year growth and our international business grew 10% year-over-year excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.","Let me first update you on our new product launches. In the U.S. our recent launches of BLINCYTO acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the on-body injector for Neulasta are going very well with positive feedback from healthcare providers. BLINCYTO as you know was approved in two and a half months by the FDA underscoring the unmet medical need in ALL patients. We are seeing a broad acceptance of the product with orders from most major institutions and good reimbursement access. We launch the on-body injector for Neulasta during quarter one. Patients no longer have to return to the hospital 24 hours later after their chemo, the on-body injector simply infuses Neulasta return. We\u2019re still on the early stages of our launch we\u2019ve seen good breadth prescribing was about 800 accounts ordering product to-date.","At last Wednesday we received the approval for Corlanor to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure. Corlanor is the first new medicine for chronic heart failure in the U.S. in almost a decade. Heart failure is a common condition that affects maybe six million people with annual cost of over $30 billion in the U.S. the majority of these costs are related to hospitalizations. And we at Amgen estimate there is as many as one million patients could be candidates for Corlanor therapy. Since our approval last week, our manufacturing team will work to the weekend, printing labels, packaging product and made our first shipment to wholesalers yesterday.","Product will be in pharmacies later this week and our sales force was trained and in the field. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity and ready to bring this innovative new medicine to cardiologist and patients. Let me now turn to the first quarter performance beginning with Enbrel.","On Slide 12, you see that Enbrel delivered strong growth of 13% year-over-year primarily driven by price. Segment growth remains strong in both rheumatology and dermatology growing 23% and 30% respectively. Competition continues to intensify particularly in dermatology, where Enbrel has lost 5 points of value share over the last year, but still retains 27% share. And will, continues to be a logical choice of patients starting treatment with the biologic.","On Slide 13, you will see the sequentially Enbrel sales declined 17%. Unit declined 7% reflecting normal quarter one season patterns and price growth of 9% and there was 17% unfavorable impact in the inventory. You may recall from our conference call in January that wholesale inventories ended 2014 at a higher than normal level by about $40 million. And we expect the level to return to normal in quarter one. However in the first quarter the days on hand dropped to the low end of the range.","Additionally revised prescription data will but there was modest end customer buying in the fourth quarter, which then burnt off in quarter one. To summarize, in quarter one below than normal wholesale inventory level coupled with the end customer burn-off negatively impacted sales. We expect Enbrel to deliver significant growth in 2015 and as we said before we remain committed to Enbrel becoming a $5 billion brand.","I\u2019ll move now to Prolia. Prolia is delivered 39% growth year-over-year with 30% unit growth in the U.S. and 44% in the international. Over the last year Prolia market share grew three percentage points in the U.S. and about four percentage points in Europe. This performance is driven by our programs simply to access improved inherence, along with directed consumer marketing in the U.S. Prolia is now capturing one in three patients, starting postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment in the United States. As you can see from the March prescription data the expected Q2 pickup is underway.","XGEVA continued the solid performance with the 22% growth year-over-year. U.S. unit share increased four percentage points over last year and in Europe unit share increased about seven percentage points. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA\u2019s superior clinical profile versus the competition. Overtime, Vectibix has received expanded indications into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe. This delivered 18% year-over-year growth with exceptionally strong unit demand. We\u2019ve also recently received additional pipeline indication in combination with our theory in Europe.","Let me now turn to Kyprolis, which delivered year-on-year growth of 59% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 19%. In the U.S. we received priority review for label expansion into second line, based on these biodata, for the late July PDUFA date. We have submitted the application in Europe and it is currently under review. These data together with our compelling ENDEAVOR data should position Kyprolis, as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. Sensipar grew 24% year-over-year driven by 14% unit growth, price and inventory levels compared to quarter one in 2014. Nplate grew 12% year-over-year with strong unit growth in all regions across the world.","Now turn to our mature brands starting with the progressing franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 4% in the first quarter driven mainly by price and inventory changes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the on-body Neulasta injector during the quarter with very positive feedback from both providers and payers. NEUPOGEN declined 15% year-over-year mainly due to banded short-acting competition in the U.S. With strong execution value of NEUPOGEN team resulted in relative stable quote-unquote sequential market share in the short-acting market around 80%. Granix was about 15% and Leukine about 5%.","Look at things are compete account by account and reinforced NEUPOGEN\u2019s long track record clinical, efficacy and safety, as well as you ability to liable supply patients. With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S. this year, we will leverage the success we\u2019ve had in the U.S. versus brand of competition, as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe. Next at the EPOGENs which have an unusual 16% year-over-year growth in the quarter, on top of price gain of 7%, EPOGENs year-over-year growth benefits from a favorable compared to quarter one 2014, where end customers drill down inventory levels significantly. In addition, quarter one 2015 benefit from favorable accounting and discount adjustments as well as higher end customer inventories due to an SKU conversion.","From underlying business perspectives, dosing and hemoglobin that was remind relatively stable and the unit demand is relatively flat. Aranesp sales grew 4% year-over-year with a unit growth of 6%. A portion of this growth reflects the timing of early tender orders in the Middle East versus 2014.","So in conclusion, I\u2019d like to say, I\u2019d to personally thank our Amgen customer facing teams across the world. This is a unique moment in our company\u2019s history where we are some things we launching, growing and defending more brands than ever before. I know our team is embracing the Amgen value of competing intensely to one and have a clear focus on delivering value for shareholders, Amgen and most importantly for patients.","Let me now pass it to Sean.","Sean Harper","Thanks Tony. Good afternoon. Well, continues to be a very busy timeframes in R&D, and today I would like to start with our cardiovascular program, specifically the recent U.S. approval Corlanor or ivabradine for chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure. Chronic heart failure is in arise in the United States and represents a very large and growing healthcare expenditure burden primarily due to the cost of repeated hospitalizations in these very gradual patients.","In fact, reducing hospitalizations in these patients as a specific focus in many healthcare systems including medicare a resting heart rates is seven or more appears to be a maladaptive response in the setting of chronically reduced cardiac pump function. Yes, despite the availability of specific beta blockers, many heart failure patients in the United States maintain such an elevated heart rate at rest.","For these patients Corlanor\u2019s unique mechanism of action, they potentially benefit them, with respect to reducing the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. In the large outcome study performed by our colleagues at [indiscernible] that risk was reduced by 26% compared to placebo on top of standard of care including beta blocker.","Obviously, reduction in hospitalizations reflects patients doing better overall, in terms of their heart failure management. We\u2019re not only thrilled with the prospect of making Corlanor available to chronic heart failure patients in the U.S., but we also view this is an excellent way to introduce ourselves to the company to the U.S. cardiology community, as we prepared for the launch of our PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha.","Of course Repatha continues to be a main focus for U.S. And, we\u2019re very pleased to see the enthusiasm for this agent, at the recent American College of Cardiology meetings. In response with the data we presented there and publish to the New England Journal of Medicine. It\u2019s quite remarkable to see so much depth of understanding and appreciation of the potential benefit risk profile of a novel mechanism by cardiologist and lipid specialists.","We were also pleased to a file Repatha in Japan with our partners Astellas. The last thing I\u2019d like to mention our cardiovascular portfolio is omecamtiv mecarbil or AMG 423. The novel mechanism agent we are advancing in systolic heart failure with Cytokinetics. We look forward to seeing the data in the second half of this year, from our Phase 2 chronic oral study, which is now completed enrollment.","Turning to oncology, we were pleased to receive priority review from FDA on our Kyprolis sNDA, for relapsed multiple myeloma, based on these biodata. And we look forward to continued interactions with regulators to bring Kyprolis the patients in need. Also in the relapse setting we were quite encouraged by the ENDEAVOR data demonstrating a doubling of progression free survival in patients randomize to Kyprolis as compared to Velcade. We look forward to providing the details of these results at ASCO in the multiple myeloma oral section on Tuesday morning. We\u2019re also initiative a Phase 3 study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis, which we feel will be quite important for patients and caregivers. I\u2019d also note that during the first quarter Vectibix was approved in the EU for first line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFIRI and was also granted full approval in the EU.","Turning to T-VEC, we completed the Phase 1b portion of the T-VEC combination study. We\u2019re performing in metastatic melanoma in collaboration with Merck and their PD-1 antibody KEYTRUDA. And we expect to advance next into the Phase 3 portion of this exciting study. We\u2019re in the final planning stages of a similar Phase 1b 3 study in head and neck cancer with Merck and KEYTRUDA as well. Clearly, the vast majority of the potential value of T-VEC lies in priming immune system in combination with Type 1 inhibitors and other mechanisms that modulates the immune system\u2019s discrimination between cells and non-cells.","We continue to explore such opportunities both within our own pipeline as well as in collaboration with others. In the meantime, despite the very rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape since the design of the T-VEC monotherapy study in melanoma including the approval of multiple agents with proven all \u2013 overall survival. We continue to believe that it is important to make T-VEC monotherapy available to the patients segments in which meaningful rates of durable response were observed in Phase 3. We therefore look forward to our discussions on this topic at the FDA Advisory Committee meeting scheduled for April 29.","Finally, we have decided to self-administration of [indiscernible] investigational product in the Phase 3 study of trebananib in first line ovarian cancer, based on recommendation by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee, who deemed the study unlikely to achieve its primarily PFS end point. In the inflammation space, our Phase 3 psoriasis data from Brodalumab or IL-17 receptor antagonist was very well relieved at the recent American Academy of Dermatology Meeting as we discussed in detail at our Investor Relation event.","For those of you who are not able to participate in addition to the very compelling efficacy data including superiority over or Stelara or ustekinumab along with an overall balanced safety profile, we did note that we\u2019ve seen suicidal ideation and behavior in our Brodalumab program in these patients known to be at risk for these events. However, we believe the evidence today does not suggest the cause of relationship between IL-17 inhibition and suicidal ideation and behavior. Data have been provided to regulatory authorities and we will be discussing it with them on an ongoing basics.","This topic will be an important and appropriate focus of regulators in their analysis of the risk benefit profile during their review of the application as we planned to file for Brodalumab. Along with our partner at AstraZeneca, we do anticipate submitting this agent globally mid year. We also recently decided to stop the Phase 2 asthma study with Brodalumab based on futility at a planned interim analysis. In other areas, our Phase 3 head-to-head study of AMG 416 versus Sensipar in hemodialysis patients\u2019 secondary hyperparathyroidism was positive and we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the second half of this year.","Our biosimilar programs also continue to advance with positive Phase 3 data for our Humira biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis. We view our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody AMG 334 as a top priority. And we will strive to be both first and best-in-class in this field. We expect to present data from our Phase 2b episodic migraine study at the International Headache Society Congress next month and to initiate Phase 3 later this year.","Finally, I\u2019d like to thank the R&D team at Amgen for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular recently it was very nice to see the level of acknowledgment paid to the remarkable breakthroughs in human genetics by deCODE in Iceland celebrated in the both scientific and lay press. There was certainly be much more to come in this very exciting era of biology. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay, thanks Sean. Before we move to Q&A, let me just repeat that we\u2019re focused on executing against the strategy for long-term growth that we laid out during our business review meeting last October. We\u2019re successfully executing on our new product launches. We\u2019re now continuing to grow key products such as Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. Of course, we continue to advance our robust pipeline as you\u2019ve just heard from Sean and our transformation efforts are delivering efficiencies in cost savings, which we\u2019ll capturing across the company. This quarter\u2019s results proved to us that we\u2019re delivering progress against our long-term objectives.","And with that, we would like to take your questions. Bryan, do you to remind our callers of the procedures for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Sure. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein.","Geoffrey Porges","I will try and be brief. There have been some questions about a partnership to support the launch of Repatha. And it seems as though it\u2019s also fairly [indiscernible] but is that something that you can now help us to rule out definitively given that that you have a pretty short interval until the launch? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Geoff, we\u2019re excited about launching Repatha and we\u2019re well along as you say in our plans for launching the molecule and we own the rights to this product globally and we look forward to commercializing it globally. Of course, we\u2019re sharing \u2013 you know we had a partnership in Japan with Astellas but otherwise the rights are ours.","Geoffrey Porges","Terrific. Well, I\u2019ll take that as a no, thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Brian, let\u2019s take the next question.","Operator","Yes, our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee","Thanks. You hit on the Neulasta on-body device briefly, but maybe if you could give some color as to the launch, how fast you think you can convert and whether or not there is anything else that we should be thinking about as to why that would be different than the NEUPOGEN competition like we saw there and now we can get comfortable with [indiscernible] competition to Neulasta.","Tony Hooper","Michael, it\u2019s Tony. So let me do some response. Obviously, it\u2019s pretty early in the launch period itself, but we\u2019ve seen pretty good uptick across as I said the 800 institution, the early debate was around reimbursement and access. We\u2019re blocking that down and the product starts to move quite fast. We are exceeding our own internal expectations at this particular stage and we continue to see very good feedback from patients who really see this as a distinctive and definitive advantage. Nurses are also very keen to utilize the product and to help patients as they go home. And last but not least more and more institutions are stepping in to buy products. So we continue to see an ongoing conversion of the business to the on-body injector.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Robert W Baird.","Chris Raymond","Question on Repatha. So, I know you probably don\u2019t want to go too much into the patent infringement case against Sanofi and Regeneron, but \u2013 so just noticing that the proposed scheduling order is out there and it has \u2013 and some of the key events \u2013 the Markman hearing for example and jury trial slated for after launch of both of these drugs. And I know you have talked about in the past in fact you have a press release I think from last year you know highlighting a potential PI, preliminary injunction. Is that still on the table or how should we think about that given the scheduling order here that \u2013 that\u2019s out there? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Thanks for your question, Chris. We\u2019re focused on having this matter reviewed on the merits. And as you pointed out, we\u2019re fortunate that it looks like we\u2019re going to be able to do that early in the New Year. So, we\u2019ll look forward to \u2013 again this is being reviewed in its entirety. And as you know and as we\u2019ve said before, we feel we have a very strong intellectual property patent estate on this product and we demonstrated in the past our determination to assert our IP rights and defend them and that\u2019s what we look forward to doing for this product early next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hi, guys thank for taking my question. First, congrats on all of the progress in last six months, 12 months on margins and on Kyprolis. So congrats on that. My question is actually on margins in the quarter. David you talked about how you printed a 50% operating margin, which is dangerously close to the 20 \u2013 lower end of the 2018 margin guidance you gave and it sounds like you expect that margin to deteriorate throughout this year. I was wondering if you can talk through some of those dynamics as the year goes on. I think your guidance implies a full year operating margin of may be 44% or 45%, maybe talk about why your guidance implies deterioration throughout the year. And I recognize this is deterioration from a surprisingly great number this quarter? Thanks.","David Meline","Yes, so first of all in Q1 as we said we are really encouraged by the performance in the business which was obviously a combination of solid top line growth, as well as the fact that we had very good expense management in the quarter. If you frame that as to how that evolves through the year then what I would say is a couple of things, one is we\u2019d indicated previously that we expect this year our transformation to deliver about $400 million of incremental savings. And certainly we saw a share of proportionate share of that already land here in Q1. And those savings will continue pretty steadily through the year.","The second dynamic on cost then is around the cost trends in particular if I look at SG&A and the sales and marketing area, as well as R&D, we do expect to see raising costs which is a combination of the fact that we inevitably, normally for the business of the first quarter is the low point for expenses overall for the year, but I think importantly for us right now we do have these launches that are coming up we do expect to underwrite those launches significantly with this transformation savings and we do expect the trend of spending to increase through the year.","So I think you basically framed it correctly as to how we are thinking about this evolving in the year.","Bob Bradway","And Mark, not to miss the opportunity to talk about the long-term as I said and as David said in his remarks, we feel we are clearly making progress towards our long-term objectives including net margin objective.","Arvind Sood","Brian, let\u2019s take the next question.","Operator","Yes and our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Great thanks for taking the question. I want ask one of ivabradine. You guys have highlighted potentially a million patients do you think could potentially be candidates for ivabradine therapy that\u2019s a pretty big market number when you look at how you price that it about 4,500 on an annual basis and well below where forecast are. Can you may be help us think about either why consensus is too low on ivabradine or why not all of that patient population you highlight is actually accessible? Thanks.","Tony Hooper","So we did the initial analysis based around looking at the number of patients with cardiac heart failure and then specifically looking at the subset with heart rates of [70] [ph] and above. And that\u2019s to help us hone down the size of a particular market, the pricing is the pricing is made based on the value proposition we think that we bring into market, obviously we come to market for the first time as a cardiology company and we intend to try and get to as many of those million patients as possible.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Just given the recent outcome of the BP CIA case about and I guess the ruling - the first ruling was that you do not have to go through the patent dance and your confidence in 2017 launch of biosimilar Humira. Can you help me understand like what gives you confidence that the timelines if you were to go through this patent dance won\u2019t go longer because many consultants say that this could go - the BP CIA discussion could go for many years beyond like two-year period or one-year period. So help me understand like giving your knowledge of that process why it won\u2019t take an extremely long time. Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Well here Robyn based on our understanding of legislation based on the progress that we\u2019re making and developing at adalimumab. We still expect that we will be in position to launch that in 2017. And of course with respect to the Sandoz matter we\u2019re expecting that I will be heard in the appeal courts later in the year. Tony do you want to add anything?","Tony Hooper","We\u2019ve basically debating a concept of 180 days notice. So that\u2019s the debate at the moment. Once we get to a point in time that we would agree to live Sandoz they have the right to come to market at risk.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt","Thanks for taking question. May be a follow-up to Mike\u2019s question on the On-body Injector for Neulasta, Tony, I have no idea of how to put the 800 accounts into context, could you tell us sort of how many accounts you have in general for your last overall and is there a target conversion rate that you are hoping to get say over the next 12 months, what would you define as a successful conversion, could you share with us?","Tony Hooper","So the 800 accounts are about 25% of our large customers. And we clearly have a target that we aiming for, I\u2019m not going to be disclosing that at the moment, but we\u2019re driving hard to get a much of our business come to the on-body injector possible.","Eric Schmidt","Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Brian, will you go on?","Operator","Yes, our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Obviously with following your approval of the ivabradine and the upcoming approval of Emab, just wondering if you guys can talk about longer-term thoughts on your cardiovascular franchise because you will be putting your fair familiar sales reps behind these two products, but is there an appetite to continue to add there? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","So, Terence it was a little bit hard to hear your questions, but I think you were asking about Corlanor and Repatha, we are excited as we\u2019ve said to get launched in the cardiovascular field with Corlanor and we think again an innovative medicine and it require some work educate to cardiologist about the appropriate use of this medicine with heart failure patients but we are excited about that and we are excited also about the innovative biology behind Repatha and the opportunity for that medicine and make a big difference for our patients with the risk of heart attack and stroke.","So, our focus is on those two medicines right now to the extent that we have other opportunities to advance innovative biology with big effects in cardiovascular disease, we will look carefully those. And as you know we have one such medicine that\u2019s in late stage of development now, which is our Omecamtiv mecarbil program, which Sean referred earlier in his remarks, so those constitute three pretty exciting innovative opportunities for us right now and if we find opportunities to build on those we\u2019ll look at them carefully.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.","Matt Roden","Great, thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats on the very nice quarter here. Sean I wanted to ask on the ENDEAVOR trial, the Kyprolis that you reported this quarter so, should we assume that the benefit that you saw with Kyprolis over Velcade was observed in both the Velcade experienced and the Velcade na\u00efve patients, because I think trial allowed both. And then can you also elaborate on the differences that you observed in cardiovascular safety between the agents and just putting it together based on the expert feedback? And how do you think these results will impact the standard of care in myeloma here? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay, few questions in there. I\u2019d say yes, we did see a pretty consistent treatment effect of Kyprolis independent of the baseline characteristics of these patients whether they had experienced transplant before whether they had been treated previously with velcade. The CV safety data I don\u2019t have anything additional to say than the information we put in you know the press release until we would be presenting at ASCO. And I do think that this standard of my view on it is that well there is always lots of exciting innovation going on in oncology these days, backbone therapies in this particular disease are going to include a proteasome inhibitor for a good long time and it\u2019s becoming pretty clear that the best agent is Kyprolis.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is [indiscernible] on for Yaron. For Repatha, what do you expect the label to look like? Do you expect standard tolerance to be a specific indication on label or something broader than that.","David Meline","Yes. Of course it\u2019s very hard to predict what regulators will decide to do there I think it is possible to write an indication which speaks to patients who are not adequately treated with respect to their LDL cholesterol response with stands or intolerant to stands so if you look at lot of the recent labeling indications that have been used by the agency they have this sort of the structure and that\u2019s kind of in my mind the base case what you\u2019d expect to hope to get in the various jurisdictions that we\u2019re going to be negotiating the labels. But it\u2019s really hard to predict exactly where the language will like.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang from Leerink.","Howard Liang","Thanks very much and congrats. Regarding the FDA panel for T-VEC next week in recent cases FDA has approved drugs for a narrow indication when the package is less than perfect. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a positive case but can you talk about whether there\u2019s any population where the risk benefit is specially coming for T-VEC. Also are you show the new anyway some of the checkpoint inhibitor combination data at the FDA panel?","David Meline","Okay. So the first question which implies that the package is less than perfect I think it\u2019s probably true, yes, that\u2019s true almost everything we do. And I think that in this case it\u2019s clear that the population that we\u2019re studied in the Phase 3 trial included a fairly broad range of patients with local regional and metastatic melanoma disease. And I think if you\u2019ve seen the data that we\u2019ve presented in various scientific forums, the responded durable response rates and the subgroup analysis looking at survival for that matter how the biggest impact in the earlier stages of the disease. So it is possible that\u2019s where the conversation would go and the advisory committee and with FDA but at this point we do have a positive trial for the whole population that we studied and so that\u2019s the logical place to start the conversation.","And then with respect to the checkpoint inhibitor all we would be doing at the advisory committee meeting would be to have a slide that will indicate of course the various studies that are going on and going with the product that include the ones I\u2019ve referenced in my prepared remarks as well as certainly being in the capable of presenting the pubically available data with the evolocumab combination the Phase 1b data that we presented previously at scientific forum.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Ying Huang from Bank of America.","Ying Huang","Hi. And good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. First of all I have a question on your biosimilar Humira programs here. Now that you\u2019ve finished both Phase 3 trials already what\u2019s the timeline for a submission in your plans. And then secondly do you plan to seek a broad label including oral indications that you did not try in Phase 3 and then quickly also David R&D cost is coming down much faster than SG&A this quarter compared to a year ago should we expect that to continue and is that driven by research or development? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Why don\u2019t we break that into two parts, Sean will talk about the Humira question first?","Sean Harper","Yes. So we do intent to submit Humira later this year the biosimilar later this year. And in fact we would be seeking this sort of a broader labels set of indications through the extrapolation mechanism that is consistent with the current guidances.","Ying Huang","Okay.","Bob Bradway","David?","David Meline","Yes, so in terms of the cost savings what I would fist say is that if you look at the savings we expect this year as well as through the whole program as we\u2019ve said before that those are savings that are being accrued across all of the areas of cost, so it\u2019s not concentrated in one versus the other. And secondly if you look at the particular pattern of savings in the first quarter what you can observe as I mention is that. And as we\u2019ve talked before we are investing freeing up flexibility to invest in our launch portfolio. So you can expect that a substantial share of what we save in SG&A will be reinvested towards the launches and then I think the third thing I\u2019d commented as to R&D that was a combination in the quarter of R&D tends to be rather lumping in terms of the spend.","So you saw a combination of savings and that we are getting from our transformation in the quarter as well as some of the inevitable lumpiness that occurs from quarter-to-quarter in that area. So I think bottom line is that we expect going forward through the year to see rising costs which you typically see in the pattern through the year. But see it a little more accentuated as a combination of rising cost with launch activities as well as in the case of R&D we still are continuing to invest in clinical trials and we will see some increases there.","And then as to the, if I may one final comment R versus D, and basically as we have talked before we\u2019ve done work to look at all of the processes across all of our business activities and so we are seeing efficiencies in both of those areas broadly.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang from Jefferies.","Eun Yang","Thank you. Question on Romosozumab. In the structured trial comparing to Forteo is the change in the BMD if sufficient enough to differentiate it from Forteo or are you following the patient to longer to see difference in non-vertebral fracture risk reduction?","David Meline","Yes, so the studies that are being done with Romosozumab versus Forteo are all designed to look at BMD and as you\u2019ve seen probably the data that I presented at the business review shows that in fact those differences are quite substantial but of course we\u2019re also looking at the quality of bone. And in particular the cortical bone thickness which we\u2019ve also looking at using fairly advanced imaging technologies there is no plan for us to do comparative fracture studies against teriparatide at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys this is Carter on for Geoff. Tony can you provide a NEUPOGEN share of the short-acting GCSF market for the quarter and I guess more broadly what are your expectations regarding potential timing of a potential biosimilar Neulasta I know some biosimilar companies have disclosed plans to file for approval later this year. Potentially just on a PK-PD study without a Phase 3 study your thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Okay. So just remind you in fourth quarter 2014, NEUPOGEN\u2019s market share was 80% first quarter 2015 NEUPOGEN\u2019s market share was 80%. As regard to Neulasta they could end the market towards the end of 2015 when our package expires.","Bob Bradway","Hey Brian, why don\u2019t you go at and take one last question as we\u2019re getting to the top of the hour.","Operator","Yes. And our last question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hi, good afternoon guys, thanks for squeezing me in. So I want to follow-up on Matt\u2019s question regarding Kyprolis. With the impressive result now I want to hand for ENDEAVOR as well as ASPIRE for that matter how do you think about the implications for the frontline CLARION study perhaps more importantly what is your market research suggest about the relative use of proteasome inhibitors in the frontline multiple myeloma study in relative to later stages of treatment thanks.","David Meline","Why don\u2019t I start in terms we can follow-up I think with respect to the CLARION study which of course is the head-to-head study against allocate in the first line setting. We feel that study has been significantly de-risked by seeing the ASPIRE data and the ENDEAVOR data. Now the extent which you\u2019ve been read through results from ENDEAVOR to CLARION is something you know people sit around and debate but certainly we feel good about the likelihood that we\u2019ll see a favorable result from the trial. And Tony, you want to respond to it.","Tony Hooper","Probably we\u2019ve done a fair amount of work I mean it all comes down again to what potential outcome of the CLARION trial will be. But as John just said if we continue to going from ASPIRE to ENDEAVOR we assume we\u2019ll have a positive result versus the competition in the marketplace. The objective in multiple myeloma is to drive progression free survival for as long as possible before you have to go onto your second and third line therefore we assume that we\u2019ll be seeing usage in first inline to once we got the indication.","Bob Bradway","All right. Corey thanks for your question as you point out things are going very well for Kyprolis and we\u2019re excited about the data that we have in hand as well as the data that we may generate well thanks for joining our call, Arvind and his team will be around if there are questions that you didn\u2019t get a chance to ask on the call. And we\u2019ll look forward to connecting with you on the next quarterly call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Okay, thanks Ian. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us today on our first quarter call. Special welcome to those who are new in their coverage of our company including Jay Olsen of Oppenheimer, Yaron Werber of Cowen, and Bill Kim of BMO. So we go into 2019 having put in place a strong track record of execution, and we are well prepared for the challenges and opportunities ahead.","I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic overview of our business and the environment we operate in. after Bob\u2019s comments, our CFO David Meline will review our financial results for the first quarter.","Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon, will then review our product performance, following by our Head of R&D David Reese who will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides to guide our discussion today and you should have received a link separately.","Just a reminder that we will use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bradway","Thank you, Arvind, and let me add to Arvind\u2019s welcome to all of you joining the call today. We entered 2019 with a strong track record of execution and an improved ability to innovate, compete, and grow over the long term. We feel now well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities presented by our newer products in our pipeline, even as we effectively defend our mature products against emerging and expected new competition.","As you know, drug prices are being challenged around the world, and we, therefore, have said for some time that we expect volume-driven growth to be important to our long-term success. And in Q1, we once again demonstrated our ability to grow unit volumes, especially for our newer products like Prolia, Repatha, and Aimovig, as well as for our six hematology\/oncology products that are in early phases of their life cycle.","I believe our performance outside of the US, where we have faced biosimilar competition for over a decade is instructive. There, our business generated 15% unit volume growth in the first quarter as growth of our newer products more than offset the erosion of our mature brands and biosimilar competition.","We remain confident in the lifecycle management strategies we have in place to defend our mature brands, and we believe there is considerable upside potential with our newer products that will drive attractive long-term growth.","As a leader in bone health with Prolia, we know that there's a need for an additional innovative therapy for women who are at high risk for fracture from postmenopausal osteoporosis. In Q1, we added Evenity to our portfolio of first in class innovative medicines with approvals in Japan and earlier this month in the US.","Postmenopausal osteoporosis remains a highly underdiagnosed and undertreated disease with potentially devastating consequences from fractures, many of which are predictable and preventable. And we're excited to be at the forefront of offering innovative products to the millions of women worldwide who may benefit from them.","I want to take a moment to highlight our biosimilars business, which we think represents a compelling opportunity to leverage our world-class biologics capabilities. This business is now annualizing at more than $200 million this year, with Kanjinti and Amgevita off to strong starts in Europe and select other international markets.","We expect other launches this year and we see biosimilars making important contributions to our revenue profile moving forward, especially as pressure on our drug pricing creates increased demand for lower cost treatment options. Murdo will discuss our full product portfolio in some detail shortly.","Looking to the future, we are rapidly advancing a robust pipeline of innovative medicines, many of which have the potential to be first in class or best-in-class therapies. In oncology alone, we're capitalizing on our industry-leading BiTE portfolio and targeted therapies across a number of important disease areas including multiple myeloma, AML, as well as various solid tumors.","As, you know, oncology programs can move very rapidly from proof of concept to registration, and we're excited about what we're seeing. You'll hear more from Dave Reese on our pipeline in a moment.","Our strong balance sheet and cash flow has enabled us to provide significant returns to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends, even as we invest in long-term, volume-driven growth opportunities around the world.","Our financial strength also gives us the ability to consider a wide range of business development opportunities, consistent with our areas of strategic focus, while remaining disciplined to ensure we earn a solid return for shareholders.","Let me just say a few words also about health care reform and drug pricing. Simply stated, we're in favor of policies that provide more patients with greater access to better health care, and we continue to work with the administration and Congress to advance policies that harness the competitive power of the marketplace, encourage innovation, and improve access to new therapies for patients. For example, we're supportive of the administration's proposal to move from back-end rebates to upfront discounts in order to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients.","Even in the face of net price declines, as we experienced last year, patients are not seeing the benefits of rebates. In fact, out-of-pocket costs for patients have been rising in recent years, which underscores the need for the administration to move forward with its final rule.","I want to just close with one final message, which is that we will build on our recent transformation successes and have the resources and determination to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us to meet our competitive challenges and to deliver long-term growth.","Now, let me invite David to share his remarks on the first quarter.","David Meline","Okay, thanks Bob. The first quarter marked another period of solid performance for the company as we delivered mid-single digit volume growth globally, while we increased investment in the business and delivered year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth in the first quarter.","Turning to the financial results on page six of the slide deck, worldwide revenues were 5.6 billion in the first quarter, with worldwide product sales of 5.3 billion, declining 1% year over year as strong unit demand for our newer products was offset by declines in our mature products, including small molecule generic competition against Sensipar.","Other revenues at 271 million, increased 60 million driven by royalty income growth. As we continue to make incremental investments to rapidly advance our innovative pipeline and maximize the value of our marketed products, our non-GAAP operating expenses increased 11% year over year. This also contributed to our non-GAAP operating income result at 9% lower than previous year.","On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased by 2 points to 14.7%, driven by higher manufacturing costs and product mix, partially offset by lower royalty expense. As mentioned last quarter, for the full year, we continue to expect year over year cost of sales expense to be flat to up depending on sales volume.","First quarter research and development expenses of 859 million were 16% higher due to increased investments in support of our multiple differentiated early-stage oncology programs. Research and development expense as a percent of product sales was 16.3% for the quarter. For the full year, we currently expect R&D spend on an absolute basis to rise in single-digit percentage terms in 2019.","SG&A expenses increased 5% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by support for our newly launched products, including Aimovig, Evenity, and our biosimilar Amgevita and Kanjinti. For the full year, we continued to expect SG&A spend to decline as launch expenses normalize, and we continue with our resource allocation discipline.","We remain on track to meet our initial 2019 operating expense guidance of inline versus 2018 on an absolute basis. Our operating expense guidance anticipates several important factors, including one, that we continue to benefit from our productivity program; two, that we make appropriate investments in support of our in line portfolio; three, that we advance our innovative and biosimilar programs; and fourth, that we continue to increase our global presence where we are experiencing rapid volume growth.","Other income and expenses were a net 158 million expense in Q1. This is favorable by 24 million on a year over year basis. The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.6% for the quarter, an increase of 0.9 percentage points, primarily due to prior year tax benefit associated with inter-company sales under US corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP net income declined 10% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 3% year over year for the first quarter to $3.56 per share.","Turning next to cash flow on the balance sheet on page seven. Free cash flow was 1.7 billion. This was lower than first quarter last year driven by lower net income and an increase in sales deductions paid to customers following higher third and fourth quarter 2018 sales.","I note that Q2 will be negatively impacted as we make one-time tax payments of approximately a billion dollars, including our second annual repatriation tax payment. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments, as we deployed 3 billion in Q1 to repurchase 15.9 million shares at an average price of a $191 per share.","Given our attractive share price, we plan to repurchase an incremental 1.5 billion to 2 billion of our shares in Q2. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1.4 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Cash and investments totaled 26.3 billion, a decrease of approximately 5.9 billion from the first quarter of last year. Our debt balance stands at 33 billion as of March 31, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 4% and an average maturity of 10.8 years.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2019 on page eight, we remain on track with our plans to continue to invest to advance our pipeline, including our early oncology programs, build out our global presence, and drive long-term volume grow. In light of our Q1 performance, we are raising our 2019 guidance.","Our revised revenue guidance is 22.0 billion to 22.9 billion versus previous guidance of 21.8 billion to 22.9 billion. This continues to reflect the range of outcomes related to Sensipar generic competition as well as the evolving competitive dynamics associated with the rest of our inline portfolio.","With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we're revising the outlook to $13.25 to $14.30 per share versus previous guidance of $13.10 to $14.30 per share. Further, we're maintaining our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 14% to 15% and we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.","This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Murdo.","Murdo Gordon","Thanks, David and good afternoon everyone. You'll find product sales information starting on slides 10 and 11. We're off to a solid start in 2019 with continued volume driven growth across our portfolio of newer products, while we successfully execute lifecycle management strategies in our more mature brands.","Moving to first quarter results, let me start with repatha on slide 12. Given the dynamic nature of the PCSK9 class and our confidence in Repatha, I want to provide some detail on its performance and growth prospects. Q1 sales grew by 15% year-over-year, as we hold leading share of the PCSK9 class. Worldwide unit growth was 81% year-over-year with 90% unit growth in the US. The growth is attributable to increasing prescribing depth by cardiologists, increasing prescribing breadth by primary care physicians, and increasing patient fulfillment following the introduction of lower list price Repatha.","In Medicare, lower list price Repatha is now available to more than 60% of seniors. The next step is to make the lower list price version available to a majority of Part D patients at a lower fixed copay versus the current co-insurance structure. While this is underway, it's expected to improve early next year as Part D plans update for 2020. Currently, only 6% of Medicare patients are at a low fixed copay level of above $50.","For patients covered by commercial insurance, approval rates have improved by 11 points year-over-year, as we continue to secure improved payer utilization management criteria through contracting. We will continue to work with health plans, PBMs and the US administration to get lower list price Repatha to patients more rapidly. And we remain committed to discontinue our original list price Repatha we see sufficient coverage in the market, which could be between now and the beginning of 2020.","With regard to pricing, the blended net price for Repatha in the US declined in Q1 due to annual contracts that took effect in January. We're optimistic that we will see a positive impact on volume growth and reported net sales over the longer term. Outside of the US, we continue to work with country authorities to optimize access and are pleased with our first ever launch in China. Overall, our priority remains to help the large underserved population of high risk cardiovascular patients that can benefit from Repatha.","Onto Prolia on slide 13. Prolia delivered another strong quarter with sales increasing 20% year-over-year, driven by 17% volume growth. As a reminder, given its six month dosing interval, Prolia exhibits a seasonal sales pattern with Q1 and Q3, representing lower sales than Q2 and Q4. Overall market penetration of the addressable patient population is only in the mid-20% range, indicating significant potential for improved diagnosis and treatment. With his unique profile and through increasing investment, we expect Prolia will remain a very consistent growth driver.","I'd like to take the opportunity to comment on our recent approval and launches of EVENITY in the US and Japan in conjunction with our partners, UCB and Astellas. The World Health Organization calls osteoporosis a global epidemic, as there are fewer diagnosed and treated patients in the US than a decade ago. In the US alone, osteoporosis is responsible for 2 million fractures and given the aging population, annual direct costs of osteoporosis are expected to reach $25 billion by the year 2025.","EVENITY has convenient once-monthly physician administer dosing for 12 months and strengthens Amgen\u2019s leading position in bone health with two highly innovative molecules that are complementary. We are confident in our ability to continue to penetrate this market. Our US sales force is trained and is already promoting the product. Meanwhile, our launch in Japan through our joint venture with Astellas is off to a strong start.","Now on to Aimovig on slide 14. To begin, the unmet need for migraine is substantial. There are approximately 4 million individuals in the US alone who take preventative medications for migraines. However, compliance is low as 75% discontinue therapy after only a year. Approximately 200,000 new patients in the US have now tried Aimovig since it launched less than a year ago, and it remains a significant opportunity for growth as CGRP penetration of the overall market is low.","We expect this number to expand considerably given the 26% sequential TRX market growth for CGRP inhibitors in Q1. Prescriber breath is consistently increasing as over 22,000 physicians have now prescribed Aimovig since launch. We\u2019re particularly encouraged the primary care adoption is steadily rising, with nearly 8000 prescribers to date. We also have indicators that our recently launched direct to consumer program is increasing patient awareness for Aimovig.","Now, let me take a few minutes to help you understand Aimovig\u2019s performance in Q1. First, Amgen is the market leader with 40% share of new to brand prescriptions, and 60% share of the total prescriptions exiting Q1. Aimovig benefits from strong market access conditions with over 75% approval rates for new patients in both commercial and Medicare Part D plans. ","Regarding net selling prices, we experienced a decline, that is the net result of two dynamics. Recall that during the early launch phase of the product, a majority of paid prescriptions were reimbursed at near list price. Currently, the proportion of our business under commercial contract and receiving discounts is near 70%. Meanwhile, the proportion of paid versus free prescriptions increased to 60% at the end of the first quarter.","Looking forward, we expect to see strong CGRP market growth, while competing effectively for share. Offsetting this, Aimovig patient persistence will continue to be dynamic, given competing free product offerings in the market. We expect net prices to stabilize in 2019 as a majority of coverage decisions have been made.","Additionally, the proportion of free prescriptions should continue to decline over the remainder of 2019. We're confident in the potential for Aimovig to positively impact patient lives and the recent launch of the single 140 milligram auto injector will further enhance the patient experience.","Moving to our Hematology and Oncology business, the portfolio of XGEVA, Kyprolis, Nplate, Vectibix, BLINCYTO and IMLYGIC collectively totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 8% year-over-year. Looking at additional details, for some of the larger brands within this portfolio, let's start with XGEVA on slide 16.","In Q1, XGEVA grew 6% year-over-year primarily from volume as we gradually see share increasing to just above 60% in the US. We recently received preferred status over zoledronic acid in castration resistance prostate cancer in the recently revised NCCN guidelines, reinforcing XGEVA superiority in this indication. Moving to Kyprolis, which grew 10% year-on-year driven primarily by growth in key markets including the US, which had 12% growth. ","Our team continues to emphasize Kyprolis overall survival benefit, and we are pleased to see increased adoption of the once weekly dose approaching close to 20% of share of Kyprolis use in the US.","On to Enbrel, sales increased 4% year-over-year, of which 2% was non-recurring, which included a positive 10 point impact from changes in accounting estimates offset partially by 8 points from unfavorable inventory changes. During Q1, rheumatology market growth accelerated by 12% versus the 6% on average over the last eight quarters. Share trends continued and we recognized a limited benefit from net selling price in the quarter, which we expect to persist for the full year.","We continue to invest in Enbrel, including the Enbrel mini with Auto touch, a multi-use device, which continues to receive positive feedback from physicians and patients. ","Next to our filgrastim brands starting on slide 19. In Q1, Neulasta sales declined 12% year-over-year, which included a $98 million purchase from BARDA. We exited Q1 with approximately 90% share of the long acting segment with Onpro holding share at close to 60% of the segment. Insurance coverage of Neulasta also remains strong in the US with close to 90% of commercial lives and 99% of Medicare lives covered. ","Currently, we're seeing increased competition in medium sized clinics and small non-340b hospitals and are prepared for additional US entrance in 2019, should they receive approval. Outside of the US, Q1 year-over-year sales declined 12%. We now face three long acting biosimilar competitors in a number of countries in Europe and expect additional entrants during 2019, which will likely accelerate the pace of the client.","More broadly, we remain confident that our experienced establish record of quality, dependable supply, and innovative solutions such as Onpro will serve us well as we compete account by account.","Turning to slide 20, Neupogen sales were $73 million in Q1 \u201919, sequentially US Q1 results benefited from $7 million of accounting adjustments and Neupogen exited the first quarter with roughly 30% share of the short acting segment. Since the introduction of Neupogen biosimilars in the US, costs to the healthcare system for short acting filgrastim have come down meaningfully.","Switching to nephrology starting on slide 21, Q1 Epogen sales declined 10% due to lower net selling price. The first quarter benefited from approximately $20 million of large end customer purchases. Given our contractual pricing commitments with DaVita, net price will continue to decline for Epogen in 2019. Aranesp declined 9% year-over-year in Q1, driven by lower volume due to increased competition. We expect Aranesp sales to continue to decline at a faster rate in 2019 versus 2018 with both long acting and short acting competition in the US.","Parsabiv continues to experience solid growth, independent and mid-sized dialysis providers utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcium emetic patients, while FMC and DaVita are gradually increasing adoption.","Turning to Sensipar, as a result of some at risk small molecule generic launches you can see on slide 24, that our US Q1 sales of $135 million are significantly lower than recent quarters. Given the intrusion of these at risk launches that have now occurred, we expect US sales in Q2 to be lower than Q1. Going forward, performance will be dependent on the outcome of legal proceedings and the rate of consumption of generic inventory across periods.","I'd like to close by highlighting the strong performance of our biosimilars where uptake of our European launches for KANJINTI and AMGEVITA is progressing as we anticipated. We're planning for multiple new launches from this portfolio over the next few years and look forward to bringing the value of these assets to patients and the health care system. ","In summary, I'm pleased with the solid execution and dedication of our team, as our portfolio evolves in 2019. We're successfully launching new products, driving volume growth and demonstrating the value of our mature brands. We're also now establishing a strong presence in the biosimilars market with customers who appreciate the high quality of Amgen services and product supply. I'm confident that we are prepared to maximize the opportunities to bring Amgen\u2019s products to a greater number of patients.","Now, let me turn it over to Dave Reese.","David Reese","Thanks, Murdo and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a rapid and exciting start to 2019 in R&D with progress across our pipeline. I'll begin with our oncology portfolio. We continue to advance our BiTE platform with approximately a dozen molecules now in or close to the clinic. In hematologic malignancies, at ASCO, we will provide an update on the dose escalation trial of our first generation BCMA BiTE molecule, AMG 420. We are now enrolling patients in a dose expansion study.","We also expect some of the first clinical data from our new generation BiTE platform by the end of the year with AMG701 and extended half life BCMA BiTE molecule. Our enthusiasm is high for our BCMA BiTE molecules as well as our CD38 bispecific and MCL1 programs as we pursue our commitment to develop therapies that can make a meaningful impact on the treatment of multiple myeloma.","Other presentations at ASCO will include the first in human dose escalation study of AMG 212, a BiTE molecule directed against prostate specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, which is highly and specifically expressed in the majority of human prostate tumors. This clinical study was conducted by Bayer through a license they had with Micromet prior to our acquisition. We believe the data from this trial provide proof of concept for the target and bispecific T-cell engager approach in solid tumors, and we have introduced a new half-life extended BiTE molecule, AMG 160, into clinical testing for prostate cancer.","AMG 160 is now progressing briskly through dose escalation. As with all of the targets for which we have both first generation and half-life extended BiTE molecules in clinical development, we will preferentially advance the halfway extended molecule if we observe comparable safety and efficacy between the two formats.","One final note on our BiTE programs. Recently, we have seen intriguing early clinical evidence of potentially enhanced activity of a BiTE molecule, in this case, BLINCYTO, when given in combination with a PD1 inhibitor. We anticipate sharing a larger data set within a year or so. There's substantial evidence that T-cell activation leads to up regulation of the PD1 access, providing a rationale for this combination. ","Based on these biologic and clinical insights, we are incorporating early checkpoint inhibitor combinations into many of our BiTE programs and I'll have more to say on this as studies initiate and we accrue data. ","I'd like to turn now to a program of great interest, our KRAS G12C program, AMG 510. By way of background, RAS mutations occur in about 25% of all human cancers and the specific KRAS G12C mutation occurs in about 14% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common form of non-small cell lung cancer. It also occurs in about 4% of colon cancers, a couple of percent of pancreatic tumors and at low frequency and various other cancers.","RAS has been a target of active exploration since it was identified as one of the first oncogene, but it remained undruggable due to lack of traditional small molecule binding pockets on the protein. The G12C mutation produces a very shallow group, which allowed us through elegant medicinal chemistry to design an irreversible small molecule inhibitor that locks KRAS into its inactive state.","I've spoken in the past on how we are improving productivity and accelerating the timelines of drug development here at Amgen, and AMG 510 is an excellent example. When we knew that we could generate an inhibitor to a key oncogene that had been un-druggable for over 30 years, we accelerated preclinical development and advanced the program from discovery to first in human trials in well under a year.","Our presentations at AACR demonstrated that we have a highly specific molecule with good drug like characteristics that can be dosed orally once a day. We also showed in preclinical models that AMG 510 may act synergistically with other agents, a particular interest where the preclinical data AMG inflamed 510 inflamed tumors, in part by up regulating class 1 MHC expression and enhance sensitivity to checkpoint inhibition.","We look forward to the opportunity to share the initial data from our first in-human dose escalation study in patients with solid tumors containing KRAS G12C mutations at the upcoming ASCO meeting in Chicago where we will also be hosting an investor event. There have been a lot of questions on the extent of the data that will be available. And what I would say here is that you should expect basic exposure data and the cumulative efficacy and safety data we've got to date.","While we have been in the clinic for only about eight months, we've completed dose escalation and are expanding enrollment at the target dose. Moving forward, we will also be exploring AMG 510 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors based on the preclinical work I've described and various targeted therapies. And we are currently moving ahead to include a combination with a PD1 inhibitor in our expansion study.","Based on the early clinical data and feedback from our investigators, we're very optimistic on the potential for AMG 510 to address unmet medical need, and look forward to seeing many of you at ASCO. Finally, in oncology, we recently began recruiting patients in a combination study of [indiscernible] plus AMG 176, our intravenous MCL1 inhibitor in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and AML l after seeing strong preclinical evidence of synergy. ","We're also rapidly advancing our oral MCL1 inhibitor, AMG 397 through dose escalation in patients with hematologic malignancies. We expect initial clinical data from these programs later this year, along with several other programs. In our accompanying presentation, you can find an overview of our hematology oncology clinical portfolio.","Moving to our other therapeutic areas, as a leader in bone health, we are pleased to receive approval of EVENITY as Murdo noted in the US for the treatment of osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture based on disease characteristics or a history of fracture. Postmenopausal osteoporosis, a silent epidemic that affects women in societies around the world, leads to approximately 2 million fragility fractures per year in the United States alone. Despite this, it remains an under diagnosed and undertreated disease with only 20% of these women receiving any type of osteoporosis treatment post fracture. EVENITY is the first and only anabolic therapy with a unique dual effect that both increases bone formation and, to a lesser extent, reduces bone resorption. For patients who need to rapidly increase bone mineral density in 12 months, EVENITY can reduce the risk of a first or subsequent fracture, and in particular, clinical fractures with symptomatic breaks that often lead to disability.","In cardiovascular disease, we expect the complete enrollment of our Omecamtiv mecarbil phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study by mid-year and recently passed an interim futility analysis with no recommended changes to the study. AMG 890 or LP(a) siRNA also continues to progress and we anticipate sharing data later this year or early next year. We recently received a pediatric indication for Corlanor for the treatment of stable symptomatic heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy in patients stage six months and older who are in sinus rhythm with an elevated heart rate.","And finally, in migraine, as Murdo noted, we received approval for our single 140 milligram Aimovig auto injector, our pre filled syringe in the US. Following inflammation, we began enrolling a phase 2 atopic dermatitis study with Tezepelumab. I'm also pleased to report that our phase 3 study for ABP 959 or biosimilar is enrolling patients.","I\u2019ll close by thanking our staff for advancing our exciting pipeline and continuing to deliver for our patients. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay, thank you. Let's open the line up now for questions. And perhaps, I can ask our operator to remind you what the procedures are for submitting your questions. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Dave, I was hoping to ask a two part on KRAS. So I guess the first thing is, it seems like you've progressed through the dose escalation period fairly rapidly. Is that because you hit the MTD faster than you were expecting or are there other factors such as faster enrollment at play? And then how should we view the fact that you're pushing forward here with combinations with PD1? As part of that, the monotherapy efficacy that you've seen is below what you were expecting, or do you think you can drive efficacy substantially higher with those combinations? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Thanks, Matt, for the questions around the KRAS program. Let me take them in order. In terms of the dose escalation, I think we will present the clinical data at ASCO. We had a planned dose escalation in the phase 1 trial, we were able to move through that very quickly based on tolerability. We had quite brisk enrollment based on pre-identification of patients at most of our centers, and we're pleased to have been able to move along in eight months, in a population that is a fraction of lung cancers and other tumors. ","In terms of the combination, as I've indicated before, I think based on the clinical setting, these molecules may find a home as either monotherapy or in combination. It\u2019s early days, and we're moving quickly to investigate both of these approaches as we move forward and the combinations will be not only with PD-L1 inhibitors based on some of the preclinical data that I described in terms of the KRAS inhibitor, inflaming tumors, and upregulating MHC 1 expression, but also data we've generated on other components of the pathway. So I think all of those will be pieces of what we explore going forward. This program is moving as quickly as almost any I've ever seen here at Amgen.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Maybe Bob would love your perspective just on the proposed Part B demonstration project. In particular, do you anticipate that the IPI proposal could remain here, do you expect there could be any changes? Thanks a lot.","Bob Bradway","Well, it's a proposed rule as your question implies, Terence and that enabled quite a bit of commentary and the administration has received something like 4,000 comments from different groups, including quite a wide range of physician groups and patient groups that were concerned about the proposal. It won't surprise you to know that we're concerned about it, and we've expressed that concern as well. We're not interested in seeing patient access to innovative new medicines and physician choice impaired by a potential rule like this. So we and others in the innovative industry have expressed that to the administration. ","And I think if you compare the situation in the United States where patients have access to innovative medicines very rapidly, in fact, if you just look at cancer, 95% of the new cancer medicines are available to Medicare patients here in the US, and that compares to about 65% of the same medicines being available in France. And by the way, in France, they're available some 21 months later. So in a cancer patient, that can mean the difference between life and death. So we're not in favor of a rule like this that might have the effect of diminishing access to innovation and impairing investments in innovation over the long term. ","Having said that, we have been working with the administration around other proposals that we think can help address the concerns of the administration, and we'd like to continue to do that. So we think there are some things that the administration could pursue that would enable the government to get access to the market prices and still enable physicians and patients to use the medicines that they think are appropriate for these diseases.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang","My first question has to do with the Neulasta trend. So year-over-year, sales came down by 12%, units went up by 1%, inventory went down 3, so by my math, the net price is probably coming down by roughly 10%. Can you comment on the pricing trend for the rest of the year for Neulasta? And then can you quickly provide an update on the Enbrel patent ruling against Sandoz.","Murdo Gordon","So Ying, I'll take the first one and then I'll ask Bob perhaps to talk about the other question regarding Sandoz and Enbrel. I think overall, we're pleased with how we're performing in the market despite two biosimilar competitors against Neulasta. In particular, we see good durability of our Onpro business, which is holding at around 60% share of the long acting filgrastim franchise. We also continue to compete at an account by account level, and we defend as you point out significant volumes. What will drive further price erosion and potentially share erosion is the number of new competitive entrants, and we're following that very closely going forward.","Bob Bradway","On the court case, nothing new to report. As you know, we're waiting for the judge to rule and nothing new to report there.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much. And first question, David, just on the KRAS, could you help us understand how -- in terms of expectations, how treatment response to this particular intervention should compare to other mutations in lung cancer that we're accustomed to seeing? For example, for EGFR, just is it likely to be as canonical if you like as those mutations?","And then secondly, Murdo, if you could just give us a little bit more color on Aimovig in particular, it does look as though you've come out of some pressure in terms of share of new prescriptions. Is that a one-time event in the first quarter that we're seeing in the prescription data or has there been a step down because of the contract, and is this the new baseline? Thanks.","David Meline","Sure, I'll go ahead and start with the question regarding KRAS biology. I think, there's probably no specific answer for that, Jeff. In some tumors, this mutation will be a trunk mutation, a driver mutation, and we may well expect monotherapy activity in other tumors based on the other suite of molecular alterations that are present, you may need combinations or another approach. I think these are all things we will sort out where we'll be doing extensive molecular profiling on the tumors as we move forward to try to sort out the best predictors of response and resistance.","Murdo Gordon","Yeah, and Jeff, considering the huge unmet need in migraine, we continue to feel good about the opportunity to grow new prescription base and to continue to compete effectively for share. As you know, we're still the market leader with 60% TRx share, around a 40% NBRx share. We have nice coverage across commercial and Medicare Part D payers. And we continue to drive good increases in the percent of patients that are paying for their Aimovig through commercial insurance benefits. So what we are seeing in our trends, in our total prescriptions is some effect of the bolus of patients that we secured when we first launched into the market and working then through the free drug to paid transition. We're also trying to understand what the persistence is in the CGRP category. We saw that it was between 20% and 30% in clinical trials, we'll be looking to see how that shapes up in the real world as we move forward.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Kennen Mackay from RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen Mackay","Quick R&D question, you'd mentioned tezepelumab phase 2 moving forward in atopic derm, hadn't Tezepelumab missed a primary important in the prior phase 2a and AD and what sort of the difference in how you're thinking about this, how high has this evolved?","Murdo Gordon","Yeah. I think we've gained a greater understanding of the approach to the disease, the variants and background medications. This is the disease that also has a waxing and waning on natural history. And so, we have, with our partners, have designed a subsequent phase 2 study that we think will rigorously evaluate the utility of Tezepelumab in AD.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould from UBS Equities.","Carter Gould","I want to change the pace for a second, ask one on the Omecamtiv progress you've been making, specifically, if there are any additional planned interim analyses either for futility or stopping really for efficacy. And then just maybe your initial thoughts on how this, you think this may be positioned in HF, maybe alongside [indiscernible]?","David Meline","Sure. This is Dave. I'll take that question. So, typically in these trials, there are interim analyses for efficacy. They are event driven, and we will communicate at the appropriate time as we might expect those data. I think one of the things that excites us about Omecamtiv is that its mechanism of action is novel, we think it's orthogonal to many of the existing therapies and should be able to be added to existing background therapies. To me, that's one of the potential great attractions of the drug for advanced heart failure.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen and Company.","Yaron Werber","Great. Thank you. So David, I've also a follow up on KRAS, can you give us a little bit of a sense, was this a typical three by three dose escalation? Or are you doing into patient escalation? And would you break out the results by tumor type as well? And then I have a quick question on Sensipar.","David Reese","Yeah, what I'll say is all those questions will be answered at ASCO. And, I don't want to get out in front of our investigators and steal their thunder, but will provide great detail in the phase 1 presentation.","What was your second question? Wanted to ask a second question about Sensipar?","Yaron Werber","Can you give us a sense? Are the launchers for Sensipar, are they [indiscernible] and are they still subject to the litigation coming up in in June?","David Meline","Yeah, so what I'd say, this is Meline. So first point is, if you look at the guidance that we offered this afternoon, what we've given you is, while it's a bit narrower, it's still quite broad. And the reason for that is the uncertainty around, will we have additional launches this year or not. And of course, that is driven by the fact that we do have litigation that's still going on and we expect that to conclude here sometime in the coming months. So, hence the breath of the guidance.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Do Kim from BMO Capital Markets.","Do Kim","I wanted to ask about the Humira biosimilar market in Europe. We know that biosimilars in the European landscape is fairly mature. But with so many competitors out there, how are you seeing how the market for Humira will shape out and how do you position your biosimilar with so many competitors?","Murdo Gordon","Yeah. Thank you, Do for the question. This is Murdo. What we're seeing in Europe in general in the biosimilars market is more rapid penetration of the biosimilars of the innovator compound, so higher biosimilar penetration in general across a number of different categories. Our shares are more or less in line with what we had anticipated and price is a little lower. So we're seeing higher volume due to that penetration, offsetting somewhat lower prices and the prices you have to be a little bit careful. Most of the interest and news that we read about on pricing, particularly in the case of the Humira biosimilar were related to tender prices in some smaller European markets. And those were pretty significant winner takes all price reductions. What you're seeing in the broader marketplace at the national formulary level and at regional formularies are better prices holding up quite well and we foresee the biosimilar business to be a significant revenue driver for some time to come.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer.","Jay Olson","I'm curious about the VESALIUS-CV outcomes trial for Repatha. Can you comment on the key differences between this outcomes trial and the Fourier trial and how that study may impact on long term commercial potential for Repatha?","And then separately, anything we should be looking out for at AAN next week in terms of data for Aimovig. Thank you.","David Reese","Well, I'll get half of the Repatha question and then Murdo will take the other one and I can address that Aimovig at AAN. So in terms of VESALIUS, these are patients with known, essentially known coronary artery disease, but who have not had an event, so they are very high risk. It's a population that, numbers in the millions beyond what we were the target population studied in the Fourier trial. We think it should add to the substantial body of evidence that we have with Repatha in another high risk population.","Murdo, you may want to comment on the commercial component.","Murdo Gordon","Yeah, we\u2019re continuing to work hard to penetrate that high risk cardiovascular patient population and compete in that category. We are seeing the data are more similar than different to what we've already had in the public domain. And we're really pleased with the 80%, 81% volume evolution and we continue to believe that more and more physicians are understanding the value of treating these higher risk cardiovascular patients.","David Reese","And then in terms of Aimovig data at the American Academy of Neurology meeting, which is starting in four or five days, we do have what I think are some very interesting data, long term safety and efficacy data in both chronic and episodic migraine. The abstracts for those who are interested are up now. In chronic migraine, for example, we were able to show that roughly two-thirds of patients were able to convert to episodic migraine, meaning fewer than 15 migraine days per month. And on average, depending on the population and the dose, the number of migraine headache days per month was reduced by 8 to 12 days per month. That's a very substantial clinical impact for these patients, as you can imagine. So those data are coming out within the next week or so.","Bob Bradway","Those data also support the launch of the new single 140 milligram dose. So they give in that patients who got to that higher dose tends to do even better on conversion.","David Reese","Right. And there are, in those patients, complete responders, which is remarkable in this disease.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.","Michael Yee","Hey, thanks for the question. Good afternoon. I guess I wanted to ask a question related to two ongoing litigation issues, somewhat with the same company. One is, if for some reason the IP does not go in your favor for some reason on Enbrel, what are the implications? And what are the scenarios that we should know or for shareholders to know?","And then maybe you can just comment on the separate litigation related to Aimovig, the thing that was a bit surprising to people. So maybe just comment on what the implications are there. Thanks so much.","Bob Bradway","Yeah, sure, Mike. I can understand that. On the first one, we feel pretty strongly about the IP case that was presented. And so obviously, if judgment were to go against us, we would immediately appeal. But on the Aimovig partnership, look, the first thing to underscore is that the teams in the field are committed to doing what's right for patients here and it's unfortunate that we have a dispute with our partner about this matter. But that's why we had dispute resolution options specified in a contract like this. So we feel that our partner is enabling a competitor product. And so we want to pursue that matter in courts, and that's where we are. But as I said, that will probably play out over a period of time. And in the meanwhile, both teams are committed to continuing to pursue this therapy for those patients who benefit from it.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Alethia Young","I just wanted to talk a little bit about the biosimilars because I know you've had put out kind of a longer term guidance around the 3 billion number, but I just wanted now that we have some biosimilars in the market, how you guys are thinking about the prospects, do you think it\u2019s a more attractive business, less attractive about the same, just want you to kind of frame some of the puts and takes that we can think about potential longer term value of that business?","Bob Bradway","Obviously, it's still very early days in the US based on our European experience and what we continue to believe the market outlook is, in the US, wouldn't change the long range comments we've made. Historically, I think that they still hold up. And we continue to pursue a number of really interesting and solid molecules and we continue to prepare for launches in the US in the not too distant future.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan.","Cory Kasimov","I wanted to ask on Aimovig and wondered if you could provide some color on this constipation issue that some docs and your competitors talk about with the drug. I guess I'm wondering how frequently this leads to discontinuations and what you might be doing to alleviate this, assuming it is even in fact an issue.","Murdo Gordon","Yeah, thanks for the question. We do hear about this issue. And obviously we're always making sure that we provide necessary patient support and physician support around the safety net part of our product. But we also think on this one, there's quite a large amount of rhetoric that's been created around this issue, given how the product performed in clinical trials, the stated incidence of constipation, our label, and it'll even be reported in the long term follow up data at AAN. And so I think it's been well characterized in good, well designed and continuous clinical trials. ","We're also pleased that many physicians, particularly the prescribers in the large scale headache centers, are telling us that it's a relatively low incidence, and that they have very little trouble having patients started on Aimovig and persisting. I think, some of the other things we're seeing in persistence and I mentioned it in response to an earlier questioner just, given that we were the entire market for many months without competition, we are seeing some persistence effects in our continuing patient population that are different than what you might have concluded from looking at the clinical trials. ","And that's a function of both people who are moving from one free trial offer to another. And it's a function of people who are perhaps not pursuing commercial insurance. And obviously, there's a small component of that that is switching away to other agents. So there's still an evolving understanding of how persistent patients are to your question on discontinuation of Aimovig and it will take many months to understand that you need at least a 12 month look back period. That puts us in the 18 to 24 month timeframe before we'll be able to actually ascertain durability.","David Reese","And Cory from a clinical perspective, I would reiterate what Murdo said, what we hear from physicians experts is that they see it at a low incidence? It's clinically quite manageable. They don't really view it as any sort of barrier at all.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Just had a pipeline question for Dave. Broadly on the earlier pipeline, you're still in dose escalation for BCMA, for PSMA, for KRAS, et cetera. But presumably you\u2019ve had some evidence of efficacy and I know it's data dependent, but is there a path to moving rapidly into pivotal studies, even if it's the registration phase 2, I just wasn't sure if this was even an option or there had been discussions with regulators on this. Thanks.","Murdo Gordon","Yeah, of course, that'll vary program by program. But what I would say in general is that our goal in these programs will be to move as quickly as we can through dose escalation and then move into expansion and potentially pivotal phases of the program. I think given the target diseases and the potential regulatory paths, that's a realistic expectation. And that's how we've planned many of the clinical development programs.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","I wanted to go back to KRAS again for a quick second and basically ask, based on everything you saw in the preclinical data, would you have expected to hit MTD by this third or fourth dose? And also you mentioned seeing cumulative efficacy at ASCO is what do you intend to show? Should we be expecting a dose response? And then separately on Enbrel, was curious what the net price trend was in the first quarter year-over-year adjusting for the accounting treatment? Thank you.","David Meline","Okay. I think there were several questions, Umer.","David Reese","In relation to KRAS, again the clinical data will present, so I won't comment on the specifics of dose response. I will say that, this is an irreversible inhibitor. And our anticipation is that achieving adequate exposure for a period of time, probably a few hours over the course of a dosing interval a day is adequate to poison the target and inhibit signaling and so our dose escalation was planned with that goal in mind and will present complete details in about a month at ASCO.","Murdo Gordon","And Umer, on your question regarding Enbrel, we did have a strong quarter on Enbrel. It was primarily driven by a strong market across rheumatology, and we did see some net price benefit based on that price increase as well as improved contracts in the New Year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","Two if I may. First, if you can break for us the relative sales of Kanjinti and Amgevita, just trying to keep track on those molecules individually. And secondly, Aimovig, Murdo, you mentioned that you\u2019re expecting the net price stabilization of this molecule and I was kind of wondering about this comment. It seems like the payers have not really selected their preferred agency out there, even as I just added, so I was wondering if there wouldn't be another step down in pricing expected when they choose to prefer agents and then with orals coming about a year out, wouldn\u2019t that cause another step down at pricing at that point, so I'm just -- can you put this comment in context?","Murdo Gordon","Thanks, Ronny. We're not breaking the biosimilar sales by brand yet. Still a volatile market, but we are happy with both trends on both products going forward. We're also, as you look at Aimovig, my comment, if you recall, has two components to it. One is the net price reduction based on additional contracts that could occur throughout the course of the year, plus a rising percentage of prescriptions that are paid and the two offsetting one another, leading to a stable price, at least for this year. And I think that that would be my clarification to your question.","Arvind Sood","Let\u2019s take one last question and afterwards Bob will make some closing comments.","Operator","And our last question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities.","Salim Syed","I guess one for me, a multipart one on Repatha, on the new CVOT trial. I guess maybe if you could just give us some color on what the genesis of the designer of that trial was, given it seems to mimic medicines companies almost like line for line. And should we be thinking of that as a validation of value proposition in the marketplace as we think about long term Repatha sales? ","David Meline","I'll be happy to address that question. Yeah. I mean, that's, we design that study, from a technical perspective, just the way we design any study, based on expected magnitude of effect, target population, all of the typical statistical calculations that go in clinical perspectives that go into study design, we weren't using anyone else\u2019s trials, a template for that study, and I wouldn't call it validation of anything but the internally consistent results from that trial alone.","Arvind Sood","Bob, would you like to make some closing comments?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you. Well, in closing, we're off to a good start in 2019. And I hope you share our team's enthusiasm for our long term prospects. We have a number of medicines that are in line portfolio that can and we expect will benefit significantly more patients as we grow longer term. We have an emerging portfolio of branded biosimilars, which we talked about, and we think will be a new source of growth for us. We're advancing a record number of potential new medicines in our pipeline targeted at some of the most prevalent costly and serious diseases facing society today. Our financial strength I think, is evident again, this quarter and our durable cash flows will allow us to continue to invest in the business, but also provide meaningful returns for our shareholders and deliver transformational innovation for patients. Most importantly, I want to just end by thanking our staff who are fully engaged and behind our mission and thank them for the work they did to get us off to a solid start in 2019. We look forward to talking to all of you at the ASCO investor meeting and then at the second quarter call in July. Thank you.","Arvind Sood","Right. Thanks, everybody. If you have any follow-on questions, if we didn't get to your question or if you have comments you would like to discuss, feel free to reach out to me or other members of my team.

I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the third quarter. Based on our strong results in Q3, I think you\u2019ll agree that our business is performing well and we are on target to deliver against our long-term objectives and commitments.

This is an exciting time at Amgen, and once again this quarter, seems we have a healthy dose of information to share with you. So perhaps before jumping in, I should provide some context.","I recall that we met with analysts and investors one year ago in New York to layout our long-term strategy for growth and our objectives for the next few years. Since then I\u2019m pleased to report, we made steady progress towards achieving all of those objectives as you\u2019ll hear on this call.","Our strategy for long-term growth starts with innovation. We set, as an objective that we would launch six new products this year, and with the approval this week of IMLYGIC, a drug for melanoma, we\u2019re now delivering on the promise of those six opportunities. And of course, we believe that two of these new products, Repatha, for cardiovascular disease and Kyprolis, for multiple myeloma represent particularly significant opportunities for patients and shareholders.","Sticking with innovation, I\u2019d like to point out that behind our six new launches, our innovative pipeline continues to advance with rapid Phase 3 progress in our migraine program, strong new data for romosozumab and a successful Phase 3 program for etelcalcetide in kidney disease.","In addition, as we reported earlier this week our innovative heart failure program omecamtiv mecarbil delivered promising results in Phase 2b testing, open with prospect of another exciting opportunities for us in the field of cardiovascular disease.","Similarly our biosimilar pipeline has advanced considerably over the past year with positive Phase 3 data for two of our nine programs, specifically our humira and avastin biosimilars. And Sean will provide more details on all this progress shortly.","In addition to delivering on the promise of innovation with our newly launched products, we\u2019re also delivering strong financial performance across the Board and making steady progress against our longer term financial growth and performance objectives. You can see this in our third quarter results today and in our year-to-date performance.","During the quarter, we delivered 14% revenue growth and 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. Our key revenue growth drivers Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar and Nplate all performed well in the period as Tony will convey in his remarks.","Adjusted earnings per share grew faster than revenues reflecting improved expense discipline in operating leverage, even as we invested in our new product launch cycle. On a year-to-date basis, revenues were up 9% and adjusted earnings per share are up 19%. Consistent with our long-term financial objectives, our operating performance continues to improve as the benefits of our transformation are reflected across our business.","Our 49% adjusted operating margin through the first nine months of the year reflects meaningful progress, against our longer term operating margin targets. Based on our ongoing strong performance, we\u2019re once again raising, our 2015 guidance as David will explain shortly.","With respect to capital allocation, adhere to our actions are solidly in line with our commitments. Consistent with our results to return an average of 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018, with a growing dividend and share buybacks, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend to $1 per share for 2016, an increase of 27%.","This comes on the back of a 30% increase for 2015. Also reflecting on our confidence and the outlook for our business, we recently increased our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. As we look towards 2016, we are focused on delivering continued strong performance, while advancing our new flow of products.","Obviously we expect to face increased competition for our legacy products, but we have anticipated these changes and put ourselves in position to defend our legacy products while growing our newer franchises. Given the many variable supply in our business, and to help you in your planning for providing preliminary guidance for 2016, which will update when we report our full year result at the end of January 2016.","Finally, let me remind you, that last October we laid out our financial objectives through 2018. A year later we feel confident, we are on track to meet or exceed these objectives. These include $1.5 billion in savings from our transformation, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth on average through 2018, and adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% in 2013 to \u2013 in the range of 52% to 54% by 2018.","Before turning over to David, I\u2019d like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and shareholders as we launch new products, expand internationally and continue from a position of strength, to transform our company for a great future. David?","David Meline","Okay, thanks Bob. Turning to the third quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 14% year-over-year, with 14% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues increased $24 million year-over-year due primarily to a milestone received for the filing of kyprolis in Japan. Total revenue in product sales were negatively impacted by approximately two percentage points year-over-year due to foreign exchange headwinds.","Adjusted operated income at $2.7 billion grew 19% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved two points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation program along with significant investment in our launch activities.","On the adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 13.5% improved by 2.2 points driven by net selling prices, lower royalties and manufacturing efficiencies. Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were up 11% versus the prior year. This increase was driven by up from payments from deal activity in the quarter, and increased investments in support of new product launches. This increase was partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.","SG&A expenses were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, driven by commercial investments in new product launches and ENBREL-related payments partially offset by savings from transformation process improvement efforts. Total operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and increased 8% sequentially. For the quarter operating expenses benefited by approximately three percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year.","We saw an increase of spending in Q3 versus the prior quarter, this reflect the typical pattern from the business, plus our launch investments this year. Other income and expenses declined by $18 million or 14% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $147 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter, a 0.9 point increase versus Q3 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 18% on a year-over-year basis.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the third quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher operating income. Total debt outstanding ended Q3 of $31.8 billion, and cash and investments totaled $31.1 million. Additionally our third quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year. In the third quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $700 million of cash deployed to share repurchases, or approximately 4.6 million shares in the period.","Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model, including delivering over $400 million of efficiency savings from the transformation, which is being reinvested this year in the business to fund our significant new product launches.","With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are increasing our guidance to $21.4 billion to $21.6 billion from our prior range of $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion reflecting solid revenue performance. Reported growth will moderate as we complete the year, reflecting the expected normalization of relatively high customer inventories as well as the affects of competition on our legacy products.","We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.95 to $10.10 per share from the previous $9.55 to $9.80 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects our strong year-to-date performance including revenue growth and lower expenses due to cost discipline.","For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase by around $0.2 billion sequentially, reflecting normal spending patterns as well as continued launch investments. In terms of the adjusted tax rate, our guidance range of 18% to 19% is unchanged, and is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted tax rate of 18.4%. As a reminder this guidance continues to exclude the possible benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015.","We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, inline with our previous guidance. As we approach the end of 2015, we are pleased with our progress again this year. We expect to meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period including double-digit adjusted EPS growth on average, $1.5 billion of transformation savings, improving our adjusted operating margin from 38% to 52% to 54%, and returning at least 60% of adjusted net income on average to shareholders.","Turning to Page 8, 2016 will be an important year as we continue progress towards our long-term goals. Given the number of moving pieces including new product launches, currency movements and U.S. biosimilar competition, as well as the continued evolution of our transformation program, we want to provide a preliminary planning framework for 2016. As you\u2019ll note, the framework is generally in line with expectations, while individual components may differ.","In 2016, revenues expected to range from $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $10.35 to $10.75 for per share. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to range from 20.5% to 21.5%, and capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million. I want to take a moment to highlight several key assumptions embedded in our outlook for next year.","First, our revenue guidance range for 2016 includes continued momentum from our growth plans as well as the meaningful contribution from our product launches. We also assume our legacy products face new biosimilar competition in the U.S., which Tony will address in more detail. Next we expect an approximate one percentage point unfavorable impact to revenue and adjusted EPS growth were $0.12 per share due to foreign exchange headwinds in 2016 versus 2015.","Assuming that current foreign exchange rates prevail through the end of 2016. This represents an approximate four percentage point negative impact on our international sales. In terms of our transformation program, we expect continued progress in 2016 with an additional $400 million of savings. These savings will be partially reinvested in the business, and will also help drive a year-over-year reduction in total adjusted operating expenses.","Finally our 2016 adjusted tax rate guidance reflects an increase versus 2015, and excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit. This increase is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings as some of our newer products in Enbrel have a higher tax rates under a legacy products. Also U.S. R&D spend is decreasing due to transformation program savings, which has the negative impact on the tax rate. We now expect the tax rate through 2018 to be in the low 20% range.","Regarding our capital allocation plan for 2016, we have continued to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have deployed a total of $1.9 billion to repurchase shares. With an increased Board of Directors authorization to $5 billion in total, we expect to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares by the end of 2016.","On a cumulative basis our repurchases will total $4 billion to $5 billion of shares by the end of 2016, since a year ago. We also plan to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting another 27% increase from current levels. With these actions, we are solidly on the path to meet our commitment return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders on average for the period 2014 to 2018, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of the business.","In summary, we are pleased with our performance thus far in 2015, and we look forward to delivering results in the remainder of this year as well as in 2016 and beyond.","I will now turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Hooper","Thanks, David, and good afternoon folks. You\u2019ll find a summary of our global sales performance for the third quarter on Slide number 10. This is an exciting quarter for Amgen as we launched Repatha and continued to deliver strong performance with our growth products. Globally, product sales grew 14% year-over-year and our U.S. business delivered 20% year-over-year growth. Our international business grew 3% year-over-year excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, with the 7% unit growth in Europe.","Let me start with an update on Repatha. The European approval of Repatha in July marked the first PCSK9 inhibitor approval in the world. We\u2019re now also approved in the U.S. and Canada. Along with our Japanese partner Astellas, we expect Japanese approval in the first half of next year. We\u2019ve designed Repatha\u2019s clinical program to demonstrate, it is simple, single dose achieving maximal PCSK9 inhibition, provides intensive and predictable cholesterol-lowering. This profile is resonating well with physicians.","In the U.S. the launch is off to a good start, we built our salesforce with experienced cardiovascular professionals and we established our presence in the field with our polymer launch in the first quarter this year. Upon approval, our field force was trained and quickly in the fields meeting with our prioritized Repatha customer targets.","Anticipating a period of negotiation for payers post approval we launched the Repatha Ready program. This program provides Repatha to appropriate patients if they wish during the insurance verification process, while plans finalize [indiscernible] and fulfillment pathways. The response to our launch is extremely encouraging, as the volume we request to-date is a clear indicator of the unmet need and physician belief in the benefits of Repatha. With the recent formulary decision, Express Scripts recognized the value of Repatha and we continue to negotiate with other payers to expand access in the United States.","However, we expect payers utilization management Criteria or UM to remain fairly narrow pending the outcomes data. In the European Union, we continue to negotiate reimbursement with individual countries. We already have patients on Repatha in Germany, in the UK and some Scandinavian countries. The cardiovascular outcomes data and the intravascular ultrasound data in 2016 will continue to expand Repatha\u2019s exciting profile. Repatha also has dosing frequency flexibility, either every two weeks or monthly. And we have submitted our single injection monthly dosing option to regulators.","For the launch of Repatha, our continued progress with Corlanor and the recently announced positive Phase 2 results on omecamtiv mecarbil, we\u2019re building a strong foundation for Amgen's cardiovascular franchise.","Turning now to Kyprolis, where sales grew 46% year-over-year, and 15% sequentially. The new indication for relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma was launched in the U.S. in July. We\u2019re off to a good start, and from our chart audits, have really seen a doubling of the KRB regimen, which is the regimen in ASPIRE in new to treatment second-line patients.","Every month there are about a 1,000 new patients who require second-line treatment. We expect sales to grow as we increase share \u2013 in these new second-line patients and see a corresponding increase in the duration of Kyprolis therapy. We also received priority review for the submission of the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated a doubling of progression-free survival compared to VELCADE treated patients.","We expect this to drive additional momentum next year, and further strengthen Kyprolis as the best-in-class prednisone inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis, outside the U.S. by the year-end including Canada, Europe, parts of South America and Asia.","Let me now turn to Enbrel. On Slide 15, you see that Enbrel delivered 30% growth year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Just to clarify, net selling price includes the impact from list price changes as well as contracting and access changes with recurred over the past 12 months. Inventory growth was 11% which was driven by favorable year-over-year comparison, as the inventory levels have normally low in the third quarter 2014.","Segment growth remains strong, in rheumatology and dermatology growing 25% and 38% respectively, year-over-year on a value basis. Quarter-on-quarter, our rheumatology share was relatively stable at about 28% while our share in dermatology declined 2% to 24% due to intensifying competition from new therapies. I would remind you that rheumatology accounts for about 80% of Enbrel sales.","Sensipar grew 29% year-over-year, driven by inventory net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Similar to Enbrel, the inventory growth was driven by unusually low inventory levels in quarter three last year.","I\u2019ll now move to Prolia. Prolia followed its normal seasonal pattern for the sequential decline in quarter three, but on a year-over-year basis delivered 25% growth, with unit growth exceeding 20% both the U.S. and Europe. Growth was driven by continued share gains of about three percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe.","XGEVA grew 19% year-over-year. Unit share increased about four percentage points over the last year in the U.S. and about 5% points in Europe. There were, however, some abnormally large purchases by some end customers in the U.S. this quarter, adding to the volume growth. We continue to focus on XGEVA\u2019s superior clinical profile versus the competition.","Vectibix is showing flat volume, this is solely due to the timing of shipments to our Japanese partner, Takeda, who hold the license in Japan. The U.S. delivered year-over-year growth of 16% and Europe 12%, both driven by the expansion of Vectibix into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. Nplate continued to deliver solid growth of 15% year-over-year driven by 17% unit growth.","Now I\u2019ll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 6%, driven by net selling price and the inventory. Similar to XGEVA, we saw signs of abnormally high purchases by some larger end customers in quarter three, which we would expect to burn off in quarter four. Meanwhile, the on-body injector for Neulasta, which we\u2019ve now branded as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit continues to gain adoption in the marketplace. Over 60% of our Neulasta accounts have now purchased the Onpro at least once. And Onpro achieved 19% share of Neulasta units in quarter three.","NEUPOGEN declined 5% year-over-year, driven by branded short-acting competition in the U.S. Sequentially quarter-over-quarter, we held share against branded competition and saw minimal impact from the new biosimilar competition, given its launch late in the quarter. Using our seven years of biosimilar defense experience in Europe, we will be competitive in the marketplace, but expect share erosion in the near-term due to the new competition.","Turning to our ESA products, EPOGEN declined 6% year-over-year, including a 15% unit decline as dynamics continued to evolve in the U.S. dialysis centers. That\u2019s 15% unit decline would have been deeper if not for abnormally high purchases by a large end customer in quarter three. Fresenius has now moved more than half its patients from EPOGEN to Mircera, and we expect the trend to continue.","Please recall that we have a contract with DaVita through 2018 in which they will purchase at least 90% of their ESAs from Amgen. We are also seeing strong Aranesp adoption with medium size and independent dialysis centers. Of the other 400,000 dialysis patients in the U.S., about 50,000 patients have now transitioned to Aranesp, including about 20,000 in Fresenius. EPOGEN sales in future quarters will be impacted by utilization at Fresenius, potential switching to Aranesp, and potential biosimilar competition.","Aranesp sales increased 4% year-over-year with a 32% growth in the U.S. driven by the shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I was just talking about. International sales will be impacted by foreign exchange rates. While we continue to see a decline in oncology ESA use, we are pleased with the response to Aranesp in the U.S. dialysis business. We are making good progress with our launch of BLINCYTO. BLINCYTO [indiscernible] taken in the most severe ALL patients, and as the ALL patients cycle through different therapies we will continue to grow patient penetration.","In summary, quarter three was an exciting quarter. Our Repatha and Kyprolis launches began in earnest and we delivered strong results for our growth products and continued to defend our mature products in the marketplace. Please keep in mind the additional inventory in the third quarter for Neulasta, EPOGEN, and XGEVA, as some of our larger end customers exceeded about $100 million, and we expect this to reverse in quarter four.","Looking ahead to 2016, our growth products including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate are continued to \u2013 are expected to continue to deliver solid growth as sales for these products have grown in double-digits this year, and in some cases in excess of 20% on a base of over $9 billion. We are also building momentum with our launch products including Repatha and Kyprolis, and we expect they will deliver more meaningfully to the top line in 2016. We will defend against increase in competition to our mature franchises with an assumption of no additional biosimilar competition before the second half of 2016. Before I close I'd like to thank our teams across the world who continue to work tirelessly, ensuring access for patients to our innovative drugs.","Let me now pass you to Sean.","Sean Harper","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. Amgen's R&D efforts are rolling along nicely with six major regulatory approvals of innovative products for serious diseases over the last year. This is the core of what we do, invest in true innovation in order to change the practice of medicine.","Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cardiovascular programs. We recently submitted a supplemental BLA to offer patients a single dose option for the 420 milligram monthly dose of Repatha, utilizing an automated device as part of our previously announced collaboration with West Pharmaceutical Services. And the FDA has communicated a July 2016 PDUFA date.","As we previously announced, based on our current modeling of our event driven cardiovascular outcome study, we anticipate the number of events required for final analysis to accrue by about the middle of 2016. With the top line data expected to follow in the second half of the year.","We also anticipate the results of our coronary artery intravascular ultrasound study in the second half of 2016. We believe that demonstrating a disease modifying effect on arthroscopic plaque burden would be a compelling result, complementary to our outcomes data.","In addition, we were very pleased at our Phase 2 oral dosing study of AMG423 or omecamtiv mecarbil, a myosin activator we are developing with cytokinetics in the setting of chronic heart failure met all of its objectives. We've already begun reviewing these data with our partners, key opinion leaders and soon with regulators, to better understand the potential role of omecamtiv in the treatment of chronic heart failure patients. Regarding our CETP inhibitor, we have flexibility to gain our R&D investment going forward after a careful review of Lilly CETP outcomes data when they become available.","Turning to oncology. Following on the U.S. label expansion, Kyprolis has received a positive opinion by the EU CHMP for the ASPIRE submission, and we will submit the ENDEAVOR file once the ASPIRE approval occurs. In the U.S., the ENDEAVOR file is under priority review, with an action date in January of 2016. Finally our Phase 3 study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting is actively enrolling.","Turning to immuno-oncology in the realm of biospecific T-cell engagers, we\u2019ve received a positive opinion in the EU from the CHMP for BLINCYTO, in the setting of Philadelphia negative relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our next molecule based on the BiTE platform AMG 330, directed at CD33, has entered testing in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, an area of profound unmet medical need. The treatment paradigm for this disease, which is approximately four times as common as adult ALL, has not changed meaningfully in 20 years and the prognosis for these patients remains bleak.","Finally, we\u2019re excited to have licensed in Xencor by specific antibody platform for six targets, including particularly an anti CD38 T-cell engaging molecule in the preclinical stage, given our focus in multiple myeloma. As we announced yesterday, the FDA approved IMLYGIC for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery. Despite the concept being around for more than a century, IMLYGIC is the first oncolytic viral therapy to be approved, and represents an important new treatment option for melanoma patients.","IMLYGIC also received a CHMP positive opinion for the treatment of adults with unresectable metastatic melanoma in the EU. While this initial indication is for a relatively small population of melanoma patients, we believe the real promise of IMLYGIC is in the combination with other immunotherapies. So we continue to advance the combination studies with the anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 antibodies that we\u2019ve previously announced.","The safety data from the Phase 1b portion of the IMLYGIC keytruda combination melanoma study appeared quite favorable, and were recently presented at the European Cancer Congress. We look forward to seeing the efficacy data from this study and continue to explore other possible combinations.","Leaving oncology, we\u2019ve completed our U.S. and EU submissions for our novel intravenous calcimimetic etelcalcetide or AMG416, in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Turning to our bone franchise we\u2019ve recently seen two data sets for Romosozumab, our anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody, in development with UCB for postmenopausal osteoporosis.","First we observed superiority to teriparatide in an open label Phase 3 study as the level of bone mineral density in patients heavily pretreated with these false names. Second at the American Society of Bone and Mineral research, we presented data from an exploratory sub-study of a Phase 2 trial, demonstrating superior calculated bone strength versus teriparatide in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. And of course we look forward to seeing the first of our two fracture outcome studies in the first half of next year. Recall, this is a two year study with patients receiving either romosozumab or placebo treatment in year one, followed by Prolia treatment in year two.","Our most migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG334, is actively enrolling two Phase 3 episodic migraine studies. The enrollment rate suggests to me a very strong clinical need for an effective, well tolerated migraine prophylactic agent. Our Phase 2b study in the chronic migraine setting is enrolling nicely as well, and we'll see those data next year.","Behind AMG334 in our migraine pipeline, our anti-PAC 1 receptor antibody, AMG301, is progressing through Phase 1. We\u2019re pleased about our partnership of this emerging franchise with Novartis. Of course the other exciting aspect of our collaboration with Novartis is the base program for Alzheimer's disease. It was scientist at Amgen who first cloned the base gene and decode has provided compelling genetic validation of this target. Here, we're taking a differentiated approach based on the concept that it may prove difficult to demonstrate a convincing disease modifying effective base inhibition, when intervening in patients who have clinically detectable cognitive impairment. By studying cognitively normal patients, genetically predisposed to late onset Alzheimer's by virtue of their APOE4 genotype, essentially intervening earlier in the disease course, we may be able to more effectively demonstrate the disease modifying effect.","This study is being conducted with the Banner Institute which has identified a large number of these patients and this coupled with our human genetics platform, provides a unique opportunity to pursue this novel approach.","Finally, our biosimilar programs continue to advance. The team is preparing for submissions from our biosimilar humira by year-end, and our biosimilar avastin in Phase 3 study in non-small cell lung cancer successfully completed. Our biosimilar assessment study in breast cancer recently completed enrollment and we expect to see the data sometime in the second half of next year.","In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the Amgen R&D team, for their dedication to patients during this remarkably busy and exciting time. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay, thanks. As Sean said this is an exciting time and a lot going on at the Company, so let's open it up for questions now. If we can ask our Operator to remind everybody of the procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.","Matt Roden","Great, thanks very much for taking the questions. Congrats on a very nice quarter. I guess David, when I\u2019m looking at your new preliminary 2016 guidance we\u2019re seeing, it falls just a touch below consensus. Just wanted to get your sense for whether or not we should be looking at the revenue side or the margin side or tax side, what is it that you think the street is missing, and if it is the revenues is it related to biosimilar competition, or lower than the street expectations on PCSK9? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where you think we\u2019re off?","David Meline","I\u2019d say the one place that kind of jumps out is if you look at the tax rate which is up year-over-year, more than actually we previously indicated the rate would go to, is probably the biggest area where we see some differences, which is frankly part of the reason why I thought it would be helpful to give you a preliminary view of what we think is going on in 2016. I think the good news in that regard is while we\u2019re generally in line with consensus overall it would imply I think that we\u2019ve got somewhat better operating performance we see for the business next year than perhaps the analysts have in their models right now.","Bob Bradway","David do you want to reiterate your R&D tax credit point as well, just to make sure that Matt and others would\u2026","David Meline","Yes, so the rate that we\u2019ve got out there for next year as is the case with this year, again we\u2019ve chosen to exclude the R&D tax rate from the calculate \u2013 the R&D tax credit because of the ongoing uncertainty of that eventually being passed and impacting unfavorably on the rate.","Bob Bradway","Okay, go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on all the progress. Maybe just two quick ones for me. First on the Repatha launch, can you give us the sales number for the quarter? And then any comments on the breadth of prescribing you\u2019re seeing and types of patients? And then on the pipeline, Sean, you mentioned omecamtiv, what are the key outstanding questions there and just timing of next steps for that program, thank you?","Bob Bradway","Hi, Tony.","Tony Hooper","Terence, it\u2019s Tony. So let me respond. I mean, obviously we launched in September, so it was not much of a quarter, so I think you\u2019ll probably see a better reflection of sales in the fourth quarter and once we finish all our negotiations. The utilization criteria the payers are putting to place are pretty much in line with the label at the moment, so high-risk patients with diagnosed after a disease who have LDL above 130, that's where we see the patients.","Bob Bradway","Tony, you want to talk about the European piece of the launch as well?","Tony Hooper","Sure. So we have launch in Europe as we know, and we do have patients at the moment in the UK, some Scandinavian countries and Germany.","David Meline","Great, and with respect to omecamtiv mecarbil, what I would say is that we're in the usual stage of having just seen these data. We have partners to review the data with we're working with really the top key experts in heart failure from around the world and have been for years on the program. So we have to review the data with them and of course talk with the regulators through the usual and the Phase 2 sort of meetings before we can reach a formal decision about whether to proceed and in what exactly format, in terms of study designs and that sort of thing. So it's all the usual steps that we have to go through for a very significant decision to advance into \u2013 outcomes trial in a setting like congestive heart failure, but we are very pleased with the data that we generated from the study.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. I wanted to ask a little bit more in the guidance. I guess just broadly speaking can you be more clear on what actually spurred you to talk about 2016 already? And in terms of the biosimilar assumptions there, is it safe to say to be more specific you don't expect a GCSF \u2013 excuse me a long acting GCSF any time before at least second half of 2016? And with that, do you therefore expect to assume a high penetration of the on-body device and where do you think that can go to in terms of penetration, thanks?","Bob Bradway","Michael in terms of why we decided to provide a preliminary framework today, it\u2019s really as we looked at it, as we look into 2016, what we observe is there\u2019s a lot of dynamics going on. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a number of new products that we see launching as you know, we are now approved for the sixth one as we had hoped. So what's going on with that, what's going on with the competitive environment in terms of our legacy portfolio, obviously foreign exchange and then our own efforts to improve the competitiveness of the business.","So my feeling was that it would be useful to you guys in that at the end of October, you're starting to look more specifically at 2016, so I thought it would be useful to provide that initial indication today. And as I said earlier, the sort of the expectations are generally in line with what we said today, but there\u2019s some differences. So we just thought it would be helpful to you guys to get something out there. So maybe Tony wants to comment on the other piece?","Tony Hooper","Sure, I mean, let me then just add that, as we look at the assumptions in place by 2016 numbers, we don\u2019t assume any new additional biosimilars until the second half of 2016. As regard to the on-body Injector for Neulasta, we continue to be very excited about the launch and the uptick in the marketplace. As I said, just over 60% of our customers or accounts that have actually purchased at least once, and the average market share was about 19% in the third quarter and that market share keeps growing.","Bob Bradway","Brian, let\u2019s take the next question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt","As well, maybe for Tony or even Bob. Just kind of curious on the U.S. pricing environment, whether you think there\u2019s been any real or perceived changes in that outlook?","Tony Hooper","Eric, obviously that\u2019s a topical question. I guess the important thing from our perspective is to reflect on what our business model is, which is to develop innovative medicines directed against serious diseases, and we tried advance medicines that have a big effect for patients and with that, big effects for society. So if you look at the six medicines we\u2019re launching, that\u2019s exactly what the medicines represent, and you know we think medicines that have a big effect size for patients, medicines that create value.","And so we anticipated this moment and the development work that we\u2019ve been doing, anticipated it in our strategy, and then the molecules that we\u2019ve chosen to advance. So again, this doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to us, that there are questions about the value of the medicines and the price and we think the more we can do to help focus on the economic burden of diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, neuro-degenerative diseases and the significant prospect or opportunity that our medicines represent against those, the more appropriate framing for the discussion.","So I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything particularly precipitous changing for those of us that are at the innovative biopharmaceutical and other than the fact that we\u2019re incredibly exciting window of time here with lots of important new innovative medicines against, again some of the vaccine, tough diseases that we all face.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Ashoka","Hi, this is Vikram on for Matthew. So just two quick questions from our side. So, first could you talk about the sustainability of price increases that you saw with Enbrel and EPOGEN, especially with EPOGEN if you could touch on the share losses to Fresenius, that would be helpful. And then secondly, you touched on this a little earlier during the call, but if you could quantify the impact of end-user purchasing patterns on Neulasta, that would also be very helpful.","Bob Bradway","I think there are three questions there. So Tony do you want to try and tackle the EPOGEN?","Tony Hooper","So, just to Bob\u2019s point again, right? So the price increases we take in the marketplace are based on the value of our products bring to market and the competitive environment in which they operate. In the EPOGEN situation, Fresenius, it represents about one-third of the marketplace in the U.S. and they are in the process of converting a large amount of their business to Masera. I think they will be probably be announcing within the next couple days, how much of their business they have converted. And I didn't get the question on Neulasta, sorry.","Bob Bradway","Repeat the third question you had there?","Vikram Ashoka","End-user purchasing patterns on Neulasta?","Tony Hooper","So what was the question about end-user?","Vikram Ashoka","Just how much end-user inventory?","Tony Hooper","Okay, so, net-net as I said the end-user purchases for Neulasta, Xgeva and EPOGEN were just in excess of $100 million in the third quarter, and we expect that to burn off in the fourth quarter.","Vikram Ashoka","All right.","Bob Bradway","Okay, Brian, let\u2019s take the next one.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a great headline print. I had a couple questions. Number one, for Fresenius has taken much more share as has been mentioned in other questions. I'm wondering why. Is it simply that you will not match price? Because I think last quarter, you mentioned something about how, and when do such contract negotiations happen? And so it sounds like you're sort of guiding us to give up on Fresenius and I want to know is that because the Masera is offering a price that Amgen just doesn't think is economical to match?","My second question was on biosimilar humira, is it still your expectation Bob that you're going to launch in 2017? Because Rick Gonzalez, AbbVie, your counterpart, absolutely insists like table pounding, heavy breathing, that there's no way that's going to happen before like 2019 or so. So I'd just like to get your updated thoughts on that? And finally can you give us any indication whatsoever, any, about what our expectations should be for gross to net discounting for the PCSK9 class, either right now early days or more steady state level. Because that's what we need obviously in our models, thank you.","Bob Bradway","Okay, let\u2019s see whether we can tackle those. I think there was three questions there Tony. The first one was about, presenting a similar respond to Mark\u2019s question?","Tony Hooper","So we have no idea what the agreement is between Fresenius and Roche who is supplies Masera to them. And our pricing decisions, I\u2019ll tell you might not just on our contract with Fresenius but the overall dialysis market in the U.S. And so we are balancing existing customers and customers who were possibly changing their portfolio.","Bob Bradway","And gross to net Tony you want to?","Tony Hooper","On gross to net we don\u2019t make public any of the contract negotiations we have with the payers.","Bob Bradway","Obviously, we\u2019re \u2013 the negotiations continue to be underway here in the U.S. and internationally. And with respect to Humira, Mark, we are excited about confidence in the clinical data that we have and as you would expect we\u2019re preparing to file those data with regulators. We recognize that there is intellectual property here that needs to be respected but we will continue to advance our molecule and continue to assess the intellectual property that\u2019s in place. And if we have a dispute, well the good news is, there\u2019s a process for resolving that dispute and we will push forward on that basis.","Arvind Sood","Okay Brian, we will take the next one.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good afternoon guys, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow-up on the 2016 guidance questions and ask if you can at least qualitatively speak to your comfort level with the Street\u2019s Repatha expectations for next year. And then also on PCSK9 front, should we expect the deal with Express Scripts to set a precedent for comparable agreements with other payors going forward? Thanks a lot.","Bad Bradway","Again two questions here, Cory with respect to guidance for 2016 we\u2019re not giving individual product line revenue guidance. Again I think David addressed pretty comprehensively what our thinking was in general about the P&L for 2016 and we hope that it\u2019s up to have it at this stage in the game. And with respect to what to expect from other payers again Tony you care to comment on that?","Tony Hooper","We were delighted that Express Scripts left the option of which drug to use to physicians and patients and we continue to believe that\u2019s the best place to be in the marketplace. That\u2019s our position as we go out to market but we are in the middle of negotiations so we don\u2019t know where we are going to land.","Cory Kasimov","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America.","Ying Huang","Thank you for taking my questions as well. Specifically I have one for Enbrel. When you provide 2015 guidance, what\u2019s your assumption for the pricing trend? I know you can\u2019t spell out the details, but can we expect somewhat similar level of pricing for 2016? And then on E12 in the market for dialysis, obviously we know what happened with Fresenius, but what\u2019s your expectation for the other one-third independent dialysis centers of the market. And then I guess lastly, given the recent biotech, I guess correction in the market, what\u2019s your thought of M&A in terms of being opportunistic here? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Well, let me answer the question around the independent and the dialysis units. Right now they receive the supply from us. We are delighted to see the level of switching that\u2019s taking place from EPOGEN to Aranesp amongst both the independence of both the medium and small dialysis centers. So we\u2019ll continue to work with them as we go forward.","On Enbrel, the net price always depends on a combination of price increases on list versus large amounts of contracting. Enbrel competes at a highly competitive environment, where payers make decisions around where products are on their more reason in terms of a preferred tier and non-preferred tier based on the rebates. And when you\u2019re on a preferred tier you pay rebate, if you aren\u2019t a preferred tier you don\u2019t pay the rebate. So it\u2019s a huge amount of dramatic changes inside hundreds of additional plans.","Tony Hooper","Okay. And then on the M&A question, Ying. As we said a year ago, that we would focus on early stage transactions and if you look at the activity that we engaged in over the past 12 months, you can see we brought in a lot of earlier stage innovative new products and technology opportunities. And we said more recently that we\u2019re opening the aperture a little bit, beginning to look at our broader range of things including potentially some larger things.","We think obviously that the valuations in the sector are probably more favorable now for the later stage assets than they were a year ago. And so, we\u2019re continuing to look and I think it may be some time, however, before the owners of those late stage assets adjust their pricing expectations to reflect the current trading environment. But we\u2019re continuing to look for nothing to report on the call.","Bob Bradway","Brian\u2026","Operator","And our next question\u2026","Bob Bradway","Yes, go ahead.","Operator","Yes. And our next question comes from Eun Yang from Jefferies.","Eun Yang","Thanks for the question. A question on Kyprolis. I understand that the Kyprolis has a greater path of improvement versus elotuzumab, but some physicians comment that the mix of different degrees overlaps the patient population, makes it difficult to compare across the study data. Now with elotuzumab entering the market already next year, can you share with us, what you are hearing as to how physicians who would utilize Kyprolis versus elotuzumab in the relapsed setting?","Sean Harper","Yes, I think, it is I think just very early days in my view to assess that and I think there\u2019s some in general the theme that I continue to hear when I talk to experts in this area is the concept that they don\u2019t view molecules like blinatumomab as things that are likely to displace a proteasome inhibitor from the backbone therapy in multiple myeloma, but rather looking at them as adjunct therapies, so our strategy is to be the preferred best-in-class proteasome inhibitor and to have adequate combination data of course with a lot of these new molecules as they come along to make sure that we are part of the best-in-class regimens for the disease.","Bob Bradway","And I think just to add to that Sean I think what we demonstrated in the ASPIRE study was unprecedented in terms of PFS in the second line relapse setting and the data that was presented elotuzumab is so-called eloquent study again difficult to make cross trial comparisons but is certainly was not comparable to what we saw.","David Meline","No, it certainly not. I think the question presumed that you can\u2019t make the comparison as well across the studies and of course we all recognized there are limitations to making study \u2013 cross study comparison.","Tony Hooper","Just to remind everyone that the product not approved in the U.S. yet so I think we should wait until the FDA makes a decision and we can see a label.","Bob Bradway","Okay, let\u2019s go to the next question?","David Meline","Well, take the next one.","Operator","Yes. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays Capital.","Geoff Meacham","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. One, Repatha, obviously the tipping point in utilization is going to come from the outcomes data but that speaks I think to the sickest patients getting access today. And so I know it's early, but any common features so far in new starts beyond LDL, things like prior statin experience or cardiac events and then would you expect this to differ in the EU looking out say 6 to 12 months? Thanks.","David Meline","Okay, Geoff thanks for the question. Tony why don\u2019t you\u2026","Tony Hooper","So Geoff, let me just reiterate I mean having long \u2013 a number of cardiovascular drugs in my life this one feels pretty good. I mean the level of discussion we\u2019re getting among cardiologists and high prescribing primary care physicians is more than what I would have expected. They really understand the value of lowering LDL and understand what the statins have delivered in terms of the outcomes data, so in my mind, the understanding is there, the demand is there, and the need is there.","The slow march we are taking with payers in the U.S. of course is reducing the opportunity for patients to get access to these drugs early, with the likelihood of Express Scripts having made this decision and we work actively with the other guys to get product up and running. The utilization criteria at the moment they\u2019ve set in places is fairly tight to insure that patients step through a number of situations, but I continue to believe that what we are seeing in terms of patients being referred to the hub for insurance verification, I feel pretty confident about that. In Europe, of course the label is slightly broader but we do take longer to negotiate with the various countries country by country in Europe.","Bob Bradway","Okay, Brian, as we are at the top of the hour why don't we take two more questions?","Operator","Okay, let\u2019s see. And we do have a question from the line of Brian Skorney from Baird.","Colleen Hanley","Hi, this is Colleen on the line for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. I know we're still early in the launch but can you comment on how many patients have started on Repatha? And can you also comment on the regulatory pathway for oral LDL lowering drugs like CTEP inhibitors or other mechanism for statin lowering and the need for cardiovascular outcome studies versus the more accelerated paths you're able to take with Repatha? Thank you.","Tony Hooper","This is Tony. The IMS data has not been very clear in terms of actual prescriptions up until about a week or two ago, so I would imagine the data the terms are coming now is accurately representing the number of patients receiving a prescription from a pharmacy. This of course doesn't take into account the patients that are moving through the hubs either run by ourselves or by our competitors, assisting patients during the verification process, as plans go through their formulary and guideline of pathway process to decide how and when to allow the usage of these PCSK9s.","Bob Bradway","With respect to the regulatory environment for other mechanisms such as CTEP inhibition, I think what I would say we're going to observe is what we saw with the PCSK9 class, which is regulators really taking into account in their determinations around what evidence base would be necessary to gain market access, and what kind of population should be included in initial labeling prior to outcome studies, that's going to be predicated very much on mechanism. And I think in the case of PCSK9, there was a certain value placed on the science that underlies that mechanism and the fact that thus far, we\u2019ve not had a situation for example, where the mechanism had been tested and failed in large outcomes trials so it\u2019s going to be a case-by-case determination by regulators based on the mechanism and the evidence base that exists and whether or not there is safety overlay and that sort of thing. So it\u2019s not a simple question to answer. I think but I think that the parameters that will be weighed are fairly clear.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James.","Chris Raymond","Question on Enbrel. So I'm looking at the math on Slide 15 and it seems to make some sense with respect to price making up the difference when you factor in inventory and units, but just want to clarify. Do you see and is it also possible that a quarterly driver could be changes in rebates and discounts? Is that a measurable impact at all quarter-on-quarter, especially this quarter?","Tony Hooper","So normally contracts are for annual period but by definition, any change in a contract will then impact your year-over-year calculations for four quarters in a row, so clearly, there are contract changes that impact the net selling price in quarter three, yes.","Chris Raymond","Okay, thank you.","Bob Bradway","Okay, great. Well, thanks everybody for participating in our call and you know myself and my team will stick around for a while, so if you have any other questions or thoughts feel free to give us a call. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes Amgen\u2019s third quarter and financial results conference call. You may now disconnect."],"2256":["Amgen Inc.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Okay. Thank you, Ian. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for joining us today.","So 2019 was the year and that we made significant progress on our strategy and took steps that position us well for what will surely be a special year in 2020 as we celebrate our 40 anniversary. What better gift to celebrate this important milestone than to get back to revenue growth.","So, our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the discussion today. We are also joined today by our new CFO, Peter Griffith, who will provide a financial update on our results for Q4 and full year 2019 and provide guidance for 2020. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon, will then review our product performance followed by our Head of R&D, Dave Reese, who will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides to guide our discussion today and you should have received the link separately. We will also use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our results, actual results, to differ materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you, Arvind and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our call .","Heading into 2020, we feel ready for the challenges of a new year and we're feeling encouraged by the progress we made in 2019. Once again, this past year, we met and exceeded our financial targets. We advanced key elements of our long-term growth strategy and we serve more patients around the world with our growing portfolio of medicines.","2019 was the transition year, we had long been preparing for as many of our off-patent legacy products faced new competition. I believe we managed this transition well, as evidenced by the fact that we delivered earnings growth in 2019 and will return to top line growth in 2020.","In 2019, drug prices in the U.S. actually fell overall for the first time since 1974. In anticipation of this challenge, we re-positioned the company's expense base and embedded productivity initiatives over the past several years that are serving us well.","In addition, we reshaped our product portfolio committing to medicines that can deliver growth for us primarily through volume increases rather than price increases. Products like Repatha, Aimovig, Prolia, Evenity, and most recently Otezla.","In 2019, we delivered 3% volume growth globally and 19% volume growth outside the United States. We're seeing especially strong performance in our Asia-Pacific region, albeit from a small base. Over the next decade, we expect this region to account for as much as 25% of Amgen's growth.","For the full year in 2019, volume in the region grew 62%. Over two-thirds of that growth came from our joint venture with Astellas in Japan, the world's third-largest pharmaceutical market. Just a reminder that this collaboration reverts fully to Amgen on April 1st, enabling us to do business in Japan, through a wholly-owned subsidiary for the first time.","Our strategic collaboration in China with BeiGene closed a few weeks ago and we're excited by what our two companies can achieve together in the world's second largest pharmaceutical market.","2019 was also a watershed year for us, for our biosimilars business. We've delivered our first several biosimilars to market on time and on budget and we believe we are in the early innings of what can be an important growth opportunity for us over time.","Through the end of Q4, the business was already annualizing at over $1 billion and we will add to our portfolio later this year with the launch of Avsola, our biosimilar to Remicade. We also expect that Amgevita, our biosimilar to Humira in Europe and other parts of the world will benefit from our recent acquisition of Otezla.","A key pillar of our growth strategy continues to be bringing to market first-in-class or best-in-class medicines that deliver a large effect size for patients suffering from serious illnesses. The world is growing older, wealthier, and more urban and these mega trends mean that the world will need more biopharmaceutical innovation, not less. We intend to be a leader and delivering that innovation.","We expect several important data readouts from our pipeline in 2020. We expect data for AMG 510 or KRAS G12C inhibitor for tezepelumab in allergic and non-allergic asthma for omecamtiv and heart failure and look for Otezla in mild-to-moderate psoriasis.","In addition, we'd expect to generate some important data across our BiTE portfolio in 2020 as well and Dave Reese will provide details on all of this shortly.","Last year, we also expanded our commitment to discovery research, strengthening our world-leading human genetics capabilities through a number of collaborations while adding large scale proteomic data as well. We remain excited about how our approach is enabling us to identify and pursue new targets and the patients who stand to benefit most from them.","Everything we see in our company and across the industry continues to make us feel that we're living in an incredible age of biotechnology innovation. Across diseases, we're seeing more and more reason to be optimistic about the next breakthrough for patients. At the same time, we know that governments and individuals who are struggling with how to pay for these breakthroughs.","We accept responsibility to be part of the solution, both in advancing innovation that really matters and in providing innovative ways for patients to get access to it. In an election year, there is bound to be much discussion about health care and we look forward to engaging with other stakeholders to promote market-based solutions that promotes innovative medicines and affordable access to them.","Just as we recognize that we need to be a constructive stakeholder to help sustain the robust ecosystem that exists for biotechnology innovation in the U.S., so to do we recognize and accept the need to be part of the process of addressing other environmental, social, and governance matters that are of concern in our communities today.","To that end, several years ago, we set targets for reducing our carbon emissions and water consumption by the year 2020. Having hit those targets in 2019, a year earlier than planned, we are now developing a next set of goals that we will share later this year. These goals will include a further commitment to our next generation manufacturing technologies, which have a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional biologics manufacturing and enable us to operate at a lower cost too.","Now, let me turn over the call to our new CFO, Peter Griffith. You'll recall that Peter joined us in October, and he will take you through the details of our performance in 2019 and our outlook for 2020. Peter, over to you.","Peter Griffith","Thanks Bob.","Let me begin by saying how happy I am to join Amgen at such an exciting time in the company's 40-year history. I also want to take a moment to thank, David Meline, the Amgen team, as well as many of you on the call who have helped me transition into the role. Over the last several months, I've enjoyed meeting many of our investors as well as members of the analyst community and I look forward to the continued dialog and engagement.","Now, let's turn to the fourth quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck. Revenues at $6.2 billion decreased 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we saw worldwide product sales declined 2% to $5.9 billion as our portfolio transition with declines in our mature products substantially offset by our growth and launch products.","We are particularly encouraged by the strong 21% volume driven growth from our ex-U.S. markets, which gives us confidence as we continue our global expansion including into China, which will also benefit from our collaboration with BeiGene, which closed earlier this month.","Foreign exchange had a 1% negative impact to fourth quarter worldwide sales on a year-over-year basis. Other revenues at $316 million were up $87 million versus Q4 2018.","Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income at $2.6 billion decreased 4% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 44.6% for the quarter, compared to 45.3% in Q4 of 2018. As previously indicated, our operating expenses reflected the typical underlining - underlying fourth quarter pattern, increased investment in our rapidly evolving oncology pipeline portfolio and additional operating expenses associated with the Otezla acquisition, which closed in Q4.","These increases were partially offset by continued favorable expense impacts from our productivity initiatives across all operating expense categories. Other income and expenses were a net $65 million expense in Q4, representing $132 million of year-over-year favorability.","This favorability was driven by gains generated from liquidating bond investments to fund the Otezla and BeiGene transaction and favorable market value fluctuations of publicly traded securities held in our venture's portfolio, partially offset by lower interest income due to reduced cash balances.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.9% for the quarter, a 1.6 point increase versus Q4 2018, primarily due to a one-time prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP net income was $2.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, supported by a 7% reduction in share count versus Q4 2018.","Next, I will review our 2019, full-year results on Page 7 of the presentation. Our 2019, full-year revenues decreased 2% to $23.4 billion, while our non-GAAP earnings per share grew 3% to $14.82 per share. For the full year, we saw a 1% decline in worldwide product sales to $22.2 billion. Volume growth in markets outside the U.S. was 19% year-over-year. Other revenues at $1.2 billion were down $56 million year-over-year.","For the full year, non-GAAP operating income at $11.2 billion decreased 6% from the prior year and our non-GAAP operating margin was 50.2% for the year, down from 52.6% in 2018. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year to $12.2 billion. This growth was driven by Research and Development investments, launch product support, and the addition of Otezla to our business, partially offset by our productivity program.","Other income and expenses were favorable by $250 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to gains in 2019 from liquidating bonds to fund the Otezla and BeiGene transactions, partially offset by lower interest income resulting from reduced cash balances.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 15% for the full year, up 1.5 points versus 2018. Again, primarily due to a one-time prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reforms.","Turning next to cash flow in the balance sheet on Page 8. For the full year 2019, Amgen continued to generate strong cash flow, reflecting a diversified portfolio of products coupled with an industry-leading cost structure. Free cash flow was $8.5 billion in 2019 versus $10.6 billion in 2018. The decline driven by lower net income, timing of working capital, and an advance tax deposit.","In 2019, we returned a total of $11.1 billion to shareholders through dividend payments totaling $3.5 billion and $7.6 billion used to repurchase $40.2 million shares at an average of $190 per share. And this followed the $21.4 billion return of capital to shareholders in 2018.","Cash and investments totaled $8.9 billion at the end of 2019, a decrease of $20.4 billion from the end of 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by the Otezla transaction, cash return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases as well as debt repayment. All partially offset by free cash flow generated during the period. Debt outstanding at year-end totaled $29.9 billion and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% with an average maturity of 12 years.","Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2020 on page 9. 2020 and will be another important year for Amgen, as we continue to invest in the pipeline to generate innovative and differentiated molecules build out the global business and support the growth of our new products.","As previously discussed in anticipation of this opportunity and continued downward pressure on net prices, we developed a productivity capability to enable us to fully invest from a position of strength.","Our 2020 revenue guidance is $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $14.85 per share to $15.60 per share. GAAP earnings per share guidance is $10.85 per share to $11.65 per share, which divergence from non-GAAP EPS, primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our Otezla acquisition.","Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 13.5% to 14.5% and once again, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, including our industry leading environmentally friendly next generation manufacturing facility in Rhode Island.","Let me mention several key assumptions embedded in our guidance. First, our revenue guidance range reflects continued strong worldwide growth from products including Prolia, Evenity, Repatha, Aimovig, Otezla and our biosimilar portfolio. At the same time, we expect increasing competition against our filgrastim and ESA franchises, as well as Sensipar.","Next, with regard to net selling prices, we experienced a 5% decline globally in 2019. For 2020, we expect to again experienced low to middle single digit declines globally. We expect our volume growth to more than offset the net price declines.","Overall, as previously stated, excluding Otezla, we expect our base business to be stable in 2020 on a year-over-year basis. As you model revenue in 2020, note that historically the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year. As a percent of the full year, product sales for the first quarter should look similar to the percentage we saw in Q1 of 2019. Murdo will explain further in his remarks.","With respect to other revenue, we expect about $1.1 billion for the full year 2020, as we anticipate increased competition against our royalty product portfolio. From an operating expense perspective, overall we expect 2020 total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low double-digit percentage range year-over-year on an absolute basis.","As previously communicated, we reiterate the following three assumptions. Non-GAAP R&D investment to increase as we invest in our advancing innovative pipeline programs and new Otezla indications partially offset by R&D recoveries received from our BeiGene collaboration.","Second, non-GAAP SG&A expense to increase due to the acquisition of Otezla as well as modest incremental investment in support of our base business, as we continue to expand globally, including China and Japan. Grow our biosimilars business and begin product launch preparation for our late-stage pipeline.","Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be generally consistent with 2019. We expect all expense categories to continue to benefit from our productivity program. We anticipate non-GAAP other income and expense to be a net expense in a range between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. This is primarily driven by lower interest income as a result of cash used to fund the Otezla and BeiGene transactions as well as our 20.5% share of BeiGene's results based on current publicly available consensus estimates.","I know that our 20.5% share of BeiGene's results will be booked one quarter in arrears in accordance with the equity method of accounting and therefore begins in Q2, 2020. As you know, on April 1, 2020, Amgen will purchase the 49% of shares in Amgen Astellas BioPharma that are held by Astellas for a nominal fee, making the company a wholly-owned Amgen subsidiary.","First, let me say how excited we are about this transition as it marks the achievement of a long-term strategic objectives. We look forward to further leveraging this platform as we seek to bring Amgen's new medicines to patients in the third largest pharmaceutical market. From a financial perspective, we anticipate limited near-term financial impact resulting from this transition.","Now, with regard to capital deployment, our actions will continue to reflect the following principles. First, we will invest in our business to expand our pipeline of innovative medicines and to seek to drive long-term volume growth globally. We will also invest in prudent external business development opportunities.","Second, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends, including the 10% increase in the first quarter of 2020 or $1.60 per share, as well as continued share repurchases. We will continue to take an opportunistic view towards the timing of share repurchases within '20. We expect share repurchases within a range of $3 billion to $5 billion and have an authorization outstanding in the amount of $6.5 billion.","And third, we remain committed to maintaining an optimal capital structure in order to minimize our weighted average cost to capital and retain our investment grade rating. Consistent with our usual practice, our guidance today does not include the impact of potential external business development activities.","So in summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2019 and we remain confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2020 and beyond.","This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Murdo.","Murdo Gordon","Thanks Peter, and good afternoon everyone.","I'll take a few minutes to reflect on 2019 and then review Q4 in greater detail. In the 40 years since incorporation, Amgen's product portfolio and geographical footprint has changed dramatically. On our 40th anniversary, we reflect on the pioneering innovative spirit of our early Amgen employees that transformed the treatment of disease.","Our mission to serve patients remains unchanged and it motivates us every single day. Our accomplishments on behalf of patients in 2019 give us further confidence about our future as we enter 2020.","To summarize 2019, for the full year, we grew volume by 3%. The growing proportion of our portfolio posted 35% year-over-year volume increases. This portfolio is diverse and includes products such as Prolia, Evenity, Repatha, Aimovig, Otezla, Amgevita, our six hematology and oncology brands as well as MVASI and KANJINTI.","Finally, our international business contributed 19% volume growth in 2019. Notably, year-over-year revenues for our businesses in China and Japan grew nearly 8 fold. These markets are long-term growth engines for Amgen and our collaboration with BeiGene along with our acquisition of Otezla will accelerate our expansions in the second and third largest pharmaceutical markets.","Now moving to fourth quarter results. Volumes grew by 3% year-over-year. In Q4, net selling prices declined 4% year-over-year, resulting in reported net sales declining by 2%. As Peter mentioned, we have a stable outlook for our base business for 2020 and with the addition of Otezla, we expect revenue growth this year despite projecting continued declines in net selling price on a portfolio basis.","Now getting into product details, Prolia delivered 15% growth year-over-year, driven by higher volume from increasing rates of new patient growth and strong repeat injection rates. Recall that given twice a year dosing, Prolia experiences consistent seasonal trends. Evenity posted $85 million in the fourth quarter, driven by strong uptake in both Japan and the U.S.","Every year, worldwide 8.9 million fractures occur due to osteoporosis. That's one fracture every three seconds and only 20% of women who experienced a fracture are treated with a bone-building medicine. Given the under-penetrated nature of this market, we continue to focus on ensuring postmenopausal women receive appropriate screening, diagnosis, and treatment. With Prolia and Evenity, we have excellent treatment options to offer these patients.","On to Repatha, Q4 sales grew by 26% year-over-year, as we continue to be the leader in the PCSK9 class worldwide unit growth was 67% year-over-year and new to brand U.S. prescriptions are steadily improving growing at 61% year-over-year, we've taken significant steps and have made major progress in improving access and affordability for Repatha.","We removed the original list price offering. We simplified and improved prescription approval rates and commercial plans and we have increased the percentage of Medicare patients up to 70% that can access Repatha at a more affordable co-pay. Although the blended net price of Repatha in the U.S. declined in Q4 versus the previous year, net selling price was relatively stable sequentially.","For 2020, we expect a step down in Repatha's net selling price in Q1 based on our contracting to obtain broader access with stabilization thereafter.","Now onto Aimovig on Slide 16. On a year-over-year basis, volume grew 27% while net sales grew 3%. As a reminder, Q4 2018 benefited from $20 million of favorable changes in accounting estimates impacting the year-over-year comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Unit volume grew 9%.","To date, almost 300,000 patients have been prescribed Aimovig by more than 33,000 prescribers. Considering that there are 4 million migraine patients in the U.S. who are eligible for CGRP treatment, Aimovig has significant potential remaining to penetrate this market and we expect to drive volume growth over the course of 2020.","Aimovig leads in both new to CGRP prescriptions and total prescriptions, which exited Q4 with a 48% TRx share. Aimovig has exceptional access with over 80% of prescriptions paid and over 92% of the lives covered.","As a result of this broader access, we expect net price to decline slightly on a full year basis for 2020, when compared to the full year 2019. Additionally, Q1 has lower sales in subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance re-verifications, and greater co-pay expenses as patients, work through their deductibles.","We'll move to Parsabiv on Slide 17, which grew by 49% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Independent and midsize dialysis providers already utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcimimetic patients while FMC and DaVita continue to increase adoption.","Next onto Otezla. With the help of the dedicated professionals that have joined our team from Celgene, we will continue to drive strong sales growth and launch potential new indications for Otezla. During the period since acquisition closed, prescription momentum continued with 13% year-over-year growth. Our seamless integration efforts, combined with planned label and geographic expansion gives us confidence in our ability to grow Otezla at low double-digit compound annual growth rate over the next five years.","For the approximately five weeks post closing in 2019, Otezla sales were $178 million. We expect first quarter sales to be proportionally lower than in the remaining quarters of the year. The quarterly pattern for Otezla in 2020 should approximate the historical pattern over the last number of years.","Moving on to Enbrel sales increased 2% year-over-year driven by a $66 million favorable change in accounting estimates and increases in net selling prices, partially offset by unit volume declines. Volume trends in 2020 are expected to be similar to those in 2019. As for net selling price, we project limited benefit in 2020 versus 2019 due to less favorable contract terms.","With two highly complementary products, targeting psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we see an opportunity to strengthen their positions in the market; more broadly, we're increasing our focus in inflammation through our broad portfolio, which includes our biosimilars, Amgevita, and Avsola. Our late-stage asset tezepelumab and a number of other earlier assets in the R&D pipeline.","Now to our hematology and oncology business, which is highly integrated with our oncology biosimilars that I'll discuss later. Our innovative portfolio of six brands XGEVA, KYPROLIS, Nplate, Vectibix, BLINCYTO, and IMLYGIC collectively totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 10% year-over-year.","As for some of the larger brands within this portfolio, XGEVA grew 7% in Q4 year-over-year driven by 4% volume growth. KYPROLIS grew 6% year-over-year driven by volume led by a 12% increase in the U.S. - in U.S. sales. Nplate grew 15% year-over-year driven by volume. Our investments in R&D for Nplate have resulted in two innovations.","First, we recently launched a smaller presentation at 125 mcg in support of in Nplate's pediatric indication, as the product is administered with weight-based dosing. This new presentation will also help to minimize general product wastage for ITP patients across all indications. Second, Nplate received approval in October for the treatment of early ITP, which gives us the chance to serve patients earlier in the course of their disease and provides the opportunity for treatment free remission.","Now onto our more mature brands, in Q4 Neulasta sales declined 43% year-over-year with a 42% decline in the U.S. Recall that Q4 of 2018 benefited from a $55 million BARDA order, which did not repeat in Q4 of 2019. Coinciding with the emergence of U.S. biosimilar competition, the most recent CMS published ASP for Neulasta reflects a 10% reduction. Bear in mind that ASP is calculated two quarters in arrears.","On a volume basis in Q4, U.S. Neulasta retained an exit share of 74% of the long-acting segment with Onpro holding an exit share of 55%. We are encouraged by Onpro's durability demonstrating confidence that our customers have in the reliability and quality of our supply, along with our broader customer services.","We now face a third biosimilar competitor in the U.S. and other potential competitors remain and development. As you model, Neulasta sales for the first quarter, recall that Q1, 2019 benefited from a $98 million BARDA order that we do not project to recur in 2020.","Finally, outside the U.S., sales declined 48% in Q4 and we expect those trends to continue. Switching to Nephrology, starting on slide 25, Q4 EPOGEN sales declined 20% primarily due to lower net selling price from our contractual commitments with DaVita, which calls for a further price reduction in 2020.","Meanwhile, Aranesp declined 10% year-over-year driven by lower volume due to increased competition. Regarding Sensipar, recall that in the U.S., there were several at risk generic launches in 2019 that resulted in year-over-year sales declining 76% to $107 million in the quarter.","In 2020, supplemental patent protection certificates for cinacalcet expire in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, which will likely result in a significant decline in ex-U.S. sales in 2020.","I'll close the product section with our biosimilar portfolio, which is highly integrated with our innovative business throughout the company. As examples, a majority of these products were made with the same manufacturing network as our innovative brands.","We also leverage the same supply chain for distribution. And on the commercial side, we continue to identify synergies in commercializing our biosimilars alongside our innovative products, making it a highly efficient selling model and allowing us to rapidly apply learnings across our portfolio.","We also offer the same provider and patient services as with our innovative portfolio. These advantages are increasingly important as we now face additional biosimilar competition to KANJINTI and MVASI and expect other competitors to enter during 2020. Our Q4 biosimilar portfolio comprised of KANJINTI and MVASI in the U.S. and Amgevita, KANJINTI and MVASI outside of the U.S. recorded sales of $258 million.","In the U.S., KANJINTI and MVASI each recorded $79 million of sales and we've seen very encouraging adoption rates in the clinic segment and hospital adoption is accelerating. Given the early stage of launch, there is also some inventory stocking during the quarter. Ex-U.S. sales from our biosimilars where $100 million led by Amgevita.","We continue to see important differences between products and markets in terms of uptake and price erosion with some markets experiencing strong uptake at more discounted pricing levels, while other larger markets including Germany and France exhibit a more balanced and sustainable opportunity.","Here again, we're able to leverage our expertise and footprint in oncology, while Amgevita efforts synergized nicely with Otezla. In summary, 2019 was a solid year given the evolution of our product portfolio. In 2020, we plan to drive volume uptake of our growth portfolio of products, now including Otezla while defending our mature brands.","Let me now turn it over to Dave Reese.","Dave Reese","Thanks Murdo and good afternoon everyone.","As we enter 2020, we are looking forward to important clinical data from programs across our three therapeutic areas, inflammation, oncology, and cardiovascular disease. I'll say more about oncology in a moment, but I'd like to take the opportunity upfront to express our enthusiasm for the BeiGene collaboration. We're off to a good start and look forward to working together to advance the global development of our pipeline of innovative oncology molecules.","I'll now begin my quarterly review in inflammation. We expect Otezla data this year from a Phase 3 study in over 500 patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis that have failed topical therapy. This patient population has no approved oral therapy available and we are confident that Otezla may provide a much needed treatment option.","We're working with the CHMP toward a Behcet's indication in Europe and with the FDA on inclusion of the scalp psoriasis data in the U.S. label this year. There are also ongoing studies for new indications, including pediatric psoriasis and we're evaluating additional studies to expand the opportunity for Otezla.","I'll also remind you that later this year, we expect Phase 3 data from our TSLP antibody, tezepelumab in development with AstraZeneca and severe uncontrolled asthma.","In bone health, along with UCB, we were pleased to receive European approval for Evenity for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture. Evenity is the first new osteoporosis medicine approved in Europe in the last decade, a testament to the need for a new therapy that can rapidly build bone.","Turning to oncology and hematology, we continue to rapidly advance the development program for AMG 510, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. We enrolled the potentially pivotal Phase 2 monotherapy study in advanced non-small cell lung cancer in approximately three months and look forward to sharing data later this year when we have at least six months follow-up on all patients. I previously mentioned that we had enrolled a cohort of advanced colorectal cancer patients in our Phase 2 monotherapy study.","Based on the data we have generated to-date, we have opened the study to further enrollment and we'll assess our potential development path in colorectal cancer as additional data become available.","We also expect to present additional data later this year from our first-in-human monotherapy study in solid tumors, where we will have more information on duration of therapy as well as data and tumor types other than lung and colon cancer. We also expect initial data from our Phase 1 combination study with KEYTRUDA in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","We are enrolling advanced colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer patients in our MEK inhibitor combination study as well as treatment-naive non-small cell lung cancer patients in our ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy study. We continue to plan additional studies primarily combination trials and we'll provide updates as the program progresses.","We remain enthusiastic about our BiTE platform in 2020 will be an important year. Based on emerging evidence of anti-tumor activity in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, we are growing increasingly confident in the half-life extended format. As we advance our BiTE clinical programs in different tumor settings, we are gaining important insights into dose and schedule and management of adverse events such as cytokine-release syndrome.","These insights will guide customized development approaches, depending on the target and underlying disease biology. Over the course of the year, we anticipate sharing data from some of these programs and I'll provide further guidance on expected data presentations as these molecules advance.","We are now pursuing two half-life extended BiTE programs for gastric cancer and recently initiated a first-in-human study for AMG 199, which is directed against MUC17, a target widely expressed in gastric cancer.","Gastric cancer, as you know is highly prevalent in East Asia, where we have a growing presence through our impending Japan subsidiary and collaboration with BeiGene. As I previously discussed, we intend to present the data for AMG 701, or half-life extended BCMA BiTE when we have a meaningful dataset, most likely in the second half of this year.","We've also made several regulatory submissions in oncology, including the KYPROLIS CANDOR study in the U.S., KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone in China for relapse and refractory multiple myeloma and BLINCYTO in China for relapsed-refractory AOL. We look forward to working with BeiGene to advance these important medicines.","In cardiovascular disease, along the Cytokinetics, we look forward to the data from the omecamtiv mecarbil Phase 3 outcome study in the fourth quarter of this year. While the heart failure treatment landscape is expected to change based on recent data from other drug classes, we believe significant residual unmet medical need remains in this global epidemic. Also in cardiovascular disease, our LP(a) siRNA, AMG 890 continues to advance and we expect to initiate Phase 2 development in the first half of the year.","Finally, on biosimilars, we're pleased to receive U.S. approval for Avsola, our biosimilar Remicade and to make our U.S. regulatory submission for ABP 798, our biosimilar Rituxan. I'm also pleased to announce that we are initiating a Phase 3 study with our 7th biosimilar ABP 938, our biosimilar aflibercept or EYLEA.","Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thanks, Dave. Ian, why don't we open the lines up for questions now and please remind our callers of the process.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer & Co. Jay?","Jay Olson","You talked a little bit about net pricing dynamics for Aimovig. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on how you expect the competitive dynamic to shape up in the CGRP space and any long-term data, you could potentially leverage there? Thank you.","Murdo Gordon","Thanks for the question Jay, it's Murdo here. We're very pleased with Aimovig's market access position now with over 92% of covered lives, having access to Aimovig at a very affordable co-pay. We're also pleased with the addition this year of CVS, last year we did not have CVS as a benefit - with Aimovig as a benefit. And we do as of the beginning of this year and we've already seen and acceleration in our new patient uptake. We are happy that the percentage of patients that are receiving paid prescriptions now of Aimovig is above 80%.","And that bodes well for the future growth of this category because we've got highly effective medicines that have an impact, a significant impact on the reduction of migraine days on migraine sufferers. And we have a lot of them, there is 4 million eligible patients out there in the U.S. and they're able to access Aimovig at a very affordable co-pay. So that's good for the future outlook of the category.","Obviously because we did contract to secure that additional access, there will be a reduction in our net selling price that you'll see in Q1 and then we expect it to be relatively stable over time. Now, because this is a retail benefit product, you do see some fluctuations, as you make true-ups in the mix of your product that comes through Medicaid commercial or to some extent Medicare Part B. But overall, we would expect post Q1 stability in net selling price.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael?","Michael Yee","I had an R&D question for David. Of course there is a lot of attention on AMG 510, you made a lot of great comments about how you quickly enrolled the study and we're going to get data later this year. One of the things I picked up on was your comments about first-line lung?","Can you just maybe make a comment about how that advances or how that progresses or how you go about a first-line strategy that's obviously a huge opportunity, so maybe just comment about where that monotherapy study goes and where you can go with first-line? Thank you.","Dave Reese","Yes thanks, Michael. That is intended to provide a potential treatment option for patients who are not eligible for other first-line lung therapies or unwilling to take such therapies. I think it will provide incredibly valuable clinical information on response to the drug in a previously untreated population. We've just started enrolling that, so over the course of the year as we generate data, we'll provide guidance as to when we may have some things to share.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Chris?","Chris Raymond","Just on M&A priorities so Bob I was kind of struck a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco. You guys talked about renal as maybe an area of interest in terms of building out the pipeline and you're offering and obviously augmenting what is a pretty formidable business now. But I think the wording that I heard you say, Bob was that any asset you bring in, would have to be game changing. So maybe two parts can you talk about the reasoning for this sort of focus on renal or at least articulating that to us. And then what are you really looking for in terms of the game-changing therapy? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Yes so, Chris just to remind you we have six commercial franchise areas, of which nephrology is one obviously that was our first. We've been a leader in that area now for several decades. We have a number of important products for nephrologists today and we intend to continue to serve the needs of patients and physicians and providers et cetera in that community. We have not found in our own discovery research efforts that we've been able to find the kinds of game changing innovation that we want to invest in from a discovery standpoint.","So we're not investing in discovery research in nephrology right now, but we are going to look for business development opportunities there and in general our strategy when it comes to the business development is to look for medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from these diseases. So we'll look for innovation and large effect size. I don't know that I use the word game changer.","But if I did, that's what I was intending to reflect the notion of large effect size innovative medicines. So to the extent, there are some in the industry or otherwise medicines, where again we think because of the historical investment we've had it with this community patients\u2019 that we can add real value, we'll look.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird & Co. Brian?","Brian Skorney","One quick one - actually two quick ones on housekeeping, just it looks like compared to last quarter, you saw a 6% decline in Neulasta market share. Could you just breakout how much of that was Onpro loss and can you also talk about how Onpro price has been impacted by the biosimilars have been able to maintain price so far or have you taken greater discounts to maintain that share? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay, those are good questions for Murdo. Why don't you go ahead Murdo.","Murdo Gordon","Yes thanks, Brian. The majority of the share decline is from the prefilled syringe. Onpro exited at a 55% share of long-acting filgrastim and continues to hold up well in terms of share. We have had a contract out there that provides some discount to Onpro, but it's a more modest discount, then you would see on the prefilled syringe.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Evan?","Evan Seigerman","One on biosimilars so what are some gating factors to achieve, I think it's multi-billion or you had at one point said greater than $3 billion in sales across the franchise. And if there were to be implementation of an international pricing index for most favored nation clause for Medicare Part B. How would this potentially impact your biosimilars business? Thank you, guys.","Bob Bradway","I can take a stab at the first part of your question and Murdo, I invite you to jump in. But since we made those undertakings before you were part of the team Murdo. The notion that we articulated was that we were going to advance the portfolio of up to 10 biosimilars that we expected that these could be an attractive growth opportunity for the company and we're off to a good start, as you heard me say earlier.","At the end of the fourth quarter, we are annualizing in excess of $1 billion. So we're off to a good start. We're on time. We're on budget with these programs and the gating item is simply product approvals and product launches. So we remain enthusiastic about our chance to earn a return from these products and it adds to the specifics of IPI, just to say in general. We obviously would be concerned we think quite a few other stakeholder groups would as well about the disruption that IPI would represent to the innovative biopharmaceutical industry.","And we think there are better ways to evolve our system in a way that ensures patients have access to medicines at affordable prices, but Murdo feel free if you want to add anything specific about IPI in biosimilar landscape.","Murdo Gordon","Nothing on IPI, Bob I think you summarized it well and on the biosimilars, the only thing I would say is I'm thankful to have inherited this portfolio and for the decisions that were made prior to my arrival. I think this is a strong business opportunity. It's been one, we've been able to realize very good competitive share in Europe and we're off to a very good start in our early launch in the U.S. And I look forward to being able to launch more products.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen?","Kennen MacKay","I totally agree it was transformative. Maybe for Murdo, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the synergies you're seeing or expecting between selling of both Otezla and Enbrel and whether there were any tailwinds there to year end formulary rebating or contracting negotiations. We should think about in pricing or access in the year ahead?","Murdo Gordon","Thanks for the question, Kennen. Yeah we're excited about potential synergies between Otezla and Enbrel, and quite frankly by extension our biosimilars business coming into the inflammation category. Too early to comment on specifics, but we continue to work through our contracting strategy, promotional strategy even things as simple as possibly expanding into primary care promotion because we have a fairly large primary care footprint.","And then clearly, our international geographic expansion is augmented by having Otezla joining our portfolio with potential new markets where perhaps Otezla was slated to be launched by distributors when we have a full blown affiliate in some of those markets. And then the last pieces of course synergies as we go into some of the new indication areas.","So I'm excited about building those. Our teams are working hard to realize those synergies, and I feel optimistic that we'll be able to be more specific in upcoming quarters.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer.","Umer Raffat","I am just extraordinarily confused today on the guidance, but I'll limit my question two specific things perhaps. First, Peter on the OINE line, if you can bear with me for a second, you mentioned $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and I was trying to think it through and I thought to myself $30 billion debt at just above 3% rate, so that's $1 billion as an interest expense, minus about $100 million of the interest income. So that's $900 million, so when you guide to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, that's effectively implying $300 million to $500 million for BeiGene. But my understanding was you're only booking 20% and I'm just trying to understand is BeiGene's implied net income $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion or am I thinking about that wrong, because that sounds so much higher than what BeiGene does. That's number one.","And secondly on revenues. I noticed - I know the business is being implied flat year-over-year outside Otezla, so I just want to understand better what the pushes and that pulls are there and perhaps also I think it mentioned biosimilars doing $1 billion in 2020 annual 4Q '19 alone was north of $1 billion run rate, so just trying to understand all this. Thank you very much.","Bob Bradway","Okay Umer. Let's try and go through that, I think there were three questions there. So Murdo, you want to take the first two on the revenue, just clarify what we said and then Pete, you can help clarify the other interest and expense line.","Murdo Gordon","Sure. So yes, we have guided that our base business will be stable year-over-year, obviously there are a range of outcomes on that portfolio and we continue to work hard across a number of opportunities to do as we've done historically and that is to outperform.","I would say that Otezla has come in and we have seen very good seamless integration of that team and that performance of that product and the growth trajectory continues with - without any interruption through the fourth quarter and we're seeing strong weeks early in the New Year.","On biosimilars, it's very early in the launch of those two products, where we are annualizing as you pointed out at over $1 billion based on fourth quarter and we expect to be able to continue to accelerate that business.","Peter Griffith","Umer, Peter here. Thanks for your question. I would take you to the fact that our total debt at the interest rate I talked about in my remarks at 3.7% average maturity 12 years, by the way, I mentioned that too. That plus the 20.5% of BeiGene's results for 2020, the publicly available consensus estimates are what we're guiding to. So when you work through those two, you should get pretty close to our $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for 2020.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Robyn Karnauskas from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Robin.","Robyn Karnauskas","I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I guess I'm confused too just by this lack of growth given that your slides have outlined, Neulasta, you've lost like half Onpro's holding, you're growing like a bunch of different products. So what is the one thing you think that is going to prevent you from growing more this year and not just having a stable business year-over-year, like that's sort of what I'm struggling with the most, just help me understand that because the way you describe, it looks like more growth of the top line. Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Sorry Robyn, repeat the last piece - last piece of your question.","Robyn Karnauskas","Sure. The way you're describing our your business is in your slide performance basically is that you're growing many parts of the business and the part that is declining is Neulasta, it seems to be potentially stabilizing with Onpro. So what is preventing you from growing beyond what you're guiding, is there one particular thing, I think most of us sitting there saying why can't you grow more than what you've outlined given the picture that you painted of the business being actually quite strong.","Peter Griffith","So I would agree with your last comment, the picture of the business does look quite strong. We're pleased with what we've been able to achieve, particularly in the back half of last year.","As I mentioned earlier, some of the Neulasta stability with Onpro has been at the expense of contracted terms, which lowered the net price of that total portfolio inclusive of Onpro and we would expect with additional competitors against Neulasta in the biosimilar space that there will be further net price erosion in the long-acting filgrastim category and of course, overall in our total portfolio worldwide, we would expect single digit net price declines for the year.","Now, that goes up against what I talked about throughout the call is we have a number of really strong growth drivers in a young portfolio, very diverse products, and we have guided a wide range on revenue and it's my hope that the strong execution we saw in the back half of last year continues into this year and we can achieve a good growth profile, not just in Otezla but in the base business.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence.","Terence Flynn","Omecamtiv is a product you guys haven't talked a lot about recently obviously some Phase 3 data coming later this year, Dave, you mentioned it in your, in your remarks as well in terms of kind of the change in treatment landscape, but just curious if you could remind us of the puts and takes for the program, as we think about the probability of success here and what would really get you guys excited that type of data? Thank you.","Dave Reese","Sure Terence. This is Dave. I'm happy to address that. I mean, as I mentioned in my remarks, heart failure is a global epidemic, what makes us continue to have excitement in omecamtiv, it's a first-in-class mechanism of action, it's the only drug ever introduced that actually acts directly on the heart cell to improve contractility or the heart's pumping function and we're conducting what'll will be a definitive 8200-patient or give or take trial in patients with advanced heart failure, it's a fairly sick population, where we're going to be looking for mortality benefit and a variety of other clinical outcome measures that improve.","So I think there is a large amount of residual unmet medical need and obviously where this fits in a train changing treatment landscape will depend on the profile that emerges from that Phase 3 trial.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein Research. Ronny.","Ronny Gal","Good afternoon and congratulations on the nice 2019 and got one housekeeping and one question. The quick one is, I was wondering if you could give us your comment on the Medicaid block grant that just was announced today. Does that has any relevance to you and then generally, where do you expect it will impact the drug industry.","And second, David, I was wondering if you could give me your - your view on the modest lung catering paper suggesting in the targeting the active GDP bound form of KRAS is better than trapping the GDP KRAS in the inactive form in terms of preventing tumors and tumor resistance to those agents.","Bob Bradway","Good. Well let me - I'll knock off the Medicaid piece first Ronny, for those who are on the call who aren't aware, CMS released some guidance earlier today, so we and others are still chewing through it. I think you'll have very limited impact at first read of it for us, but it's likely to be relevant for those states that didn't opt into the ACA in the first instance and we'll go through it as well, I'm sure others in our industry, more closely to see whether there are any specific issues, for our business, but it didn't seem to me Ronny that that was going to be a concern for us in 2020. Dave, you want to tackle the one please.","Dave Reese","Yes. I'm sure you don't want to address that one, Bob. So, we look - for those who aren't familiar, Ronny's referring to paper that came out within the last month or so that suggests that also targeting the GDP bound form of KRAS G12C would be required for signaling inhibition. We read the paper with interest, of course, I'll make a couple of observations. First, I would say our own data with AMG 510 suggest that at the appropriate doses and doses that we can achieve clinically, we can completely suppressed signaling throughout a dosing interval.","It is also my understanding or belief that the G12C inhibitor used in that paper may have been a little less potent and one thing that we've learned over 40 years in oncology is that if you in completely inhibitor target, you very quickly breed resistance.","So I would say, I feel very confident based on the preclinical data that we've generated with AMG 510 and we're of course profiling tumors across our clinical program to try to generate signatures of response and resistance. This is the sort of thing that we'll look at. But I don't see anything in the literature as of yet that dissuades me from the approach we're currently taking.","Operator","And our next question is one of Mohit Bansal from Citi. Mohit.","Mohit Bansal","And a quick question on Otezla in mild-to-moderate psoriasis, it seems like you will have data later this year, but given that net of tax rate is kind of a standard of care in that particular market and is a generic, what sort of challenge do you anticipate placing baseline in that market and how do you think about navigating those challenges there? Thank you.","Dave Reese","Yes. Well, let me start Mohit and then I'll ask Murdo to jump in. So in mild-to-moderate psoriasis, there are currently no approved oral therapies. The only thing really available to patients right now is topical therapy, many of them will not ultimately experience disease control with those topical therapies and so we think there is a real opportunity for Otezla in that area. There are up to nearly 6 million patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis in the United States alone. So that gives you a sense of the size of this opportunity and actually the prevalence of the disease. Murdo.","Murdo Gordon","Yes and Mohit, the only thing I would add is, yes, there is some methotrexate use there, but it's largely a topical business as Dave described and it's largely a patient population that gets very little relief. And this is really a patient population that is in the sweet spot for Otezla. The other thing I have to say is that our new colleagues when building out their positioning strategy for Otezla and their payor strategy have done a very, very nice job of positioning the access and reimbursement for Otezla as a post topical pre-biologic option.","So I think for the mild-to-moderate population if we're successful in securing that indication that same payor strategy will be continued. So, I feel confident that we're in good shape there for another source of growth for Otezla going forward.","Bob Bradway","So Ian, I know we've got several calls or several questions still queued up, so we will try to get through those apologies that were beyond the top of the hour here, but let's go onto the next question.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is from line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew.","Matthew Harrison","I just wanted to follow up on a comment that Dave made earlier in the call, suggesting I think that - that maybe you're seeing some activity in HLE-BiTE in both solid tumors and liquid tumors. Maybe you could just characterize for us what - what data you have internally that gave you the confidence to make that statement? Thanks.","Dave Reese","Yes. Thanks, Matt. And I assume that someone would pick up on that statement. So what I would say is, I'm not ready to declare victory in any indication yet, but we're seeing the sort of pharmacodynamic activity and early suggestions of anti-tumor activity that are reminiscent of the early days of BLINCYTO and that give us encouragement that we're on the right track.","I'd also point out that we undoubtedly have the largest experience in the world in development of bispecific T-cell engagers, as I noted in my remarks, we've learned an enormous amount about dosing and scheduling appropriate management of adverse events and I think all of that is starting to come to bear right now and we're starting to see some of these hints in that in the HLE or half-life extended format. So again, I'm not ready to declare a victory, but we're seeing signs of encouragement and we'll be ready to share some of those data as the year goes on.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Do Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Do.","Do Kim","Just one on Aimovig, you've talked previously about expanding the primary care prescribing base. How would you go about doing that and could you do it with your current sales force?","Dave Reese","Yes. Thanks, Do. We - we are doing it with our current sales force. I think I talked about the 33,000 prescribing base and I think we're seeing some encouraging results, right now in the CGRP class, you see about 7,000 new patients coming into the class and into the category that are receiving a CGRP therapy and it's our goal to broaden that given that there are so many patients, who are persisting on oral therapies and older therapies that are just not as effective and in fact we see very high drop off and very low persistency on these older oral meds like topiramate and we are trying to change that care continue on that pathway in the way physicians treat chronic migraine sufferers and I think we're having some success.","So the 7,000-patient per week number that we're seeing is one that we're looking to grow and we are applying all the right efforts, both in our digital campaigns as well as our personal selling teams in the primary care community right now. So yes, the answer is, we have all the resources required to do that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen & Company. Yaron?","Yaron Werber","If you don't mind, Dave, just have a quick housekeeping and then a question for Murdo. On the housekeeping side, Omecamtiv, can you just let us know is there one more final DSMB look before you look at the event rate, and then for Murdo just curious about Repatha, it looks like it's beginning to grow now. But now, what's your expectation given that 70% of patients that have access to the new price - the new formulation. Thank you.","Dave Reese","Yes Yaron, so I'll take the Omecamtiv question. There is an -- as we've previously discussed, there is an interim analysis for efficacy that will occur, that has a very, very high bar, a very high bar in terms of the statistical stopping rule. So our expectation is that the trial will continue through to the primary analysis towards the end of the year.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. And Yaron, on Repatha just a reminder, a 100% of patients are accessing the low-list price because we pulled the original list price off the market in December. And we've been able to throughout the course of 2019, open up the commercial access where the majority of patients receive Repatha by their physicians prescribing it without the need for paperwork and utilization management criteria, so physician attestation only in commercial is the majority condition for how they can prescribed Repatha.","And then in Medicare Part D space, obviously that's a new event for us, because we were mid-cycle when we lowered the price with the introduction of the low list price. So it's really something we're excited about as an accelerating potential for Repatha, as was mentioned roughly 70% of Medicare Part D lives now have access to Repatha at an affordable co-pay.","So we're looking forward to seeing sustained growth going forward. Our teams are ready and I was just with our sales forces in Dallas and everybody is pretty excited about being able to treat more patients quite frankly the way they should have been treated all along.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Geoffrey.","Geoffrey Porges","A quick housekeeping and then one for Murdo. First, could you just give us an update Dave on where the C5 biosimilar program is, is that still active and then for Murdo - Murdo, I'm impressed with the Evenity number, you're annualizing it sort of $350 million already, which I think is better than most of us anticipated. Could you talk a little bit about the reception you're receiving and whether you really think this can become Forteo's obviously losing its exclusivity, can it become a Forteo-like brand given what you're seeing already? Thanks.","Dave Reese","Yes. Jeff, so I'll take the first part of that question relating to ABP 959 or Soliris biosimilar, the Phase 3 is actively enrolling and we'll provide guidance as we come to the conclusion of that trial when you can expect to see data.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. And Geoffrey, thanks for the question on of Evenity. We are pleased with the launch trajectory on Evenity, it's reflective really of two markets, Japan and U.S. primarily. The Japanese launch has been nothing short of a resounding success out there with our partners, Astellas and UCB, I think physician reception has been excellent.","We positioned the product for post-fracture high-risk patients and I think that that's gone really well and it's where the risk benefit equation seems to be one that most physicians are accepting off and we've done the same thing in the U.S., our launch is a little younger in the U.S., but nonetheless the trajectory has exceeded our own expectations as well.","We just recently got our permanent J code in the U.S. and that's opening up the prescriber base as well. So I do think that we will have a very successful franchise on our hands and of course UCB will be commercializing with some help from us across Europe, thanks to the approval with the EMA there.","So overall, whether - will it be as big as a Forteo that remains to be seen. We are - I will remind you slightly less expensive 30% on the low-end as much as 70% on the high end than our competitors in the category, it's a 12-month duration so it's not a product that you take for multiple years, it's for of 12-month duration, but the new patient acquisition is clearly exciting.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia?","Alethia Young","I guess part of that has been another drug that's been doing quite well in spite of Sensipar. So maybe can you talk about should we expect continued kind of unit demand growth. I know you probably had some contracting obviously over the prior 12 months. But just maybe help us frame how to think about the next 12 months for parts of it. Thanks.","Dave Reese","Yes, thanks, Alethia. The Parsabiv performance last year was fantastic. There are a number of patients, who are benefiting from it. There is a change in reimbursement for Parsabiv going into coming into 2020 that may slow the rate of growth a little, but the range of Parsabiv outcomes is broad and it's really too early to call.","A \u2013 Bob Bradway","Okay, Ian, I think we've got two more calls we try to get them and then we'll wrap up.","Operator","Very well. Our next question is from line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Salim?","Salim Syed","Just one for me on Omecamtiv, David, you mentioned that the landscape will be changing believe on and some of the recent data. And I guess what I was looking for some clarity on when I presume you're talking about the SGLT2 space specifically flows in and then from the commentary you provide, are you envisioning this to be on the Omecamtiv to be on top of SGLT2s or competing at the head and if there is any patients actually getting enrolled in the trial. Thank you.","Dave Reese","Yes, thanks Salim. Yes, so I was making reference to the SGLT2s in particular, our sense is that the patients treated in those studies were probably a somewhat less sick population. So that may be a point of differentiation and then as we have intended all along with our Omecamtiv given the lack of drug-drug interactions that we've seen now in the mechanism of action. It is intended to be an add-on to other therapies.","Of course, in the Phase 3 trial, we will look at number of patients, who are receiving things such as SGLT2s in the study.","Bob Bradway","Okay, let's get the last question.","Operator","And our final question is from line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory?","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Gavin on for Cory. Thanks for fitting us in. I apologize if you answered this, but we are wondering what your assumptions are going into the double-digit growth for Otezla. Does this imply a label expansion or is this just with the existing label and or any comment on competitive concerns.","A \u2013 Bob Bradway","And I think we've addressed that. But we just reiterate for you Gavin, what we think is behind that.","A \u2013 Dave Reese","Yes. So we are assuming that we would secure additional indications in our assumption for double-digit going forward. We're also using historical growth rate and where we're sourcing a new patients right now. So I think that's pretty clear.","Bob Bradway","Okay, everyone. Thanks for your patience. Sorry. We went a little bit past the allotted hour, but let me just conclude by saying that we feel good about where we ended in 2019 managing through what was always going to be a transition year for us, and we think we're on the cusp now of a period of new product revenue growth.","So we look forward to that. And we look forward as well to important clinical data that is expected particularly towards the second half of this year. So I'd be remiss if I didn't just take a moment to thank as well the Amgen staff around the world, who continue to work so hard every day to deliver on our mission to serve patients. So thank you to them. And we look forward to let me chance to talk to all of you in April after the first quarter.","Peter Griffith","Thanks Bob. Thanks everybody for your participation. If you have any other questions you would like to cover, of course myself, and the rest of the IR team will be around for several hours. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Amgen's fourth quarter 2019 financial results conference call. We thank you for joining us.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter conference call. We posted solid revenue and earnings per share growth which provides yet another indication of how we are successfully executing on our growth strategy.","To discuss this and other topics, including our increasingly visible pipeline opportunities, I'm joined by several members of our management team today. This is Bob Bradway's first conference call with investors as our CEO, so he will lead with providing a brief strategic overview. Following Bob, our CFO, Jon Peacock, will review our quarterly results and update our guidance for the year. Our Head of Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will highlight our product performance, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update, including top line data from our PCSK9 program for hypercholesterolemia. After Sean's presentation, we'll have plenty of time for questions.","I'm sure you have reviewed our press release, and I hope you found our new user-friendly format useful. We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which, in summary, says that through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bradway","Thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter conference call. As you can see from the results, our performance in the first half of the year was very strong. Our results reflect broad momentum on the top line for both our established and newly launched products.","Amongst our established products, Enbrel performed particularly well in the second quarter as we benefited from our ongoing investment in the brand. I'm pleased as well with the progress of XGEVA and Prolia, which continue to gain favor with patients and physicians as we launch these brands globally.","In addition to strong revenue, we enjoyed operating leverage through the first half of the year, and together with the benefit of last year's buyback, this has enabled us to deliver very strong earnings per share growth through the first 6 months of 2012.","Based on our strong first half and the momentum we have in the business, we are raising 2012 guidance for revenues and earnings per share, and we'll cover the details of that with you in a moment.","I'm encouraged not only with the operating results for the first half of the year, but also with the progress we are making in our R&D portfolio. I would highlight 2 novel molecules in particular that help position us for attractive future growth. First, together with our partners at UCB, we're excited to be enrolling patients in a Phase III study of our sclerostin antibody for osteoporosis, or AMG 785. There remains a clear medical need for a systemic anabolic agent that helps osteoporotic women build bone, and we're excited about our sclerostin antibody's potential to address that need.","Similarly, with a benefit of strong Phase II data, we're excited about advancing our PCSK9 antibody, or AMG 145, to help treat patients who are not otherwise able to manage their LDL cholesterol level to acceptable levels. This, too, represents an important new opportunity for us.","While talking about R&D, I would note that following on the inflammation partnership we formed with AstraZeneca last quarter, our recently amended Takeda agreement is another step in the direction of freeing up R&D resources to focus on our most important programs.","Strategically, we are executing well on our agenda. Our acquisition in Turkey established a strong position for us in a fast-growing region of the world for biopharmaceuticals. We acquired an innovative cancer company, Micromet, in the first quarter and our more recent acquisition of KAI brings us a novel medicine in the dialysis field, where we expect to be able to add value as well.","Financially, our company is in a strong position, and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders is reflected in our growing dividend and the considerable progress we've made against our $10-billion buyback program.","Finally, I know a number of our staff are listening into this call, and I want to take a moment to thank them for their exceptional efforts and accomplishments through the first half of this year. Our focus here at Amgen is on growing the company and delivering for patients and shareholders.","We're off to a good start, and I know I can count on our staff to keep delivering through the balance of the year. Now let me turn it over to Jon, who will review the details of our financial performance. Jon?","Jonathan M. Peacock","Thanks, Bob. As you can see on Page 4 of the presentation, this was a strong quarter for us. We grew revenues 13% and adjusted earnings per share 34%.","Product sales grew 8% compared to 2011, reflecting continued strength across the portfolio. Tony will give you more perspective on the individual product performances shortly. On a geographic basis, our U.S. business grew by 9%, and the rest of the world, predominantly Europe, for us, by 3%. And compared to the first quarter, our rest of world sales, again predominantly Europe, grew by 5%.","Other revenues increased by $200 million versus a year ago. This was the result of our agreement to grant Takeda worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Motesanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor for cancer, in return for agreed milestone payments and royalties.","In 2008, we'd entered into a global codevelopment and profit share agreement for Motesanib and granted exclusive rights to Takeda in Japan. The agreement to grant worldwide rights triggered the revenue recognition of a payment previously received from Takeda at the time of signing the original codevelopment agreement.","And as Bob has highlighted, this also allows us to free up resources and focus on our most important R&D programs. Sean will talk more about this later on.","Operating expenses was 7% higher compared to 2011, slightly below product sales growth. Cost of sales were up 17%, and that included the higher Puerto Rico excise taxes. Since this tax initially passes through inventory and it was introduced in January of last year, the charge was lower in the first half of 2011. If I exclude the effect of Puerto Rico taxes, operating expenses grew by 6% in the quarter versus a year ago.","Research and development costs overall were flat and SG&A costs were up 8%, and this was driven a combination of higher Enbrel profit share payments and investments in international expansion.","Adjusted earnings per share grew by 34%, and that was driven by strong operating income growth of 23% and the 16% lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher tax rate.","The higher tax rate was primarily driven by the expiry of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit at the end of 2011. And at this point, the credit has not been renewed for 2012.","Turning to Page 5. Free cash flow in the quarter was $2.2 billion, and that was up $800 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. In addition to the strong operating performance, this increase was driven by the termination of fixed to floating interest rate swap contracts on our debt portfolio, and this realized U.S. cash of $400 million. It was also driven by the collection of $200 million of overdue receivables in Spain under the government's recent funding program.","We raised an additional $3 billion through our U.S. bond offering in May, completing the financing of our $10-billion share repurchase program. Uses of cash in the quarter were primarily share repurchases of $1.2 billion, dividend payments of $300 million and the consideration for the acquisition of MN Pharmaceuticals in Turkey for $700 million.","Payment for the acquisition of KAI Pharma of around $315 million was made just after the end of the quarter. And so at the end of June, we held cash balances of $22.5 billion and total debt of $24.5 billion.","Our debt portfolio has an average maturity of 14 years and an average coupon of 3.8% pretax. Following the termination of the swap contracts noted above, the interest terms are now 100% fixed, and given the maturity and the rates on these bonds, we feel very comfortable with this position.","Year-to-date, we've repurchased shares at a total cost of $2.6 billion, and at an average price of $68.55. And this brings the total cost of shares repurchased under our $10-billion share repurchase program to $7.6 billion and at an average cost of $62.75 a share.","So turning now to Page 6. Based on the strong first half year, we're updating our guidance for the full year. We now expect full year revenues of between $16.9 billion and $17.2 billion and we expect adjusted earnings per share of between $6.20 and $6.35.","Our guidance on the full year tax rate and on capital expenditures remains the same.","The EPS guidance reflects the onetime upfront and milestone payments received from Takeda, AstraZeneca and Astellas in the first half of the year, and it reflects an expectation of higher clinical development costs in the second half as we ramp up the Phase III trials for AMG 785, our sclerostin antibody for osteoporosis; and in accelerating our Phase III program for AMG 145, our PCSK9 antibody to lower LDL cholesterol. Sean will talk more about both of these programs.","I'd also note that I expect cost of sales to be slightly higher in the second half and for the full year, as denosumab and Enbrel growth continues in the mix. Overall, though, we plan to maintain the discipline of keeping operating expenses at or below revenue growth on an annual basis.","So I'll now hand over to Tony to take you through more details on our commercial performance.","Anthony C. Hooper","Thank you, Jon. Good afternoon, everyone. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #7.","First, let me say I'm very pleased with the execution of our commercial strategy. Our team is focused on appropriately maximizing the value of all our brands across both our portfolio and our geographies.","Let me start with the Filgrastim franchise, where Neulasta represents about 80% of our sales. In the U.S., we continue to drive Neulasta unit growth by maintaining our emphasis on first and every cycle treatment as the best way to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia in appropriate patients.","In Europe, Neulasta unit demand remained relatively stable. But Neupogen, which accounts for about 20% of the franchise, lost some share to biosimilars due to pricing pressures.","Let's now turn to Enbrel. I've spoken to you for a couple of quarters now about our strong focus on this product and about our commitment to investing in Enbrel over the long term.","You may also recall that our patent protection has been extended until 2029 and our profit share arrangement with Pfizer ends in October 2013.","This will result in dramatically improving the profitability of our product. Our recent focus for Enbrel has been on optimizing the sales force, expanding direct-to-consumer advertising and ensuring appropriate access.","We have completed the consolidation of all U.S. field sales activities under Amgen and we've made a small expansion to the sales force. This has allowed us better coverage and frequency on both rheumatologists and dermatologists.","We're also very pleased with the results of our DTC and access initiatives. All of these efforts have led to a stabilizing trend in our share for both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. More importantly, we've seen significant increase in our new-to-biologics segment prescriptions.","Enbrel remains, in value terms, the leading biologic in the fast-growing rheumatology and dermatology segments.","Aranesp sales grew by 3% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We've seen fairly stable usage patterns for several months in the U.S, consistent with our expectations regarding changing practice patents.  We believe the majority of these practice patent changes have now been realized. Internationally, Aranesp unit growth was partially offset by price declines.","EPOGEN quarter-over-quarter sales were up 18%, mainly due to customer and wholesaler buying patterns. But I am pleased to report that we saw a 2% growth underlying unit demand in the quarter. Hemoglobin levels reported up to April seem to settle at about 10.7 grams per deciliter. Average dosing has also been less volatile than what we saw in several previous quarters.","We've seen limited impact on EPOGEN sales from new competition. However, we continue to expect some volatility in EPOGEN sales as a result of the overall dynamics of the market, but we are confident in our ability to compete strongly with this brand.","The execution of our strategies for our growth-phase products, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate resulted in double-digit demand increases for each of these 3 brands.","Now turning to denosumab. We are confident in the strategies we developed to drive long-term growth for both Prolia and XGEVA. XGEVA growth continues to be driven by share gains and overall SRE segment growth.","Our primary areas of focus for XGEVA have included emphasizing the product's superior clinical profile, increasing share of voice by way of more sales force focus and direct-to-patient programs.","For Prolia, I am pleased with the progress we've made with this brand. A key part of our strategy is to encourage patients to initiate a dialogue with their physicians. Our direct-to-consumer television campaign in the U.S, featuring Blythe Danner, has created a marked increase in these dialogues. We also see an increase in unaided brand recognition by patients and a continued increase in website traffic.","On the access front, our efforts have driven a reduction in the reimbursement projection rate at pharmacy for the brand, and on the sales force front, we've made a targeted increase in our sales force to ensure we reach high-volume osteoporosis general practitioner prescribers.","In markets outside the U.S., we continue to see excellent uptake in countries where we have already launched, and we continue to make progress on pricing and reimbursement in countries where we have not yet launched.","In summary, I am pleased with the competitive strategies that our team have developed and our focused execution against these strategies. I'm confident in our commercial team's ability to face the challenges that lie ahead as we continue to bring vital medicines to patients.","Now let me pass you on to Dr. Sean Harper.","Sean E. Harper","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. Our clinical programs are all advancing quite well, including our Phase III oncology programs: AMG 479 in pancreatic cancer, AMG 386 in ovarian cancer and T-Vec in melanoma.","We have initiated enrollment with AMG 785, our monoclonal antibody directed against sclerostin in our second, in this case alendronate-controlled, Phase III study designed to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis with our partners at UCB.","We anticipate initiating Phase III enrollment for brodalumab, our monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the IL-17 receptor, in moderate to severe psoriasis with our partners at AstraZeneca, MedImmune this year. Blinatumomab, our monoclonal antibody inhibitor of HGF, the ligand for the MET receptor, garnered a lot of attention at the American Society of Clinical Oncology this year due to the impact on survival in gastric cancer patients who have high MET expression in their tumors.","There is great unmet need in gastric cancer, particularly in emerging markets such as China. This program is now in Phase III planning.","As you know, we received a complete response from FDA on our application for an XGEVA sBLA for bone metastasis-free survival in patients with prostate cancer and rapidly rising prostate-specific antigen levels. We have recently filed an sBLA application with the EMA, focused much more on the subset of patients with very rapidly rising PSA, who experience the greatest degree of benefit in our study.","We recently closed our acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals. KAI's lead program is a calcimimetic agent, KAI-4169, for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism that can be intravenously administered during standard 3x weekly hemodialysis regimens.","In the context of the recent results of the EVOLVE study, our Phase III cardiovascular outcome study of Cinacalcet, our takeaway from ongoing discussions with nephrologists continues to be that an IV therapy administered coincident with dialysis would provide an opportunity to be assured that the patient receive the drug as intended.","Phase II data for KAI-4169 are very promising, and we're planning an efficient Phase III program based on biochemical endpoints.","Bob and Jon have mentioned the new deal structure with our partners at Takeda regarding Motesanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor for cancer. We feel that it makes great sense for Takeda to take the lead on developing this asset, specifically for Asian populations, based on a subset analysis from our global trial in non-small cell lung cancer.","This arrangement allows us to redirect significant resources into some of our other innovative development programs and to continue to seek to optimize return on our R&D investment.","Finally, our large Phase II program with AMG 145, our monoclonal antibody inhibitor, PCSK9, continues to great -- generates great interest due to the large number of patients in clinical practice who cannot reach their LDL cholesterol goals despite currently available therapies.","We have completed the primary analysis of approximately 1,300 patients in our studies, exploring the efficacy of AMG 145 as monotherapy or in combination with statins in statin-intolerant patients, and in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. These studies met all of their key endpoints. The majority of the patients in these studies were rolled into an open label extension study, which will provide critical long-term safety data for our filing.","We intend to submit our Phase II data for publication and presentation in an upcoming medical conference.","No matter how we have examined these results, they have provided us with compelling efficacy and safety data that have allowed us to commit to Phase III, which we plan to initiate early in 2013.","Our program has also provided the richness of data necessary to optimally determine the dose for both every 2-week and every four-week subcutaneous administration schedules.","Bob?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay. Thank you, Sean. Arvind, let's open it up for questions. And perhaps you could remind our friends of the guidelines for the Q&A session?","Arvind Sood","Yes, absolutely. Marvin, would you go ahead and review the procedure for asking questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just on a -- just a couple of financial questions on what looked like a strong quarter. Could you help us just to quantify some of the benefits of the accounting changes on the anemia franchise that you mentioned, that you called out in the press release. It would be helpful in just trying to get a little bit better sense of the quarter. And then again, I know you referenced it on the guidance raise, could you help us just to think through in terms of how much of the incremental profitability that you see in the second half of the year that you are going to reinvest in the business? Where is that going to go as we think about numbers for the second half of the year?","Robert A. Bradway","Sure, Marshall. Maybe I can take the second piece of that question, and then Jon can answer your specific question about the ESA reference. With respect to the second half, Marshall, remember in the first quarter we said, and on this call we've reiterated a couple of things about the second half: first that we're excited about the opportunity to be investing in the second half on a couple of innovative important pipeline programs that are advancing to Phase III. So that includes AMG 785, and then you've heard our remarks now as well on AMG 145. In addition, bear in mind when you think about the second half that Enbrel is performing very well this year. And as you know, the margins on Enbrel are different from some of our other products. And so that will be reflected when you look at the margins in the second half. But we continue to invest in Enbrel. We feel we are earning an attractive return on that, and in addition, we're pleased with the progress and the returns that we're earning on the denosumab launch globally. So we're excited about the first half of the year. We like the investment opportunities that are available to us and we're excited to see the momentum continue in the second half.","Jon, do you want to address Marshall's specific questions on the accounting?","Jonathan M. Peacock","Yes, and maybe I'll just also just remind Marshall that with our $3-billion debt offering in May, there will be a sort of an effect on interest expense in the second half of the year from that. But again, I'd just reiterate the comment that we will continue to maintain the discipline of ensuring that operating expenses grow at or below the level of revenue growth. On the question on EPOGEN in particular, I think we, in the press release, talked about the drivers of EPOGEN's performance during the quarter. There was some adjustment to Medicaid rebates. It was -- I think we mentioned 3 factors: our customer buying patterns and a low-single-digit point growth and underlying demand, but there was some Medicaid rebate adjustments. And that's something we do periodically. It wasn't a major factor for EPOGEN in the quarter, but it was part of the overall performance. But dose utilization, the reduction in discounts from the new contracts were the main factors, and the accounting estimate change was probably the smaller of those 3.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On AMG 145, Sean, I presume the initial Phase III investigation will be in special populations such as those studied in Phase II? Is that correct? Or do you view this as a broader-base replacement for statins as lipid-lowering agent? And then related, can you talk about the endpoints under consideration for Phase III? Interested not only from a clinical perspective, but also trying to understand the length of time before you might be able to file a BLA.","Sean E. Harper","So I appreciate the question. I think that the 145 program is one that is, of course, a very competitive space right now. And so we're not wanting to provide just yet a lot of detail around the Phase III program in terms of things such as endpoints and exact timing. I would answer your first question by saying that we really see the opportunity for this product being very squarely in the space of patients who, despite all available therapies, are not reaching their LDL cholesterol goals, and therefore, are walking around with markedly elevated cardiovascular risk. So I think it's hard to imagine why one would step away from, in many cases, a generic, very effective statin therapy if that were treating a patient sufficiently. But as you probably know, there are very large numbers of patients who are not getting to their goals despite the availability of such therapies.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm sorry if you covered it, but I'm not sure you did. I just was hoping you can give us the current inventory in -- across your major products? And Bob, just for you, just give us a little bit of a sense kind of, how do you see where you're going to be spending OpEx? I mean, it looks like you've been leaving -- making a lot of room to invest in 785 and PCSK9, which are going to be significant investments for you guys. So R&D, you're going to have your hands full. What about SG&A? Is there anything you could do to actually streamline operations or improve margins?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay. Thanks for the questions, Yaron. I know you've got a couple of different questions in there. We'll -- I'll ask Tony to address the inventory question in a moment. But with respect to OpEx, we did cover some of this, Yaron. I'm not sure whether you were on at the beginning of the Q&A. But looking to the second half of the year, you're right, we do expect to -- we're excited about the investments that we're going to make in 785 and 145. And in the first half of the year, obviously, our investment in R&D was lighter. That's consistent with traditional patterns for us as well. With respect to SG&A, bear in mind that Enbrel's performing particularly well. And as Enbrel performs well, you'll see that reflected in SG&A. But productivity improvement has become a way of life here, Yaron, and we're going to continue to look for productivity improvements across all of our businesses, so you should expect that to be a feature of the second half and beyond here. Tony, do you want to offer any comments to Yaron on the inventory for the quarter?","Anthony C. Hooper","So I think, as is always the case, Yaron, individual product movement can create noise on either a year-by-year or quarter-by-quarter basis in terms of grades. However, our wholesale inventory for our products in aggregate had no significant impact on our business in quarter 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Navdeep Singh - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's actually Navdeep substituting in for Robyn. Thanks for taking my question. Question on your pipeline now. You've highlighted your PCSK9 antibody in your introductory comments, and I was wondering how your molecule compares to the regenerants in alfa [ph] molecule? And are you expecting AMG 145 to be a monthly or biweekly? And a final part to that question is, are you expecting FDA or the EMEA to require cardiovascular trials?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay, there are a lot of questions wrapped up in that. And as Sean said earlier, the 145 -- AMG 145 or PCSK9 field is very competitive right now. There's a lot of interest in developments. We like the data, as Sean said, however we look at it. We feel compelled by the safety and efficacy data that we've seen in our large Phase II program. Sean answered a couple of the things that you asked in your question, so he can touch on those, I think. So, Sean, why don't you...","Sean E. Harper","Yes, I mean, it's obviously not possible to make comparisons between these agents that haven't been tested head-to-head against each other. The Q2 weekly and Q4 weekly program for our molecule is something that we anticipate carrying from Phase II into Phase III, and we think that's an important option for patients to have. The filing plans for the product at the present is to file based on LDL lowering as a surrogate endpoint. We also are anticipating a large cardiovascular outcomes trial to demonstrate the value of the product at the level of outcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","For Bob or Jonathan: Going back to April, when you laid out your capital redistribution policy, you talked about dividend being smaller elements of the return, but growing, you obviously made 1 set there. Can you just update us on the thoughts on how you want to grow that [indiscernible] in the medium term?","Robert A. Bradway","Yes. Ravi, as I said in my remarks, we're pleased with the progress we're making on our capital plan. As you know, we've increased the dividend. We're committed to continue to increase that dividend. And in addition, we're well into the $10-billion buyback that we announced as part of that program now last year. And so I expect we'll continue to make progress on the buying back front and then through time again, you should expect the dividend to increase.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A question on Sensipar. Now Mr. Seamus [ph] is proposing to implement hypoglycemia monitoring and also the performance of scores are going to be used to determine payments to dialysis centers. Do you think there's a very good chance that Sensipar may be excluded from oral bundling starting in 2014?","Robert A. Bradway","Eun, it's Bob. We had a little trouble hearing your question. I certainly caught the tail end of it, which was, you're asking whether we thought there was a chance that Sensipar could be excluded from the bundle. I think -- what we know is that Sensipar is an important medicine for patients on dialysis who are suffering from secondary hyperparathyroidism. It's a differentiated product, a product whose efficacy and safety profile I think is well understood. We don't know, at this point, so it would just be speculating hypothetically about how this may play out and whether it will be and when it will be included in the bundle. So rather than entertain that hypothetical question, why don't we wait and see how it plays out through time?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess it's a good problem to have, but it seems like you're getting perilously close to achieving your 2015 top line guidance and almost the bottom end of your bottom line guidance here, right this year, Bob. So in the absence of long-term estimates from the company, should we just continue to extrapolate at this rate? Or what are you thinking about the long-term? And when will we get an update on that guidance?","Robert A. Bradway","Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're not providing long-term guidance on this call. We did provide the updated guidance for 2012. We are making progress against the objectives that we established at our last Investor Day. And we'll look forward -- we're working with Arvind to find a date that works for all of you and for us, so we'll have an opportunity to refresh you on the goings-on at the company and the pipeline and the strategy and so forth. So for now, Eric, I'd say we're pleased with the progress that we're making against the 2015 objectives, and our guidance for 2012, now, I think for the second half of the year is also clear.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","2-part question, just on XGEVA, I'm wondering if you could size the opportunity in the prevention of SREs? And how far penetrated are you in that opportunity? And then the second part is just for the anti-sclerostin antibody, how do you see that positioning relative to Prolia and XGEVA?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay, Jim, thanks for the questions. We'll answer those. Let me ask Tony to talk to you about XGEVA. And then, Tony, perhaps, you'd like to pass to Sean to comment on the fit between sclerostin and Prolia?","Anthony C. Hooper","Okay, thank you. So XGEVA does, in fact, continue to be viewed as a very important and differentiated product by the oncology community, and its growth continues to be driven by both share gains and the overall SRE segment growth. In the U.S., the SRE market growth is about 27% year-on-year. And when I look at the second quarter, the XGEVA dollar share was about 50% and the unit share was about 33%, showing about a 3-point increase in market share quarter-on-quarter. Sean?","Sean E. Harper","Yes, I think from a medical perspective, what we're hoping for here with sclerostin is to fill a very important need, and that is for a bone anabolic agent that could be used in patients who have severe osteoporosis and are at high risk for fracture, followed then by an anti-resorptive therapy strategy with an agent such as Prolia. So we feel that these agents will be essentially complementary to one another. And imagine patients being treated with the anabolic therapy and then the gains that are rapidly accrued from that intervention being maintained by use of potent anti-resorptive agents such as Prolia.","Robert A. Bradway","Jim, as I've said before, one of the things that impresses us when we're engaging with physicians who are treating osteoporotic women is the degree of interest in an effective systemic anabolic agent. And so, we're excited about the Phase III trial that we have underway and excited about the data that we can generate to try and meet that unmet medical need.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on PCSK9, can you talk about strategically whether you'd be looking for a partnership or is that something that you plan to market alone, just thinking about the long term? And then just briefly, in terms of your funding, will you need to -- they said you've got a big debt you're maturing next year, so is that something that you need to fund with new debt?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay, thanks, Rachel. With respect to PCSK9, we -- we're very confident in the biology, very confident in the molecule that we developed, excited about the data we've seen. And so, we look forward to developing this molecule and helping it reach patients who need a therapy to help them get their LDL and cholesterol levels to -- within an acceptable range. So this is a molecule that we're excited about. We're prepared to bet on the biology behind it and I think our development plans are very clear. With respect to the funding, Jon can talk specifically about the maturing convertible that I think you're referring to.","Jonathan M. Peacock","Yes, we have a convertible that matures in February of next year. It's likely that we will refinance that convertible and we have a number of different routes to doing that and we'll be looking through the options over the next several months. But you should expect that we will be going to the market in some form to refinance that convertible by February of next year.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I'm sorry, Bob, just on PCSK9, I was asking more about your commercial strategy, not your development strategy. Is it...","Robert A. Bradway","We're not commenting on that now, Rachel. Again, what we're focused on is developing this molecule. We think the scientific and commercial opportunity are very attractive here. So right now we're focused on helping this product get through the clinic.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My question -- I'd like to ask something on your most important franchise, that nobody seems to actually ask about anymore. That's on your G-CSF franchise. Do you guys believe that Teva's lipeg- filgrastim, their long-acting G-CSF program, infringes on any of your patents? Or do you think that Teva has freedom to operate? And then just second question, I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on the dividend. Obviously, as your stock's gone, done so well this year, your yield has, of course, declined and many people now compare you to a large pharmaceutical group, which has a yield of around 4%. So I know you made some general statements about the mix there, but I'd love to hear your updated thoughts about how you're thinking about taking the dividend up over time?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay, Mark, again, 2 questions there, but we'll try to answer those for you. With respect to dividend, the remarks that we've made previously, I think, are the remarks we want to stand by, Mark, which is that we're managing the aggregate payout to our investors and we're delivering that payout through a combination of dividend and buyback. We're not trying to manage to a particular dividend yield, but our dividend has increased and we expect that we will continue to increase that dividend through time. With respect to G-CSF, you're right, that is an important franchise for us and an important franchise for patients. We're focused on continuing to grow the franchise, particularly with Neulasta. We're very focused on the competitive -- of the outlook for competition for that franchise, not just here in the U.S., but globally. As you know, we are -- we have consistently demonstrated that we have the will and the skill to defend our intellectual property, and you should expect that we'll do that with respect to our G-CSF franchise as well as our other franchises. And finally, I would just remind you, Mark, that Neulasta is about 80% of our worldwide Filgrastim business.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And their G-CSF is long-acting.","Robert A. Bradway","Correct, yes.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Is -- does that infringe on your patents?","Robert A. Bradway","Well, as I've said, Mark, we -- you should expect that we will assert our IP rights, and to the extent that they infringe, you should expect that we'll deal with that through the appropriate channel.","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bob, on your long-term guidance, with regard to your OUS or emerging market presence, you guys have done a few deals of late. I'm just curious what the level of comfort with your exposure is today. Are you still looking at having a significant presence by 2015? And do you think your prior strategy of smaller deals will fit going forward, as your revenues is, obviously, going to go a lot higher by then?","Robert A. Bradway","Sure. I'll answer that, Geoff, and I'll ask Tony to offer a few thoughts as well. Our objective by 2015 is to have a direct operating presence in 75 markets and we're well on our way to achieving that. And now we're in some 56 markets, I guess. Today, we identified a few of the emerging markets, in particular, as being important strategically to us and markets where we would entertain the prospects of acquisitions like what we've done in Brazil and Turkey. And those markets included Brazil, Russia, where we've entered into a partnership with a local entity to manufacture a product there and then the other important markets: China, Turkey, Mexico, South Korea and India. And so we'll continue to look for opportunities. I think it's likely that if we do anything strategically, it will be along the lines of what we've done with Bergamo in Brazil and Mustafa Nevzat in Turkey. Tony, do you want to add any color to our longer-term prospects and objectives internationally?","Anthony C. Hooper","All right. Just to confirm that in Brazil and Turkey, we've more than quadrupled our presence based on the acquisitions. The acquisitions are not only valuable for the market themselves, but for the surrounding regions as well as we establish our presence. Having just spent some time in the Far East, again, just reconfirming that we have huge opportunity for growth from a baseline of nothing in both Japan and China. So we'll continue to focus our efforts on these large markets to drive the top line and to establish our presence outside U.S. and outside Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Enbrel, could you just give us a breakdown? Strong sequential growth in year-over-year. On the growth versus prior year, what percent was volume, price and how are you doing on share?","Robert A. Bradway","Sure, Geoff, thanks for the question. Tony, why don't you give that response to Geoff?","Anthony C. Hooper","Okay. So let me just start by reminding you again that after 14 years of being in the market, Enbrel, in dollar terms, continues to be the market leader in both rheumatology and dermatology. Our price has been a significant contributor to our growth in the next -- last year or so. The markets, however, are growing fast, and what I see as very exciting, based on the increased investment we have, is the constant increase in the market share of new -- or patients new to biologics, both in the dermatology area as well as the rheumatology area. And new patient acquisition, to me, is the future where the brand is growing, so I'm delighted to see that pickup and to see that growth. As you know, we've also strengthened our sales force support by consolidating the sales forces in the U.S. under the Amgen umbrella. We've expanded our team effort and our DTC campaigns with Phil Mickelson, together with our new-launched dermatology campaign, continue to show increase as we go forward.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Sorry, Tony, was it all priced in or was there volume increase in that 10% year-over-year?","Anthony C. Hooper","There was a small volume increase, but predominantly price.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question on Epo. When you look at the numbers this quarter, you did suggest that there was actual volume growth as well as obviously a lot of buying pattern changes. But if you -- if there was really volume growth quarter-over-quarter, do you basically think that we've essentially hit the bottom? And I'm looking at -- consensus numbers are all over the place, but generally down. So do you think we're near or at the bottom?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay, Michael, I understand. It's an interesting question. But Tony, why don't you talk a little bit about what we see on dosing and try to help Michael get a sense for the dynamics of the Epo market right now?","Anthony C. Hooper","Okay. So as I've said in my introductory remarks, the quarter-on-quarter growth is confusing. But when we look underneath that, we actually see an underlying unit growth of about 2%. We do see that H1B has settled at about 10.7% for the last 2 months or so. I look at March and April. We're waiting for the May data now. And we also see less variability in the actual dose itself over time. It's difficult to predict whether this is where the market will land, but it has been stable for a couple of months now.","Robert A. Bradway","Michael, there's been some focus and some writing in the analyst community about the increased rate of transfusions. And I know some folks on that via regulators and payers as well. And while none of us have the data yet, clearly, we think that part of the rebound we saw was a response to the fact that hemoglobin levels were dropped and transfusion rates were increasing in some places, and so, our current dosing seems to have been stabilized following that trend in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just one question on -- also on EPOGEN. Just kind of curious if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on exactly what this Medicaid rebate artifact was in the quarter? And what's the last thing of factor, is there any sort of thing you have to think about in terms of a reversal or anything in the impact in the second half? That'd be great.","Jonathan M. Peacock","Yes, maybe I'll just pick that one up, Chris. I think what we did say was that the overall trend was driven by predominantly dose utilization and the pricing changes that we put in place at the beginning of the year. And there was some impact from this, what we referred to as accounting estimate. We estimate the Medicaid rebates that are due and accrue those on a quarter-to-quarter basis. As those claims come in, we adjust our accrued rebate based on the actual claims that come in. So we adjust as we go. The amount was not significant in context of the other drivers and we'll continue to adjust up or down based on the experience that we see in terms of the actual claims coming in, but this should become smaller and smaller as our experience of the actual claims build.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just had a question on the -- on Enbrel and maybe a larger question on the autoimmune franchise. Can you just give us your thoughts on the impending competition from orals and how you plan to offset that? Is the strategy, continue to be reliant on Enbrel? Are there oral development candidates that you have in-house or are there ones that you have identified potential licensing opportunities?","Robert A. Bradway","Sure, Ian, I'll take the question. We're obviously excited about the performance of Enbrel. We're encouraged by the 14-plus-year track record that Tony referred to, which enables us to have a very clear safety and efficacy track record for the product. We expect to continue to compete against other anti-inflammatory agents, whether they're injectable, infusible or oral. I think you're probably referring to the prospect of an oral jack being approved later in the year. Rather than talk hypothetically about competition from AKKA [ph] that hasn't yet been approved, what I, again, would reiterate is that we remain encouraged about the long-term outlook for Enbrel and for the benefit that it provides the patients who are suffering from inflammation. More generally, Ian, as I hope you would expect, we are very active on the business development front, continuing to look at and have looked very closely historically at anti-TNFs -- and again, oral and a wide range of different products. And as we've said on many occasions, the bar established by Enbrel is a high one and we have found it difficult to find molecules that offer superior efficacy and prospect of superior safety as compared to Enbrel. But we are and we will continue to look for ways to extend our leadership in the anti-inflammatory space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joel D. Sendek - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had a question on the EPOGEN franchise also. I'm just wondering how much of a threat you view the Amantys [ph] drug to be? And if they do manage to take some share, would you be prepared to discount in order to retain the share that you have?","Robert A. Bradway","Joel, thanks for your question. Obviously, we're very conscious that the competitive landscape for EPOGEN is evolving, and as with Enbrel, where we have a long established track record, we have an even longer established track record with EPOGEN. We think EPOGEN serves well the needs of the dialysis community, both from the standpoint of providers and patients. But we take seriously the prospect of any competition, and that includes the recently approved product that competes against EPOGEN. So we continue to watch developments in this market very carefully. But having said that, we also feel confident about what we offer patients and payers and customers with our EPOGEN product. Tony, do you want to add anything to that?","Anthony C. Hooper","No, I think the only thing I would add was, I can say, after 20 years of being in the market, working together with the dialysis providers to ensure we provide optimal care to patients on dialysis, it's the clinical value of the product, it's the experience of the product and that is where we focus in terms of defending our brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Boris Peaker with Oppenheimer.","Boris Peaker - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just had a general question. You mentioned that you benefited from DTC advertising in the quarter and I think across several of your products. How much room do you see there is to grow your advertising campaign, and particularly, that some of your competitors are also going through the DTC route in the rheumatoid arthritis space as well as maybe some other spaces?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay, Boris. Yes, we've been obviously investing, and we're pleased with the returns we're seeing for Enbrel and Prolia. But, Tony, if you want to offer any specific comments to Boris' question, go on and jump in.","Anthony C. Hooper","So ultimately, the success of all our DTC came -- campaigns is measured through sales growth. In the case of Enbrel, where we've been doing some DTC for some time, we are confident that they're impactful and we see the impact in their share trends as well. So as we evaluate the ROI on an ongoing basis, we're consistently looking to tweak and to adjust and to make sure we're maximizing the return on investment.","Robert A. Bradway","Okay, Marvin, let's take one last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Very simple one. Sean, you may have said it, and I apologize, but the -- at ASBMR, can you discern what you will -- what you believe you will present on 785? I assume the PMO data will be there, but what I'm most interested in is fracture healing. Will that also contain Phase II data there at that meeting?","Sean E. Harper","Yes, the Phase II PMO data will be at the fall ASBMR. I actually don't know the answer to whether we're intending to have any fracture healing data there. I do not believe so, but I'd have to check with the team to be sure.","Arvind Sood","Okay. Thanks, Sean. Listen, let me thank everybody for your participation in our call this afternoon. If you have any questions, comments, obviously, myself and the rest of the Investor Relations team will be around for the next several hours. So I look forward to having that discussion.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Excellent. Thanks Ian. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We have a lot of ground to cover, so I'll keep my comments brief.","Continued execution, launch progress, and pipeline advancement are some key themes that come to mind as I think about our third quarter results. To elaborate on these themes and more, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO. After Bob's strategic review, our CFO David Meline will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated guidance for 2018. Also joining us today is Tony Hooper, and then you'll get to hear from Murdo Gordon, our newly appointed Head of Global Commercial Operations. Following Murdo's review of product performance, our Head of R&D, David Reese will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides to guide our discussion today and a link to those slides was sent separately.","My customary reminder that we will use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bradway","Okay Arvind, thank you.","On today's call I'll provide an overview of our performance in Q3, speak to the progress we're making in delivering our strategy for long-term growth, and share some thoughts on the current healthcare environment.","Let me start by acknowledging that while we're in the midst of a period of high volatility driven by a variety of macro and political factors, our fundamental objectives of innovating for the benefit of patients and delivering for shareholders remain intact and unchanged.","Looking to the future, there are bound to be headwinds but we're confident in our ability to navigate them from a position of strength. You see evidence of that strength reflected once again this quarter in our healthy balance sheet, strong cash flows, and efficient cost structure.","We've said for some time that we expected growing pressures on drug prices in our industry. We can all see that plainly today. With price under pressure, having innovative products which can deliver volume growth by meeting the needs of large numbers of patients is ever more important.","We have several such products and you can see the benefit of this in the third quarter where our new and recently launched products had double-digit unit volume growth. We believe differentiated products like Prolia, Repatha and Aimovig offer attractive long-term growth prospects.","Prolia continues to build strength globally and there continues to be large untapped potential in the area of osteoporosis. With Repatha, we're taking steps to open up access and improve patient affordability to this important therapy.","Our announcements this past week are significant and reflect our commitment to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients especially in Medicare in order to help ensure that patients who need Repatha get Repatha.","Our new product story continues to unfold with Aimovig and migraine prevention. I'm sure it's not lost in you that Aimovig is off to a very strong start and in fact is shaping up to be one of the industry's most successful recent launches reflecting the pent-up demand that exists in this area.","People suffering from migraine and their physicians have been waiting for years for an effective new therapy and they've reacted very well to Aimovig. We believe biosimilars can be an important growth driver for us as well as we\u2019re now launching KANJINTI, a biosimilar Herceptin and AMGEVITA, a biosimilar to Humira internationally.","Our innovative pipeline is moving very quickly. As you know, we aim to allocate capital to R&D where we believe we have innovative first-in-class molecules with the potential for large effect sizes and serious diseases. Over the past few months, we've introduced seven such programs into the clinic. Dave Reese will talk more about these in a moment.","From a capital allocation standpoint, we've continued with our share buyback and dividend increases and will continue to take a disciplined approach to business development where we believe we can create value for Amgen's shareholders.","Turning to the political policy environment for drugs in the U.S. this obviously remains very topical we don't expect this to end anytime soon. We remain committed to working with the administration and elected officials to advanced market-based reforms that will promote competition and improve access to new therapies without undermining our nation's innovative ecosystem.","The U.S. leads the world and discover new cures and treatments for serious diseases. We believe our society benefits from embracing this innovation. If our objective is to lower healthcare costs and improve population health and productivity, what we need is more innovation and not less and we need a system that ensures access to it.","Let me end by thanking our staff for their efforts this past quarter. I know they're working hard to finish the year on a strong note and I'm grateful to their dedication and for their dedication or for their dedication to our mission.","Let me turn over to David","David Meline ","Okay, thanks Bob.","Overall we are encouraged by our strong results and earnings in the third quarter. I'm pleased that our transformation efforts continue to enable both investment in our business and delivery of double-digit earnings per share growth as we navigate our portfolio transition.","Turning to the financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck. Worldwide revenue at $5.9 billion in the third quarter grew 2% year-over-year. Worldwide product sales at $5.5 billion in the third quarter grew 1% year-over-year, as strong unit volume growth in our new and recently launched products outpaced declines in our mature brands.","We continue to experience good volume growth in Europe at 13% in the quarter reflecting the value of our innovative products in a market where we've experienced biosimilar competition and portfolio transition for several years. Other revenues at $394 million increased $74 million year-over-year primarily due to a milestone payment received related to our Aimovig partnership with Novartis.","As communicated earlier this year, we continue to expect full-year other revenues to grow 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income at 3 billion declined 2% from prior year non-GAAP operating margin was 53.9% for the third quarter as we continue incremental investments in our products and pipeline to drive growth and maximize shareholder value.","On a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased by 0.3 points to 13.8% driven by higher manufacturing costs partially offset by lower royalty cost and the impact of Hurricane Maria related charges in Q3 of 2017.","Research and development expenses at $906 million or 16% of product sales increased 6% versus last year. SG&A expenses increased 11% on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by investments in product launches and marketed products support. In aggregate third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year.","Other income and expenses were a net $222 million expense in Q3 this is unfavorable by $164 million on a year-over-year basis due to timing of portfolio rebalancing and liquidation of marketable securities and a lower cash balance versus Q3 of 2017. The non-GAAP tax rate was 13% for the quarter a 6.4 point decrease versus the third quarter of 2017.","Due to the impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform as well as a estate settlement received this quarter. Third quarter non-GAAP net income at $2.4 billion was flat year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 13% year-over-year for the third quarter to $3.69 per share.","Turning to next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. The company generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2018 versus $3.3 billion in the third quarter 2017 driven by timing of tax payments. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders consistent with our commitment to deploy excess cash over time. Reflecting an 11% year-over-year reduction in average share count in Q3 we deployed 1.7 billion repurchase 8.7 million shares at an average of $196 per share.","Further we have over $3 billion remaining under our current authorization which we will continue to deploy opportunistically. Lastly our third quarter dividend increase to $1.32 per share an increase of 15% over last year. Cash and investments totaled $29.9 billion a decrease of $11.5 billion from the third quarter of last year.","This decrease over the last 12 months was primarily driven by $20 billion of cash return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks partially offset by over $10 million of free cash flow generated in the same period. Our total gross debt balance stands at $34.4 billion as of September 30, 2018 carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and average maturity of 11.5 years.","Turning next to the outlook for the business for 2018 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing in our pipeline building out our global presence and increasing spend in support of long-term volume growth across large patient populations. While delivering solid business performance.","Our revised 2018 guidance is driven by strong business performance over the first three quarters of the year our confidence in solid performance in the fourth quarter and continued conviction in our strategy. Our latest revenue guidance is $23.2 billion to $23.5 billion versus previous guidance of $22.5 billion to $23.2 billion for revenue. The high-end of our range assumes no sense of our generic competition for the remainder of 2018.","Regarding our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance we're revising the outlook to $14 to $14.25 per share versus previous guidance of $13.30 to $14. As a reminder, we expect Q4 total operating expense to increase 12% to 15% quarter over quarter reflecting the typical pattern for the business. We are really affirming our prior non-GAAP tax guidance of 13.5% to 14.5% and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.","In summary, we're pleased that are 2018 performance remains on track as we continue investing to grow the business. We\u2019ll provide 2019 guidance on our January call.","This concludes the financial update, I now turn the call over to Murdo.","Murdo Gordon","Thanks David.","I\u2019m excited to join such a special company and my early experience here has been extremely positive. I have been impressed by the highly talented people at Amgen along with a culture that is patient focused. Amgen has tremendous opportunity with highly innovative and unique products a tradition of strong science, a rich pipeline and now commercially available biosimilars that will benefit large numbers of patients.","Now on to the Q3 performance and you'll find information on our product sales starting on slide 10. I'm pleased to report that despite increasing competition, we continue to deliver volume driven sales growth in 2018 similar to the prior quarters our international operations delivered 11% sales growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange which was driven by 15% volume growth.","If I turn to brand performance beginning with Prolia, we delivered another outstanding quarter with sales increasing 15% year-over-year with 16% volume growth from share gains in both the U.S. and internationally. Repeat injection rates in the U.S. remain especially strong at over 70% if you recall we do see some seasonality with Prolia demand which held true in the third quarter this year.","Osteoporotic fractures represent a large burden for patients and can be very expensive to treat and results in more hospitalizations than heart attack, strokes and breast cancer. By 2025 fragility fractures are expected to cost $25 billion in the U.S. Prolia is a novel biologics developed to address this large unmet need and it's priced very competitively.","Moving to our oncology product starting with KYPROLIS which grew 12% year on year driven primarily by growth in our ex U.S. business. As you recall from the previous quarter there was a benefit to sales due to a clinical trial purchase in Q2 which did not repeat in Q3. Our team in the U.S. is diligently executing in a strategy of emphasizing KYPROLIS overall survival benefit and throughout the third quarter we've seen both new patient and total patient shares gradually increasing.","In addition on October 1, we received approval from the FDA to expand the label to include a more convenient once weekly dosing option for KYPROLIS. This demonstrates Amgen's commitment to continued evidence generation and innovation to serve patients. Furthermore Amgen is committed to providing patients with next-generation innovative medicines to treat multiple myeloma and Dave Reese will have more to say about that in his R&D update.","XGEVA grew 12% year-over-year primarily from volume as we expanded into multiple myeloma with our label update earlier this year. We continue to receive positive feedback from physicians and institutions and continue to grow share in that segment.","Turning to Neulasta sales decreased 6% year-over-year, the decline was driven by lower net selling price and lower unit demand due to biosimilar competition we now face in the U.S. market. We observed a small decline in segment share and as we seen for the past few quarters a slight reduction in the overall market segment in the third quarter.","Onpro continues to represent a majority of Neulasta sales of greater than 60% share in the U.S. We continue to believe Onpro drives a better patient experience and better appearance to therapy which leads to lower rates of febrile neutropenia and hospitalizations. For several years, we've been preparing for a day when biosimilar competition to Neulasta receives approval and launches, One biosimilar is in the market and we anticipate several more by the end next year which will pressure Neulasta sales.","We\u2019ll continue to compete account by account and we\u2019ll remain confident that our experience in the long-acting G-CSF segment and establish record of quality and dependable supply will serve as well. For NEUPOGEN, we exited the third quarter holding 35% share of the short acting segment in the U.S.","As expected by biosimilars continued to gain share over time and pricing pressure continues to intensify. Regarding Nplate, Vectibix, IMLYGIC and BLINCYTO, while smaller individually they combine to deliver sales of $432 million in the quarter, up 10% year-over-year with 13% volume growth.","Moving now to Enbrel. Sales declined 5% year-over-year with the underlying fundamentals in both rheumatology and dermatology segments consistent with recent trends. This was offset by some favorable accounting adjustments. After 20 years on the market our commitment to patients and investment in the brand continues with positive completion of the SEAM-PsA study, the recent launch of our innovative delivery system, the Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch and an improved formulation. Overall we expect the fundamental trends in volume share and net selling price to continue.","Switching to our ESA portfolio, EPOGEN declined 5% year-over-year due to lower net selling price in a category that is becoming increasingly competitive. With the potential launch of a biosimilar in the U.S. we would expect a further decline in that selling price. Aranesp declined 8% year-over-year primarily driven by increased competition from a long acting product in the independent and mid-sized dialysis organizations.","Slide 20, provides a breakout by segment of our ESA business which provides clarity on the size of each and performance within. Assuming that the approved deport in biosimilar launched in all segments, we're prepared to compete.","Turning now to calcimimetics. Parsabiv has launched in several markets including the U.S. where we continue to see strong uptake at independent and mid-sized dialysis providers. Fresenius and DaVita are gradually increasing adoption. Parsabiv continues to deliver clinical benefits to patients by putting control in the hands of the healthcare provider which could also drive an improved level of patient adherence.","Turning to Sensipar, sales declined 11% year-over-year with the launch of Parsabiv. The outlook for Sensipar are still uncertain given ongoing litigation. It remains possible that generic competition may enter the market at risk. Shifting gears from our innovative product portfolio, we're pleased to have launched our first commercial biosimilar products in Europe. We're excited to have launched KANJINTI, a biosimilar version of Herceptin, and earlier this month we launched AMGEVITA, Amgen's biosimilar to Humira, across a number of European countries.","We have eight additional biosimilar programs in development and we expect this business to be an important growth driver for years to come. Repatha grew by 35% year-over-year as we continue to compete effectively with a leading share in the PCSK9 class of 62% in the U.S. and 57% in Europe. Regarding our U.S. business, we've made strong progress to improve patient access to Repatha. Despite the strides that we've made in making Repatha available to all patients who could benefit from therapy, too many of them face significant hurdles due to high copay expenses.","In light of this, last week we made an important decision to improve the access and affordability of Repatha especially for Medicare Part D patients, who represent 65% of the market. We've launched a new NDC at a list price of $5,850 which was the only viable option to reduce out-of-pocket cost for Medicare patients as their copay is calculated from the list price. This should substantially lower their out-of-pocket costs and lower the abandonment rate which is as high as 75%. Not only is this good for patients but it's also necessary to compete.","Although the lower price may impact Repatha sales near term, as plans update we expect to see a positive impact on volume growth as this important therapy becomes more accessible and affordable for many more patients. Regarding our ex-U.S. business, we continue to maintain a majority share and continue to work with country authorities to optimize access.","Overall our priority remains to help the large population of high-risk cardio vascular patients. The cost to society of not treating these patients is unacceptable and we continue to investigate all avenues to improve access for appropriate high-risk patients around the world.","Now moving to aim Aimovig, which represents one of the strongest launches that I've seen in my experience in this industry both within this therapeutic area and even more broadly. We've been further energized by the remarkable response from physician and patient communities due to the launch of this innovative therapy. As of the third week of October, over 12,000 healthcare professionals prescribe Aimovig resulting in over 100,000 patients starting Aimovig since launch.","The services that we set up to assist patients in gaining early access to the product have been working to resolve requests from the sizeable pent up demand in the market. As we've addressed the initial bolus of patient demand we expect prescription activity to moderate and normalize over the coming weeks. Since our launch, two additional products have gained approval in the U.S. and we feel confident in our ability to compete with Aimovig's differentiated product profile.","We have our first mover advantage. And in addition Aimovig is the first and only preventive migraine treatment that specifically blocks the receptor to CGRP. Aimovig is delivered in a simple once monthly does with an easy to use SureClick autoinjector. However, current aided awareness among patients for whom Aimovig would be appropriate still remains low at just above 10%. And given the debilitating nature of migraine, we've extended our patient education campaign through direct-to-consumer television advertising in the first part of Q4.","As we exit the third quarter with favorable approval rates reflecting the manageable utilization management levels and copay levels that have been established as a result of our having priced Aimovig for access. Due to our initial success with access, patients are rapidly moved to commercial coverage. Migraine is a debilitating condition that continues to have a significant lasting impact on the lives of patients in society at large. Aimovig offers a new opportunity to these previously under serve patients and their loved ones to lead more normal lives.","In summary, we continue to transition to a portfolio exemplified by volume driven growth. I'm pleased with the execution and consistency of performance in 2018, and I'm excited about the opportunities in front of Amgen. So let me close by once again thanking the many hard working employees of Amgen for all they do for our patients each and every day.","I'd like to thank one of our most patient focused employees, and that's Tony Hooper, who after a very successful tenure as Head of Commercial, here at Amgen, is handing over a very well run in organization. Tony has been generous of his time in transitioning the commercial leadership role to me and I'm extremely grateful for his guidance and support.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave Reese.","David Reese","Thanks Murdo.","As Bob mentioned, we are entering an extremely exciting phase in R&D including seven new early stage clinical programs. Six of these are within our oncology therapeutic area and I will begin my remarks there. Starting with our bispecific T-cell engager platform.","AMG 427 is a half-life extended BiTE the targets FLT3, a receptor that is expressed in almost all AML cells. Activating FLT3 mutations and over expression of wild type FLT3 are both associated with poor prognosis in AML patients. In contrast to small molecule inhibitors of mutant FLT3, AMG 427 targets both mutant and wild type forms of the receptor. Also in AML, we began enrolling a Phase 1 study earlier this year with AMG 673, our extended half life CD33 BiTE, and we look forward to the opportunity to present the first in human data from our first generation CD33 by AMG 330 later this year.","Having BiTEs directed against different targets on AML cells is core to our strategy of using combination or sequential therapy to eradicate the disease which occurs in about 20,000 patients in the U.S. each year. Likewise in multiple myeloma, our goal is to transform the disease through the generation of deep durable responses and ultimately achieve a functional cure by using highly effective combinations of drugs.","One foundational element is cut Kyprolis, which is a potent proteasome inhibitor as demonstrated by the superior efficacy of Kyprolis containing regimens against standards of care including overall survival, the gold standard in oncology. As Murdo mentioned, the approval of the weekly Kyprolis regimen provides a more convenient dosing regimen of this highly potent therapy which we hope will help serve more patients.","In addition to Kyprolis, we have a portfolio of high potential myeloma therapeutics including two that just entered the clinic. First, our CD38 bispecific antibody AMG 424 developed in collaboration with the Xencor. And second, our oral Mcl-1 inhibitor AMG 397, which we are pursuing in multiple myeloma as well as non Hodgkin's lymphoma and AML. You will recall that our first-in-class IV administered small molecule MCL1 inhibitor is also progressing through Phase 1.","Finally, we are very excited about our BCMA BiTE program where our extended half life molecule AMG 701 continues to enroll in Phase 1 and we are very much looking forward to the opportunity to present the initial clinical data from our first generation BCMA BiTE AMG 420 at a medical conference in the fourth quarter.","Turning to precision oncology, RAS is the most frequently mutated human oncogene but has been un-druggable for 35 years. Therefore, we are very excited to move the first KRAS G12C inhibitor into the clinic with AMG 510. Another first-in-class clinical program is AMG 119, our CAR T directed against DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. This now gives us the unique ability to evaluate our BiTE and CAR T DLL3 programs in parallel, which will allow us to explore the optimal utilization of these therapies in small cell lung cancer, an area of significant unmet medical need.","And finally, we are dosing our first patient today with AMG 562 a half-life extended version of our CD 19 BiTE BLINCYTO. This is a unique time at Amgen with a number of high potential first-in-class programs advancing through the oncology pipeline. We have designed these development programs to rapidly establish proof-of-concept and then move into the pivotal phase, so that we may get these innovative therapies to patients as quickly as possible.","I would note that we are hosting an Investor Relations event at the upcoming ASH meeting in San Diego on Monday night, December 3, at 8:00 PM, where we will share more on these exciting programs and I hope to see many of you there in person.","Turning to our other therapeutic areas. In our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, we continue to expect Phase 2 results from AMG 301, our PAC1 receptor antibody for migraine prevention by year-end for a presentation at a medical conference in 2019. In cardiovascular medicine, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 1 study of AMG 890, a novel Lp(a) small interfering RNA therapy, elevated Lp(a) is strongly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of LDL cholesterol, it has remained largely unmodifiable.","In our collaboration with Cytokinetics, the Phase 3 outcome study for omecamtiv mecarbil continues to briskly enroll heart failure patients, reflecting the enthusiasm for this approach. We also recently filed an IND for AMG 594, a novel troponin activator for the treatment of heart failure. We look forward to advancing AMG 594 into the clinic in the near future.","In our inflammation collaboration with AstraZeneca, our novel first-in class Tezepelumab program targets TSLP an upstream modulator of multiple inflammatory pathways continues to progress with our Phase 3 study in severe uncontrolled asthma enrolling well. The potential for Tezepelumab to address significant unmet need was recognized by the FDA by granting breakthrough therapy designation for patients with severe asthma without an eosinophilic phenotype.","Finally, our biosimilar programs continue to advance. We are preparing our US and EU regulatory submissions for ABP 710, our biosimilar Remicade which we expect to occur by the first quarter of next year. We have also achieved global alignment on the study design for ABP 959, our biosimilar Soliris and are now in start-up of the Phase 3 pivotal study.","I'll end my update there and close by thanking all of my colleagues here at Amgen who worked so hard to advance medicines that can make a real difference in the lives of patients. Bob?","Robert Bradway","Okay. Thank you, David.","As Arvind noted earlier, Tony Hooper is on the call with us and now he will be at Amgen beyond year-end. This will be his last quarterly earnings call with us. This is a ritual, who has been part of his life for the past 13 years, so Tony before we start Q&A, is there anything you want to say to the listeners?","Tony Hooper","Well, Bob, thank you very much indeed. Good afternoon, folks. For those of you who have now listened to Murdo twice in the last week or so, I'm sure you understand why we're so excited about him joining the executive team with Amgen. He does bring with him decades of successful commercial experience in many of the therapeutic areas that Amgen participates in. He also bring a set of fresh set of eyes to our efforts, our mission and will help lead Amgen on to the next stage of its journey.","As Bob mentioned in our second quarter call, one of the hallmarks of a well run company is the carefully considered succession planning process. Murdo and I are executing an orderly and planned transition, unrelentingly involved to ensure that nothing falls for the tracks, so that Murdo can rapidly focus on growing revenue and defending the legacy brands. I'd like to also take this opportunity to thank all the Amgen staff that I had the pleasure to work with over my seven years at Amgen.","We got a group that sets tough goals and then delivers them. They have a passion for serving patients that is beyond words. They are also one of the most competitive groups I've ever had the pleasure to work with. I'd also like to thank those analysts and investors on the call today for interactions over the years. Your challenges and your guidances have always been appreciated. Thank you very much.","Robert Bradway","Okay, thank you. With that, why don't we turn it over to the Q&A. And Ian, if you just remind our callers of the process that we use for that purpose. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Thanks very much for taking the question. I appreciate it. I wanted to ask a question about biosimilars, if I could. So could you maybe just comment a little bit on how you view the outlook for biosimilars in Europe? Obviously, we've seen some recent TNF launches. But the Humira launches, it's fairly competitive. And I'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit more in detail about how you view the outlook and how you view the competitive dynamics in that market? Thanks.","Robert Bradway","Early days still. But we like, what we see so far. As you know, we've launched our two products KANJINTI and AMGEVITA, as we said we're in early days, but so far so good. So we have portfolio of eight other molecules advancing through the clinic, and we look forward to launching those internationally as well. Murdo, any incremental thoughts from you, well?","Murdo Gordon","Yes, we've got more experience, obviously with KANJINTI, having being in the market for a longer period in time, we've done quite well through a series of tender processes with particular strength in Germany. I think it's a little too early to tell with AMGEVITA, but we have obviously seen competitive activity and it will be a competitive process, but the team on the ground is very strong.","The other thing to think about with the biosimilars portfolio for Amgen is, particularly as it relates to some of the oncology biosimilars in our portfolio is, we will be embedding them alongside our innovative portfolio and we'll be able to explain the benefits of the Amgen quality and dependable supply to providers and reimbursement authorities around the world.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","A question for Murdo and perhaps Bob. I know it's early days in the seat. But I wanted to get Murdo, your preliminary thoughts on strategies to grow Amgen OUS business, how much of a broader priority is this? I'm just asking because it's a much smaller component of the revenue base versus peers, but you do have asset now that can be foundational to growing OUS more broadly. Thank you.","Robert Bradway","We will take the answer in two parts Geoff, I'll kick off. As you know, we've been able to demonstrate double-digit volume growth now quarter-after-quarter in international markets and I think that reflects the recognition of the value of our of our new products, and we do expect international growth to be an important part of our long-term strategy for delivering that to our shareholders. And again, I think it's still early days for us in particular in Asia and some of the other emerging markets, but so far, we're encouraged by the results. Murdo?","Murdo Gordon","Yes, I would echo the same remarks, Bob, and I would just add a few good events that have happened for us with approval of Repatha in China. We have a great partnership in Japan with our partners Astellas, and we look forward to expanding beyond that in 2020.","We have great businesses across Europe, Canada, Australia and emerging businesses in the rest of the world and it is as it was Tony's focus, it will be my focus to continue to grow our business ex-U.S. and make the innovations from Amgen's R&D pipeline available in those markets. So we've gone from 42 countries to 102. That's a good sized footprint for a company our size and affords us an opportunity to expand outside of the U.S.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang","So maybe Bob you can give us a little more color, given the recent proposal from Trump administration on the reform on Medicare Part B. What can Amgen do to mitigate potentially the negative impact?","And then secondly I have a question on Aimovig. Given the apparent lack of differentiation clinical data so far, how do you position Aimovig against the other two competing therapies to market for 2019 contract negotiation? Thank you.","Robert Bradway","Okay. Again, we'll take this in two parts. One on I'll start with the, your question about the political environment and then kick it to Murdo to respond to your question about Aimovig. With respect to the proposal, I could think I'd start with your question, which is that at this point, it is just a proposal. We expect it will be quite a bit of interest in trying to help shape the eventual outcome of that, but our objective and our commitment is to continue to work with the administration and congress to try to improve the competitiveness and access for innovative drugs in our system, and that includes in Part B.","We think there are some things that can be done to eliminate unnecessary cost and friction in the system and make sure the patients who need innovative therapies can get them, and we will continue to advance those ideas in our discussions in Washington. But again, it just would underscores a proposal at this point and there will be plenty of time to see the proposal take shape.","Murdo you want to address the question, starting with the comment that there is no differentiation between the products?","Murdo Gordon","Well, yes. As I said in my prepared remarks, the launch of Aimovig has been a fantastic success. We have seen very good provider payer and patient response to our launch. And as I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, Aimovig is indeed the only receptor antagonist for - to CGRP.","We're also hearing really good feedback on the fact that there is no loading dose and that payer approvals have been quite good so far. So about 70% payer approval rate for a new product in a symptomatic category and that's a really, really strong signal to us that payers do indeed want to approve them, want to pay for these agents.","You've seen that we've been able to secure coverage at least with one large PBM with ESI and we're working through the rest, but I continue to believe that being a first mover in this category and having over 100,000 patients initiated so far, having a really strong program to bridge patients from initiation to secured reimbursement through their insurer.","And having 12,000 physicians having tried the product to-date puts us in a really strong position to work with payers to make sure that reimbursement for this product is both differentiated and open.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","I recognize you don't want to give 2019 guidance until January, but just wondering, Dave, if you can walk us through maybe the puts and takes for both the top line and margins that we should think about as we look at our models here. And then just a high level expectations for pricing dynamics in 2019, should we expect something similar to what we saw this year? Thank you.","David Meline","So as I said, we'll offer formal guidance in January, but in terms of the contributors to performance next year, I guess I would start by pointing out that the company, we've got running in a very efficient manner right now given the work that we've done to improve our competitiveness over the last several years. And we are continuing to challenge ourselves and we've put in place a continuous improvement program where we're going to get incremental productivity, which will help us to fund what is a very exciting pipeline of opportunities that are developing.","The second thing I'd mention is that we do continue to increase our investment in support of the new products. Most recently Aimovig, most recently also continuing to build out, as was the question around international, which is an investment that we are committed to an ongoing basis.","And then finally, if I look at the revenue side of the business, we're encouraged by the ongoing double-digit growth that we're seeing in our new product portfolio. And of course, we have a fair amount of uncertainty now about on the legacy side, what is going to be the path of competition and the timing, in particular as it relates to Neulasta and eventually Sensipar. So that's an open question that we'll see by January we'll have incremental information on those and we'll be able to share with you our guidance at the time.","But overall, we think the business we've established a nice run rate in terms of profitability and margins and we'll continue to seek to optimize that while making sure we're not missing any opportunities to invest.","Robert Bradway","I think on pricing Terence, it's premature for us to be offering any comments about 2019 pricing. So I think we're all aware of what the environment is for pricing now globally and we'll just leave it at that for now.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Chris Raymond","Maybe another biosimilar question if I might. Just on the biosimilar eculizumab program, I think you guys still highlight this program pretty prominently on your biosimilar website. But I don't think you really talk much about this effort in a while. And then I think that's despite having had the go ahead for just over a year now, I think from the EU regulators to start that trial. So I guess the question is when will we hear more about this program and maybe when we do, can you maybe tell us in what way? Thanks.","Robert Bradway","Why don't we ask Dave to respond your question, Chris?","David Reese","Yes. Then also as I mentioned, we finished Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic study in this program, we have achieved global alignment in terms of the design of the Phase 3 trial and we're in start-up activities for that study. This of course targets a disease where there are a limited number of patients, they tend to be focused that centers of expertise. There's competitive patient enrollment and so we feel that based on where we are, we're well positioned to execute that program.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company.","Phil Nadeau","I wanted to ask on Sensipar in the litigation there you mentioned couple of months ago, you have more incremental information early next year. Can you remind us of the timelines of that litigation and when in particular it could finish? Thanks.","Robert Bradway","The litigation is under way now and we don't have a timeline for when the appeals process will be run there, but obviously this will be visible part of the normal legal process. And David, you can just reiterate what you said about guidance for the balance of the year, if you'd like with respect to Sensipar.","David Meline","Yes. So what we've indicated is that in the updated 2018 guidance, we have a range which includes, at the top end where we would continue with Sensipar without generic competition through year-end and obviously within the range we would include other scenarios. But, yes, so we're continuing to monitor those and if there were a launch it would be at risk at the present time, at least.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas","I guess another question around since you've already touched here just specifically around Medicare advantage, given the step edits that are - are initially are out in August and then may go in full effect January 1. Can you help us understand what percentage of Neulasta revenue would be if there was unlimited capacity for a biosimilar for new asset taking a step at it. And can you help us understand in the field right now, what you're seeing regarding these plans forcing people to use the cheaper drug over a grand drug in the situation of Neulasta and others? Thanks.","Robert Bradway","Robyn, we're having a little bit difficulty hearing you at times during your question. So I don't know that we want to give specific percentages in response to your question, but Murdo I'll advise you to offer any thoughts.","Murdo Gordon","Yes, I think the specific question was related to step edits in Medicare Part B. And what we think the impact of that would be on Neulasta particularly in light of biosimilars, if I heard properly. But I would say that we've been pleased so far with how Medicare Part B plans are - or how Medicare Part B has been managed however, we are clearly aware that on the 340B side of Medicare, there are certain advantages to biosimilars.","But on the Part D side of Medicare, the Medicare Advantage step edits have been moderate so far, and we would expect that to be the case in 2019. Beyond that, I think we'll see more propagation but it's hard to pin down specifically where we'll see it.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.","Michael Yee","Wanted to ask an R&D question and that was obviously you highlighting a lot more about the BiTE platform, you obviously have some early AMG 420 data you've reported out. I guess, maybe if you could speak to how competitive, you expect to bispecific BCMAs or bispecifics overall are expected to be versus CAR Ts and how you expect yourself to be positioned with bispecifics overall? And maybe with a focus on BCMA just to start off with. Thanks.","David Reese","Yes, thanks for the question. I would first start at a high level by saying, don't necessarily expect CAR Ts and BiTEs to be mutually exclusive. We think all of these therapies will find a home. We've been quite pleased with the data we've seen so far in our BCMA directed BiTE programs. We think that they do have some potential advantages.","Number one, these are off the shelf therapies, our goal in all of these programs is to deliver an off the shelf medicine that an average oncologist can deliver whether at an academic center or in the community as opposed to a specialized center for CAR Ts.","We also expect to of course to be able to deliver these at a competitive cost of goods, which are in the longer term, I think will be important. And then finally we believe that with the BiTE platform, as I mentioned in going after multiple targets, it affords us the ability to take multiple shots, add a tumor cell by either using them in combination or sequentially, and our goal here really is to produce very deep and durable responses.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.","Geoffrey Porges","Question for you Bob. Looking at your commentary in all of the results, there are obviously a lot of pressures in different parts of the portfolio, but also some opportunities. First question is are you running the company with the expectation of growth or with the expectation of stability from the current portfolio?","And then secondly, you've commented in the past, that the business development opportunities have been constrained by the price of the available assets and obviously that's changing. Could you give us a sense of - from both the Amgen perspective and your sort of industry perspective on whether assets are becoming more available and attractive and what sort of cadence you would expect things to start to move?","Robert Bradway","Geoff, our orientation is to try to position the Company to deliver long-term growth for our shareholders. So our focus is on delivering a portfolio that can generate long-term growth that starts with innovation, the ability to demonstrate the value of that innovation and then the ability to capture the benefit of it globally. So that's what we're focused on.","And you're right, we've positioned the Company to be, we think in a strong position to deal with the kind of headwinds that the industry is dealing with at the moment. And in addition, we have some of our own individual patent expirations, but we think we're in good position to manage through those as well.","At the same time, as you point out, valuations have been volatile and have started to come down for some of the earlier stage companies in our sector and we will continue to look for opportunities. And I suspect our well capitalized peers will as well, opportunities to advance innovation where we think we can do that through business development that adds value to our shareholders. So we're paying close attention to it as you would expect. And we will continue to do that.","As with respect to the cadence so, Geoff, I wouldn't like to comment on whether we'll see an increase in activity or not, but I think it's fair to observe that prices are adjusting in the sector.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","Bob, two questions for you, first as a CEO of Amgen and then as the Head of Pharma. First conceptually, if you think about the biosimilar business, your biosimilar business, what kind of - what percentage of Amgen revenue should biosimilar achieve and say 5, 8, 10 years, just pick a horizon of your choosing. Just to get a feel of how you're thinking about this.","And second you talked about helping the administration shape their proposal. I guess the basic question is can pharma accept or support any proposal where the US will use international benchmark data for prices in other countries to set or determine US prices as a principal?","Robert Bradway","So, Ronny, two very different questions there. First, with respect to biosimilars, as you know, we are advancing 10 products, in aggregate, they address market of $65 billion plus of revenue opportunity. We've said that we think this can be an important growth driver for us. We have talked in the past about this being a potentially a multi-billion dollar business unit for us. We're pleased with it so far, we've been operating on time and on budget in this area. We've noted that it's proving difficult for some of our competitors, but we expected that that would be the case.","So, so far we like our hand in biosimilars. And we think that this can be a growth driver for us. But to state the obvious, we have been and we will continue to be driven by our innovative portfolio of products and that's not going to change as we advance our 10 on a similar molecules. So well, they can contribute to growth, the balance of our business is still going to remain overwhelmingly and innovative led business.","And with respect to your question about the pricing environment in this country, obviously we think that innovation and having access to it are critical. We think the United States has benefited from innovation, making it to the citizens in this country more rapidly than in other countries, and we think that if you look across diseases, our citizens are benefiting from the availability of new medicines more quickly and more comprehensively than in other countries. And what we're focused on is seeing both that the innovative ecosystem is maintained and that patients can have access to it.","And as I've said, or as I said earlier on this call, particularly in an aging society we think what's required is more innovation, not less. And the system that enables people to get access to that innovation swiftly. So that's what we're focused on, and I think you can see that's what our trade association has been focused on as well.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","First on your BCMA, my question is not on the data, but more on, just so we understand the design heading into ASH. And specifically what's the total n in the trial versus the total n at that specific center where the investigator showed those 5 CRs. Just so we have a sense for that.","And then secondly, Murdo, I don't want to ask you on 2 to 7 TMB update, but what I do want to ask you is on CGRP. My question is, the slide mentioned you expect the TRx activity to moderate and normalize. Do you think the class is close to peaking or will it continue to grow and competitors are getting more share? Just wanted to understand that better.","Robert Bradway","Okay, we'll just answer in two parts, Dave.","David Reese","Yes, so let me start with the BCMA. The design of the trial is the standard first in-human dose escalation. So we would expect later in the year to present data across all of the cohorts, which of course are across quite a range of doses. I'll leave it to the investigators who run the trial to present the details of that including the sample size, sample sizes by cohort.","Murdo Gordon","And Umer thanks for not asking me technical questions of a different kind on this call. But CGRP market is we think significant and we don't think we're moderating to the point of saturating that market. The point I was making was in our current trend you see the result of some pent-up demand where patients were anticipating the availability of Aimovig.","So we saw quite a large bolus of patients coming in to our patient services hub and those patients are a part of our current curve. At some point, you will see that the pent-up demand will work through, and there will be a slight change in the slope of the uptake curve, but it will still be a very strong launch curve, especially when you compare it to other recent launches in other categories.","And then the other comment that I made that I would draw your attention to is just that the spontaneous physician, - sorry patient awareness here unaided is between 10% and 15%. And what we've seen since the launch of our DTC campaign is that our website and other digital media traffic has doubled.","And so we really think we're scratching the surface of helping migraine - chronic migraine sufferers with our preventative therapy such as Aimovig. So it was really just a comment on having a bolus of patients working through the early part of our uptake curve, that we think that we'll see continued demand growth.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen MacKay","I have another commercial Aimovig question for Murdo. The 100,000 patient numbers really spectacular I was hoping you could maybe help us understand how many of those are still on free drug versus how many have been transitioned to commercial reimbursement?","And then sort of following up on the prior question relating to trajectory and moderation, on Slide 24 your chart on uptake there appears to suggest sort of exponential uptake with almost 150,000 prescriptions out in October 18. Is that launch trajectory chart for sort of display purposes only or could I be reading into that 150k number? Thank you.","Murdo Gordon","You sound like I do when I'm talking to my team here Kenny. Thanks for the question. We're obviously very excited about this launch trajectory. It is indeed significantly better than recent launches. And there are a few things to consider about that. One, the unmet need for chronic migraine sufferers is really high. Two, this is a very interesting and helpful medicine for those chronic sufferers. And three, payers have allowed the reimbursement of Aimovig.","So to your question of how much is paid and how much is free is we would anticipate that overtime a significant portion of our early launch cart will indeed be paid. I think we have really strong patient feedback both anecdotally and through our services hub.","We have really strong physician or headache specialist feedback and we would expect that the launch trajectory will continue to be one that exceeds other benchmarks from other categories. As for a specific percentage of free versus paid, it's really hard to do, but I will say we're closing the gap on the ratio quite quickly.","So our retail uptake that those are patients going straight to paid product not through our patient services hub is rising rapidly and is on the same, if not more steep trajectory than the total.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","Wanted to follow up on CGRP and ask about access. So we've seen the one publicly announced incremental formulary win for Aimovig already with Express Scripts. But anecdotally, could you speak to how dynamic these payer discussions in formulary positioning are now the competition has entered the market? Or maybe more specifically, do you see this has been a market that necessitates competitive rebates or discounts to drive access or should we be thinking about the space differently?","Robert Bradway","Yes, so far we're feeling quite good about what we've been able to do with payers. As you mentioned, the ESI win we also have a good indications from Anthem and Kaiser. We are working through the process across other plans and access team here is out there, negotiating. And yes, you will see some gross to net in the form of rebates.","Where we end up with that? It's just very early to tell, but we want to make sure that patients have access to Aimovig. You can tell that that was our strategy from the beginning with the price points that we established in the market and we will indeed be continuing to ensure that patients have good comprehensive access both commercially and in Part B.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould from UBS.","Carter Gould","I guess for David, on the myeloma landscape, myeloma assets between Kyprolis, BCMA, your CD38 and MCL1, I guess is there an underlying perspective on how you either think the myeloma landscape is going to evolve or how you think you can shape it as opposed to pursuing these as sort of disparate assets? Thank you.","David Reese","Yes. Thank you for the question. It's a great question, our feeling is that we're actually very well positioned to have a potentially transformative impact on this disease. Our view is that combinations of these agents will be used going forward.","And the goal I think really now is cure or functional cure for this disease, someone trained as an oncologist, that's not you or do you use lightly, but I think it's warranted here and we would view this as a collection of agents that we think we can use in the right combinations to really drive toward that kind of outcome as opposed to a series of one-offs.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Alethia Young","And Tony, congrats on a wonderful run and congrats for everybody else is that been added to the team. I guess I have a question about the PAC-1 data coming, and just how do you envision this mechanism fitting with CGRP and generally, what your expectations kind of heading into that's read out at the end of the year? Thanks.","David Reese","Thanks, it's Dave Reese, I'll handle that question. PAC-1, the PAC-1 receptor sits in a pathway that is very distinct from the CGRP pathway, the sort of neurovascular pathways that we believe are involved in the genesis of migraine are quite different here. Now, what we don't have with the PAC-1 receptor that we had during CGRP development was the sort of clinical validation because it is a first-in-class, first out of the gate agent.","The design of the Phase 2 trial is really quite similar to the design that we had with Aimovig and it's designed to give us an efficacy readout, as well as of course additional safety data. Should we see efficacy, the question will then be, is there a distinct population of patients that may respond to PAC-1 receptor inhibition as compared to CGRP inhibition and that would be something that the development program would be intended to determine going forward.","Robert Bradway","Ian, as it's just a few minutes past 6:00 PM on the East Coast, let's take two more questions, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities.","Salim Syed","Tony, I'm still happy to send you my Repatha scripts, if you want. And welcome to Murdo. I have one on PCSK9, either for you Murdo or for Tony. On inclisiran, so obviously another quarter has passed and then another - we've got another DSMB update. At what point or maybe how do you guys framework that in terms of threat versus to being complementary to your PCSK9, maybe for primary prevention or threat regarding pricing or volume? How do you guys framework those two things? And maybe just give us your thoughts around that. Thank you.","Robert Bradway","We might just start to answer your question Salim with Dave Reese, since you're asking questions about our clinical programs.","Tony Hooper","Yes. I mean, I would offer a few observations here. First, long-term safety is an absolutely critical outcome in this class. And with Repatha, we have an enormous amount of data. I think that is the - that is probably the critical piece. We'll have to look at the efficacy. I think the accumulated data with Repatha strongly support the lower is better hypothesis. I think there is just an overwhelming weight of evidence, now in support of that. And therefore, we feel very comfortable with what we can deliver with Repatha.","Murdo Gordon","Yes, the only thing I would add Salim is as Tony mentioned, I've got decades of experience, and I've been in cardiovascular now for decades. I've seen the evolution of statins, I have seen the evolution of antiplatelet drugs, I have seen the evolution of novel oral anticoagulants.","And I think what I hope to be able to do is pick up where Tony left off, and really expand the usage of PCSK9s and specific Repatha for these high-risk cardiovascular patients where we've proven an event reduction benefit. We can do that with substantial time horizon prior to when we would expect other competition like Inclisiran entering the market.","And I think with recent moves, we've made to improve access specifically for Part D patients, which is, as you know that 65% of the potential patient pool, we should be able to help improve the volume growth of Repatha between now and when we might face new competition. Part of me wants to say that new competition can expand the class and improve interest in it. But I would like to make sure that we are competitive and we drive share there as well.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird.","Brian Skorney","I just wanted to get your thoughts. I know you just completed a trial with Sandoz regarding the Enbrel infringement. Just wondering when you expect the judge to return decision in this case. And can you just kind of walk us through what the best case and worst-case scenarios are for you guys in terms of potential biosimilar impact and timeline of exclusivity?","Robert Bradway","Well, Brian, the closing arguments are expected in that trial, later this year. I think, late in November we're expecting closing arguments and then some time thereafter likely months thereafter, we'll have the judge's decision. And then I'm sure whichever way the outcome as you can expect will be challenges in the appeals process.","So at this point why don't we just simply reiterate that we stand by the intellectual property of Enbrel. And we look forward to having an opportunity to validate that intellectual property through this court process.","Okay. I think, let me thank you all for joining us on the call and I hope you can see from our report of the third quarter that we continue to deliver solid financial performance. We're ready for the change in competitive environment that all of us I think and this industry face, focused on developing innovative first-in-class therapies. And we're excited about the 7 that we talked about just having introduced into clinic, doing our parts and working with our colleagues in the industry to improve accessibility and affordability for our products.","And finally, excited about the level of engagement that we continue to enjoy from our staff around the world. So thank you all for your participation in the call. And as usual, our IR team will be standing by if you have any further questions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Amgen's third quarter 2018 earnings call.

There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks.","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Derek, and good afternoon, everybody. So first of all, thank you for taking the time to participate in our conference call today to review our operating performance for the first quarter of 2017.","Before we begin, I would like to extend a warm welcome to those who are new in their coverage of Amgen, including Umer Raffat of ISI Evercore and Carter Gould of UBS. Each of us very much look forward to working with you.","We made a lot of progress during the quarter both in our commercial execution as well as our R&D efforts, so I'm anxious to get started. I would urge you to listen for specific themes, including volume-driven growth and operational expense management as you hear our senior leaders describe our performance.","Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call today with a brief report on how we are executing against our long-term strategy for growth. Following Bob, our CFO, David Meline, will review our financial results for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017. Our head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. And I'll give you a heads-up right now that we have a lot to discuss on our R&D efforts.","As is customary for us, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail.","We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release on Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2016 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, thank you, Arvind, and thank you all for joining our call.","It's been an active first quarter at Amgen. And before talking about our financial results, I want to put the events of the first 90 days of the year in context because I think they underscore the reasons why we're confident about achieving our long-term objectives for growth.","As you know, we're focused on six therapeutic categories. And during the quarter, we achieved important milestones in each of them. Core to our strategy is a commitment to differentiated innovation. We aim for products with a big effect size in areas where the unmet need is high. That's what we feel will be required to succeed over the long term in this industry.","In our cardiovascular portfolio, we strongly believe Repatha represents one such product. As all of you know, cardiovascular disease poses by far the biggest health burden on society today. And our outcomes data demonstrated unequivocally that Repatha can play an important role in reducing that burden. And the data also showed to my mind that the rate of cardiovascular events, which approached 10% per year in the optimized statin arm of the trial, is still far too high without Repatha.","Against this backdrop, we expect Repatha to be an important product in the fight against cardiovascular disease and increasingly expect physicians, patients, and other stakeholders to recognize that rejecting an innovative drug for high-risk patients which demonstrated beyond 12 months a 35% reduction in the risk of heart attack, a 24% reduction in the rate of stroke, and a 28% reduction in the rate of revascularizations is simply inappropriate.","The practice of medicine won't change overnight but it won't stall either, not in the face of an innovative new therapy that can prevent hundreds of thousands of otherwise needless and tragic events. In the U.S. alone, cardiovascular disease costs our society in excess of $600 billion a year. And without meaningful innovation like Repatha to change the trajectory of this disease, those costs will exceed $1.2 trillion by 2035.","We believe it's right to embrace innovation not only for patients but also for society. Economic study after study has shown that society benefits financially from adopting therapies like Repatha. Nonetheless, we recognize the access challenges of the day, and that's why we have and will continue to offer innovative value-based contracts to help build a bridge between the medical need and the affordability concerns for patients and payers.","In addition to novel biology, intellectual property is another source of differentiation for our innovation. We were obviously gratified this quarter by the Delaware court's support for our position on Repatha, and we now stand ready for the Appeals Court to hear the case in June.","In oncology, there's no better standard for differentiated innovation than achieving an overall survival advantage for patients. In the first quarter, we achieved that with both KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO. The BLINCYTO results are encouraging for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia obviously. But more broadly, they are encouraging as validation for the whole approach of our immuno-oncology BiTE platform. Perhaps because we are the only company with an advanced BiTE platform, this area is not as well understood in the investment community as other areas of immuno-oncology, but we're excited about the potential of our BiTEs and have several programs moving swiftly in our pipeline. We look forward to sharing data as they become available from these efforts.","The overall survival data for KYPROLIS achieved at an interim analysis in relapsed multiple myeloma patients are also very important and timely. Having established superiority versus Velcade, we expect these data will drive increased share for KYPROLIS, particularly in the second line, and will also be helpful for reimbursement considerations.","Also in multiple myeloma this quarter, we achieved positive results for XGEVA. And subject to regulatory approvals, we look forward to being able to offer this therapy to multiple myeloma patients, many of whom are at risk of skeletal-related events such as those prevented by XGEVA.","Bone health remains an area of high unmet medical need, as still millions of women at high risk for postmenopausal fractures remain untreated. Reflecting on the number of postmenopausal fractures, the World Health Organization called this a global epidemic. Prolia's ongoing significant volume-driven growth, 21% in the quarter, attests to the value of differentiated innovation in this field. Already the leader in bone health, we expect EVENITY will strengthen our hand. And while we await both further clinical data and regulatory reviews, Sean will describe the encouraging results that we received this quarter for the three-year follow-up from the FRAME study.","While discussing our strategy of differentiated innovation, I also want to address our newest therapeutic area, which is of course neuroscience, where we are on the threshold of a novel first-in-class therapy for migraine sufferers. We had the opportunity to present our registration-enabling data at the American Academy of Neurology this week. And not surprisingly, experts in the field were excited about erenumab in an area where there is otherwise precious little to offer those suffering from episodic and chronic migraine.","I've seen some headlines asking whether our expanded collaboration with Novartis signals a waning of our enthusiasm for this opportunity. The answer is absolutely not. We have high hopes for erenumab. And at the same time, we recognize this is a new therapeutic category for us and will likely be a competitive race. So we were very pleased that Novartis, already our collaborator in international markets, shared our enthusiasm for this first-in-class molecule in the U.S. and our determination to resource this product to win. With their decades of experience in neurology and a shared commitment to serve those suffering from migraine, we're excited about our expanded collaboration.","When it comes to strategy, you've also heard us talk about life cycle management, especially for our legacy franchises. The Neulasta Onpro launch is now widely seen as one of the most effective examples of this, with market shares now in excess of 50% in the U.S.","In nephrology, we announced earlier this quarter an extension of our partnership with DaVita for EPOGEN. And of course, we also gained approval for Parsabiv in the U.S. As the established leader in nephrology therapeutics, we continue to look for ways to serve patients with kidney disease and expect this to remain an important franchise for us.","As you know, an element of our strategy includes developing a portfolio of biosimilars, and I'm glad that we made that commitment, as I think there will be a robust market for these products. And while our portfolio of 10 biosimilars is progressing across the board, the highlight for the quarter was in inflammation, where we received EU approval to go along with our U.S. approval of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to Humira. The first steps in building out this business are to establish biosimilarity and gain registration, and obviously we have done that now for an important molecule in the biggest markets. The next step is to navigate the IP landscape, and the process for that is underway.","Over the past couple of years, we've talked on these calls about our ongoing transformation efforts. We committed to a companywide transformation, real, meaningful change designed to make us more competitive, improve our operating margins, and ensure that we would be in a strong position to return capital to our shareholders during this period of increasing competition for our legacy franchises and while launching nine innovative products, maintaining our investment in innovation, advancing our biosimilars portfolio, and expanding our international presence from 50 to over 100 countries. We have asked a lot of our staff, and they have delivered. In our past results, you've seen our steady progress, and you see it once again this quarter, where our margins have grown and we delivered 9% earnings per share growth.","Looking forward, our orientation is long-term growth with volume-driven products, and we think we can deliver that across our focused therapeutic franchises. But we're also set on managing the business tightly to deliver in the short and medium term too. You should see this in our track record, and that's what you see in this quarter as well.","Our balance sheet and cash flows are strong, and we're looking for investment opportunities, albeit with a determination to add value for our shareholders, not just someone else's. Given valuations across many targets in the sector at the moment, that's challenging, but we'll remain patient and discriminating when it comes to M&A.","We've long advocated the need for corporate tax reform. If innovative U.S. companies are to remain competitive, we need a level tax playing field. We don't have one now, but we're hopeful this administration will deliver that in 2017. Obviously, we think such change would improve our flexibility for capital allocation.","I've taken a bit longer than usual on this call, but with all of the events of the first quarter, I wanted to make sure to reiterate that we're investing in long-term opportunities, managing the business tightly, and are poised to capitalize on investment opportunities which might arise.","With that, let me once again thank our staff for their engagement with our mission, and then turn to David. Thank you.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Bob.","We were pleased with our solid overall results and earnings growth again in the first quarter, as our transformation efforts enabled progress in an environment of strong competition and portfolio transition. We also were encouraged by our 7% volume growth in Europe, reflecting the value of our innovative products in a market where we have experienced similar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years.","Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, worldwide revenues at $5.5 billion in the first quarter are flat year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX. Worldwide product sales at $5.2 billion in the first quarter are flat year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX, as strong unit demand for our newer products was offset by declines in our mature brands. Other revenues at $265 million decreased $23 million versus the first quarter of 2016.","Non-GAAP operating income at $3 billion grew 5% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by 3 points to 57.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payments in Q4 of 2016.","As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses. On an overall full-year basis, we expect another year of strong operating margins, driven by tight operational expense management. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.4 points to 13.1%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by product mix.","Research and development expenses at $748 million were down 13% year over year, driven by a first quarter 2016 payment related to a third-party collaboration agreement, lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs, and continued benefits from our transformation initiatives. Research and development as a percent of product sales at 14.4% is lower in Q1, consistent with previous years. Going forward, research and development expense as a percent of product sales is expected to normalize around 2016 levels.","SG&A expenses decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payments, partially offset by increased investments in new product launches. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 7% year over year and remain on track to meet or exceed our 2018 commitment of $1.5 billion in transformation savings, while investing to build the business globally, support new product launches, and invest in the long-term pipeline for the business.","Other income and expenses were a net $131 million expense in Q1. This is favorable by $13 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher cash balances.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.5% for the quarter, a 0.4-point decrease versus the first quarter of 2016. This decrease reflects favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a smaller benefit from share-based compensation tax expenses compared to the first quarter of last year. As you may recall, this benefit is a result of the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-9, requiring these tax impacts to be recognized on the income statement versus the balance sheet. The benefit of this adoption contributed approximately $0.06 to our non-GAAP earnings per share in this quarter compared to $0.09 in the first quarter of 2016.","Non-GAAP net income increased 6%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 9% year over year for the first quarter to $3.15 per share.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7, free cash flow was $2.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $400 million over last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher profitability as well as timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS.","We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments, as we deployed $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.4 million shares at an average of $163 per share, and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, as previously communicated. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1.15 per share, an increase of 15% over last year.","Cash and investments totaled $38.4 billion, an increase of approximately $3.7 billion from the first quarter of last year. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow generation. Our debt balance stands at $34.1 billion as of March 31, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and an average maturity of 12 years.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2017 on page 8, overall our 2017 revenue guidance remains unchanged at $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion. Our first quarter volume and price performance was in line with our plans, as we experienced a solid contribution from our newer products while managing the impact of competition against the balance of the portfolio. Revenue guidance also reflects the potential impact of the Repatha litigation and improving access for appropriate patients as a result of the positive Repatha cardiovascular outcomes data. Finally, our guidance takes into account potential biosimilar competition against Neulasta commencing as soon as the fourth quarter of this year.","With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are raising the outlook to $12.00 to $12.60, reflecting our overall solid Q1 performance. In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 18.5% to 19.5%, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.","As previously stated, our 2017 guidance ranges are based on application of existing laws, including the Affordable Care Act and the current U.S. tax code as well as current interpretation of the required notice period prior to commercial marketing of a biosimilar under the BPCIA [Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act]. We will continue to update guidance going forward for changes in these factors and any other business updates.","Finally, consistent with our 2017 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period, including: double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth; non-GAAP operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%; $1.5 billion of transformation savings; and return to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period.","This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. You'll find our product sales starting on slide number 10.","Our business performance is shifting to a more volume-driven growth as we launch innovative products targeting the large patient populations with unmet medical needs. Whilst our focus is on innovation, we have also executed effective life cycle management strategies for some of our legacy brands which are facing potential new competition. Although U.S. revenues declined 1%, our ex-U.S. growth was 3%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, fueled by a 7% volume growth.","I'll now discuss our specific product performance and will structure my comments by therapeutic area. Let me begin with our bone health franchise.","Prolia is a great example of one of our innovative products that realized robust volume growth during the quarter, with most of its 21% year-over-year sales growth driven by unit volume. Prolia, with a strong value proposition, is uniquely positioned in postmenopausal osteoporosis as the leading branded product on the market. We will continue to invest in Prolia to reach a greater number of patients whilst reinforcing adherence for those already taking Prolia to ensure they continue to realize its benefits. Overall, we expect Prolia will remain a significant growth driver, as the approximately 850,000 U.S. patients on Prolia therapy only represent about 20% of patients presently being treated for postmenopausal osteoporosis.","We also look forward to expanding our bone health franchise with romosozumab, our innovative bone-building molecule for which we now have a trade name, EVENITY. In conjunction with our partners at UCB, we're preparing for a U.S. launch in advance of the July 19 PDUFA date. As Bob pointed out, having the ability to co-position EVENITY and Prolia sequentially will improve our ability to better treat those large patient populations. For thousands of high-risk postmenopausal osteoporosis patients such as those who have fractured, we have a proven therapeutic strategy with EVENITY to first build strong new bone in patients with 12 months of treatment, followed by Prolia for proven continued fracture risk reduction.","Oncology is another area that is benefiting from volume growth with our recently launched products. Let me start with KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS realized 23% year-on-year growth during the quarter. And most of this growth was volume-driven, including our international markets. As you know, KYPROLIS is indicated in the U.S. for second and third-line multiple myeloma. In second-line, triplet regimens are used in approximately one-third of patients. And despite new entrants, we've been able to achieve about 50% market share for new patient starts in this segment.","The other two-thirds of second-line patients are treated with doublet regimens. And recent data from our ENDEAVOR study had demonstrated that KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone improved overall survival by 21% or nearly 8 months when compared to the Velcade plus dexamethasone.","Improving overall survival is the gold standard measurement when treating cancer. This data clearly establishes KYPROLIS as the proteasome inhibitor of choice and will be a compelling differentiator in our strategy to displace Velcade in this setting. KYPROLIS is well accepted in large academic centers that treat high numbers of multiple myeloma patients. And we are now focusing on extending KYPROLIS's reach into the community oncology practices.","Despite the introduction of new competing products in the U.S., we have also regained share in new third-line patients over the last few quarters. We expect proteasome inhibition to be foundational therapy in multiple myeloma for many years to come and are focused on growing in second and third lines of therapy with plans to expand KYPROLIS's use in newly diagnosed patients. Outside the U.S., we continue to enter into new markets and secure reimbursement with the benefit of the new KYPROLIS overall survival data.","XGEVA grew 6% year over year, mostly due to volume, as we continue to emphasize its clinical benefits. We look forward to having the positive multiple myeloma study data added to our label. This will expand the patient population eligible for XGEVA treatment.","Both Nplate and Vectibix saw another good quarter of volume growth of 9% and 6% respectively.","Neulasta sales increased 2% year over year, as we continue to see a small decline in the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapeutic agents. The first quarter also benefited from accounting estimate changes due to lower Onpro returns, underscoring that Onpro delivery is working better than initially assumed. We continue to drive increasing adoption, and Onpro now represents over 50% share of all Neulasta purchases. This has been a great example of a very successful life cycle management strategy. And as David explained earlier, we expect minimal impact in 2017 from potential long-acting biosimilar competition.","I'd also note that the first quarter historically benefits from heavier purchasing by certain end customers, and we estimate this benefit in quarter one to be about $50 million, which we expect to reverse in quarter two.","For NEUPOGEN, the impact of competition was in line with prior performance. We entered the quarter retaining a 46% share of the short-acting market in the U.S. We expect these competitive dynamics to continue over the course of 2017.","Moving now to Enbrel, I would start by emphasizing that we see no trend break versus 2016. And I will go through Enbrel carefully and in some detail because I don't want you to misinterpret long-term dynamics based on some quarter one peculiarities.","Before getting into quarterly performance, I'd like to highlight that we utilize IMS prescription data to analyze the business. Like many of you, we noticed a slowdown in the first quarter IMS scripts. This has implications for our views on segment demand and end-user inventory levels. We've been in close contact with IMS, and they agree that the first quarter prescription data appears soft in several specialty product categories, including rheumatology and dermatology. As a matter of fact, on a year-over-year basis, unit growth in rheumatology appeared to slow from 9% in the first quarter of 2016 to 2% in this quarter, and from 25% to 9% in the dermatology segment for the same period.","IMS attributes the softness to a combination of several factors, including the number of shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the first quarter of 2017, the impact of patient out-of-pocket costs including deductibles, and the Part D donut hole for the start of a new year, as well as the potential increasing use of 90-day prescriptions. This is also consistent with our view of the market.","We noted our expectations that 2016 trends would continue into 2017. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our share declined 1 percentage point to 32% in rheumatology and declined 2 percentage points in dermatology to 15%, in line with 2016 share trends.","As for the end-user inventory, we previously said that we expected quarter one reductions due to the quarter four 2016 $150 million excess inventory. Based on the IMS data, we calculated an approximate $30 million reduction in inventory levels this quarter. And therefore, we expect the remainder to be used up during the course of the year. Obviously, the accuracy of the IMS data has implications for understanding of both unit demand dynamics and end-user inventory.","Consistent with our previous guidance, net selling price had a minimal impact on year-over-year sales growth during quarter one. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, we are seeing increased commercial patient copay assistance impacting their selling price, which is likely a function of higher patient out-of-pocket costs. This impact typically tapers off over the remainder of the year, and our view on net selling price in 2017 is unchanged.","We are optimistic about a rebound in both Enbrel and Enbrel segment growth in future quarters, as IMS prescription data from the more recent weeks shows improvement versus the beginning of the year in both rheumatology and dermatology.","So in summary, the quarter one results likely reflect a temporary marketplace issue, and we believe the long-term dynamics are intact and in line with our prior expectations. There remain a substantial number of patients for which Enbrel is the best treatment option given its competitive efficacy and long-term safety profile. We will continue to invest in Enbrel to enhance its value it brings to patients and providers. Given its long-term period of patent protection, Enbrel will continue to be a significant cash flow generator for Amgen for many years to come.","Turning now to our nephrology products, beginning with Aranesp, on a worldwide basis, Aranesp declined 4% year over year. In the U.S., it increased by 7%, including the conversion from EPOGEN at numerous independent and midsize dialysis centers. This conversion was substantially completed by quarter three of 2016, with Aranesp now representing over 85% of the ESA usage. Performance outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the timing of tenders in certain markets.","Now to EPOGEN, as previously disclosed, we recently renegotiated our supply agreement with DaVita. DaVita represents about one-third of the U.S. dialysis market, and they will continue to predominantly purchase EPOGEN through 2022. In exchange for longer supply certainty, we made concessions on net selling prices, which impacted the quarter-on-quarter results. Also, as David mentioned, we do not expect a material impact to our ESA business in 2017 from a short-acting biosimilar competitor.","Sensipar increased 15% year over year, driven by a combination of net selling price and volume growth. Parsabiv, our innovative new cosmetic, delivered intravenously, is now approved in both the U.S. and Europe. And we are working with CMS to secure a reimbursement mechanism in the U.S.","Let me now turn to our cardiovascular franchise and Repatha. Let me first address the quarter-on-quarter growth, which might look a little strange. Quarter four 2016 was slightly inflated due to the booking of a Middle East tender, which was not repeated in quarter one this year. With closer examination of the data, you will see that we recorded positive volume growth in the U.S. of 14% and 28% in Europe. In the U.S., we achieved segment share of 64% in quarter one for new-to-brand patients and briefly touched on 70% as we exited the quarter. In Europe, we exited 2016 with 56% segment share. Our U.S. formulary coverage has greatly improved over last year, especially in Medicare Part D, where we have almost tripled the number of lives covered.","Results of the Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study that were presented at the American College of Cardiology last month are clearly a game-changer for cardiovascular patients, showing significant reductions in MIs and strokes.","We also shared our analysis on the economic value of Repatha at the ACC. This calculation used standard peer-reviewed methodology, using real-world event rates and imputed mortality benefit from the meta-analysis of previous studies, the CTTC relationship, and concluded that prices in the market today are well within the value-based price range. Naturally, this calculation is based on average net selling price and not the list price.","Since the ACC, we've been engaging with payers in the U.S. and across the world on Repatha's clinical data and economic value. We are in active discussions with all of the large U.S. PBMs and payers, and they recognize the importance of Repatha's outcome data to patients.","We are focused on reducing barriers and improving processes to make it easier for a physician to prescribe Repatha and for patients to get access to this important therapy. We expect payers will start changing utilization management criteria and processes over the coming months.","Several independent groups have studied the access situation and have concluded that current access barriers are inappropriate and potentially harmful to patients. As pointed out in the recent publication by the Partnership for Health Analytic Research, or PHAR, it started with the irresponsible prediction of healthcare costs prior to FDA approval of the PCSK9 inhibitor class. These overestimates resulted in onerous restrictions and lack of patient access from the beginning.","At the ACC last month, two research teams, including one from Duke, presented data showing that patients' clinical characteristics were no different between those denied reimbursement for PCSK9 versus those approved, showing that payer utilization management processes were nothing but an arbitrary barrier to access. And just today, the FH Foundation published a peer-reviewed paper in the journal Circulation showing that 63% of FH patients and 58% of established ASCVD patients had their PCSK9 inhibitor claims rejected despite having suboptimal LDL-C levels and being on moderate or high-intensity statins.","Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number-one cause of death and disability in the world. And in a moment, Sean will remind us of the incredible outcome value that Repatha has demonstrated by its ability to reduce both MI and stroke. This data together with the groundswell of cardiology and patient pressure will result in increasing levels of patient access. Repatha will continue to grow for many years to come, making it one of the largest innovative assets Amgen has brought to market.","Let me conclude by saying a few words about erenumab and our recently announced expanded collaboration with Novartis. We believe that partnering with Novartis, a company that is well-positioned in the neuroscience space, will enable us to maximize the launch of this first-in-class product. We believe that erenumab will offer a strong value proposition to millions of patients suffering from chronic or episodic migraines.","Let me close by thanking all the Amgen staff that worked so hard and tirelessly to get our important products to patients around the world.","Sean?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon.","I'll begin my comments today with Repatha. As you know, we presented the results of our Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study at the American College of Cardiology meetings in March with simultaneous publication in The New England Journal of Medicine. This represented a major step on the path of getting this therapy to the patients who so desperately need it.","The study had several objectives: first, to validate the PCSK9 mechanism with respect to cardiovascular outcomes; second, to establish the safety of reaching unprecedented low LDL levels, recall that 25% of patients in the Repatha arm had on-treatment LDLs below 19; and third, to understand whether the linear relationship established by statins and ezetimibe between LDL and cardiovascular risk continues down to very low LDL levels, as the human genetics had suggested. This study gave clear positive results on all of these objectives.","The results also validated our dosing approach of maximally inhibiting PCSK9 with Repatha, and that when it comes to LDL, as we began to hear cardiologists coin at the ACC, lowest is best.","Importantly, outcomes data from Pfizer's discontinued PCSK9 program were presented and also published in The New England Journal of Medicine, confirming the efficacy seen in our study and demonstrating that not all PCSK9 antibody therapies are the same with respect to off-target liabilities.","Now there's been a fair amount of speculation in the press and elsewhere about the magnitude of the risk reduction observed in our study, so I'm going to spend a bit of time on the results. We have found that the vast preponderance of experts in this field view this study as highly successful in terms of the observed effect size. Essentially, the results are exactly as what would have been achieved had one been able to reduce LDL to the same degree with additional statin therapy were it possible to do so without unacceptable toxicity.","Specifically, experts understand that the treatment lag that occurs in the first year of therapy, a phenomenon seen in all lipid-lowering trials in this type of population, represented a much larger proportion of the median time on therapy in our study, which was just over two years, versus the average 5.5-year-long statin study. They also understand that adjusting appropriately for duration of therapy, the results line up extremely well with the cholesterol treatment trial as a collaboration or CTTC meta analyses.","When one looks at the pre-specified landmark analyses for this chronic therapy, after the first year when the treatment lag is over and the true chronic value of the therapy can be assessed accurately, the risk reductions in myocardial infarction 35%, stroke 24%, and revascularization 28% are quite impressive, particularly in the setting of such a remarkably clean safety profile. Experts also understand why one should not have anticipated an impact on CV mortality in such a study, and I would refer those who are interested to an excellent editorial on this subject published recently in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology.","And to just remind us of the clinical reality here, many millions of patients like those in our outcome studies have a high annual risk of CV events, despite maximally tolerated statins, and have no other therapeutic alternative to take their LDLs down to levels that significantly protect them from such events. In fact, we were all surprised by the fact that despite optimized therapy with best standard of care, including high-intensity statins, patients in the placebo arm of our CV outcome study had an annual event rate of almost 10%, which clearly demonstrates the unmet need here, as event rates in the real world are significantly higher than those seen in clinical trial settings.","Now one of our highest priorities is to ensure these results are reflected in the Repatha label as soon as possible, and we're targeting regulatory submissions by midyear. I'd also note that the Repatha 420-milligram single-dose delivery option was recently approved in Europe.","Turning to oncology, we completed XGEVA regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe for the prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma patients, providing a potential new treatment option for patients, many of whom are not able to avail themselves of alternative therapies due to renal insufficiency. In multiple myeloma, we received the overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study in relapsed or refractory patients, which confirm the superiority of KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone over Velcade plus dexamethasone. In fact, ENDEAVOR was the first head-to-head study to demonstrate a survival benefit versus a current standard-of-care regimen in this setting, and we're preparing to submit these results to regulators as well.","We also remain on track to begin enrollment this quarter in our Phase 3 study of KYPROLIS in combination with DARZALEX in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and also recently began enrolling a Phase 1b study of new formulations of oprozomib.","Turning to our immuno-oncology programs, I'll begin with our BiTE platform. We were very pleased that FDA granted BLINCYTO Priority Review for our recent sBLA that includes overall survival data from our Phase 3 study to support conversion from accelerated to full approval. The application also includes new data in Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a small population but an area of significant unmet need. We also continued to roll out our Phase 2\/3 BLINCYTO program in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","We also had the opportunity in the recent American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting to present preclinical data from some of our new BiTE programs, including half-life extended constructs. We continue to make good progress with the investigation of Enlogic in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, and we'll be presenting the results of our Phase 2 study in combination with Yervoy at ASCO as well as some very interesting human biomarker data at the Congress of the European Association of Dermato Oncology.","Finally, in the early-stage immuno-oncology pipeline, we're making progress on our Advaxis collaboration and have an investigational new drug application in place for a personalized neo-antigen-targeted approach to cancer immunotherapy.","In our bone therapeutic area, our collaboration with UCB on EVENITY continues to advance, and we look forward to our July U.S. PDUFA date for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. Ahead of this, we expect the primary analysis of our active controlled fracture study, ARCH, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in the near future.","I will remind you that the upcoming primary analysis will include the clinical fracture and vertebral fracture primary co-endpoints as well as an interim analysis of the event-driven non-vertebral fracture study secondary endpoint. If statistical significance is not achieved at this interim analysis, the study will continue until the final analysis some months later. We designed ARCH in this manner to ensure adequate powering at the non-vertebral fracture endpoint.","I would also point out that compared to the placebo-controlled FRAME study, the ARCH study compares EVENITY followed by alendronate to antiresorptive therapy with alendronate throughout the study period. These sequences are being assessed in a higher-risk population than our FRAME study, with all subjects in ARCH required to have prevalent fracture. This was possible given the active comparator design, and we were not exposing these higher-risk patients to placebo.","If you recall in the FRAME study, the event rate for non-vertebral fractures was much lower than expected. And at 12 months, the non-vertebral relative risk reduction was 25% in the EVENITY-treated patients but was not significantly significant. In an exploratory analysis reported at ASBMR [American Society for Bone and Mineral Research], the relative risk reduction at two years in FRAME was 25% with a nominal T-value that was less than 0.05. We recently conducted the three-year analysis of this study, which again demonstrated nominal significance for non-vertebral fracture, demonstrating that a year of EVENITY therapy still had high treatment impact through year three, despite the fact that the control group received a very potent antiresorptive agent, Prolia, in years two and three.","Within our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, we had the opportunity to present the results from our two Phase 3 erenumab studies in episodic migraine at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting yesterday. The data demonstrated the robust and consistent effect of inhibiting the CGRP receptor with erenumab. And feedback from experts at the meeting have been very positive, with many viewing this as a potentially game-changing therapy for a debilitating, highly symptomatic disease. We look forward to making first-in-class regulatory submissions for erenumab that incorporate our episodic and chronic data later this quarter.","AMG 301, our PAC-1 antibody for migraine, also continues to progress. We've seen encouraging pharmacodynamic activity in our Phase 1 study in normal subjects and are currently designing a Phase 2 program in migraineurs, which we expect to begin later this year. Also in the quarter, Phase 3 enrollment in Alzheimer's disease began for the small molecule BACE inhibitor, AMG 520, we are developing with Novartis.","In our inflammation collaboration with AstraZeneca-MedImmune, I am pleased to provide a program update for AMG 157 or tezepelumab, our monoclonal antibody that inhibits thymic","stromal lymphopoietin or TSLP. TSLP is an epithelial-derived cytokine produced in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli that drives inflammatory responses. TSLP expression is increased in the airways of patients with asthma, the magnitude correlating with the severity of disease.","Some of you may recall that our Phase 1b data were quite compelling and were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2014. Together with AZ-MedImmune, we've now received the results from a large double-blind Phase 2b study in patients with inadequately controlled severe asthma in which AMG 157 demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations compared to placebo at 52 weeks, successfully meeting the primary endpoint. This is a very encouraging result. And together with AZ-MedImmune, we are currently evaluating the potential for this agent to address a broad population of patients with severe asthma.","Briefly in nephrology, in the first quarter we also received approval for Parsabiv, our innovative IV calcimimetic that is administered thrice weekly at the end of dialysis for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease.","And lastly in biosimilar news from Europe, we received approval for AMGEVITA, our biosimilar Humira, for all available indications and submitted ABP 980, our biosimilar Herceptin, for approval.","In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our staff for advancing these important programs on behalf of patients.","Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, thank you, Sean. I know we've taken more time than usual on our introductory remarks, so let's go straight to questions, Derek, and just please remind our callers of the process for the next step.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence, begin your question.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the question, maybe just a two-part on Repatha. First, Tony, can you comment if the payers appreciate the details of the four-year data that Sean walked through? And then it looks like net price might have taken a step down in the U.S. in the first quarter. I'm just wondering if you can confirm that and any additional commentary that you can provide. Thank you.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Terence, sure. All our discussions with the payers have been really starting with the discussion on the Repatha outcomes data, and I don't think we've had any pushback at all in terms of people really understanding the robust value. We will continue to work with them. Obviously, each one of them has agreed to go back and relook at the utilization management criteria as we speak.","There does appear to be a slight adjustment in the net price. One was due to a small accounting adjustment. And two, of course, we book our patient copay program to the net price, and the first quarter is normally a lot higher than second, third, or fourth. So we see that normalizing as we go forward.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Can we go to the next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew, you may begin your question.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question. Tony, thanks for the detail on Enbrel. I'm sure, as you appreciate, there's a lot of questions that people have on that. If I can just ask two points there, you cited a market slowdown which you think will improve throughout the rest of the year. Could you just talk about your confidence around that? And beyond some of the weekly data points, are there other reasons to believe that broadly the market is not slowing?","And then second, it seems to me that the impact on price in the first quarter is higher than you've seen in quarters past, even when thinking about copay assistance and some of the other factors. Is there anything else going on there, and what's your confidence about price leveling out for the year? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. So as you know, with Enbrel as a retail product, about 97% of the volume is reported on a script basis, so we can track it quite tightly. For the quarter, it was definitely down, both rheumatology and dermatology. When I look at it sequentially, January, February, March, and then as I see it going into April, each one of those months has shown an incremental growth both in terms of DOT as well as prescriptions and in terms of growth. So January was down a lot. February was better than January. March was better than February, and April is starting to look much better than March as well.","From a net price, we don't see a dramatic change in the net price. Some the new contracts are coming into place, but our outlook on net price for 2017 hasn't changed at all. And when I look at abandonment rates, abandonment rates in the first quarter are pretty similar for Enbrel to what they were in the fourth quarter or the third quarter last year.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","And, Matthew, maybe just big picture here, when we look at the flow of patients into the information space, particularly rheumatology and dermatology, we see no reason in the marketplace that the trend of an increasing number of patients into this therapy would have abruptly changed between the fourth and the first quarter. So we think that we'll continue to see growth in the underlying demand for these kind of products.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying, you may begin your question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on Repatha. How much have you heard from the physicians in terms of feedback that they have to wait for a treatment guideline change by, let's say, ACC or AHA before they start prescribing more Repatha? And if that's the case, when do you think those professional organizations will change the guideline?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","I think it's probably a subtle question that you're asking there, Ying, so why don't we just take a moment and really step through it. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take the first go.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So all our discussions with cardiologists have been around their frustration of the administrative burden that has been placed upon them to get a prescription for appropriate patients. A lot of them are having to hire full-time nurses to spend the entire day chasing down required patient data, to chase down interactions between the patient or between the physician and the respective payer or the PBM. The guidelines themselves clearly in everyone's mind would help move the decision-making and the utilization criteria a bit quicker. But our major conversation with physicians is not really around the guidelines; it's more around the inconvenience.","From a guideline perspective, clearly both the AHA and the ACC are busy looking at the outcomes data. They've told us they're busy identifying position papers they wish to put forward. The NLA, the National Lipid Association, was there. The Association of Preventive Cardiology (sic) [American Society of Preventive Cardiology] (54:25), run by Dr. Seth Baum, is in the process of looking at a revised set of guidelines, including a proposed set of utilization management criteria, which they're proposing the PBMs and the payers should be using.","In terms of guidelines themselves, both the AHA and the ACC have said it will take some time before they actually get to a final guideline change.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","I think the important information here is that the data demonstrated that lower is better, or as Sean said and as we increasingly hear from experts in the field, lowest is best. And I think people recognize that the current guidelines are out of sync with that. So the data make the point clear, and we expect to see white papers and then ultimately changes in the guidelines. But for right now, the data are an important piece of getting people to understand how to manage this disease for patients. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Eric, you may begin your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just as a follow-on to Ying's question, it sounds like the major bottleneck is this hassle factor, Tony, that physicians are being put through, and I guess I'm just wondering what kind of leverage Amgen has to reduce that factor. Can't payers just stay entrenched and say our policies are that we'll cover it, but we're going to make you go through X, Y, and Z hoops and maintain the hassle factor and I guess the evidence of better medicine?","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So, Eric, I don't think I've spoken to a single cardiologist or general practitioner who hasn't commented on how onerous the process is to gain access to these products.","I think without a doubt, the third-party organizations, the professional organizations such as the ACC, the AHA, as well as patient organizations such as the FH Foundation are the ones who are running the research work at the moment, including Duke, as I said. We actually looked at those patients who received a PCSK9 and those who didn't, and actually show there's no clinical difference in the patients themselves. This type of burden I think is going to start putting the pressure on the payers.","Talking to the payers, they themselves are agreeing with us that the clinical data is important, and they need to expand access to appropriate patients. So we will continue to drive that interaction with them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory, you may begin your question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. I have a pretty commercial question on erenumab. I wonder if you can comment on early interactions you're having with payers on that front or maybe just general market research for the product. I guess specifically, I'm wondering how much of an impediment you expect access to be in the early days of that pending launch and how much your research may have factored into the strategic decision to further engage with Novartis.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So let me start, Cory, by just telling you about an interaction I had with my counterpart at Novartis yesterday. He and I have both been in recent contact with neurologists who specialize in treating patients with chronic migraine. And the two of us are quite elated at the level of excitement we're seeing amongst these physicians about having for the first time in decades a treatment opportunity to really help people who have this debilitating disease. It truly is one of those symptomatic diseases where if you've got a migraine, you really know about it, and it impacts how you run your life. Can you run your life or can you be a good caregiver?","We are starting our discussions with the payers right now. We are helping them see the data from a clinical perspective. Obviously, the real negotiation can only start once we have the label, and we look forward to having that in the next couple months or so.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Josh, you may begin your question.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. If you can, help us understand the market segmentation in asthma, really the issue with AMG 157 again versus some of the other novel biologics targeting the IL4 side pathways (58:46). Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. The question was a little bit hard to hear, Josh, but I think, Sean, why don't you take the first crack at it?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yes, what I would say is that it's still early days for a lot of the therapies that are still in development. But as you look across the biologics landscape in asthma, there's a few things that are clear. One is that in aggregate, asthma is an enormous opportunity from the perspective of the unmet need and the number of patients who are, for example, having to take courses of oral corticosteroids throughout the course of the year to manage their disease, which is very problematic for them.","And I think what you're seeing is that many of the mechanisms that are either out there now in biologics or being developed currently are segmented to populations that, for example, have high eosinophilic counts, atopic phenotype, et cetera. And in the case of TSLP, what we like about TSLP is it is a very upstream kind of a mediator of this inflammation. And our expectation is that we could have a very broad impact on patients with activity across the spectrum of patient phenotypes within the asthma disease spectrum, which would make it a very attractive therapeutic option.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny, you may begin your question.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening and thank you for taking my question. I guess the Supreme Court have been looking at the biosimilar law today. In the case they side with you and find that shall means will, can you give us a feel for what will happen with the biosimilars that have already launched for Neulasta? Will they have to come back into the full patent dance? Essentially, if you win this case, what does it mean in terms of delay of biosimilar Neulasta approvals or launches?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","I think there are a couple things in your question there, Ronny. Let me tease apart the two pieces of it. First, as you know, the Supreme Court reviewed this today, and so we'll know within a matter of weeks. Obviously, we think the 180-day needs to be enforced as it was written in the law. But with respect \u2013 I think you must have been referring to the short-acting competitors to NEUPOGEN.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","No, I was talking about the patent dance and impact of Neulasta biosimilar launches. Essentially, if you win that, will the biosimilar Neulasta be delayed?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","I guess I'm not sure what you mean by delayed. I think again, the big picture here, Ronny, is that we've known for some time that we'll face biosimilar competition. We're expecting that that will happen for Neulasta, and we're ready for that. You've seen the actions that we've been taking over the past couple years to be ready for that. And we're ready to embrace the competition, and we've positioned the company from an operating expense standpoint with the knowledge that that competition is coming, and we're launching medicines and entering markets that we think will help us grow beyond that. So the 180-day is obviously post-FDA approval, so we're watching different competitive products make their way through the regulatory pathway.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","If I could then, in terms of the guidance we've offered, there are none that have been approved yet to compete with Neulasta. There's one that's lined up I think in the third quarter here. So if it were approved and the 180-day stands, then that would imply, as we've indicated, that we could face competition as soon as late this year, and that's how our guidance is built right now.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia, you may begin your question.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just again on Neulasta, I know Onpro is picking up momentum. But I'm just trying to figure out if you think \u2013 how do you think this helps defend you against biosimilar share? Is it as simple as that the market is remodeling itself, and so it delays and prolongs some of the competition that you may see, or is there some other dynamic we should be aware of? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Alethia, it's Tony. So let me go back to a comment I made on the last quarter earnings. Let's use MD Anderson as an example of probably one of the premier large oncology teaching centers in the country. It took MD Anderson almost \u2013 just over 12 months to go through their P&T committee to get an agreement within the institution to start shifting patients to Onpro. And the rationale was they were really having a good look at the clinical value, the treatment protocols, the discharge protocols, and they finally agreed that this product was certainly worthwhile having.","We spent a number of weeks training their 600 oncology nurses so they were able to really identify the right patient, administer the drug before patients went home, and they have therefore changed the clinical practice. The feedback we get from both the oncology nurses, the oncologists themselves, and patients in fact about the fact they no longer have to come back 24 hours later or a day after their chemotherapy when they're in the middle of chemo-induced nausea and vomiting is a huge advantage and allows them a better quality of life.","So we really believe that the benefit this drug brings is not simply a device. It is really something that allows patients to continue to live their lives whilst being treated for cancer. It also has resulted in changes, definitive changes in discharge protocols, which we think will take some time to be reversed if there's no other alternative.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Yes, it's worth keeping in mind the big picture here, Alethia. There's some data in a peer review publication from this week recognizing that there are 100,000 hospitalizations a year in this country from patients who suffer from an infection while undergoing chemotherapy, and of course that's what NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are designed to address. And any product like Onpro that can help prevent some number of those infections is an important product. So there's still an important need in the marketplace. This innovative delivery device enables us to meet a large portion of that need.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Derek, let's go with the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Geoffrey, you may begin your question.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on the question about erenumab, Bob, could you take us through your thinking about the partnering decision? Because you're in a strong net cash position. You've got robust cash flow. You've got plenty of space in your R&D given the sequential trend, and yet you partner one of your two late-stage products for what certainly looks like it's a fairly specialized prescriber base initially. So could you talk a little bit about that, and then also how you'll be collaborating with Novartis on the launch? Particularly, who will be setting price and how you're thinking about price? Thanks. Sorry for the complicated question.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","No, that's fine, Geoff. We'll take it in two parts. Why don't I take the first piece? Then we'll have Tony address some of the specifics in your question.","We recognize and we're excited about the opportunity to have a first-in-class and a molecule that we think has a good chance to be best-in-class for a disease where there just aren't good therapies available today, so we're excited about that. But at the same time, Geoff, I think there is a specialty element of this that we don't have experience in. Novartis has been in the neurology neuroscience field for some 60 odd years now, and so they have a real established track record there. And as we interacted with them first with respect to the international markets, I think we came to realize there were opportunities to create a bigger opportunity by combining forces than by going it alone in the international markets.","We've come to know and share and respect each other's capabilities over the time since that agreement went into place. And as we looked at the opportunity in the U.S. and our desire to make sure we resource this to win, including getting off to a strong start with the specialist prescribers, it was our view that our shareholders were going to be better served by our joining up with somebody that had a very established presence in this field. So that's our view, and I think all of our interactions since then make us feel confident that that was the right decision for the shareholders. But, Tony, why don't you add your thoughts?","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Sure, we've been working with Novartis now from a global research perspective and a global marketing perspective for some time. So the teams have gotten to know each other quite well. My counterpart and I have been drawn into these discussions with these experts, as I said, and he and I are becoming even more increasingly excited about the opportunity to deliver a first-in-class product like this to patients in need. He and I both have experience in terms of launching products in the U.S. over the last five years or so, and we understand some of the barriers and some of the challenges. But we also understand the large unmet need over here.","It's clear to us that a strong start in terms of having a clear group of physicians who realize the importance of treating patients properly is going to be important to place pressure on the entire payer system to ensure we can get access. They have a very good presence in the neuroscience market. The feedback we've had from third-party research has shown their team and their medical team are very well regarded, and this strong relationship in our mind will support the ability to launch fast, launch rapidly, and be highly effective in the initial uptake. So they're a good team to be with. We will work closely with them, and I think we can maximize our ability to bring value to patients.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","And, Geoff, as regard to your questions about operational details, obviously those are topics that we discuss with them in detail before we move forward. And we think between the two of us, we think we've got those details worked out. But again, we're excited to have this partnership in hand and we look forward to getting this molecule approved so we can get out and help patients with it.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, good luck. Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Ian, you may begin your question.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you, just another question on Repatha. You made a comment that payers could potentially make some changes over the coming months. I was just hoping to clarify. Are those changes in prior authorization, or are they just payers being more diligent in making sure the right patients are getting access to the therapy? And as I think about ACC.8 (1:09:38), the guideline changes in some of the answers you provided, do you need those changes \u2013 do you need the new guidelines to state lower LDL goals, or what else, what other type of changes could we see which would benefit the PCSK9 class overall?","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So, Ian, it's Tony again. So clearly, everything here is driven from the interpretation and understanding about outcomes data, that fundamentally this product, Repatha, on top of maximally tolerated statins, which is the gold standard to date, is able to drive LDL down further and reduce even more dramatically the risk of heart attack and stroke. So the discussions with the payers are consistently around the utilization management criteria to make sure that the burden is less onerous for physicians, that they and patients are able to get access to products quicker and faster.","White papers or position papers from professional cardiology organizations are really essential to start paving the way to ensure we move towards the guidelines down the road. But they factor, the good clinical data is what's important. Payers have said to us from the beginning that yes, they see the drug lowers LDL, but they need to understand what that means. The outcomes data now shows you what that means, and all our discussions have been, if we are to renegotiate a contract, it is based around the payers' willingness to amend and make more simple the utilization management criteria.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer, you may begin your question.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two pipeline questions, if I may. On romosozumab, the upcoming ARCH trial, what percentage of patients were enrolled in Latin America?","And secondly on CGRP, I noticed you have a TREADMILL CV safety trial that wrapped up earlier in the year. Any update and\/or feedback from that, and was that a study that FDA asked you to do? Thank you.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, so with respect to ARCH, the percentage of patients in Latin America, I don't remember an exact number, but it is substantially less that it was in the FRAME study, but it is still meaningful. So I think it's about 30% roughly, whereas it was higher than that in FRAME.","But I think it's important to recognize that it wasn't the part of the world that the drug was being administered that was the problem. It was the fact that the fracture rates in a placebo-controlled population where physicians were very hesitant to put high-risk individuals into the trial because of the placebo arm, that the fracture rate was so low that we really didn't have any opportunity to demonstrate a further lowering of the fracture rate. And we don't expect that phenomenon in FRAME because the patients that were enrolled were by definition, by protocol, much higher risk. They had to have had prevalent fracture already. They have had much lower T-scores and so on, because in this case, patients are either getting romosozumab followed by alendronate, or alendronate from the get-go with no placebo control. So I wouldn't focus so much around the question of Latin America, although that was where we saw the problem with the very low event rates.","And then the other piece to keep in mind is that we do have an event-driven analysis for non-vertebral fracture in ARCH which we didn't have in FRAME. And that also, as you know, addresses this event number powering problem that you can run into, which is essentially the wall we hit in FRAME.","With respect to CGRP, I think it's a very good question. One of the things that I learned from talking with people at the meetings in Boston is that the real question in most neurologists' mind right now about the CGRP class remains long-term safety and tolerability. They're very impressed with the efficacy data. They're very impressed with the tolerability and safety that have been observed to date in relatively short exposures in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 study. And so I think there are a number of things that we have been doing specifically as a company, like we have over three years of long-term exposure in open-label extension studies. Other companies, to our knowledge, have not been doing this.","We did the CV TREADMILL study on our own volition because we felt that, again, these were going to be kind of questions that would exist in the marketplace. We have a number of pre-clinical and clinical studies, for example, on the impact on blood pressure and so on that would have been done specifically in anticipation of the kind of questions that prescribers will have around the long-term safety of the product. Many of these data are not broadly appreciated because they haven't come out in peer-reviewed publications and they haven't been necessarily presented in plenary type presentations like the Phase 3 data were. But in aggregate, I think these are going to be important and potentially differentiating data for the product.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","That's very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Carter, you may begin your question.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sean, I'll stick with the pipeline theme. On the BLINCYTO studies, you referenced the ALL B-cell (1:15:25). When do you think those data might be presented? Could those be registrational? And on CNP520, is there an interim built into that Alzheimer's study? Thank you.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yes, so the BLINCYTO studies are just enrolling now, so it's a little bit hard to project when we would be presenting data from them. That depends, of course, on a number of factors in terms of enrollment rate and when we might hit certain milestones with respect to interim analyses and so on. But the program is progressing on plan, and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace in the clinical trial investigator space, I should say, for the program.","And then with respect to the CNP520 program, there are some futility analyses built into the Alzheimer's study, which are designed to cut losses if we weren't seeing some kind of an effect. And I believe there may be also an early stopping efficacy interim late in the trial, though. I'd have to go back and look at the protocol to be sure about that.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Sean, not everybody might be familiar with CNP520. So you just might remind them (1:16:56)","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yes, so you might remember that this was highlighted in The Wall Street Journal the other day. Novartis and Amgen I think had come convergently to the opinion that we have extremely high confidence in the target itself, in large part because of the genetic validation work that was done on this target at deCODE. And so the question is really a question of when to intervene. And what we're doing in this study is enriching for a population, who based on their APOE genotype and age are very highly predisposed to converting from a normal cognitive capability to a minimally impaired cognitive capability. So we're going earlier than anyone else has done to date. This actually may be what's required to demonstrate a disease modifying effect.","So the molecule itself is a very high-quality small molecule BACE inhibitor that has been demonstrated to drop A-beta levels dramatically in CSF and all that good stuff. And the main issue strategically is to go in a little bit earlier in this population. And while this is a genetically defined population, about 60% of patients who actually develop Alzheimer's have one of these predisposing alleles. So it's not some tiny little population. It's genetically defined.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff, you may begin your question.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question, one for Tony or Sean. So in contrast to Repatha, you haven't had a lot of payer pushback on Prolia. So are there payer or pricing lessons to be learned when you think about the romo [romosozumab] launch in July and its combination with Prolia? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Let me take that one, Geoff. The major difference probably between the two is that the majority of Prolia sales are Part B, so it's a buy in bulk model, where Repatha is predominantly a Part D or a retail product we sell.","I think it's all around the value proposition, and we go back again to the day we presented at the ACC just to reconfirm that the present net price of Repatha in the marketplace is well within the range of the value proposition or the value-based pricing in fact for this particular product.","So I think the two things are different. There was a lot of speculation up front about how the PCSK9s could cost the market $150 billion or whatever it was, which resulted in some silly actions, I think, with all due respect. The drugs continue to show real good BAT value. We're happy to stand up and discuss it anywhere. And how the bank (1:19:54) would pay at the moment is how do you change the utilization management criteria, nothing else.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Chris, you may begin your question.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks. So just a broader question on the biologics market structure and maybe as it relates to your biosimilar business. So we were reading a white paper that I think you guys put out recently on the biosimilar market. I think you guys highlight a real problem. Even under a hypothetical scenario, I think your paper talked about how where a biosimilar is priced at, say, a 25% discount to the innovator, you still have a patient copay that's still higher than the innovative drug. I think in your paper it said almost 40% higher under Medicare Part D. So just curious, you guys seem as close as anyone to policy makers and directions to where this may go, and I know you devoted a great deal of time and energy towards your biosimilar business. I assume that there's an expectation here that some of these disincentives will go away. Can you maybe talk in broad terms how you think that might play out?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Tony, why don't you go ahead and take that?","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. One, I don't remember us putting out a white paper, so I just want to make sure that we're not being given authorship of something we didn't write because I'm unaware of Amgen putting out a white paper. We have said historically in the past that we believe that the biosimilar market will move much like a branded generic market; that the pricing in the beginning will be cautious; that the people who come to market and those who actually use biosimilars will be looking for a combination of quality, continuity of quality, continuity of supply, and the reputations of the organizations coming to market.","We believe that at Amgen we have a lot of good reputation. We have a 38-year history of never shorting a patient, of having quality product consistently on the marketplace. As we've gone through the process of actually developing these biosimilars ourselves, we've realized how tough it is to actually bring these drugs to market or how to develop them. We've spent time with regulators around the world making sure they understand what good looks like, that the rules and regulations are aligned with what we are doing.","There is some debate in the U.S. around linked J-codes between the brand versus the biosimilar. I think those are still being debated at the moment. But until then, it's an unlinked J-code, which means the reimbursement or copays are different. There's a lot happening in the marketplace, and how that could change, I can't speculate now.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Derek, as it's going on 6:30 on the East Coast, let's take two last questions.","Operator","Okay, absolutely. And your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun, you may begin your question.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, a question for Sean. In your collaboration with Arrowhead on RNAi therapies targeting cardiovascular diseases, what's your view on potential safety issues that may be related to RNAi-based therapies? And when do you expect to move into clinic? Thank you.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yes, I think that the siRNA technologies right now look good enough that in the case where the only way one can drug a target appears to be siRNA-based inhibition, it's a reasonable thing to pursue. And so that's what we're doing, for example, for LPa where we don't feel there's any other way to drug the target. It's not a derisked platform at this point, and there obviously are concerns. And I think that regulators are going to be very cautious in approving products early on that are based on this kind of novel platform, unless of course it's in a setting where there's very high unmet need and no other kind of options.","So we are exploring siRNA largely in settings in which the drug can't be \u2013 the target can't be interdicted in other ways, and also where we feel that the therapy would be unique in its ability to address that target. So LPa represents an example like that. We have other targets that we feel are potentially that way. And so at this point, we're moving that ahead. The program is really still in a preclinical stage, but it is moving very rapidly. The collaboration has been great. But I can't really give specific timelines of when it would be in the clinic at this point.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Let's take one last question, and then Bob will make a few closing comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed. Salim, you may begin your question.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in, just a question on romo maybe for Sean or for Tony. The non-vertebral data, guys, how are you thinking about that in terms of uptake? And then also will we be getting that non-vertebral data in the press release, either in a qualitative form or quantitative form, when we get the top line? Thank you.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yes. So what I would say is that having evidence of non-vertebral fracture impact is important for cytotherapeutics (1:25:56). Of course, the most important endpoint for physicians, payers, and patients is clinical fracture, which is the symptomatic vertebral fractures which can be very profoundly impactful to patients' quality of life, as well as the long-bone fractures or non-vertebral fractures. And there, we've seen good results, and that's one of the co-primary endpoints for ARCH as well. And I think that it is something that is an important variable. In the end, things like hip fracture are the real dreaded complications of osteoporosis. So having a sense from the aggregate data for a molecule that there can be protection in sites like the hip is important, and that's why we're anticipating ARCH keenly, as it's coming very soon.","I can't comment on what we exactly we'll decide to disclose in a press release. We are always focused on very complex embargo requirements by both the society clinical presentation venues as well as the journals that we're trying to publish in, and this can be quite an elaborate dance to figure out what we can put into our press releases in that setting.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it, thanks so much.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","All right, thank you all for your questions and for your time. We appreciate it. Maybe just a quick couple of quick thoughts from me and then we'll let you back to work. First, as you heard in our discussion, we're pleased with the volume growth, particularly from our newer products in the quarter. Clearly, there was some noise in the first quarter around Enbrel and the trends. But as you heard us say, we think the long-term trends for Enbrel are on track despite that noise in the marketplace in the first quarter.","And again, lastly, we think we've positioned the company well. And as a group here, we're excited about the future given the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Amgen. So thanks for your interest. We'll look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"2337":["Amgen, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session.","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Ian. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the time to participate in our second quarter results conference call today. We realize it's a very busy day with a number of companies reporting but, unfortunately, we are going to add to your already long day as we have a lot to discuss today.","Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will open up the discussion today with an overview of our business, the environment we operate in and management succession. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our financial results for the second quarter in some detail and provide updated guidance for 2018. Tony Hooper, who leads our Global Commercial Operations, will give you an update on how our products are performing, particularly those that have been launched recently. And then our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, will provide a pipeline update.","We will use slides to guide our discussion today and a link to these slides was sent separately. My customary reminder that we will use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. But before I do, I would like to sign a fun fact for the day. The crossword puzzle in The New York Times today, 30 down, the answer is Amgen.","So, with that, Bob, over to you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, Arvind. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. On today's call, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter performance, share some thoughts on the rapidly-changing U.S. healthcare environment and, of course, comment on the succession plans that we announced earlier today for two senior leaders you know very well, Sean Harper and Tony Hooper.","First, our performance. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute effectively on our long-term growth strategy, as we delivered 4% top-line growth and 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. An important part of our strategy is to increasingly focus on volume-driven growth, and our results reflect the progress that we're making on that objective.","Unit volumes increased, in many cases by double-digits, for all our newer products, including Repatha, KYPROLIS, Prolia and XGEVA. We also continue to generate strong volume-driven growth outside the U.S., where our legacy brands have faced competition now for many years. This includes 9% growth in the second quarter. We remain confident that our newer product launches, as well as the medicines advancing through our pipeline, will enable us to drive attractive, volume-driven growth globally over the long-term.","Let me give you a few examples of some of the newer medicines that we're seeing driving our growth. In the second quarter, we launched Aimovig in the U.S., where it is the first and only CGRP inhibitor approved for migraine prevention. Aimovig also marks Amgen's first entry into a new therapeutic area for us, which is neuroscience. We've been very encouraged by the enthusiastic reception for Aimovig from physicians and especially from migraine patients who have waited a long time for a new treatment option like this.","We're also encouraged by the progress we're making with Repatha which we believe can play an important role in the fight against cardiovascular disease, the world's number one killer. As you know, Repatha significantly lowers LDL cholesterol, which is a leading, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We have and will continue to work to expand access to Repatha globally.","Building on our decades of leadership in nephrology, we're seeing strong early adoption of Parsabiv, which is the first new treatment in more than a decade for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis. And, lastly, I'm pleased to report that we recently launched our first biosimilar, KANJINTI, which is a biosimilar to Herceptin in Europe.","We've put a strategic stake in the ground a few years ago to build a world-class biosimilars business, and we continue to believe that biosimilars represent a meaningful growth opportunity for us. We look forward to launching AMGEVITA, which is our biosimilar to Humira internationally later this year, and to launching a steady stream of biosimilars in the years to come.","My comments on biosimilars provide a good transition to a discussion of the healthcare environment in the U.S. As you know, just this past week, the FDA published its Biosimilar Action Plan. We're encouraged by the FDA's actions as well as by others in the Trump administration, and we welcome the opportunity for open dialog. Although we believe biosimilars can help address the issue of rising healthcare costs in general and concerns over drug pricing in particular, we also recognize that biosimilars alone aren't enough.","Fundamentally, we believe that innovation is the key to alleviating the massive financial burden placed on society by chronic diseases like cancer, neurologic disorders and cardiovascular disease. And without innovation and improved access to it, the burden of chronic disease, which already runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars annually for any single one of these diseases, will only grow larger as the population ages.","And we'll continue to work with our colleagues in the industry to engage with the administration, Congress and the entire healthcare community to find ways to promote innovation, while also ensuring that our medicines are accessible and affordable for the patients who need them. We appreciate the administration's engagement on this important issue. And as to prices, we made decision a few months ago not to increase the prices of any of our medicines at midyear, and we have no plans to change that for the balance of the year.","My final order of business before I turn the call over to David Meline is to discuss the executive succession announcements that we issued today. One of the hallmarks of a well-run company is the carefully considered succession planning process, and I believe that Amgen has done this well through our nearly 40-year history. And I'm confident we'll do so again as Sean Harper and Tony Hooper step-down from their roles in anticipation of their forthcoming retirements.","I can't express strongly enough my deep appreciation for the contributions these two leaders have made to Amgen. They've played a critical role in transforming Amgen into the company we are today and their legacies will continue in the teams they've built and the patients that we'll serve. And above all, Sean and Tony have maintained a relentless focus on Amgen's mission to serve patients and we're a better company for it.","As you all know, I have great respect and admiration for Sean and Tony and they've been great partners and colleagues. And while they leave big shoes to fill, I'm excited about the two leaders who are succeeding them and I know Sean and Tony are committed to working with me and my team to ensure that our new leaders successfully transition into their roles.","Now, let me start with Dave Reese, who is known to many of you and is someone that I've worked closely with over the past decade. Dave has been with Amgen since 2005 and he's been closely involved with virtually all of the medicines that have emerged from our pipeline since then. An oncologist by training, Dave has led discovery research and parts of clinical development and he's also played a critical role in building our early-stage oncology pipeline, particularly our portfolio of BiTE molecules which we find especially promising.","His background includes past faculty appointments at UCLA and UCSF, and we're excited to have him assuming the new responsibilities here at Amgen today. Dave has joined us on the call and he'll have an opportunity to say a few words a little later this afternoon.","Meanwhile, Tony's successor, Murdo Gordon, will be joining us in September from Bristol-Myers Squibb, where he most recently served as Chief Commercial Officer. His experience and capabilities are a perfect fit for where we are going strategically. Murdo has global experience at a time when we're looking to continue to expand our geographic presence.","He's operated in a number of our core therapeutic areas of focus, including cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation and oncology. And in addition, during his time at Bristol, Murdo led Commercial Operations in the U.S., which, as you know, is our largest market, and also had responsibility for value and access, which as I discussed earlier is an increasingly important component of today's dynamic healthcare environment.","Tony will be at his role through much of the third quarter and he'll join us in welcoming Murdo on this earnings call in October. I'm looking forward to having Murdo and Dave become part of our leadership team and both are exceptional, highly accomplished leaders well-suited for the opportunities ahead.","With that, let me turn to David Meline for financial highlights.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Bob. Overall, we're pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter as investments in support of our newer products delivered growth and our business continued to generate strong cash flow.","Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, worldwide revenues at $6.1 billion in the second quarter grew 4% year-over-year. Worldwide product sales at $5.7 billion in the second quarter grew 2% year-over-year as strong unit demand from our newer products outpaced declines in our mature brands. We're also encouraged by the sustained double-digit volume growth from our ex-U.S. markets.","Other revenues at $380 million increased $144 million year-over-year due to a milestone payment received related to our Aimovig partnership with Novartis. Non-GAAP operating income at $3.1 billion grew 2% from prior-year. Non-GAAP operating margin at 55.1% for the quarter.","As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of the year driven by the timing of expenses. As mentioned last quarter, we continued to evaluate incremental investments in our products and pipeline as well as external opportunities to drive growth and maximize shareholder value.","On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased by 0.4 points to 13.1%, driven by higher manufacturing cost and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower royalty revenue \u2013 expense. Research and development expenses at $850 million or 15% of product sales were relatively unchanged in the second quarter of 2018 versus last year. For the full year, we expect research and development expense as a percent of product sales to be comparable to 2017 levels.","SG&A expenses increased 14% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by investments in product launches and marketed product support. We expect Q3 and Q4 spend levels to be consistent with Q2 as we continue to invest in our launch and growth products. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year. Other income and expenses were a net $185 million expense in Q2. This is unfavorable by $29 million on a year-over-year basis.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.2% for the quarter, a 3.2 point decrease versus the second quarter of 2017, due to the impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform, offset partially by a prior-year benefit associated with the effective settlement of certain state and federal tax matters. Non-GAAP net income increased 5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 17% year-over-year for the second quarter to $3.83 a share.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7. The company generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2018 versus $2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2017, driven by higher cash taxes resulting from the first installment of the repatriation tax paid in Q2 of 2018, partially offset by lower ongoing income tax liability as well as higher net income. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitment to deploy excess cash over time.","In Q2, we deployed $3.2 billion to repurchase 18.2 million shares at an average of $175 per share. Further, we plan to deploy an incremental $3 billion to $5 billion for share repurchase in the second half of 2018. Lastly, our second quarter dividend increased to $1.32 per share, an increase of 15% over last year.","Cash and investments totaled $29.4 billion, a decrease of $10 billion from the second quarter of last year. This decrease over the last 12 months was primarily driven by $19 billion of cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, partially offset by over $10 billion of free cash flow generated in the same period. Our debt balance stands at $34.5 billion as of June 30, carrying a weighted-average interest rate of 3.9% and an average maturity of 11.7 years.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2018 on page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing in our pipeline, building out our global presence and increasing spend in support of long-term volume growth across large patient populations, while delivering solid business performance.","Today, we are revising our 2018 guidance, which reflects our strong Q2 performance and outlook for the second half of the year. Our latest revenue guidance is $22.5 billion to $23.2 billion versus prior guidance of $21.9 billion to $22.8 billion. This guidance reflects our solid performance to-date as well as our confidence of continued good performance while recognizing uncertainties related to potential new competition for Neulasta and Aranesp and a range of potential Sensipar generic competition outcomes.","With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are revising the outlook to $13.30 to $14 per share versus previous guidance of $12.80 to $13.70 per share. We are reaffirming our prior non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million this year. In this regard, we are breaking ground on our new manufacturing facility in Rhode Island in the next week.","This concludes the financial update. I turn the call over now to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you very much, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find our product sales starting on slide number 10. I'm also pleased to report we delivered a solid second quarter, with 2% year-over-year product sales growth.","Let me first add to Bob and David's comments regarding our focus on volume-driven growth. We recognized early on that the evolving U.S. landscape should lead us to focus investments in brands that serve large patient populations in addition to our traditional focus on more targeted specialized therapies. We also made the strategic decision to advance and bring to market a broad biosimilar portfolio. We're making good progress on all these fronts.","As evidence, you can see our strong growth in Prolia and Repatha and our early success with Aimovig, three medicines that treat diseases affecting tens of millions around the world. We're also now in the market with our first biosimilar with several more to follow. In addition, our continued volume growth outside the U.S. serves as a model for what growth in the U.S. can look like in the future.","With regard to U.S. pricing, in evaluating factors contributing to our reported sales growth, changes in net selling price had minimal to no impact over the last 18 months, and we expect that trend to continue going forward. We've not increased the list prices of any of our medicines since the administration's drug pricing blueprint was issued. And in May, we decided not to execute list price increases that have been planned for July. This reflects our commitment to identifying opportunities to improve affordability and access for patients. While there is no simple fixes, we want to be part of the solution.","To summarize our sales performance for the quarter, we continued to generate double-digit growth, primarily driven by volume for several of our newer products and those with label expansions such as KYPROLIS, XGEVA, BLINCYTO and Parsabiv. And, once again, sales growth outside the U.S. was very strong, increasing by 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by 14% volume growth.","Let me now turn to our brands. Prolia delivered another outstanding quarter, with sales increasing 21%, with 16% volume growth year-over-year and share gains in both the U.S. and international markets. Moving now to oncology, let me start with KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS grew 25% year-on-year, driven primarily by our ex-U.S. business. Our European business benefited this quarter from a $27 million clinical trial purchase. Just recently, we received approval to include overall survival data from the ASPIRE study to both the U.S. and EU labels. I'm also pleased to announce that we recently received reimbursement for KYPROLIS in France and we look forward to a rapid uptake in that country.","XGEVA grew 14% year-over-year, primarily from volume, as we expanded into multiple myeloma with our label update this January. Turning now to Neulasta where sales increased 1% year-over-year, but consistent with recent trends we saw slight reduction in the overall market segment in the second quarter, resulting in a small decline in volume.","We continue to drive the adoption of Onpro in the U.S. and exited quarter two at 63% share of Neulasta unit sales. Onpro's increased utilization underscores the value it provides to patients and providers, which we believe will be a clear differentiator versus potential competition. We expect to see more global utilization of Onpro in 2018, with recent launches in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, Ireland and Austria.","Regarding potential new entrants, we are prepared to compete if and when they enter the market and have years of experience competing in the short-acting G-CSF market across the globe as well as experience competing in select markets outside the U.S. in the long-acting GCF market. We're confident in our capabilities, and we know that reliability of quality supply is a key factor for our customers.","For NEUPOGEN, we exited the second quarter holding 37% of the short-acting segment in the U.S. Some of our competitors and public officials have made statements that the U.S. biosimilar market is not working. We have a different point of view. NEUPOGEN was the first major biologic to face biosimilar competition in the U.S. The fact that our biosimilar now holds the majority share of this segment less than three years post-launch proves that biosimilars can find a meaningful place in the U.S. market just as they have in Europe. This also gives us confidence in the future of the Amgen biosimilar portfolio.","With respect to remainder of our oncology portfolio, the combined sales of Nplate, Vectibix, IMLYGIC and BLINCYTO were $426 million in the quarter, representing 10% year-on-year growth with 11% coming from volume increases. Enbrel sales declined 11% year-over-year with market growth, segment share and net selling price constant with recent trends. You'll recall that second quarter 2017 benefited from a significant inventory build creating an unfavorable year-over-year comparison.","On a quarter-over-quarter basis, sales increased 18%. We continue to be pleased with the launch of Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch which has been met with positive feedback from both patients and physicians. Overall, we expect fundamental drivers of Enbrel to follow the recent trends.","Switching now to our ESA portfolio, EPOGEN declined 14% year-over-year due to competition and a lower net selling price driven by extended supply agreements with DaVita. Aranesp declined 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased competition.","We've been competing against a long-acting product in the independent and midsize dialysis organizations since the beginning of the year. We have volume and share-based contracts in place with some of these customers and we'll continue to compete on an account-by-account basis. We're also prepared to compete with the recently approved short-acting biosimilar in all customer segments, including hospitals and clinics. Nonetheless, we expect to lose some share in these segments once the product is available.","Let's now turn to our calcimimetics. Parsabiv has launched in several markets, including the U.S., where we have a solid uptake at the independent and mid-sized dialysis providers. Both FMC and DaVita continue to run pilots to determine the eventual treatment protocols. So looking ahead, we expect to see adoption continue to increase gradually over time.","Turning to Sensipar, sales declined 2% year-over-year with the launch of Parsabiv. As David mentioned, the 2018 outlook for Sensipar is still uncertain given the ongoing litigation. It remains possible that a generic competition may enter the market later this year.","Repatha sales grew 78% year-over-year, primarily from volume, as we continue to compete effectively, maintaining a majority share on a global basis. With outcomes data added to our label in the U.S. in December and more recently in Europe and Japan, our teams have been speaking directly to the benefits of treating patients with Repatha.","We've recently concluded negotiations to improve patient access in the U.S. with several payers, including, but not limited to, CVS and Anthem. These payers presently represent greater than 65% of Repatha's commercial revenue. As these changes take effect in the second-half of this year, we expect the proportion of commercial plans requiring documentation and the utilization management criteria to be cut in half with the rest relying on simple physician attestation.","In exchange for simpler, UM criteria, we have increased our rebates which will result in a lower net price. We recognize that the higher rebates unfortunately don't always result in lower out-of-pocket cost for patients. Therefore, we continue to work with a wide range of stakeholders on continued improvement in access.","We are, however, encouraged by the fact that physicians have consistently recognized the benefit of treating patients with Repatha and have demonstrated a strong demand for the drug even when faced with severe restrictions on reimbursement. Our priority remains reaching the large population of high-risk cardiovascular patients.","Now on to Aimovig, the first and only therapy specifically designed to prevent migraine by targeting and blocking the CGRP receptor. Patients and physicians share our excitement for this new therapy. And, as you know, we set up a hub to assist patients to gain early access to the product while we complete negotiations with payers. This program provides a free two-month trial of Aimovig.","We have, in fact, received a large bolus of requests from the Headache Centers of Excellence reflecting the pent-up demand for this innovative new therapy. We're busy working through these requests and expect to see the prescriptions coming through over the coming weeks.","Should a patient not be approved by the insurance during this two-month period, we have a bridging program during their negotiations to ensure that patients are not denied drug. Negotiations with payers are progressing well and we have successfully completed contracts to attain coverage for just under 30% of lives already.","We're also excited that we've launched our first biosimilar, KANJINTI, a biosimilar version of Herceptin in Europe. Biosimilars represent an important growth driver for Amgen and so far the market is behaving as we anticipated.","So, in closing, we continue to transition our portfolio, exemplified by volume-driven growth. I'm pleased with the execution and the consistency of performance in 2018. I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us. Let me close by thanking all the Amgen staff that work so hard to get these important products to patients and for a strong first half of 2018.","Let me now hand you over to Sean. Sean?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, all. I'll begin today with our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis. Tony spoke about our U.S. launch of Aimovig and the difference it's already making for migraine patients.","In addition to the U.S. approval in May, our partnership announced a CHMP positive opinion in the EU last month. And I'm pleased to announce that we recently submitted a Supplemental Biologic License Application in the United States for our 140 milligram SureClick autoinjector. We look forward to working closely with FDA to make this available to patients as soon as possible.","Also, in migraine, we expect the data from our proof-of-concept in dose-finding Phase 2 study of our PAC1 antibody for migraine prevention, AMG 301, to be available by the end of the year and presentation at a medical meeting in 2019. There have been a number of recent developments in Alzheimer's disease clinical programs in our industry, so I thought it would be useful to highlight our partnership's ongoing beta secretase inhibitor program and why we have such confidence in our approach.","AMG 520 or CNP520 is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of BACE1, a target with strong genetic human validation from deCODE that is part of our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis. We're taking a differentiated approach with this clinical program and are currently enrolling two Phase 3 studies.","In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid precursor protein cleavage products such as Abeta begin accumulating decades before symptoms present. And by the time a patient is symptomatic, Abeta accumulation has reached a plateau and significant neurodegeneration and subsequent inflammation have already occurred.","Therefore, we've always felt that potential treatments should be administered as early as is feasible in trials attempting to demonstrate disease modification. So our partnership in collaboration with the Banner Institute (sic) [Alzheimer's Institute] (00:29:16) is focused on a population of pre-symptomatic cognitively normal subjects who based on their APOE genotype and age are very highly predisposed to developing cognitive impairment.","One study is enrolling approximately 1,300 APOE4 homozygotes, that is subjects with two copies of the APOE4 risk allele and a second study is enrolling approximately 2,000 subjects, either APOE4 homozygotes or heterozygotes which have one APOE risk allele and evidence of brain amyloid accumulation.","While we're studying a genetically defined population, it's a large and representative one, as approximately 60% of patients who develop Alzheimer's disease have at least one of these predisposing disease alleles. We haven't been surprised by how the Alzheimer's clinical landscape has played out of late and the recent disappointments and potential signals of efficacy have not changed our overall conviction around our program, particularly that a small molecule BACE1 inhibitor administered pre-symptomatically is likely to be the best approach to address this pathway and disease.","In oncology, I'm happy to report we've completed enrollment in two Phase 3 studies, our study of KYPROLIS plus DARZALEX and dexamethasone versus KYPROLIS and dexamethasone alone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and our IMLYGIC combination study with KEYTRUDA in unresectable metastatic melanoma.","Turning to our early-stage oncology pipeline, we've advanced a number of programs into clinical testing as reflected on slide 26. And by the end of this year, we expect initial Phase 1 data from our BCMA BiTE, AMG 420, in multiple myeloma and our CD33 BiTE, AMG 330, in AML. We look forward to additional data from other BiTE programs over the next year or two, including both liquid and solid tumors.","We've also deprioritized AMG 224, our BCMA antibody-drug conjugate, based on early data reads from our AMG 224 and AMG 420 programs that support our view that our BiTE technology may be superior to current ADC technologies. Finally, on Nplate, we recently submitted an application in the U.S. for pediatric immune thrombocytopenia.","In other regulatory news beyond the KYPROLIS update that Tony discussed, we received a Repatha label update incorporating our cardiovascular outcomes data and full approval for BLINCYTO in the EU and Prolia was approved for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in both the U.S. and EU.","Also, in our bone franchise, we resubmitted our EVENITY Biologics License Application for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. Finally, in our biosimilars development programs, in addition to our KANJINTI approval that Tony discussed, we received Phase 3 data from ABP 710, our biosimilar of Remicade in rheumatoid arthritis, that we believe demonstrates similarity to a referenced product.","In closing, as always, I'd like to thank our staff for continuing to deliver for patients. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Sean. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, Sean, if you'd like to say a few words as I guess this is your swan song earnings call. Why don't you feel free to share your thoughts? And then we'll invite Dave Reese to say a few words and then open up for questions.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Right. Well, this was, of course, an exceedingly difficult life decision for me given the wonderful experience I've had over more than 16 years at Amgen. I love the mission, the people, the science and technology, and all of these are the best they've ever been, not to mention the relationships I have based on mutual trust and respect with you, Bob, and many other Amgen leaders and staff.","That said, it's rare in our industry to have the opportunity to personally hire from academia and develop over more than a dozen years such a capable individual as David Reese as a successor for Head of R&D. As you all know, succession for this particular role can be very challenging. Dave is truly ready and just, as importantly, after 21 years in the industry, I'm ready for a change, likely to early biotech company creation here in this local area of California.","Dave is a medical oncologist who was on faculty at UCLA, when I recruited him to Amgen and he served in a variety of increasingly senior roles since his hire in 2005. These have included late-stage clinical development, discovery research and as our Head of Translational Sciences and oncology programs. In this last role, he's introduced all of our current pipelines into the \u2013 molecules into the clinic.","Many of you know Dave from his presence in our investor events. If not, you're going to really enjoy getting to know him. He has my full confidence and that of my team as the next Head of R&D for Amgen. I'll be staying around through the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition.","Finally, I'd like to thank everyone at Amgen and in the investment community for the support I've received over the years. It's been a privilege to be part of the evolution of this great American company and to have such high-quality interactions with our investors and analysts.","Dave, welcome to earnings call-land. Why don't you make a few comments?","David M. Reese - Amgen, Inc.","Well, thank you, Sean, and thank you for your partnership. It's certainly been a highlight of my career over the last 13 years. I'd like to emphasize that we're dedicated to our core mission of advancing science for the benefit of patients. We'll continue to focus on developing medicines that produce large effect sizes in serious diseases where there is significant unmet medical need.","I've been a part of the R&D leadership team for some time as Sean mentioned. And I also believe that the commitment that we've made to using human genetics to understand the origins of disease and to suggest therapeutic interventions is the right choice and in fact will become increasingly important in our drug discovery enterprise.","Likewise, I'm convinced the platforms such as our BiTE technology, and other therapeutic modalities have the potential to deliver transformative medicines. Having led our Translational Sciences efforts for some time, I cannot be more excited about our preclinical and clinical pipelines.","At the same time, it's undeniable that we've entered a period of remarkable technological ferment leading to both a deeper understanding of disease, and providing a wide array of new technologies that will change how we do science at the bench and advance molecules in the clinic. In light of this, I'm extraordinarily enthusiastic about the opportunities in front of us and I look forward to keeping Amgen at the forefront of this rapidly-changing industry.","I also very much look forward to working with all of you in the investment community as we focus on creating value through delivering our pipeline. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Dave. Let's open it up for questions now and we'll ask our operator just to remind you all of the procedures for doing that. Ian, over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter and congrats to both, Tony and Sean. So first one I have a high level question. You guys bought back $3.2 billion stock in second quarter in addition to the $10 billion buyback in first quarter. And then there's another plan to do a $3 billion to $5 billion in second half. Does this suggest anything about your strategic thinking about M&A transactions, given the large buyback?","And then, secondly, maybe I want to see if you have any comments on the potential entry of Neulasta biosimilar in the second half. We saw Mylan priced at 33% discount on list price level. So what's the assumption on the second half run rate for Neulasta? And what's your defense strategy on Neulasta? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. There's quite a lot there, Ying. Let's break it into two-parts. Start with David Meline in response to your question on capital allocation. Then we'll ask Tony just to reiterate what he said in the call.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. So on capital allocation, I think, we've been quite clear in the past and we haven't changed our point of view, which is how we create value as an enterprise is investing in innovative medicines either internally through our own R&D efforts and also we're very active looking for opportunities externally to add to the portfolio. And so we'll continue to do that.","What's also true is I think we all know we have a tremendous capability for cash generation, and we have a large amount of excess cash following tax reform. And we are committed to return excess cash through time to shareholders. So I wouldn't read our ongoing repurchase activities to be anything other than following on that commitment and I would definitely not read that we're backing off from our commitment to continue to add to our pipeline and our portfolio.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So as regards the Neulasta biosimilar, I mean clearly we have been competing in the marketplace with NEUPOGEN and biosimilars for a number of years now. The team stands ready and able to compete. We have a long legacy and history of reliable and consistency of quality supply. We have spent quite a bit of time converting the market to the Onpro device, which is a unique and innovative device which is beneficial for both clinical practice and for patients themselves. And I think there's quite a difference in the marketplace between the list price of these drugs and the ASP price.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question. And I guess, Sean, this might be your last call so I wanted to ask you a question. And that was you highlighted Alzheimer's and perhaps you could opine, obviously, on your view since you are running different studies in APOE carriers and non-carriers, whether there is truly a difference there and whether there's a difference in progression and opine on the debate, of course, this week.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Well, Michael, I think that we've been able to utilize data that we've accumulated in Iceland through deCODE who, as you know, have done some of the really seminal breakthrough genetics and epidemiology and in Alzheimer's to understand the rate of cognitive decline that occurs in patients who have 01 or 2 of the APOE4 alleles. And that plus age allows one to make some estimates of when people who are cognitively normal will begin to develop some cognitive impairment in the context of a disease-modifying trial.","So we've had the advantage of that information, and that's what led us with Novartis to move toward this kind of a genetic stratification of the population. And we again expect because we are looking at this type of enriched population that we'll be able to conduct in a feasible way these trials which otherwise it would be very difficult to conduct if you were taking patients who were cognitively normal and didn't have these high risks for conversion in the reasonably near future, try to engage in a clinical trial.","So it is a differentiated approach and I think an important one. And as I stressed before, it's not like a little proof-of-concept experiment in some tiny subset of patients with a genetic risk factor. This is 60% of the people who present with Alzheimer's disease have one or two APOE risk alleles.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So before my question let me say congratulations to Sean and Tony on their tenure and good luck as they move on and welcome to Dave. So, Tony, I was hoping a question for you. You mentioned a little bit about Aimovig. I was hoping if you could provide some insight into two factors. So we're obviously seeing the scripts but we don't really have a good idea of the translation of those scripts for free drug into revenue.","So I don't know if you're willing to just give us any thoughts around how we should be thinking about the script trajectory versus your ability to generate revenue from them. And then second item is you talked about having about 30% of the lives with coverage already. Could you just talk a little bit about what's the utilization management criteria that you've been able to negotiate for that? And do you think that's suggestive of the UM that we should expect for the rest of the plan? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Sure, Matthew. So I want to start by saying I think from what I've seen anecdotally from both physicians and from patients, the response to Aimovig in the marketplace is beyond our expectations, right. So patients are really finding this to be a definitive difference in the way of managing their migraines. We knew we'd have a little bit of an issue in the beginning as we sort of put the contracts into place. So we created the hub together with Novartis to ensure all patients referred into the hub first to allow them access if they didn't already have coverage to the two-month free program.","Right now, the majority of our business is in free drug, but we are rapidly converting that business to paid prescriptions. And you'll see as the bolus comes through the hub, there's been quite a dramatic change in the number of patients that happened in the last week or so. And we expect this to get back to a steady state in the next three or four weeks or so.","In terms of those organizations who were visionary enough to move rapidly to give access to patients who have been struggling with this devastating disease for a long time, the UM criteria has been pretty clear. We always assume the drug will be used as a second line when patients have failed on existing generic therapies and that's where it is, but all the plans at the moment only require physician at a station, right? So, no documentation, just a physician stating very clearly the patient has already tried some other products.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Got a question on co-pay accumulators. So I think last quarter, Tony, I think you indicated that you don't anticipate seeing any impact in the first half but we're now in the thick of Q3 and from most modeling of these types of plans it looks like much of the impact is likely to be in the summer. So I guess maybe can you describe \u2013 and also, one of your big competitors actually lowered guidance for one of their drugs as a result of impact here. Can you maybe just talk about the dynamic impacting Enbrel in particular? And I know there's a few countermeasures that you and other folks in the industry have talked about taking but maybe give an update as to how effective those countermeasures are and where things stand with this thing? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Sure. So I'm not going to talk about what the countermeasures are that we've put into place. They're clearly competitive. But I have looked very closely at the potential impact of accumulator programs on Enbrel both in the first quarter where I saw minimal to nothing and again for the second quarter where I saw minimal to nothing and I'm not forecasting much in the third quarter beyond.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I figured I'll ask both Tony and Sean a question each. So, perhaps first, Sean, maybe just a little confusion on your response on one of the prior questions on AMG 520. I guess what I'm asking is why not enroll non-carriers? Do you think they'll perform better and it'll be harder to tease out a signal? Just want to understand why not have it in your Phase 3 program?","And then, Tony, my question to you was just to clarify how Neulasta's economics work the way it's structured currently in the face of biosimilars? And specifically what I was looking to understand was, A, is any part of Onpro reimbursed via Part D as in David? And then also the economics, how they work for 340Bs versus clinics, and whether some part of market could be rebated more or could be more defendable, that kind of thing? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. A lot of questions there. We'll try to take those one at a time.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Right. So with respect to the strategy we're using, so the way to think about it is that we're focused on testing people before it's potentially too late to be able to show disease modification. And so we believe that means that people have to be cognitively normal on an intense battery of cognitive testing. But if you imagine bringing people in who don't have a predisposing genetic driver to have them be very likely to develop the cognitive impairment in the relatively near future, you're going to be doing this study forever.","So what we decided to do was basically enrich for people who have both a certain age and the APOE status that they were likely to have enough events of people going from cognitively normal to cognitively impaired during the course of a trial that won't take forever. And given that this represents 60% of people with Alzheimer's disease, it seems like a pretty reasonable strategy to me.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So as regards Neulasta, Umer, all of Neulasta's Part B. Nothing is in Part D. From a reimbursement perspective, Part B is obviously under ASP plus. ASP depends on what your prices are today and what they'll evolve to be in a few quarters time. As Amgen, as a company, we've always presented our position very strongly to both the environment and to CMS and the government that we prefer a level playing field between our sales and biosimilars in the future and allow normal competitive factors in the marketplace to allow us to compete equally.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Ian, let's take the next question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions, and best of luck to Sean and Tony on next steps and congrats to Dave. Maybe first just for Tony on Repatha. Was wondering what percent of lives now have the eased utilization management criteria. And with the new treatment guidelines expected later this year do you think that'll have a further impact on access? And then maybe just for Sean on AMG 301 you mentioned the PAC1 antibody. What are you hoping to see from this Phase 2 trial and if it's positive could you move right into Phase 3? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. So again a couple questions there, Repatha, the utilization management question and then how guidelines may affect.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So as I said, about 65% of our business at the moment is going to move towards at a station only. And in terms of total evolution of the commercial business that's probably between 25% and 40% of the total lives available. I think as we continue to negotiate the other plans we will get better utilization management criteria. I do believe we're going to get better access. The drug is proving to be something that physicians and cardiologists are prescribing consistently continually and the demand from patients is still there.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. And, Terence, for AMG 301, our PAC1 antibody receptor antagonist, we're doing something very similar to what we did with Aimovig where the proof-of-concept trial also includes the dose ranging, all predicated on some dermal blood flow assays that were done in healthy subjects to pinion the dose ranging. So if we're successful in demonstrating proof-of-concept, hopefully we also would have enough dose information to be able to proceed directly into Phase 3 as we were able to do with Aimovig, but, of course, we'll see. This is a novel pathway that needs to be validated in humans through this experiment.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners LLC.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much and repeat the congratulations to Tony and to Sean. One quick question, perhaps for Bob on rebates. Could you give us a sense of what impact elimination of the Safe Harbor for rebating would have on Amgen's product access and price? And then I hate to sort of pursue this Alzheimer's question again, but, Sean, could you talk as you're sort of looking at leaving Amgen, what are the barriers to exploring all the sensible combination ideas that might be out there in Alzheimer's given all the frustration that the industry has had with single product trials?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, Geoff. Maybe I'll answer your rebate question in two parts. I'll start, and then, Tony, you can jump in. So big picture, Geoff, as you know, the discussion about rebates is underway. The administration has asked for perspectives, and we've participated with our industry colleagues in sharing our thoughts about this.","We think that the administration is focusing on an important topic here, which is rebates and the impact that the rebate structure in our industry has on patient affordability. So we welcome an opportunity to be able to share our industry perspectives with decision makers in the government, and that process is underway. It's a little bit premature I think to talk about what the specifics of your question were on our business, but I'll invite Tony to share his thoughts.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So the only thing I could add to what Bob was saying is that clearly in competitive markets your rebates tend to be higher. And so the gap between your list price and your net price tends to get quite large, none of which allows patients to benefit from, of course, because they're paying co-pays, co-insurance or deductibles based on the list price. If the rebates went away, by definition your list prices would get closer to net prices, and patients would be able to access drug better.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","And maybe one last thought \u2013 sorry, Geoff \u2013 and then we'll kick to Sean. Rebates and the structure that exists today evolved over many decades. It's hard to imagine what the impact of unraveling that would be if that unraveling occurred quickly. But, again, we're part of the discussion. We look forward to trying to figure out whether there isn't a better way for patients than what's in place today. Sean, why don't you...","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question, Geoff. I think that what I would say is that it's difficult given the costs and complexity and duration of these kind of trials to imagine going directly into combination without having demonstrated some efficacy and safety of the individual interventions.","And I think there is a very strong logic behind combination and the disease because we know from the human genetics that one problem is APP processing and the generation of fragments like Abeta. And that another problem is the way in which the glial cells in the brain handle the subsequent cell detritus and death and inflammation. And that's pretty clear from the genetics which has largely been elucidated by deCODE.","And so we think that we'll get there and that there will be combination therapy. But we probably need to see one of the individual components validated. And then you'll see people adding on to that therapy to try and see a more dramatic impact on disease progression.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Robyn, are you there? Okay. Ian, let's go to the next one.","Operator","Very well. And our next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question, and I also wanted to offer congrats to Sean and to Tony. Just a question on healthcare policy. I know there's been a lot of talk about \u2013 with respect to biosimilars, interchangeability, and, Tony, want to get your perspective on maybe how close we are on that. And then the other issue is Part B to Part D conversions, or the demo project, kind of what your thoughts are on that. Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Maybe we'll ask Sean to talk about the appropriateness of interchangeability from a regulatory standpoint first, Geoff, and then, Tony, feel free to add any thoughts you have.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. I think obviously there are two aspects to this. There's the regulatory piece which varies from country to country. In the U.S., as you probably know, the agency has provided reasonably clear guidance around what's necessary to achieve the interchangeability, but that hasn't really been put into practice yet. People are doing trials that are designed to meet that standard.","No one has had an approval based on it yet, so there's a learning curve there. But that will be an important goal that some companies will pursue with their products. Then there's the question of whether there may be, if you will, interchangeability policies that will exist at the level of payers, and who can potentially do whatever they want independent of the regulatory component. That, Tony, maybe you could comment on.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. So, I mean, as we said, NEUPOGEN to us is probably the best example of the existing system allowing biosimilars to access the marketplace. After three years, they hold the majority market share and, therefore, we continue to put forward our proposal that the market be left as is, that we keep the playing field level, that we allow the normal competitive framework of the marketplace to take place.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And talk about B to D.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at, Geoff, but obviously one of the things that's being discussed in Washington is whether it makes sense to consider the movement of certain drugs from Part B to D. And, again, there are early stages of discussions about what that would look like and for which products it would be irrelevant. So premature I think to speculate about whose products would be included in that over what time and what impact.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Ian, let's go to the next one.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Also let me add my congratulations to Sean and Tony on the retirements as well as to David on his well-deserved promotion. So a question is for Sean. I wanted to ask about BCMA, and kind of what you see as the bar in your ongoing Phase 1 trials. And are you looking at your products more as monotherapy assets or as part of existing combinations down the road?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. I think this antigen is going to likely prove to be fairly transformative in the disease. And the question becomes the modality that you go after it with. As I mentioned, we're less impressed with what we're seeing with the ADCs and the BiTE technology appears to be capable of generating early data, small numbers of patients, very dramatic results.","Whether you gain anything from a cell-based therapy directly against this antigen? Nobody knows because there's no \u2013 not even a way to do an indirect comparison at this point, let alone any kind of direct comparison. So it'll be really interesting. I think, of course, initially, we'll be studying it as a monotherapy in patients who are late stage and have undergone many rounds of attempts to treat the disease. But one could easily imagine a therapy like this entering all lines of therapy and including attempts to cure the disease in the first-line settings. Dave, you may want to comment further as -","David M. Reese - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, no, it's a very good question and, of course, we would anticipate the initial forays to be as monotherapy but there are a variety of potential biologic combinations that make sense. And we will plan to also aggressively develop those over time. As Sean mentioned earlier, we're hoping to be able to present publicly sometime later in the year on some of the first clinical data from these programs.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Let's move on.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen MacKay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A quick one on the EVENITY resubmission. I was wondering just how you were thinking about this internally. There was obviously some hope at least on the Street that the independent blinded re-review would suggest some kind of missed adjudication of events, which may really help the resubmission.","And then, secondly on Neulasta, just wanted to get your perspective on sort of the strength of the Onpro defense if a hospital protocol has changed. I know a lot of time and effort went into getting Onpro onto hospital protocols. I was just hoping to get your perspective as to how large of a barrier this is. For instance, how challenging this could be to be changed to Mylan's generic?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Kennen. Why don't we have Sean answer the first question and, Tony, if you'd take the second question?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. So with respect to EVENITY, we did a very comprehensive scouring of the clinical databases and then re-adjudicated all of the events that were originally identified plus any that have been identified subsequently. The good news is that it showed that our research platform is very robust, because when we redid this we saw pretty much the same thing we did the last time when we did it originally.","The bad news is that it didn't really change the dataset for the potential safety signal. It is the opinion and this is just an opinion of the people involved both at Harvard and here at Amgen that the most likely explanation for the finding in the alendronate-controlled trial is chance. We think that's most likely. However, that's not going to be good enough to mean that you're not going to have a need to warn patients about a potential risk. And I'd say we think we're sort of back where we were before we did the exercise.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. And then to answer your question on Neulasta Onpro. So, to remind you again that all the institutions are working as hard as anyone else is to improve on the efficiencies of their processes. Most of the large teaching institutions took about 12 to 18 months to change their clinical practice, because it does apparently take some time to change clinical practice in a large institution.","The benefit of this one is, of course, is it changes the entire protocol about how you treat a patient, how many times a patient has to come back to the institution, how many times the oncology pharmacist has to be remixing, how many times the oncology nurse has to be infusing, and how many times the oncologist has to be there which is all on top of the fact that a lot of patients live far from the hospital and have a problem to come back the next-day when they're suffering from the side effects of high dose chemo.","So what we've delivered is not just a unique opportunity to give better value to patients who can spend more time at home, who are going to have the drug administered at home but we've also taken out a huge amount of inefficiency in the institutions which allows the nurses, the oncologists, and the pharmacist to go and do something else. So one assumes that the value we bring is more than just the drug itself. It's truly an augmented value and we believe that's fairly sticking.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Ian, let's take the next question. And just a quick reminder that if you can please limit yourself to one question, so (01:04:35). Let's go to the next one.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Phillip Nadeau from Cowen & Company.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on Repatha. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned that price was going down because of the agreements that have recently been signed. Can you talk a little bit about the time course of that decline in price? When did it start? Did it start in Q2 or is it starting on July 1 and when will price stabilize again? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So the list price hasn't changed. Some of the rebates by contract have changed. Some of the newer contracts become effective July 1 and we're clearly having to be competitive in the marketplace to maintain these contracts.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Ian, next question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould from UBS.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats to Sean and Tony. I guess for Sean or David, coming back to the BCMA question. How should we be thinking about 420 relative to 701? Is there any differentiation other than the half-life format and then sort of is 420 just sort of proof of principle and then the strategy would be the switch to 701? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","David, why don't you?","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. No. Thanks for the question and it's a good one. 420 as you may know advanced into the clinic earlier than 701. And so our intent at this time is to continue advancing both molecules until such time as we've generated datasets definitive enough for us to make a decision. All things being equal, of course, we'll take forward the half-life extended molecule.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Let me just add my congratulations to both Sean and Tony for their time with Amgen. As we're talking about biosimilar let me just ask something there. First, Tony, I was wondering about Herceptin subQ in Europe since you're launching the molecule. Do you think that segment of the market will be protected from biosimilar competition or do you think this is accessible? And then in the United States, I noticed you've signed a lot of agreements with various providers around oncology. And I was wondering do those agreements provide economical advantages for those providers to continue to use Neulasta over the biosimilar over the duration of the agreement.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. So any innovative SKU to any product, of course, makes the entry of the biosimilar a little bit more difficult. It doesn't make it impossible, so we're watching all those segments in Europe as we speak right now. And then as regards Neulasta and our customers in the U.S., we have fairly strong relationships with our customers, and we have continued to work hard to maintain and to expand those good relationships, yes.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Ian, let's take the next question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities.","Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me in, and congrats, again, to Sean and Tony. I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to give any further detail on patients in the hub for Aimovig, whether you'd quantify those patients and give us a better sense of how many patients may be queued up in this bolus that may be coming. Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So we haven't made that public yet. We're trying to make sure that we understand how unique each of those patients are, coming in, and that they are appropriate patients. I would say that, as you watch the evolution of the prescriptions coming out of that, you'll start getting a feel of the size of the bolus.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","So, Ian, as it's well past 6:00 p.m. on the East Coast, why don't we take two last questions?","Operator","Very well. Our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. And I'll throw my congrats as well to Sean and Tony and welcome to David. Just one on Aimovig probably for Tony. Tony, I was wondering if you can speak to \u2013 when we're thinking about Aimovig longer-term, so past this bolus here, what are the potential bottlenecks that you're seeing. Do you think that this is an area where you'll have to get reimbursement at the PCP level in order to not have a bottleneck in the system? And also the neurologists that are treating, do they have additional capacity to take in additional patients? Thank you.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So there are about 20 headache specialty centers around the country at the moment, and the volume of patients they can take in depends on how much they expand over time or not. But it's a fairly large number of patients coming through them. And then, there are another couple of thousand neurologists who clearly are prescribers. But I do believe that the role of primary care physicians down the road becomes important. They do see patients and their ability to refer patients who are appropriate for a drug like Aimovig would be critical for the long-term value of this drug, yes.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Ian, let's take one last question.","Operator","And our last question is from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to ask a question on the pipeline on AMG 301 for migraine prevention. I was wondering if you can just help us understand the role that you guys see of PAC1 versus CGRP. And if successful, how do you kind of envision these being used, separately or a possibility for a combination down the line? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, I guess what I would say \u2013 this is Sean \u2013 is that the thing I'd stress is that these appear to be rather independent neural pathways in the system. And so if it works, if PAC1 inhibition works, one would expect that it's not likely that it's going to be kind of redundant to CGRP. So you could imagine situations in which patients who are poor responders to CGRP inhibition might respond to PAC1 or that the two together might give better efficacy, assuming that was tolerable. But that will all have to be figured out in the clinic, and we're just at the first step of trying to understand whether, as monotherapy, we can see the efficacy of the PAC1 pathway in the first place.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Ian, well, thanks. Let me just say a couple of quick remarks. Obviously, we're encouraged by the strong start we've enjoyed to the first half of 2018 and hope our investors share our optimism for the long-term prospects of the business through the growth that we expect from our new and recently-launched products as well as our biosimilars and innovative pipeline.","And, finally, I would be remiss if I didn't just take a moment to thank our staff for their continuing focus on our mission, which is to serve patients with innovative medicines that make the big difference for serious disease. So thank you to all our staff for their focus, the results of which you see in our report through the first six months. Look forward to talking to all of you in October. Thank you.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, all, for your participation. If we didn't get to your question, feel free to call us. The IR team will be standing by for several hours. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for joining us for Amgen's second quarter 2018 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect."],"2365":["Amgen Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we\u2019d like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session (Operator Instructions).","I\u2019d now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our conference call to review our third quarter financial results. This sure has been a busy year. It\u2019s also been a great year so far as we\u2019ve made remarkable progress against our strategic priorities.","I\u2019m joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a progress update on our accomplishments. Following Bob, our CFO, Jon Peacock; will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide an update on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Tony Hooper, Our Head of Commercial Operations will then discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that we see going forward. And finally Sean Harper, our Head of R&D, who will provide a brief pipeline update and after Sean\u2019s comments, we should have ample time for Q&A.","We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially.","So with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Bob Bradway","All right. Thank you, Arvind. We executed well through the third quarter and you can see that both in our financial and our strategic results for the quarter. Financially sales were up 11% and earnings per share were up 16% and off the back of this performance we\u2019re raising our guidance for revenues and adjusted earnings per share for the full year.","A number of important pieces came together for our strategy over the past few weeks and I want to just quickly summarize them for you. In Japan our strategic alliance, which is known as the Amgen Astellas BioPharma KK has now begun operations and we\u2019re developing five innovative molecules through the alliance, the first of which we expect to launch in 2016 and then ultimately of course we expect to establish our own wholly owned subsidiary in Japan as early as 2020.","In China our joint venture with Zhejiang Betta Pharma is now complete and we hope to launch Vectibix there together as early as 2015. We also announced our plans to build research and translational capabilities in China at Shanghai Tech University representing a step forward in our commitment to this market.","Consistent with our stated strategy of building a presence in some 75 countries, we\u2019ve achieved that and more following the repurchase of rights to Neulasta and NEUPOGEN from Roche in markets outside of the U.S and the E.U. These markets account for about $200 million in NEUPOGEN and Neulasta sales and we will provide a platform for future product launches.","And finally of course we completed the acquisition of Onyx at the beginning of the month and now its still early days the transition is progressing smoothly and we\u2019re excited about the prospect of adding value and driving growth in multiple myeloma with Kyprolis, which we think has significant opportunity in earlier alliance of therapy and in markets around the world as a best-in-class proteasome inhibitor.","Oprozomib looks attractive as well as a potential oral proteasome inhibitor for maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma and of course we expect Nexavar, Stivarga and Palbociclib to contribute to growth also.","While we were busy laying the ground work for long-term growth with our strategic moves during the quarter, our internal efforts were also progressing well. In R&D with the addition of Kyprolis and ivabradine, the innovative medicine for heart failure we licensed from Servier in July, our pipeline now includes 10 late-stage innovative programs set to generate pivotal data over the next couple of years.","Separately, our portfolio of six biosimilars continues to advance as well and we now have a pivotal trial underway for our second of these molecules, this one a biosimilar to Humira.","Some of you\u2019ve asked about the status of the patent infringement lawsuit we filed in the U.S versus Teva on their long-acting lipegfilgrastim product candidate. Teva has advised us that they\u2019ve withdrawn their PLA for the product and the FDA has confirmed this withdrawal, so we\u2019ve agreed to dismiss our lawsuit on this product. Of course if circumstances change we can refile the lawsuit.","Before turning to Jon, I want to thank my colleagues in Amgen and our new colleagues from Onyx for their efforts during this past quarter. All of our focus on patients is evident in the strong operational and strategic results we produced over the last three months. Jon?","Jon Peacock","Thanks, Bob. This has been a busy quarter for us. We\u2019ve advanced several of our most important strategic priorities as Bob has outlined. But at the same time, we\u2019ve remained focused on our business and delivered a strong operating performance in the quarter.","Revenues advanced 10% compared to the third quarter of 2012 with product sales up 11%. This included a $155 million NEUPOGEN order from the U.S government. It also reflected continued momentum with Prolia, with XGEVA, Enbrel, and Neulasta as well as important contributions from Sensipar, Nplate, and Vectibix.","Operating expenses were up 10% on the quarter overall. Over the course of the last 12 months we\u2019ve been enrolling multiple clinical trials, which will enable a data rich year in 2014 as several of these trials start to readout. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 45,000 patients enrolled in our late-stage programs compared to around 30,000 twelve months ago. That\u2019s an increase of 50%.","Research and development costs in the quarter were also impacted by a $50 million upfront payment to Servier for the U.S. rights to ivabradine. SG&A costs included 12% increase in Enbrel profit share payments, which amounted to $430 million. And as a remainder, the Enbrel profit share expires at the end of this month and is replaced by a 12% royalty on sales, leading to an anticipated net benefit of around $800 million in operating income in 2014 compared to 2013.","Net income increased by 13%. Our tax rate in the quarter was lower compared to 2012, benefiting from the federal R&D credit and a change in the geographic mix of expenses and revenues. This was partially offset by higher other income and expense. The third quarter charge for other income and expense is broadly representative of the charge that you should expect to see in the fourth quarter and into 2014. Adjusted earnings per share growth of 16% also benefited from a lower average share count.","Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet on page five, we generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and paid a dividend totaling $400 million. Our total cash and investments of $26.5 billion at the end of the quarter included a $3.1 billion bank loan to fund the Onyx acquisition, which was disbursed when the deal closed on October 1.","The funding for the acquisition was completed with a further $5 billion bank loan received and disbursed on October 1. With this, total debt outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter is expected to be $32.2 billion. And as a remainder, the $8.1 billion raised from the Onyx acquisition carries an interest rate linked to LIBOR, and at current rates, this amounts to 1.3% pre-tax.","Share repurchases year-to-date amounted to $800 million at an average price of $85 and following the Onyx acquisition, we don\u2019t expect any significant share repurchase activity in 2014 and 2015.","Turning to page 6, we\u2019re raising our guidance for the full year and this includes the contribution of Onyx from October 1. We now expect revenues to be in the range of $18.3 billion to $18.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share to be between $7.35 and $7.45. Our guidance on tax and capital expenditures remains unchanged. Tony?","Tony Hooper","Thanks, Jon. You'll find the summary of our global sales performance for quarter three on Slide 7. I'm pleased to report we had a strong quarter three with product sales growing 11% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. We also saw strong top line contributions from all our geographic regions. Our U.S. business grew 12% year-over-year with wholesale inventory ending in the normal range. Outside the U.S., sales grew 7% year-on-year or 9% excluding foreign exchange.","I'd like to start the review with our portfolio beginning with Enbrel. Rheumatologists and dermatologists continue to recognize Enbrel with track record of efficacy, safety, and long-term experience. We are committed to investing in Enbrel over the long term given our prolonged exclusivity and the end of our profit share agreement with Pfizer at the end of this month. Enbrel sales grew 7% year-over-year, primarily due to price.","We remain focused on demonstrating the value and benefits of Enbrel to physicians, payors, and most importantly patients. Our direct-to-consumer advertising continues to emphasize the benefits of using Enbrel. Enbrel consistently leads total brand awareness in the rheumatology segment, and physicians continue to honor over 90% of Enbrel patient requests. We remain the value share leader in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments, and I'm confident in Enbrel's potential growth.","Moving now to Neulasta and NEUPOGEN. Please remember that Neulasta represents about 80% of the combined sales of these two products. We continue to emphasize the addition of filgrastim to the first and every cycle of chemotherapy as the best way to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia in appropriate patients. Year-over-year, global sales for Neulasta increased by 9%. This was mainly driven by price and a slight increase in unit demand.","For NEUPOGEN, sales grew 50% year-over-year including the $155 million order from the U.S. government. EPOGEN sales were flat year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, sales declined slightly due to the favorable Medicaid rebate adjustment recorded in quarter two. Unit demand in the quarter was stable.","Aranesp sales were down 10% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter sales were negatively impacted by changes in estimates in both quarters including the Medicaid rebate adjustments recorded in quarter two. We expect Aranesp sales in both U.S. and Europe to continue trending slightly downwards.","Sensipar sales increased 7% year-over-year due to increases in overall unit demand driven by strong segment penetration. Nplate and Vectibix sales in aggregate were higher by 19% year-over-year due to increases in unit demand.","In Europe, we continued to pursue reimbursement with payors for the treatment of first and second line metastatic colorectal cancer, and our European label now includes the new NRAS data which allows more targeted treatment to patients based on their wild-type RAS status.","Turning now to the denosumab franchise. Prolia posted a 62% year-on-year growth. We did see, however, some seasonal softness in the third quarter something we have come to expect, but we continue to grow share in both the U.S. and the rest of the world. We also continued to improve repeat injection rates in the U.S. and our latest data shows over 60% of patients are returning for their second injection.","Earlier this month, we launched Prolia in France which is the largest PMO market in Europe. XGEVA global sales grew 5% quarter-over-quarter. In the U.S., our value share grew by 6 percentage points in the quarter. On a unit basis, our share grew by 2 percentage points, while competing against numerous generic zoledronic acid competitors. We now hold 42% unit share in this segment. Outside the U.S., XGEVA grew 12% quarter-over-quarter driven by share gains.","Recent launches in Europe continued its strong uptake. In France we already achieved 50% segment value share since launching in quarter one. Our commercial focus remains on reminding physicians and patients of the superior clinical profile of XGEVA.","Other products, which is comprised of our Brazilian and Turkish businesses declined 13% year-on-year. This was primary due to Turkey since this business is driven in part by government tenders where timing of awards tends to fluctuate. We expect sales to significantly rebound in quarter four.","Let me now turn to our new and exciting business Onyx Pharmaceuticals. I'll like to start by thanking the entire Onyx team for their unwavering commitment during the acquisition period. They remain focused and grew their business 6% quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, as most of their U.S. execution drove a 10% increase in the number of Kyprolis [ph] accounts during the quarter as the depth of prescribing continued to grow.","We're excited to continue building on this important growth platform in multiple myeloma with potential expansion into early lines of therapy as well as launching in countries outside the United States.","In summary, I'm very pleased with the competitive strategies our team have developed and our execution against these strategies. We remain focused on serving patients and bring them vital medicines. Our underlying business delivers another strong quarter and I believe we are well positioned to meet our full year revenue growth objectives.","Let me now pass it to Dr. Sean Harper.","Sean Harper","Thanks, Tony. We continue to forge ahead on our existing pipeline efforts and I'd like to take this opportunity to also welcome our colleagues at Onyx. The team has done an outstanding job advancing innovative multiple myeloma therapies and we're very optimistic about the long-term potential of Kyprolis and Oprozomib. We're looking forward to the new Kyprolis data next year including the final analysis of the FOCUS study in relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma.","In addition the Independent Data Monitoring Committee will review an interim analysis of the ASPIRE study in relapsed disease next year. As many of you are aware, FOCUS is the registration enabling study for refractory\/relapsed multiple myeloma targeting the EU and ASPIRE is the confirmatory study for full U.S. approval as well as the registration enabling study for relapsed patients in both the U.S. and in EU.","We will also be presenting additional data on Oprozomib an oral proteasome inhibitor at this year's American Society of Hematology meeting. We are doing everything we can to help maintain momentum on these programs and to bring to bear any resources we can to further enable our success. The mission and culture of the two companies seem remarkably well aligned and I'm excited to have them on our team.","The lipid-lowering program intended to be the basis of registration for AMG 145 now called Evolocumab. It's completely enrolled and we eagerly await the results in 1Q '14. We plan to speak more about this program along with our other cardiovascular programs at an investor event at the American Heart Association meeting in November where we will be presenting one year data from over 1,100 subjects in our Phase 2 open-label extension study.","For Trebananib we continue to estimate the final overall survival analysis from the ongoing pivotal study in recurrent ovarian carcinoma to occur in the second half 2014. We have decided to discontinue enrollment in our study of Trebananib in combination with DOXIL in the study of recurrent ovarian carcinoma due to ongoing DOXIL supply issues.","We've also determined that a much smaller study than initially planned can be utilized to accurately assess the effects of Trebananib on progression-free survival and first line ovarian cancer. In addition, the emerging therapeutic landscape in non-small cell lung cancer limits the potential utility of Trebananib in this study, so we're also just continuing enrollment in this Phase 2 study. There were no new safety findings related to these decisions.","Our psoriasis program for Brodalumab consists of three Phase 3 studies, one placebo controlled and two head-to-head against ustekinumab or STELARA. I'm pleased to report all these are now fully enrolled and we expect to see the data next year.","Velcalcetide or AMG 416 is our novel IV calcimimetic being investigated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on hemodialysis. Phase 3 data are expected next year and we will be presenting Phase 2 data at the American Society of Nephrology meeting next month.","Just to close the loop a few on outstanding XGEVA filing after extensive discussions with EU regulators, we've decided not to pursue further our request for a bone metastasis free survival indication in castrate resistant prostate cancer in Europe. Our biosimilar unit continues to make good progress and as Bob mentioned enrollment has commenced in our biosimilar Humira pivotal study in psoriasis.","Finally I\u2019d just like to take a moment and acknowledge my colleagues in R&D who continue to innovate and execute at a very high level. We\u2019ve made great progress this year, and as you can see from my last slide eight of our late stage programs will achieve significant milestones next year. We\u2019ll be very busy in 2014, but our organization is ready and we look forward to continuing our track record of delivering noble therapies for patients in need. Bob.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you Sean. Marvin, we\u2019re ready for questions. If you\u2019d remind our listener\u2019s of the procedures, we\u2019ll open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Thanks for taking my question. So I guess, I think big picture seems like your base business continues to be more stable than I think a lot of people on the Street expected, and you\u2019re continuing to grow your pipeline, and you -- like you did a deal today going into emerging markets. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to -- I\u2019m struggling with understanding the impacts the new businesses have on margins, and what the real revenue opportunity is for global expansion. So, I know you haven\u2019t given guidance, but maybe in a general sense can you help me think about when you think global extension will contribute meaningfully, and how do we think about maybe bookends for margin impact. And then lastly, when do you think it's appropriate to give guidance on these businesses -- more detailed financial guidance?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thanks Robyn, there are a couple of questions there. Why don\u2019t we try and answer that in two parts. First you\u2019re right, we\u2019ve continued to make progress in laying the groundwork for our future growth, and we felt for sometime that an important ingredient for our long-term success was international expansion, and in particular a clear path forward in Japan, China, and the other key emerging markets, and we\u2019ve made tangible progress as reflected in the items that we reviewed from this quarter. So, we feel good about the presence that we created and the ability to leverage that presence for our innovative molecules when they\u2019re ready to be launched. As regards to your question about margins and returns; why don\u2019t I ask Tony to share his thoughts? We\u2019re obviously not going to provide individual market guidance, and Robyn I think the next opportunity for us to talk more generally about guidance would be in connection with our fourth quarter results which is scheduled for January of course the next year. Tony, do you want to offer any general thoughts to Robyn on how we\u2019re thinking about markets and the criteria for profitability that we\u2019re holding the teams accountable to?","Tony Hooper","So as we think about the Amgen presence at the moment we do have a fairly decent presence already in the Middle East, North Africa, and Latin America. Our business in this part of the world is really well in excess of $0.5 billion and growing rapidly double digit. The products we have in the portfolio also are highly sophisticated biotech type products, so pricing is pretty much in line with the type of product we bring to markets, so we\u2019re not competing in these markets in the mass part of the market, but clearly around the high medical need with prices that will allow our margins fairly close to the type of business we run in Europe at the moment.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Let\u2019s go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering, first if you can provide us on your thoughts on the Kyprolis development program. Now that the deal is closed, particularly I would be curious in your outlook for both FOCUS and ASPIRE. And then in the event that FOCUS does not have a positive readout, how comfortable are you that ASPIRE will be enough to secure a label there? And then the second question I had was just, can you remind us of your strategy for your Humira biosimilar if the trial you\u2019re running is designed to support worldwide filings including the U.S? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay, Terence you\u2019ve got a couple of questions here; let\u2019s try to answer those. Sean, I suppose you might want to just share with Terence our thoughts about the global development plan at Onyx.","Sean Harper","Yeah, I think that the FOCUS and ASPIRE trials will read out next year, FOCUS in its final form and ASPIRE will have an interim analysis reviewed by the data monitoring committee, and if positive, we will see it, otherwise we\u2019ll see the final analysis. I think that in the case that FOCUS is really focused on a third plus line indication for Europe and we feel that it's quite an independent thing from the goals of ASPIRE which are to allow a relapsed population or if you will second line population to have a registration path in both the U.S. and EU, and we\u2019re pretty confident that assuming the results are what we\u2019re hoping for that that stands on it's own from a regulatory perspective.","Bob Bradway","And Tony, on Humira you want to answer Terence\u2019s question?","Tony Hooper","Sure, I mean our biosimilar strategy is clearly a global strategy. We are working closely with the FDA to understand requirements. We understand what's required in Europe, and then we\u2019re working with other countries outside those two regions to try and understand where the pathway is going forward, but we think globally on a consistent basis, yes.","Bob Bradway","Okay, Marvin lets take the next question, and maybe you can just remind the audience to just limit themselves to one question please, so you can get through everybody.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","Thanks. Maybe just a quick one on Bob\u2019s comments around Teva and IP dispute around long-acting GCSF, could you remind us when your patent actually expires and whether Teva withdrew the PLA because of the patent or for some other issue?","Bob Bradway","Eric our IP on pegylated filgrastim extends through the end of 2015, and as I said in my remarks, we understand that they have withdrawn the product from -- withdrawn the file rather from the FDA, and that\u2019s the reason why we dropped our lawsuit.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","Do you know why, Bob?","Bob Bradway","You would have to ask them that question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hey guys; thanks for taking the question; I know that CMS has proposed cuts to reimbursement rates to dialysis providers. I think this came up on the 2Q call, I think at the time we were in the comment period. I was wondering if you can update us on what's going on there and if you can help us all understand an issue what impact it could have to models, and then if you could just comment on the NEUPOGEN government purchase, should we think of that as one time? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Okay, Tony.","Tony Hooper","So let me talk about the bundle. The time for comment to CMS is now expired, and we have assumed that the CMS would make some type of ruling early in November. We\u2019re not quite sure how the government shutdown will impact that timing, but we\u2019re standing by to wait to hear what's going to happen. Now their decision could be to implement immediately. It could be to implement over a period of time, or if you implement in at a time in the future. We don\u2019t know yet what the impact will be or how much the proposed reduction will in fact be. So we\u2019re just waiting for that at the moment. On NEUPOGEN?","Bob Bradway","Sure, on the government order Mark, I think at this point we can\u2019t predict whether there will be future orders from the government or not. I think we would notice that we\u2019ve got a track record \u2013 strong track record of being able to supply customers with safe, reliable, quality NEUPOGEN, Neulasta product, and if the government wants to order more, we\u2019re prepared to supply it. But at this point, I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate as to whether there\u2019ll be future orders.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, just to confirm one, the pegfilgrastim application was withdrawn, but are we still expecting both a NEUPOGEN like in a non-peg Neulasta like product to come from Teva soon and both under settlement. Maybe you could clarify if you expect both of those to come and how we should as investors be expecting your franchise to look once those do arrive to market?","Bob Bradway","Okay, a couple of things Michael just to remind you. We expect that there will not be a NEUPOGEN like product on the market before mid November after that time when our intellectual property expires on NEUPOGEN we would expect to see Teva launch a product, and I would note it won't be a biosimilar and it won't be a product that has the same label as NEUPOGEN. With respect to other long acting products, again so far as I\u2019m aware none are registered and so rather than speculate on what they might do, I think we\u2019ll wait and see what the regulatory reaction is to products that they have on file.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities","Great. Thanks for taking my question as well. Sean, as you know, I've been interested in this ovarian program with Trebananib. Just want to ask you about the DOXIL shortage which necessitated the closing of enrollment for TRINOVA-2. Just wondering if you can talk about whether or not that impacts your statistical power to hit PFS in OS, whether or not the second study is required for approval in the indication and whether there are other implications we should consider here? Thanks.","Sean Harper","Yes. Matt, I don't think the DOXIL study was always a non-registration trial to suggest some \u2013 generate data in the setting of a very commonly used agent in ovarian cancer and so there really are two problems. One is that it's not really very commonly used agent in ovarian cancer anymore because it's so unreliable on supply and we can't get the drug. This is the second time we've had to do this and it's just very disruptive to not have supply for patients in a clinical trial setting. So that should have no variant all along our ability to register the product, to access OS in the existing independent study with the paclitaxel background that we're waiting for sometime next year nor would it have an ability to assess PFS in the first line study which has always been the primary goal of the first line study.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities","Great. Thanks very much.","Sean Harper","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So Sean highlighted on Slide 9 all the data events for next year but I want to ask Tony the commercial perspective on this. Is there an ROI that you're looking for, for the various Phase 2 or 3 assets that you have that are maturing? I guess said another way, just given your top line is there a threshold that these assets have to cross to really sort of move that, I think?","Bob Bradway","Geoff, this is Bob. Let me jump in there on the question that you directed at Tony. Our intention is to advance molecules for which we think we can exceed the cost of our capital. So when we look at our late and early stage programs, we want to have a clear view to what's it going to take to beat our cost to capital and we think we're in good shape in that regard on the late stage molecules and we continue to watch that carefully on the mid-stage and early-stage programs.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","Got you, okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Another big picture question on your biosimilar assets, when can we expect more news flow on the other five projects you previously identified and given the changes in the biosimilar competitive environment since your business review day, do you view this opportunity as bigger than you guided to at that point? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Ravi, why don't we answer this in two parts. With respect to communications, again as our biosimilar molecules enter pivotal trials we'll plan to call them out on our quarterly calls as we did today, so we've done that for both the molecules that are now in pivotal trials and Tony, if you want to talk more generally about the quality of the opportunity here jump in.","Tony Hooper","So as we monitor these six assets we've identified, all of them continue to grow globally. So the medium-term opportunity of playing with markets continues to be a lucrative market. We continue to believe that our ability to bring to market a high quality reliable supply product will be unique benefit that Amgen has. So we continue to see it as an opportunity, yes.","Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citi","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have kind of also a little bit of a challenging question relating to cardiovascular franchise and just on 145 \u2013 just give us a little bit of an update where you are on formulation and sort of are you guys thinking that the concentration will remain the same but the device is going to change into an auto injector? And then where does Ivabradine, what does that fit in and is it based on \u2013 you going to be looking for CAD and the chronic heart failure indication, kind of what's the strategy? It sounds like you're going to be using previous data to file? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Okay. So regarding 145, as I said many times before, this is a very competitive situation and we're not wanting to get into that level of specificity around how we're going to be presenting the agent. Its suffice it to say that we think we're going to have good ways of delivering to patients every two week and every week presentations of the product. Ivabradine is a really interesting molecule that is unique in its mechanism and has a really critical role in the management of heart failure outside the United States. We have data sets which are very robust supporting chronic heart failure whether as a large outcome study that was done not too long ago, put into the labels around the world. European heart failure guidelines include the use of Ivabradine in patients who can't be adequately heart rate control but with beta blockers. So our desire is to see the agent registered ultimately and in both of these indications in congestive heart failure as well as in patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina. There is also a large outcomes trial with in-patients with coronary artery disease, approximately 20,000 patients that's going to read out next year which should potentially quite supportive to the use of the agent in the kind of angina indication. So that's\u2026","Sean Harper","Tony, do you want to add some thoughts?","Tony Hooper","Yes, so as we think about Amgen launching 145 which is one of our largest exciting opportunities we have that would have been the first time Amgen competes in the cardiovascular field and therefore Ivabradine which has shown the same, being a unique opportunity, a unique mode of action in an area of high unmet medical need will allow us prior to the 145 launch to build competencies, skills in our organization to build a relationship with the cardiology group, make sure we understand the hot rolling interaction of the PMT committees, discharge protocols all of which will play in line with the launch of 145. So setting us up, getting us the experience at the same time driving a rather exceptional product in a large unmet medical need.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with BoA Merrill Lynch.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A question, I wanted to go back to Kyprolis, I was hoping Sean you might be a little bit more granular on your development plans I guess on two fronts. One, with the head-to-head studies it seems like \u2013 for ENDEAVOR and CLARION there are going to be important for frontline approval but also potentially for EU reimbursement given the cost concerns with Revlimid and Kyprolis, I guess my view is that these studies are fairly risky. Do you plan to make any changes to the design of these studies or add additional supplemental studies? And then just on the cardiac pulmonary safety profile given the recent events with [indiscernible], I'm just wondering what your comfort level is on the safety profile and how confident are you based on the data that you have to say that there's not going to a safety imbalance that stops either those studies early? Thanks.","Sean Harper","Well, first I'd say that generally as we look at the Onyx opportunity, we were very impressed with the development program and I see the development program as being quite well thought out. Of course we'll work with our colleagues that makes them think about details of the way that statistical analysis plans are done and this sort of thing. At a technical level for sure there will be a process of looking to gather things, but I think that generally speaking we feel very good about the development program which has been developed with a lot of input from the experts in the field from around the world and regulatory authorities of course. It's always possible that we would add studies. I wouldn't think that there is anything that glares out as a missing piece but there are lots of opportunities to do additional studies with a smaller dose with both Kyprolis and Oprozomib and we'll just have to think about that in a big picture perspective in terms of return on investment, overall portfolio management. Safety I think I can't give you any guarantees about safety, I mean, we -- the data that we see to date with the agents is reassuring and appears that the benefit that\u2019s being derived from the use of the product in a setting exceeds the safety concerns. There are of course especially in oncology safety issues with virtually every therapeutic agent. So I still see a very strong benefit risk profile here and I think that the opportunity to let these studies play out and see what we learn from them is that -- is in front of us.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Let\u2019s go to the next question Marvin.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein.","Geoffrey Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question about the Onyx acquisition. I mean if we look back at Onyx, it had about $200 million in operating expenses in Q2 and now you had a chance to integrate the two organizations. Could you give us a sense of what that operating expense might be looking up like in Amgen\u2019s hands, say a year from now once you\u2019ve kind of embedded everything in? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Sure Geoff. I guess we\u2019re 21 days into this transition. What I had observed is that as I said earlier, the transition is moving smoothly. There are clearly going to be some opportunities for us to think about synergies and as you would expect we\u2019re down the road already in that regard with our colleagues at Onyx, but I\u2019m not going to provide guidance at this point. We will have an opportunity to do that next year in January when we talk about the fourth quarter in the way that we typically do. But again, I think the big picture Geoff is that we\u2019re three weeks into this. We feel good about what we\u2019ve seen, I think feel good about the way in which we\u2019re working together and comfortable about the opportunity to help drive growth here and create value both from things that we can do to grow the brand and grow access as well as things that we can do to provide cost synergies.","Geoffrey Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Christopher Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Yet another sort of cardiovascular question for AMG145, so we\u2019ve picked up a lot more investor interest recently on Merck\u2019s upcoming improve the trial and I know this is not your trial, nor your product, but there is I think a fairly decent chance that there is going to be a read through at least from an investor standpoint if that trial fails and I know these mechanisms are very different. But can you may be just give us a sense, how should we be thinking about how the FDA might be thinking, if indeed that trial doesn\u2019t show up, sort of a long-term benefit and what the implications are for what they might require for the entire PCSK9 class? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Yes, I think it\u2019s obviously difficult to speak for the FDA, in terms of how they might view LDL as a surrogate endpoint based on the results from one of dozens and dozens of studies that have been done and have shown that reducing LDL has had a solitary effect on cardiovascular outcomes. I think it\u2019s just going to depend enormously on the actual interpretation, detailed scientific interpretation of studies in -- like improve it. I think those studies will be looked at carefully, any studies that come out over the next few years will be looked at carefully by regulators and the scientific community. But it\u2019s really down to the detailed assessment as to whether the results actually call in to question whether LDL is a reasonable surrogate for cardiovascular outcomes, while one waits for cardiovascular outcomes result to come from a trial, which is well under way. And it\u2019s just tough to speculate on that at this stage, but I think that it\u2019s clear to me that LDL is looked at differently than other lipid parameters by regulators with respect to being the most robust of those.","Christopher Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","I have a question, Tony you\u2019ve commented about, how well Enbrel has done not only in this quarter but in past quarters. Yet in the last quarter you made a reference to some slowdown in the [indiscernible] markets, so I wondered if you could actually break apart how you\u2019re looking at the growth rates around each indication for Enbrel would be very helpful. And if I could sneak in a second really quickly, it's again around 145, in your comments earlier around of ivabradine you made some references to the cardiologist and I wondered if in fact your assumption was that 145 would not be used by the primary care physician or did I simply misread that from your statements in chronic heart failure? Thanks very much.","Tony Hooper","Okay, Tony at regards to Enbrel about two thirds of our business is in rheumatology and about one third in dermatology. Net-net we\u2019ve seen both these markets just slowdown a little bit in terms of growth, this was growing fairly healthily. In rheumatology we clearly continue to hold market share. In dermatology we have seen a slight decline in market share over the last couple of quarters or so, but we clearly believe that the product profile both in rheumatology from an efficacy and a safety perspective as well as our profile in dermatology specifically here around safety will allow us to continue to maintain a fairly large market share as we go forward. As regard to 145 the assumption we\u2019re making is the initial launch of 145 will be more specifically on high risk patients which will be treated by cardiologists. As always there\u2019ll be a smattering of general practitioners who do a fair amount of cardiovascular work, but we don\u2019t see us going in the early stages to a large GP market.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","Thanks very much.","Tony Hooper","Okay.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.","Eun Yang - Jefferies & Co.","Thanks. Question on Brodalumab. I\u2019m assuming two Phase 3 trials are designed to show superiority over STELARA in psoriasis, and the fact that Novartis issued a superior efficacy over Enbrel with their IL-17 antibody. Why did you use STELARA as a competitor versus Enbrel?","Sean Harper","Well, I think the choice of ustekinumab as the competitor for Brodalumab was really a matter of just putting ourselves up against the molecule that we thought has the increasingly is becoming the agent of choice from an efficacy perspective in the disease if we wanted to set as higher bar as we could really from a competition perspective and so that was in part why we made the choice. And we could have chosen other comparators but that was the choice that we made.","Bob Bradway","Good. Let\u2019s go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel.","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Thanks Bob. So I had a question of Kyprolis sales and obviously you seem pretty happy about the $65 million it looks to me pretty flat over the last couple of quarters, I am wondering if the -- now the drug is in your hands whether we should expect or if there\u2019s any significant growth embedded in your guidance for the fourth quarter or do we need to wait for the new studies to come out next year? Thanks.","Tony Hooper","Joel, its Tony. So let me just say a couple of things. The first leak of a potential acquisition started to come out in late June. So there\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty amongst Onyx employees for a period of time and as I said in my remarks earlier, I am pretty grateful in spite of this terrible disruption that happened in their lives they maintained the business as well as they did. Including the third quarter it's normally a fairly soft quarter even for oncology. 14 days after the close we had in the hands of every single field based employee a letter of employment confirming employment. We have looked at this team. This team has obviously been put together with a clear knowledge of where the multiple myeloma market is, where the treatment physicians are and we\u2019ve hired through the Onyx team a top class oncology sales organization and medical field organization. We're certainly hoping that with certainly now bringing on their lives that performance will improve over the fourth quarter but clearly as you look to the medium to long-term, the next major expansion of the Kyprolis label will come with both the FOCUS and the ASPIRE ideas.","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann","Thanks very much. Regarding the changes in the Trebananib program, can you comment on whether these represented in any way a de-emphasis of this compound, specifically regarding focusing \u2013 the focus on frontline study on PFS, are you still pursuing a regulatory following in the U.S. for frontline? And then the second, the TRINOVA-1 study can you talk about your outlook record filing given the interim overall trend they presented?","Bob Bradway","No, I think we're still quite interested in Trebananib potential and see it as an agent which could gain registration globally for first line and recurrence feed. So in the first line I think we recognize that it's extremely difficult as I'm sure you know to try and achieve an overall survival result in the first line. Our general thought is that if we can achieve an OS result in a significant line of therapy like in the recurrence study that we're waiting for OS data now, that that would be sufficient for the molecule to allow us to move forward with attempts to register in first and second line globally. So that's really the strategy and the change in the size of the first line study doesn't diminish in any way our ability to access the progression-free survival there.","Jon Peacock","Marvin, I think we have exhausted a lot of topics here, so why don't we take one last question.","Operator","Last question comes from the line of Gene Mack with Brean & Capital.","Gene Mack - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.","Thanks so much for taking the question. Just on Oprozomib and strategy there, wonder if you guys can give us the sense of \u2013 just given how fast Millennium moved their oral compound 9708 through Phase 3 testing, I'm just wondering how soon do you think you might be able to get in to a pivotal program with Oprozomib? Is it just too early to tell at this point or can you like Millennium go sort of from Phase 1 to really big one from Phase 1 to Phase 3? Thanks.","Sean Harper","Yes, I think it's probably just too early in the process for me to speculate about that right now. The agent is really at the threshold between Phase 1b and 2 at the moment. I'm sure there are \u2013 there's an ability to be aggressive with the development of the molecule but we also want to do it right and skipping phases of development isn't always the best idea. So we'll have to needle through that and decide how we're going to proceed.","Arvind Sood","Great. Thank you, Sean. So let me thank everybody for your participation in our call this afternoon.

I would like to welcome you to our conference call for the first quarter of 2018. I think we are off to a solid start with new and recently launched products continuing to deliver volume driven growth including our most recent launch of Parsabiv.","We also have notable catalysts to look forward to, like our upcoming FDA action date for Aimovig for migraine prevention. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway will lead the discussion today with a strategic overview followed by our CFO, David Meline who will review our results for first quarter and provide updated guidance for 2018. Tony Hooper our Head of Global Commercial Operations, will dig into out product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update.","We will use slides corresponding to our prepared comments today and a link to these slides was sent earlier. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today\u2019s presentation to provide information, which maybe useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today\u2019s press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.","So, just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2018, 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Mr. Bradway?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Thank you all for joining us. As you can see, we're off to a solid start in 2018 with 3% growth in product sales leading us to 10% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. We had double-digit unit growth in all of our new and recently launched products including Repatha, KYPROLIS, Prolia and XGEVA.","We also generated strong volume growth outside of the U.S. where our legacy brands have faced competition for some time. Repatha, KYPROLIS, Prolia, XGEVA and soon Aimovig are clear examples of innovative medicines that address real unmet needs. These will be important drivers of our long-term growth.","In addition, we continue to invest in R&D to develop new game changing medicines like omecamtiv, tezepelumab and in the earlier stage molecules like our IL-2 mutein all of which have clear potential value propositions for patients and society.","In addition the broad promise of our BiTE platform is coming into focus across a number of molecules in our cancer pipeline. The recent approval for BLINCYTO in ALL patients with minimal residual disease gives us confidence in this approach to immuno-oncology for both liquid and solid tumors.","We're looking forward to launching Aimovig, our first neuroscience therapeutic, which is in turn a first-in-class CGRP antibody for migraine prevention. Together, with Novartis we're ready to launch Aimovig this quarter in the U.S. We hope to redefine migraine prevention for relevant patients, physicians and payers given the urgent unmet need and the pent up demand for a better therapy in this disease. Current therapies do not adequately address this debilitating disease and migraine is gone under appreciated and under treated for too long.","Later this year we will see our biosimilar effort begin to come to fruition as we launch AMGEVITA our biosimilar of Humira internationally. We have a compelling opportunity to leverage our decades of biotechnology experience to create and reliably supply high quality biosimilars to patients worldwide. While gaining regulatory approval of biosimilars has proven challenging for many in the field, we have successfully executed in our plans receiving first cycle approvals for AMGEVITA and MVASI a biosimilar to Avastin.","We have our next opportunity for approval with KANJINTI our biosimilar version of Herceptin on May 28, in the U.S. We believe biosimilars can be an important growth opportunity for us as we begin to launch our products globally.","Our balance sheet and after tax cash flows are strong enabling us to invest in long-term innovative growth opportunities and to return capital to our shareholders. Our priorities for the use of cash continue to be investment in innovation and supporting the launches of our growth products while continuing to build out our global presence.","Following tax reform, we announced plans to build a new state-of-the-art next generation bio manufacturing facility in Rhode Island, which will result in the creation of many new highly skilled jobs. This new plant, which is the first of its kind in the United States will employ Amgen\u2019s proven next generation bio manufacturing capabilities and manufacture products for the U.S. and global markets.","As for business development, we continue to look for innovative opportunities that are consistent with our areas of strategic focus while remaining disciplined about the path to earning return for our shareholders. We have a strong track record of returning capital to our shareholders, which we plan to maintain.","Since initiating our dividend seven years ago, we have raised it on average 25% a year, while also returning excess capital through significant programmatic share buybacks like those, which we've undertaken this year.","Briefly addressing the political environment, let me say that over the coming weeks and months, we will continue to work with Congress and the administration to advocate for policies that improve the affordability and access to important new medicines while seeking ways to constructively modernize Medicare program.","In closing, let me just thank all of our Amgen staff around the world, as I look at our business today and into the future our outlook remains strong as we continue to deliver for patients and shareholders.","Let me turn the call now to David.","David Meline","Okay, thanks Bob. We're pleased with our solid revenue and earnings growth in the first quarter. As our transformation, efforts continue to enable investments in support of volume driven growth during a time of portfolio transition.","Turning to the financial results, on Page 6, of the slide deck worldwide revenues at $5.6 billion in the first quarter grew 2% year-over-year. Worldwide products sales at $5.3 billion in the first quarter grew 3% year-over-year as strong unit demand for our new products outweighed declines in our mature brands. We are particularly, encouraged by our 11% year-over-year volume growth in Europe, reflecting the value of our innovative products in a market where we have experienced bio similar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years.","Other revenues at $211 million decreased $54 million year-over-year due to an unfavorable compare related to milestone payments received in Q1 of 2017 partially offset by higher royalty income in Q1 of this year.","Non-GAAP operating income at $3 billion grew 1% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 56.9% for the first quarter. As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of the year driven by the timing of expenses.","As mentioned last quarter, we continue to evaluate incremental investments in our products and pipeline as well as external opportunities to drive growth and maximize shareholder value.","On an non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of products sales improved by 0.4 points to 12.7% driven by lower royalty expense partially offset by increasing manufacturing costs.","Research and development expenses at $739 million, were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2018 versus last year. Research and development as a percent of products sales at 13.8% is lower in Q1 consistent with previous years. Going forward, research and development expense as a percent of products sales is expected to normalize to around 2017 levels.","SG&A expenses increased 6% on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by launch preparations for Aimovig and our bio similar products, In addition to making greater investments in Prolia to capitalize on its full potential. Similar to our R&D expense profile the SG&A percentage of sales is traditionally lowest in Q1 and we expect the full year to normalize at or above the 2017 levels as we continue to invest in our launch and growth products.","In aggregate non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year, we remain on track to exceed our 2018 commitment of 1.5 billion in transformation savings, while investing those savings to launch and support new products, build out new therapeutic areas and advance our bio similar business increase our global presence and continue to provide meaningful returns to shareholders.","Other income and expenses, were a net $182 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $51 million, on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP tax rate was 13.7% for the quarter a 4.8 point decrease versus the first quarter of 2017. Reflecting the lower U.S. federal statutory rate due to tax reform.","Non-GAAP net income increased 6%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter to $3.47 per share.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cast flow was $2.6 billion for the quarter driven by higher net income as expenses normalized for the remainder of the year we would expect free cash flow in subsequent quarters to be somewhat reduced from Q1 levels. In addition, earlier this month we paid $600 million, which represented the first of eight annual installments of the cash repatriation tax. This payment will impact our Q2 free cash flow.","We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders consistent with our commitments as we deployed $10.8 billion in Q1 to repurchase 56.4 million shares. We plan to repurchase an incremental two to four billion of our shares in Q2. Additionally our first quarter dividend increased to $1.32 per share, an increase of 15% over last year.","Cash in investments totaled $32.2 billion, a decrease of approximately $6.2 billion from the first quarter of last year. This decrease reflects the successful execution of our Dutch auction tender offer in Q1 in addition to or significant buyback in dividend deployments over the past twelve months offset by our free cash flow generation during that same period.","Our debt balance stands at $35.5 billion as of March 31, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and an average maturity of 12 years.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2018 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue to invest in our pipeline. Build out our global presence and increase spend in support of long term volume growth across large patient populations. Today, we are revising our 2018 guidance, which reflects our solid Q1 growth as well as the revised tax outlook.","Overall, our revised revenue guidance is $21.9 billion to $22.8 billion versus previous guidance of $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion. This continues to reflect a range of potential Sensipar generic competition outcomes as well as new potential competition for Neulasta and Aranesp. At the same time contemplating the year-to-date sales performance for Calcimimetic portfolio.","With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are revising the outlook to $12.80 and $13.70 versus a prior guidance of $12.60 to $13.70. Further, we are revising our non-GAAP tax rate guidance to 13.5% to 14.5% versus prior guidance of 14% to 15%, as we have realized some favorable one-time items in 2018 associated with the implementation of tax reform.","We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million this year. This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Hooper","Thank you, David and good afternoon everyone. You\u2019ll find our product sales starting on Slide number 10. Our business, continues to shift to more volume driven growth, as we continue to launch innovative products targeting large patient populations with unmet medical needs.","We're off to a solid start to the year, with all of our newer products delivering double digit growth. The total portfolio grew at about 3% as the legacy brands, some of this volume growth.","As has been trend for the last number of quarters our ex-U.S. business continues to grow more rapidly generating 7% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange fueled by 9% volume growth.","In many of our ex-U.S. markets we've already experienced a majority of the decline of a mature brands demonstrating the growth potential of our newer portfolio. These markets serve as a model, for the overall company's future growth profile. We\u2019re also in deep preparation for the upcoming launches Aimovig for migraine sufferers and the first of our bio-similar portfolio. A majority of the sales teams are trained and in place and subsequent investment levels will continue ramping up throughout the year.","Let me now turn to our brand performance. Prolia, leading brand osteoporosis therapy grew 16% year-over-year primarily from volume. We continue to drive growth of new patients, as well as improved repeat injection rates. This results in an increasing share of postmenopausal osteoporosis segment, as patients and physicians realize the benefits Prolia.","As a reminder, given a six month dosing interval Prolia exhibits a seasonal sales pattern with quarter one and quarter three representing lower sales, than quarter two and four. Overall market penetration either is still low in the 20% indicating, significant potential for improved diagnosis and treatment. With this unique profile and through an increased investment we expect Prolia will remain a very strong growth driver.","Let\u2019s now move to the oncology, starting with Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 17% year-on-year driven primary by our ex-U.S. business. The majority of second line usage in Europe is in the triplets regimen and Kyprolis has continued to take market share from Velcade. In the U.S. the overall multiple myeloma market defined as all lines of treatment grew in the first quarter. Kyprolis has stable shape but room to growth in the second line segment. Our focus message to physicians remains clear. Patients who have relapsed will actually live longer than when treated with regimens that include Kyprolis.","XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year primary from volume. Although we believe more than half of this growth is from a buy in that should burn off over the coming quarters. Since our label expansion into multiple myeloma in January 2018, our teams have been emphasizing XGEVA\u2019s clinical benefits of preventing skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma. It's still early days but anecdotally we are receiving positive feedback from physicians and institutions as many multiple myeloma patients cannot receive optimal therapy with [indiscernible].","Whilst we're not providing a slide let me comment on the other products on our oncology portfolio. The combined sales Nplate, to Vectibix, IMLYGIC and BLINCYTO exceeded $400 million in the quarter. Sales growth of these brands at 16%, 15%, 20% and 44% respectively was driven primarily by volume growth with some benefit from a buy up during the quarter.","I'm particularly pleased by the performance of BLINCYTO, which is our first product in the BiTE platform. You'll hear more about this from Sean as well as his views on other products emerging from the platform.","Turning now to Neulasta. Neulasta sales decreased 5% year-over-year as we continue to see a slight decline in the use of minor suppressant chemotherapeutic agents. We also saw a small blind little burn off in the second quarter. We continue to drive adoption of Onpro in the U.S. and exited quarter one at a 62% share. Onpro\u2019s utilization in the U.S. market further underscores the values of those patent protected technology and providing convenience for patients and lower rates of hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia.","We expect to see more global utilization on Onpro in 2018. As a reminder we recently received positive CHMP Opinion for Onpro in Europe and are in the late stages of launch preparation in several markets.","For NEUPOGEN, we continue to compete effectively holding just under 40% market share of the short acting market in the U.S., as we exit quarter one. This is after four plus years of facing competition.","Moving now to Enbrel, sales declined 6% year-over-year with market growth and volume trends consistent with recent quarters. The stands in contrast to the trend break in market growth experience quarter one 2017.","Recall that during quarter one patients experienced insurance re-verification and resetting of deductibles some of which resulted in a higher patient assistance class relative to late quarters \u2013 to latter quarters. Consistent with our pride disclosure we continue to expect 2018 net selling price to decline slightly versus 2017. While early days, the launch of ENBREL Mini with AutoTouch has been met with very positive feedback from both patients and customers and we\u2019re excited about this opportunity, this innovative, patient-centric delivery system provides.","As a final note, purchasing patterns or the supply chain for ENBREL can cause quarterly fluctuations. As we noted previously, quarter one represents the lowest quarter of the year slightly over 20%, with the balance distributed fairly evenly through the rest of the year. Unit declines, net selling price trends for the balance of the year are expected to continue consistent with those seen in quarter one.","Switching now to ESA portfolio. Slide number 18 shows the quarter one 2018 composition of our ESA business and provides a year-on-year growth percentage for the different segments. EPOGEN declined 10% year-on-year, underlying volume remains relatively stable, while we recognize a lower net selling price, as a result of our extended supply agreement with DaVita.","Aranesp declined 11% year-over-year with lower unit demand of 8%, primarily based on increased competition. Recall that last quarter we provided a disclosure that a long-acting competitor had extended their product more broadly into the small to mid-size dialysis centers. And then we expect to lose some of those businesses early as quarter one 2018.","We have volume and share based contacts with some of these customers and we'll continue to compete on an account by account basis. We're also prepared to compete for the potential short acting biosimilar in all customer segments including hospitals and oncology clinics, if and when such a biosimilar is approved by the FDA. Our long track record of safety, efficacy and reliable supply is a competitive advantage.","Turning now to cosmetics, we've launched Parsabiv in several markets including the U.S. and is off to a strong start. As the head to head technical data showed, Parsabiv demonstrated a greater level of efficacy when compared to Sensipar. Since it\u2019s administered in the patients existing IV line during dialysis, it puts control in the hands of the health care provider, which could also drive an improved level of adherence, nephrologists continue to be positive and are excited about having this product available.","In the U.S. so far we have a solid uptake in the midsized dialysis providers. The larger free-standing dialysis clinics continue to run pilots to determine the eventual treatment protocols. We expect to see adoption increase gradually over time.","Turning now to Sensipar where year-over-year growth of 18%. As a reminder, the reimbursement mechanism for Sensipar in the U.S. changed from Part D to Part B in the beginning of 2018. It was also altered the supply chain for patients, most of whom now receive Sensipar directly from the dialysis provider versus more traditional pharmacies. We believe the providers ordered additional supply during quarter one in order to minimize potential patient treatment interruption.","We also believe that the new supply chain is now normalized and quarterly volume should return to more historical run rates, assuming continued exclusivity and take into account some transition to Parsabiv. As David mentioned, the 2018 outlook for Sensipar is still somewhat uncertain given the ongoing litigation. It is of course conceivable that competitors may be able to bring generic products to market at some point in 2018, although, we believe we have a strong litigation position.","With Repatha, we continue to compete effectively maintaining a majority share on a global basis, with outcomes data in our Repatha label. Our team has been speaking directly to the benefits of treating patients with Repatha and its ability to reduce the risk of heart attack by 27% and stroke by 21%.","Repatha grew 151% year-over-year, primarily from volume. Overall fulfillment rates in U.S. continue to improve as utilization management criteria evolved. Over the past few months we've seen access to Repatha continue to be improved and we remain committed to ensuring access and affordability of high risk cardiovascular patients. We've been negotiating with several payers for months to expand patient access to Repatha and offering significant discounts with multiple offers spending.","As a market leader, a majority of new PCSK9 inhibitor prescriptions offer Repatha. The only PCSK9 inhibitor approved by the FDA to prevent heart attacks and strokes in patients with established ASCV disease, in addition we have unequivocally demonstrated that treating patients to the lowest LDL level as possible is the best treatment approach including for patients with baseline LDL levels as low as 70 milligrams per deciliter.","Our priority remains reaching the large population of high risk cardiovascular patients. The cost of society of not treating these patients in unacceptable and we look into all options to improve access for appropriate high risk patients, we also look forward to having the Repatha labels updated and expanded with the outcomes data outside the U.S. soon.","Let me finish what I started, we continue to transition to a portfolio exemplified by volume-driven growth with performance in many countries outside the U.S. as proof point. A majority of our brands grew double-digit, our performance in our mature brands as well as some of the new ones demonstrate our ability to compete. This gives us confidence as we prepare for our upcoming launches. So let me close by thanking all the Amgen\u2019s staff that work so hard to get these important products to patients and for the strong start to 2018.","Now I\u2019ll pass you to Sean.","Sean Harper","Thanks Tony and good afternoon. I'll begin my comments today with a brief overview some key milestones from Q1 and then highlight a few early stage innovative programs we find particularly promising. We recently received several important regulatory decisions in Europe, including the approval of an expanded indication for XGEVA prevent skeletal related events in patients with multiple myeloma.","We also received several positive opinions from the CHMP including recommendations for the addition of our cardiovascular outcomes data to the Repatha label. A Neulasta label variation to include the Onpro kit and a marketing authorization for KANJINTI, our biosimilar Herceptin, I would note that KANJINTI, has a PDUFA action date next month in the United States, also in the U.S.","BLINCYTO received accelerated approval and orphan designation for the treatment of adults and children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia with minimal residual disease or MRD. There are now technologies that allow for exquisite sensitivity in detecting at a molecular level whether residual disease are suppressant. MRD is the strongest prognostic factor for relapse in ALL patients and in our Phase 2 study of ALL patients in complete remission that were positive for MRD, 81% achieved MRD negativity after a single cycle of BLINCYTO.","This was the first step for approval for the treatment of MRD by FDA and we're gratified that our first BiTE therapy is meaningfully advanced the oncology field. This approval presents a paradigm shift not only in the treatment of ALL but also potentially in other diseases were extremely potent therapies are being employed as such we're incorporating MRD into all of our clinical studies as appropriate. And we continue to develop therapies that drive deep and durable responses.","For the first time, there is talk of actually achieving cures and what have been fatal diseases and we're excited to help lead the way. We have the opportunity to highlight preclinical data from several of our Phase 1 assets at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting early this month.","The antiapoptotic family members MCL-1 and BCL-2 are understood to play a key roles in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia or AML, a grievous disease that affects four times as many people as ALL with approximately 20,000 new cases and 10,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. At AACR, we presented promising data showing market improvements in activity and potency with the combination of our MCL-1 inhibitor AMG 176 and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax compared to either agent alone in preclinical settings.","A Phase 1 study of AMG 176 as monotherapy is currently enrolling relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and AML patients. We also discussed our unique ability to target the antigen DLL3, very exciting target with both BiTE and CAR-T technologies, small cell lung cancer is an aggressive disease with very poor outcomes and accounts for about 10% to 15% of all lung cancers. Despite this, there have been no significant advances in the treatment of this devastating disease in decades. DLL3 expression is highly restricted to small cell lung cancer.","And we've developed two very potent modalities for clinical testing. AMG 757 or half-life extended \u2013BiTE if its currently enrolling patients in Phase 1 and AMG 119 or DLL3 CAR-T developed with KITE that we expect to begin enrolling very soon. We're really anxious to see the effects of targeting DLL3 with immuno-oncology approaches which we believe will be more effective compared to a traditional antibody or antibody drug conjugate approach.","We also presented preclinical data characterizing our half-life extended BCMA BiTE for multiple myeloma AMG 701 and our FLT3 CAR-T program for AML. At the Society of Interventional Radiology meeting in March, we presented Phase 1 safety data from our hepatic injection study of IMLYGIC. And we're now moving into Phase 2 in combination with KEYTRUDA in hepatocellular carcinoma and a number of tumor types with liver metastases.","All of these programs underscore our differentiated multimodality approach to our immuno-oncology platform, where in addition to IMLYGIC, we're currently advancing more than a dozen early stage BiTE molecules, there are seven already in the clinic and three CAR-Ts through our collaboration with Kite.","We're particularly interested in the potential for BiTE in solid tumors and we've been seeing some very encouraging early activity. We look forward to initial clinical data from AMG 420, our BCMA BiTE for multiple myeloma and AMG 330, our CD33 BiTE for AML by the end of this year.","Briefly on Aimovig, our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, we continue to work with the FDA toward our May 17th PDUFA action day and data are being presented today at the American Academy of Neurology from a study in patients with migraine who have previously failed two to four preventive treatments. These unique results add to the consistent body of evidence for Aimovig across the spectrum of migraine patients from treatment na\u00efve through those who have failed multiple therapies.","Finally, I'd like to spend a few minutes on one of our early inflammation programs, AMG 592, an IL-2 mutein current therapies for auto immune diseases suppress the immune system. While this approach is effective in therapies such as Enbrel have changed the practice of medicine significant unmet need remains for many of these diseases. In a normally functioning immune system regulatory T cells or Tregs maintain balance between self and non-self recognition by negatively regulating effector cells.","In the autoimmune disease state, this balances off favoring the effector cells within paired Treg responses having been identified in multiple human diseases including through human genetics. IL-2 is the dominant growth factor for Tregs but in its native form, it has significant toxicity associated with administration.","With AMG 592, we\u2019ve designed an IL-2 mutein with an extended half life that preferentially binds to the IL-2 receptor. So as to selectively promote Treg growth and function, at last year's American Society of Hematology meeting, we presented in Phase 1a data in healthy volunteers that showed a single dose of AMG 592 was well tolerated and resulted in dose dependent increases in Tregs with minimal increases in effector cells as shown on Slide 30.","Based on these exciting results, we've already initiated proof-of-concept studies in graft, chronic graft versus host disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. We\u2019re very excited about the potential for AMG 592 and believe that this approach could be quite powerful in a number of inflammatory diseases.","In closing I want to thank our staff for their dedication to developing break-through medicines for the benefit of patients. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you, Sean. Inn, we turn over to our question time now and perhaps you could remind our callers of the procedure for asking question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Afternoon, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. Tony for Aimovig, I know we\u2019re close to the launch and I realize it\u2019s competitive. But maybe if you could help us with kind of how you see the size and scale of the commercial organization. And from a reimbursement perspective, maybe what are the lessons to be learned from the PCSK9 experience when you look to the migraine launch. Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Geoff, let me try and answer it in two ways that we are going to market together with Novartis. Novartis have a rich history of presence in the neuroscience market, both in terms of the salesforce and an outstanding medical organization. We have complementing it with both teams calling on specialists as well as some of the primary care physicians who have a propensity to look after patients with severe headaches or migraines.","From a timing perspective, we clearly are in the lead. We look forward to launching first unlike the PCSK9 situation. We had to follow. We will actually sit in the price of cells. And this is clearly a market where patients have huge symptoms and actually know when they\u2019re not being properly treated. So we look forward to a large dose of patients who want to come of this drug as quickly as possible.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank.","Maryana Breitman","Yes. Hi guys, thank you for taking the questions. Maryana Breitman for Andrew Peters. I wanted to ask about a possible strategic moves, do you see [indiscernible] like new platform or technical capability or an individual products and what stage products would those be?","Bob Bradway","Well. I\u2019m afraid your phone line was breaking up. So we couldn\u2019t hear the question. Do you want to try to repeat that and then Inn, if we can\u2019t hear at this time maybe you can recycle her towards the bottom end of the call. Sorry, won\u2019t you try again, let see we can hear you.","Maryana Breitman","Can you hear me now?","Bob Bradway","Not great. Why don\u2019t we get you on a different line and ask our operator Inn to help you get back in the queue.","Maryana Breitman","Okay, Thank you.","Operator","All right. While recycle our back through, our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Bob I think previously on some of the prior calls, you referred to access capacity in the system. I was just wondering if you can update us on your latest thoughts there particularly in light of some of the consolidation we\u2019re seeing on the services side of the industry. Thanks a lot.","Bob Bradway","Nothing new Terence. As I said in my remarks, we\u2019re continuing to look at ways to use our balance sheet to strengthen the business, continuing to look at ways to invest in innovation. So we\u2019ve made our \u2013 I think our points on that topic well known and I wouldn\u2019t say, there\u2019s been change over the course of last quarter.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Christopher Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Christopher Raymond","Hi, thanks guys. Just one question on Enbrel. We kind of struck Tony by your prepared comments. I know you talked about this last quarter that Q1 would represent, I think you said 20% of the annual number for full year 2018. Just doing the math I think that would infer Enbrel revenue of about $5.5 billion for the full year. And I know you guys don\u2019t want to give guidance at any more granular than you\u2019ve already given. But that numbers a lot bigger than consensus and what actually imply on up year-on-year number which would seem to be a reversal from what we saw 2016 to 2017. So I just want to if you could verify that, first of all, is that math is right. Maybe sort of talk about the driver there in terms of that trend reversal. Thanks.","Tony Hooper","Yes. So let me confirm again that quarter one is normally a 30 low quarter, because of the need for re-verification, the need for the reset of deductibles. So patients pick up in the second quarter. We said last quarter that we expected this quarter to be about 20% of the total annual revenue and then probably landed up at \u2013 being at about 21%, almost 22% of what I expect the full year to be. So my number don\u2019t get as high as yours.","Christopher Raymond","Got it, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang","Hi, Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering maybe Tony, can you comment on the recent ICER draft analysis on a cost benefit on Aimovig, and actually propose that wrench of the pricing. Would you actually take that into your consideration when you price Aimovig? Thanks.","Tony Hooper","Ying, so a couple of things. One, it is a is a draft publication by ICER. They are requesting public comments up to an including, I think the 8 of May. So a number of organizations are busy commenting on that. It is the second publication, obviously, if you remember that that they has already been one publication, which took place on the 23 of March in the Journal of Medical Economics, authored by a number of headache specialists and economists, which laid out in very clear value range for this particular category. The ICER report doesn\u2019t seem to take into account things such as absenteeism and presenteeism, which we would argue is really an important thing to look at from both an employee perspective and an employer perspective. But all of these ranges for within a reasonable level that will be discussing with the payers.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on AMG 592, just curious if there\u2019s any kind of particular preclinical work that suggests an opportunity favors maybe lupus, RA or GvHD? Or is it kind of still an open question. Is there also the possibility for less frequent dosing there?","Sean Harper","So we \u2013 this is a half-life extended kind of a construct that we\u2019ve designed. And I think that we have some, of course we have preclinical models of these diseases. But I would say that when you\u2019re working with such a different mechanism than has ever been applied to autoimmune disease before. Our faith in the predictive nature of these animal models of diseases like lupus and RA and so on is modest. So we use all kinds of scientific reasoning and the animal models to guide us into kind of the initial set of experiments that we chose. But it\u2019s fair to say that like was the case when for example TNF inhibitors came available or IL-17 and so on. It\u2019s ultimately important screened through humans with these diseases to determine, whether the mechanism can be fruitful.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Kripa on for Robyn. Like you mentioned earlier, you\u2019re developing therapies in multiple modes such as BiTEs and CAR-Ts to target the same indications and you have a lot in the pipeline. I was just wondering if you can take us to your thought process on how you decide to target the same indication with two different modalities or how you decide to go in one direction versus the other.","Sean Harper","Right. So it\u2019s a good question, I mean the first thing I would point out is that, at the moment moving into the clinic. We really just have a few CAR-Ts and we deliberately matched a couple of them with BiTEs so that we could actually, scientifically determine the pros and cons of these technologies. Because the data that exists today are very much apples and oranges in terms of the patient populations and the way that they\u2019ve been pre-conditioned for example before being treated with, let\u2019s say, CAR-T cell versus BLINCYTO, even when you get into diseases that are on the surface the same ALL for example or the various forms of CD19 positive lymphoma.","So I don\u2019t want to give you the \u2013 you to get the impression that for lots and lots of our targets we have double programs. We have helpful that are designed specifically to, hopefully in humans give us some understanding of whether the benefit risk looks better for one these hyper technologies versus another. And so that\u2019s kind of an approach and we like to understand that in both hematologic and in solid tumor settings.","Ultimately what will determine what we move forward with is, primarily in oncology is going to be efficacy, right with an acceptable amount of safety. And what we really don\u2019t know yet is whether you can get some generally similar kind of a clinical benefit from \u2013 for example, a bite intervention versus a CAR T, it would be hard to imagine that you would select the CAR T under those circumstances given a lots of consider practical, considerations cost to goods and thing in that sort.","It\u2019s early days, I don\u2019t think anyone has ever really made these comparisons, there is a lot of speculation. And we\u2019re hoping to shed some actual light on these clinical questions.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much for taking the questions. Sean, list on your milestone still romosozumab in both U.S. regulatory submission and European review. Could you give us some update on your expectations for the labeled indication and the sort of size of the addressable patient population for romosozumab now?","Sean Harper","Sure. Yes, I think that with romo, we\u2019re at this point where we\u2019re well into a process of discovering the entire clinical data base experience with the molecule to make sure that we have every cardiovascular event that may have occurred in any of the trials and then run them through a new blinded adjudication process. Well that make sound easy, it\u2019s actually quite time consuming and requires coordination between us and another clinical center in this case Timmy. So that\u2019s underway and I think the results of that are going to be very important in determining where we end up with the product.","Obviously the unmet need for this kind of anabolic product it\u2019s very strong. The compelling need for it, the efficacy was very favorable. And it\u2019s a short period of treatment one year, so I think that what we really need to understand is do we believe that there is actually a cardiovascular risk because as you know, Geoff, we have two studies they can\u2019t both be true, one of them says there\u2019s a risk the other one says no.","So if we get some additional information from this reanalysis it could tip the scales in one direction or the other, we\u2019re just seeking the truth. And then whatever the truth is it will make its way into the label. So it\u2019s a little bit hard to know where that benefit risk will land and whether we\u2019ll be talking about a patient population that has a particularly significant level of unmet need and therefore it makes sense to use it in a context in which we actually believe there\u2019s a cardiovascular risk versus that the cardiovascular risk seems to be much less of a true phenomenon. And so that\u2019s the best I can do to characterize that at this moment.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.","Michael Yee","Hi. Thanks for the question. I have a question for Bob. I mean, I guess there was a large M&A deal in the space last week. But I guess more important big picture your view of the environment given that there has not been that many deals. Do you feel for Amgen it is more of a case of not finding things that are good fits or it\u2019s a price issue? I guess maybe you could talk about the overall dynamic when you are looking at all of these different biotech companies. Thanks so much.","Bob Bradway","Again I think, we have a track record of being pretty disciplined. The way we evaluate targets, our focuses on being confident that we have a pathway for our shareholders to earn a return. But we\u2019re looking for ways to invest in our industry, we\u2019re interested in innovation that aligns well with our six therapeutic areas that we focus in. And opportunities that are consistent with our desired advance innovation globally. But I think Mike, historically the evolutions have been challenged in this sector. We see a little bit of adjustment taking place now. And we\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful in reviewing all the different opportunities. So we think can help us earn a return for our shareholders and help make a difference for patients.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt","Hey, congrats on a great start to 2018. Maybe a question for Tony on Repatha. Since the presentation of the ODYSSEY data have you seen any changes in market share or any change in your pricing discussions with payers? Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Eric, we saw an increase in the NBRxs after the outcomes data came into Repatha\u2019s label. Since the ACC, we\u2019ve seen relatively little change in the marketplace to date.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Bob, my question is there\u2019s been a lot investor feedback on a possible merger of equals like a transformative deal between Amgen and a big pharma name \u2013 a European pharma name in particular. How do you feel about a transformative M&A situation? Is that something you\u2019re open to philosophically or is the focus really more on Smith Biotech.","Bob Bradway","Our focus somewhere is on finding opportunities to invest in innovation, again, we think we can make a difference innovation is focused in the areas that are important to us and opportunities that enable us to continue to expand our global footprint. So, I think speculation rises and falls through time at our industry. But our focus on those things has been consistent as has our determination to have a pathway to earn a return for our shareholders through our business development activities.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about CGRP and recognizing the competitive nature of this class. But with the article out this morning commenting on Express Scripts intention to push for lower list prices on the CGRP class to limit out of pocket cost borne by patients and implement a pay for performance type of model. Would you say this is consistent with the interactions you\u2019ve had with payers and maybe how you\u2019re thinking about different pricing models for this class following on the heels of some of the more unconventional pricing scheme as you\u2019ve implemented for PCSK9s. Thanks.","Tony Hooper","So Cory let me start that one and I\u2019ll let Sean to talk about some of the differentiation between our product and the others that are trying to come to market. Clearly, we are in the lead as they said and coming to market first is important it allows us to set the baseline price. We look very carefully at the value based pricing has come forward. We\u2019ve listened to the affordability question in the marketplace with the ESI or looking at value based prices and look forward to them opening up access in those situations to allow \u2013 access to appropriate patients.","And we will continue to come forward with prices that are responsible that take into account the co-pay requirements as best we can. We have a number of risk based contracts on the table with Repatha and we\u2019ve acquired to pay that talk to players about risk based complex with Aimovig. So let me ask Sean to talk a little about why we think this drug is actually very different to the others coming to markets.","Sean Harper","Well, Tony I think that there\u2019s a number of things to just point to in terms of the advantage besides being first to market. I first of all, we are a receptor antagonist and that is still the case, we\u2019re the only receptor antagonist in the clinic and we chose that path for a number of reasons. But one of them was potency and so we seem to be the only product that doesn\u2019t require loading doses or intravenous administration, which can be quite an awkward thing for patients and providers in general.","We recently developed the data and this is being presented today in this population and highly refractory patients who failed as many as four prior prophylactic therapies and the data looked really strong in that group. So that\u2019s a differentiated data set. And I think also remember that when physicians are dealing with patients and it is encratic either adverse reactions or lack of \u2013 or presence of efficacy they have to choose between different agents within a class.","Generally speaking, a physician is if they started with for example one of the ligand sequestering antibodies going to another ligand sequestering antibody doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense compared to trying a receptor antagonist. So we hope that the receptor \u2013 us being the only receptor antagonists would result in more therapeutic sort of options for physicians who are trying to manage this very challenging condition.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould from UBS Equities.","Carter Gould","Afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess commercial question for Tony on XGEVA. Hoping to get a little bit more detail on the uptick in the quarter, if you could maybe provide some rough detail on the size of the buy end versus how much was driven by myeloma. And you provided some anecdotes from physicians\u2019 and institutions but maybe some commentary on how access is going into simplification. Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Okay, Carter. So, it\u2019s a great indication to have to expand the label we estimate there\u2019s about one hundred thousand multiple myeloma patients in the U.S. that potentially could benefit from the product. Because it\u2019s a Part B product I don\u2019t see the prescriptions as tightly as I do with the Part D products. So we tend to look back about six to eight weeks in arrears. It is clear that there\u2019s a large number of patients who could benefit from this the feedback has been good. The buy end probably accounts for about $30 million in the quarter, which we expect to burn out quite quickly. But everything we\u2019ve heard to date has been positive.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask the question on Parsabiv if I could I understand the financial and sort of growth prospects for the next year or two while the product outside of the bundle. Maybe you could just talk to us about what happened in this product and how you think about it as potentially longer-term growth driver once it gets added into the bundle and what the scenarios are for that? Thank.","Bob Bradway","That would be tough to calculate that. As you know the dapple will run for a minimum of two years CMS will do a full evaluation of the benefit of the drug. We\u2019ve looked at our head to head trial, we feel that was fairly beneficial from an efficacy perspective. We also believe because of the PPI we line administration during dialysis that adherence will improve. And by definition the real world situation will deliver a higher level of value to both the patients and the dialysis units. And therefore it\u2019s not an and all it\u2019s really evaluating the benefit the drug brings and then how that is calculated into the future bundle going forward post a dapple.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen MacKay","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe another one for Tony. I was just wondering if you could elaborate, just what was going on with Aranesp surrounding the competition at some of the smaller providers. And then on the long-term guidance wondering if you\u2019re accounting for HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors in the coming years here. Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Okay. So Aranesp, as you know, is bifurcated into a whole lot of pieces more than half of our business is outside the United States where the business continues to be fairly stable other than foreign exchange. Inside the U.S. it is divided between the dialysis nephrology business the hospital nephrology business and the oncology areas. Oncology has been declining for some time, so we see no change there.","In the nephrology dialysis there has been a movement from a competitor a long acting competitor from FMC that has now moved into some of the IDOS and the MDOS and some of the decline you are seeing, we do have volume and shape contract with a few of these people and we will continue to fight account by account. And then on the nephrology hospital there\u2019s a strange compare versus first quarter 2017 which included a large clinical trial purchased from a competitor.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","Hi everybody and thanks for squeezing me in. Tony I\u2019m afraid this is one as \u2013 around the PCSK9. As we think about the contracts you try to sign out with the payers. Are you guys looking for open access, are you looking to close the card with a single word, or is your competitor interested in doing that and you\u2019re following him. And second, you kind of mentioned the issue around how low this one needs to go with LDLC. And I was wondering if Sean can comment on the GEM article showing kind of like feeding off the benefit when you start a patient below 100 LDLC.","Tony Hooper","So, I think we\u2019ve always said that we would always want to have a situation where the physician has a choice on behalf of the patient. So I would always advocate for having an open formerly. We do talk consistently about looking for ways and means to have access for this high risk patient population. There\u2019s about 3.4 million patients in the high risk population. We think a very, very small percentage a single digit penetration has been made in that population to date. And then I\u2019ll let Sean talk about the scientific discussion around lowering LDL.","Sean Harper","Yes. So I\u2019m familiar with the GEM article that you were referring to that was just published it\u2019s a meta-analysis. I\u2019d point you to the accompanying editorial, which I thought was pretty good at outlining some of the likely confounding that occurred in that meta-analysis. The problem with these meta-analyses is when they go back in time 20 plus years and look at mortality. They\u2019re very confounded by the case fatality rates that occur when people are hospitalized in the studies or experienced heart attack and stroke for example. So if you go back to for example the 4S study or Western Scotland studies the case fatality rate for a heart attack back in those days was like 30%, now it\u2019s 4%.","So you really end up with a very confounded analysis which says, well gee, when you start with a high LDL and you lower it kind of to a mid range you get this big benefit on mortality. Well that\u2019s just what they were doing back then because there were no statins. And so people came in at very high LDL levels and they got reduced. And nowadays they come in at much lower LDL levels and it\u2019s virtually impossible to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in mortality, which has not happened in them in a long time and with a lowering trials.","So I think that it\u2019s very confounded, I think the editorial speaks to most of that and also just talks about shouldn\u2019t we pay attention to the biology in our understanding holistically about how these products work and the data that emerged from all the studies that have happened in this field whether they be with statins or products like ezetimibe or now the PCSK9 inhibitors. The overall clear picture is that no matter where your LDL starts if you lower it substantially in a patient who\u2019s at high risk, you\u2019re going to really going to get a very large risk reduction.","It is true that if a patient starts at a high LDL they have a higher risk because LDLs are risk factors. So in absolute terms you get a little bit more benefit for treating patients who have higher LDLs. But the relative risk reduction appears to be consistent across trend and the highest quality data show a very clear picture of lower is better without any safety concern. So that\u2019s my comments on it.","Tony Hooper","As of going past 6:00 PM on the East Coast. Why don\u2019t we take two last questions after which Bob will make some closing comments.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities.","Salim Syed","Yes. Hi, great guys. Thanks for the question. I just had one on Repatha. So there\u2019s a ACC treatment guidelines some people are expected to come out this year at ACC Conference 2018 that\u2019s November I believe. Do you have that same view? And then how do you expect \u2013 when you expect to come out of that in terms of practical incremental revenue opportunity for Repatha, they lower the target LDL levels. Thank you.","Bob Bradway","I just comment that I think you\u2019re right that this sort of general expectation is that they do around the EHA time frame and at this point one assumes that they\u2019re not going to be waiting around for another data set that I can think of to look at lowering land. So I think it\u2019s pretty likely that they\u2019ll come out. And I think that if you look at the pathway update that was done some months ago likely is kind of indicative directionally of where they\u2019re likely to go as the data has accumulated.","Tony Hooper","And then from a revenue perspective, I would imagine it would be very difficult for payer to have utilization and management criteria that defer to the guidelines that are published by the HA and the ACC.","Operator","And our next question is from James Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing us in again. This is Nick in for Jim. Just going back to CAR T can you comment on Amgen\u2019s investment in the space with respect to helping commercially ready as opposed to academic components such as access, clothes manufacturing systems? And then for solid tumors many of you to get success with CAR T you\u2019ll need to take a combination approach. Can you share that view? Thank you.","Sean Harper","Well let me answer the second question first. I think that \u2013 I believe that in most disease settings with whether you\u2019re dealing with the CAR T or the buy specific T cell engaging type technology particularly in solid tumor settings but even in some settings such as lymphoma. People will hypothesize that there could be additive or synergistic effects between checkpoint inhibition and the use of piece kind of targeted antigene focused approach. So I think time will tell but you can expect to see many of these agents developed where in arm and in the clinical trial will be to combine the product with a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to looking at its activity alone. I hope that\u2019s answer that part of the question. And Tony I think there was a component of the question having to do with kind of the more of the commercial landscape.","I mean, these are Phase I, these are \u2013 we\u2019re just getting ready to started enrolling the first patient in our first CAR T program in Phase 1. We\u2019re certainly working with Tony\u2019s organization but at this early stage at this point.","Tony Hooper","And Nick I\u2019m not sure as well as you\u2019re referring to the manufacturing but anyway you can follow up with Arvind and his team who were here for a while. We didn\u2019t get to the full breadth of your question. Anyway let me just wrap up by thanking you all for joining the call. As you can see we\u2019re off to a good start here at the first quarter of 2018. We think we\u2019re in a strong position heading into the balance of the year. And we\u2019re feeling confident about the long-term outlook for growth of the company.","So we look forward to joining with you again here after the second quarter. Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Well thanks everybody. Thanks, Inn.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Amgen\u2019s first quarter 2018 financial results conference call.

Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, thank you, Jake. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015.","I would particularly like to acknowledge those who are new in their coverage of Amgen, including Steve Chesney of Atlantic Equities in London, Ronny Gal of Bernstein, Alethia Young of Credit Suisse, Hartaj Singh of BTIG, and Brian Skorney of Baird. Welcome. Each of us look forward to working with you and helping you understand of our company.","We have a lot of ground to cover today, so let me make some very quick introductions. Leading the call today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic report on our performance in 2015 and outlook for 2016. Following Bob, our CFO, David Meline, will review our Q4 and full-year results and update you on our previous preliminary financial guidance for 2016. Tony Hooper, our head of Global Commercial Operations, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, with a particular focus on newly launched products. Following Tony, our head of R&D, Sean Harper, will provide a pipeline update.","We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email.","Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thank you, Arvind, and let me add my welcome to those of you who are joining our call.","Let me start off by saying that 2015 was an exceptional year for Amgen. It was another year of consistent and reliable performance as we delivered for patients and shareholders. I think you can see that first in our financial results. Eight percent revenue growth in 2015 reflects the strength and breadth of our products, and our 19% adjusted earnings growth reflects the operating leverage we've created through our successful and ongoing transformation efforts.","The momentum of our products can be seen in the 17% growth we recorded from our inline brands, including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate. Together these brands generated $11 billion for us. Our legacy medicines also performed well, and these continue to be strong cash flow generators for us. And we remain positioned to compete as new players enter the market.","While delivering these solid results for the year, we also laid important groundwork for our future growth with four innovative launches in oncology and two in cardiovascular disease over the past 12 months. As we've said before, we expect Repatha and Kyprolis to be significant opportunities for us, and see these as great examples of innovative medicines that address big unmet needs by providing significant clinical benefits and demonstrable value propositions for patients and providers. The importance of having value propositions such of these is only said to grow in the innovative biopharmaceutical industry, and we're well-positioned to embrace that reality in our pipeline.","Developing innovative medicines to address serious illness is at the core of what we do. Behind our six new product launches are a number of additional exciting innovative pipeline opportunities, notably romosozumab in bone health; and AMG 334, which is directed at migraine in the neuroscience area. Also of note is our nephrology product, etelcalcetide, which is under regulatory review, and omecamtiv mecarbil, which is an intriguing opportunity for us in cardiovascular disease.","In addition to our own pipeline of molecules, we expect to remain active in business development. When it comes to later-stage opportunities, we would expect this to revolve around our six core areas, which are hematology\/oncology, cardiovascular, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, and neuroscience.","Focus will remain important to us, and you see that reflected in our decision this week to out-license our respiratory molecule, AMG 282. While we were intrigued by the genetics behind this target and the potential for the molecule in asthma and COPD, we feel the commercialization of it can be better optimized by Genentech, given their established presence in this field.","We continue to expand our global geographic reach, now with full ownership of our products in new markets and the very exciting approval of Repatha in Japan with our partner Astellas, which represents our first product approval for this Japanese partnership.","Our biosimilars program is also making tangible progress, with one under regulatory review, one having completed Phase 3, and another for which Phase 3 results are expected later this year.","We're making significant progress with our transformation efforts here at Amgen. We've already reduced gross costs by $700 million, enabling our 2015 adjusted operating margin to grow by some four points. We will make further progress in 2016, and we're expecting another $400 million of gross savings as we expect to reduce adjusted operating expenses year over year. Our transformation has also made us more agile, and you see the benefits of that in our competitive performance across our products.","In manufacturing, our teams are significant contributors to our transformation efforts, driving down our cost of sales and making final preparations for the licensure of our next-generation bio-manufacturing facility in Singapore.","Improved drug delivery systems are an important differentiator of our medicines, and we're delivering solid results with them. The Neulasta Onpro kit has been extremely successful in the marketplace. And we filed our Repatha once-monthly dosing option globally. We'll continue to innovate with patient and provider-friendly delivery systems to help differentiate our products.","We've also remained focused on smart capital allocation. Through a combination of share buybacks, dividends, and value-creating business development activities that are aligned with our overall strategy, we expect to drive shareholder value.","We established a set of targeted financial commitments through 2018. These metrics were chosen in part to provide evidence that we are making clear progress on our strategy through a period of patent expiration and new product launches. I'm pleased to report that as we closed 2015, we've made significant progress toward accomplishing these longer-term metrics.","And finally, as we enter 2016, our position is strong, our strategy is clear, and we're excited about the year ahead. I'd like to think my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders.","David, over to you.","David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bob.","Turning to the fourth quarter on page five of the slide deck, revenues at $5.5 billion grew 4% year over year, with a 3% increase in product sales. Other revenues at $207 million increased $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting an increase in royalty income and a milestone payment recognized in the quarter.","Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 16% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved five percentage points to 44% for the quarter, reflecting the continued benefits of our transformation program.","On an adjusted basis, total operating expenses decreased 4% year over year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately two percentage points.","Cost of sales margin at 14.3% improved by 1.6 percentage points, driven by lower manufacturing costs, higher net selling price, and lower royalties.","Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were down 10% year over year, reflecting the Q4 2014 upfront payment to Kite Pharma of $60 million for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration, as well as the benefit of R&D expense savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.","SG&A expenses were up 3% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting incremental expenses in Q4 for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.","Other income and expenses improved by $53 million year over year to a net expense of $120 million in the quarter, primarily due to cash investment portfolio activities as well as higher interest income due to higher cash balances this year.","The tax rate was 11.6% for the quarter, a 1.4 percentage point increase versus Q4 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to a decreased benefit from the R&D tax credit in 2015 versus 2014 due to higher pre-tax income and reduced R&D expenses. As a result, adjusted net income increased 19% and adjusted earnings per share increased 21%. You will find a summary of our full-year 2015 results on page six of the presentation.","Our 2015 full-year revenues grew 8% to $21.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $10.38 per share. For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to $10.1 billion, a 19% increase, based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with flat operating expenses. Operating margin improved by four percentage points to 48%.","On an adjusted basis, cost of sales margin improved by 1.3 percentage points year over year to 14.5%, driven by lower royalties, higher net selling price, and lower manufacturing costs.","Research and development expenses decreased 5%, driven by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. And SG&A expenses were up 6%, primarily due to increased commercial expenses for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.","Other income and expenses improved by $114 million year over year, primarily due to higher interest income due to higher cash balances, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher debt balances.","The tax rate was 16.8% for the full year, up 1.9 percentage points versus 2014. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page seven, for the full year 2015 we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow versus $7.8 billion last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and profitability. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, total cash and investments increased to $31.4 billion. This balance included over $2 billion in the U.S. and $29 billion outside the U.S.","Total debt outstanding increased slightly to $31.6 billion. As a result, net debt decreased by $3.5 billion to $200 million at year end 2015. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 10 years.","Additionally, for 2015, we increased our dividend per share by 30% to $0.79 per quarter, with payments totaling $2.4 billion. We also announced a 27% increase to the dividend to $1.00 per share for our first quarter 2016 payment.","Finally, at our 2014 business review, we indicated the intent to repurchase shares totaling up to $2 billion by the end of 2015, which we have now accomplished with repurchases of approximately 13 million shares since Q4 of 2014.","At the end of 2015 we had approximately $4.9 billion remaining under our board-authorized share repurchase program. We intend to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares in 2016 and are on track to deliver our capital allocation commitments to shareholders.","I will now turn to guidance for 2016, summarized on page eight. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2016 guidance on our October earnings call. Today we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects an improved revenue outlook, due to revised timing of new biosimilar competition, as well as the inclusion of the R&D tax credit, which has been permanently extended.","With this background our 2016 revenue guidance is $22 billion to $22.5 billion versus prior guidance of $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion. And our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $10.60 to $11 per share. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to improve by one percentage point versus prior guidance, 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.","As a result of our strong progress in 2015 and the 2016 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth, adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%, $1.5 billion of transformation savings with a net $800 million reduction in operating expense, and return to shareholders of at least 60% of adjusted net income during the period.","We also previously guided for total restructuring expense related to the transformation program of $935 million to $1.035 billion during the period through 2018. Based on better than anticipated results from the exit of two of our closed facilities, we now expect to incur a total of $800 million to $900 million in restructuring expense through 2018, with nearly $700 million recognized already in 2014 and 2015.","In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2015, and we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2016 and beyond.","This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter on slide number 10.","Globally, product sales grew 3% year over year for the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter and 12% for the full year. The fourth quarter included the negative $100 million impact related to the large quarter three end customer purchases that I described in our last earnings call.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted year-over-year sales by two percentage points in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, our international business was up 5% year over year for the fourth quarter and up 6% for the full year.","By any measure 2015 was a success from an operating and execution standpoint. Our growth products led the way, as they continued with meaningful growth. We also laid the foundation for future success with our new product launches, as well as further expansion into new countries, while transforming our customer-facing model and delivering significant cost savings, which we reinvested in the launches.","Let me now start with an update on our new cardiovascular franchise, where we had two launches in 2015, Repatha of course being the biggest opportunity. Repatha is off to a strong competitive start. In the U.S. Repatha's relative share of the segment is reflective in my mind of our launch preparations and execution in the field. Brand recognition amongst cardiologists and primary care physicians is strong. And Repatha's single dose delivering intensive and predictable LDLC level reductions is resonating well with prescribers.","We've made good progress with our payer negotiations. More than 80% of commercial lives currently have access to Repatha. But strict payer utilization management criteria are limiting the uptake, as you see in the IMS scripts. We continue to work with payers on evaluating the utilization management criteria to ensure that appropriate patients are able to receive Repatha through their plans.","In Europe, reimbursement negotiations are ongoing, and we expect to add reimbursement in many countries over the course of the year. I'm pleased to report that earlier this month we secured national reimbursement in Spain, well ahead of expectations. In Japan Repatha was approved last week. And along with our partner, Astellas, we are looking forward to launching the product in the next few months after securing reimbursement.","Sean will discuss our coronary imaging and cardiovascular outcomes study shortly. And we look forward to data from these two trials strengthening Repatha's profile. Also in cardiovascular disease, our innovative heart failure medicine, Corlanor, is making steady progress with prescribers after its launch early in 2015.","Let me now move to oncology, starting with our other large new opportunity, Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 63% year over year and 8% sequentially. Our chart orders indicate that we have more than doubled KRd patient share in new-to-treatment second-line patients since our label expansion in July, based on the ASPIRE data. We're very excited too about the recent FDA approval to add ENDEAVOR data to our U.S. label, demonstrating that Kyprolis doubled progression-free survival versus Velcade. Our teams are trained and in the marketplace the day after the ENDEAVOR approval.","With both the ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data now in our U.S. label, we have strengthened Kyprolis's profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Kyprolis is now the only approved therapy for relapsed multiple myeloma, with proven efficacy as a single agent, doublet, or triplet combination, with different doses to meet individual patient needs. Sales will continue to grow as we treat more second-line patients, and they stay on therapy longer, driven by the deep and durable responses to Kyprolis.","In Europe Kyprolis was approved in November for second-line therapy based on the ASPIRE data. We are launching across Europe on a country-by-country basis, as reimbursement is secured. It is already reimbursed in Germany, and the launch there is underway.","Continuing now with oncology, XGEVA grew 10% year over year in the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion in sales for the year, driven by unit share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by some large purchases in the third quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.","Vectibix grew 2% year over year, but had a 10% unit growth. With over 60% of Vectibix sales outside the U.S., foreign exchange negatively impacted Vectibix growth by about seven percentage points.","Nplate continued solid growth of about 15% year over year, driven by 17% unit growth.","Turning now to the filgrastim franchise, the launch of the Neulasta Onpro kit continued its strong momentum, achieving 24% share of all Neulasta sales in the fourth quarter. This innovative delivery system is applied during a patient's chemotherapy visit, so they can avoid returning to the doctor the next day, as this is the normal requirement for Neulasta injection. This will also be an important differentiator versus future long-acting filgrastim by some of the competition.","Quarter over quarter, Neulasta was negatively impacted by the burn-off of some larger U.S. customer purchases in the third quarter that we described on our last call. We expect Neulasta to grow modestly in 2016, as we don't expect a biosimilar launch in the U.S. until the end of the year at the earliest.","NEUPOGEN declined 4% year over year. Sequentially it lost three points of market share in the U.S., split between the biosimilar and the branded competitors, but still retains 76% share. Share loss over the last year resulted in an 11% unit decline in the U.S., but the U.S. sales also benefited from a revision to accounting estimates in quarter four. As I said previously, we will compete account by account using our many years of experience competing against biosimilars in Europe and branded competitors globally, but do expect some share loss.","We launched two other medicines in oncology: BLINCYTO, which continues to make inroads with ALL patients; and IMLYGIC, where we are pleased with the initial response in key institutions with met (24:05) indication as well as its future potential in combination with other immunotherapies.","Let me now turn to inflammation with ENBREL. On slide number 19, you'll see that ENBREL grew 8% year over year, driven by net selling price. You'll recall, net selling price includes the impact from list price changes as well as contracting and access changes that have occurred over the past 12 months. Year over year, segment growth remained strong, as rheumatology grew 27% and dermatology grew 46% on a value basis. Quarter on quarter, our rheumatology value share was stable at 28%, while our share in dermatology declined two percentage points to 22% due to intensifying competition from new therapies. I'll remind you that rheumatology accounts for about 80% of ENBREL sales. Given ENBREL's exclusivity through 2029, we continue to invest in the brand, and its outlook for further growth remains strong.","I'll now move to bone health and Prolia. Prolia grew 21% year over year in the fourth quarter, with about 20% unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe, delivering $1.3 billion of sales for the year. Growth was driven by continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2016.","With our recent agreement with GSK, we look forward to transitioning Prolia as well as XGEVA and Vectibix back under Amgen's control in 48 countries and continuing to drive growth. This is another important step in delivering our international expansion strategy.","We're also looking forward to a potential important addition to our bone health franchise with romosozumab, which will soon have its Phase 3 data and Sean will be discussing in a moment.","Turning now to our nephrology franchise, starting with EPOGEN; EPOGEN declined 37% year over year, driven by a shift in ESA use. This decline has three primary components. First, around 30% of the decline is due to the shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting. We continue to see uptake of Aranesp with medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. Second, roughly 20% is a result of the burn-off from a large customer purchase in quarter three, as we discussed on our last call. The remaining 50% of the decline comes from the shift from Mircera at Fresenius. Fresenius represents about a third of the U.S. dialysis business. In October, they disclosed that just over half of their dialysis patients utilizing ESAs had switched to Mircera.","EPOGEN sales in 2016 are likely to be impacted by further share declines at Fresenius and the potential for additional switching to Aranesp. Just a reminder that we have a very good business partnership with DaVita, and our agreement with them extends through 2018 to purchase at least 90% of their ESAs from Amgen.","Aranesp sales increased 4% year over year, with a 25% unit growth in the U.S., driven by continued shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp. International sales were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates.","Sensipar grew 21% year over year for the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion in sales for the year, driven by net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe, with good growth prospects for 2016.","Our nephrology franchise has another exciting opportunity with Parsabiv, the new trade name for etelcalcetide, an intravenous calcimimetic, currently under regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe.","I would like to close by outlining our expectations for 2016. We do not expect Neulasta or EPOGEN biosimilars in the U.S. until the end of 2016 at the earliest, assuming potential competitors provide us 180 days' notice between approval and launch. EPOGEN is likely to face continued competition at Fresenius and the conversion to Aranesp.","EPOGEN continues to face headwinds with new competition, while we expect Neulasta sales to continue to grow given the assumed delay of the U.S. biosimilar competition.","We expect ENBREL, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate will all see continued growth in 2016. And our recently launched products, notably Repatha and Kyprolis, will continue with meaningful growth in 2016. Kyprolis's improved label in the U.S. coupled with our launches around the world will continue to drive solid growth. Repatha growth is expected to be steady in the near term, with breakaway potential once we have the outcomes data in our label.","It sure has been a busy and very exciting time for our teams across the world, and I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to delivering for patients.","Let me now pass it to Sean.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon.","2015 was an unprecedented year for Amgen with a record number of regulatory submissions and approvals, and 2016 promises to be another very busy year. We've already announced two regulatory approvals, and there are a lot more R&D events to come.","Beginning with our cardiovascular franchise, last week Repatha was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular events who are not adequately responding to statins. This is the first approval of a PCSK9 inhibitor in Japan and the very first approval by our joint venture, Amgen Astellas Biopharma.","I'm also happy to report that our outcomes study remains on track, as we continue to expect the data in the second half of this year along with the results of our coronary imaging study we're conducting with the Cleveland Clinic. We believe that demonstrating a reduction in plaque burn with Repatha will resonate with cardiologists and complement the outcomes data.","We've also been reviewing in detail along with our partners at Cytokinetics and Servier the Phase 2 data for omecamtiv mecarbil, our novel myosin activator for heart failure. We've been extremely encouraged by the feedback we've received from our discussions with experts in the field as we prepare to meet with regulators to discuss a potential path forward.","Turning to oncology, last week in the U.S. we also received a new indication for Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting. This was based on the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated clear superiority over Velcade, as Kyprolis doubled the amount progression-free survival time. This FDA decision also converted the initial accelerated approval to full approval and added important dosing flexibility. The Kyprolis ENDEAVOR data are currently under review in the EU.","Subgroup analyses of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR were presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting last month, and the response from physicians reinforced our view that Kyprolis will be a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy as physicians pursue deeper, more durable responses for their patients in search of cure. In support of this, we're exploring the use of Kyprolis in combination with newer therapies for multiple myeloma and announced an initial agreement late last year in which we are providing drugs to Janssen for combination study with daratumumab.","In the fourth quarter, we also received three marketing authorizations in Europe, including Kyprolis in combination with Revlimid plus dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. IMLYGIC was approved for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic with no bone, brain, or other visceral disease. And BLINCYTO was approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","We recently conducted an analysis of the events occurring in our large ongoing Phase 3 trial of XGEVA in the setting of skeletal-related events prevention in multiple myeloma patients. And with the usual caveat that this is an event-driven trial, we currently estimate we'll see the data toward the end of this year.","We also continue to expand our immuno-oncology platform and announced new collaborations with Merck combining their PD-1 inhibitor with BLINCYTO in the setting of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; and AMG 820, our anti-colony-stimulating factor one receptor antibody in advanced solid tumors.","Finally, in oncology, our Phase 1 study of AMG 330, our anti-CD33 BiTE, continues to enroll acute myeloid leukemia patients.","In the area of bone health, we along with our partners at UCB are awaiting the results from our registrational Phase 3 study of our sclerostin antibody, romosozumab, for post-menopausal osteoporosis. We expect these data this quarter. In this study, we are assessing the effect of romosozumab dosed monthly for 12 months compared to placebo dosed for 12 months, after which both cohorts are treated with Prolia for 12 months. The co-primary endpoints are the incidence of vertebral fracture at 12 and 24 months. And important secondary endpoints include clinical and non-vertebral fractures. We're also conducting a Phase 3 study of similar design comparing romosozumab to alendronate in year one, followed by both cohorts being treated with alendronate in year two.","We expect romosozumab to be used in high-risk osteoporosis patients. And with a total of 12 monthly doses, we believe the most effective way to ensure proper dosing and maximum benefit in this patient population, at least initially, is through administration by a healthcare provider. We'll continue to evaluate the development of potential indications, formulations, and delivery options that could be attractive for certain patient populations.","In fact, we will be seeing data from a Phase 3 study assessing the improvement in bone marrow density in men with osteoporosis in the first half of this year. While osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures are more commonly associated with postmenopausal women, as many as one in four men over the age of 50 will suffer a fragility fracture in their remaining lifetimes.","Before I leave our bone franchise, I'd point out that we'll also be receiving data from a Phase 3 Prolia study in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Millions of patients are on glucocorticoid therapy around the world, which can result in significant bone loss and fracture.","In neuroscience, our Phase 3 study in episodic migraine with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, continues to enroll extremely well across two studies, a testament to the unmet need and desire by patients for an effective prophylactic therapy. In the chronic migraine setting, our Phase 2b study is expected to read out in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the Phase 1 study of our anti-PAC-1 antibody for migraine, AMG 301, is currently enrolling patients.","And finally, we received a target action date from the FDA on ABP 501, our biosimilar Humira, on September 25 of this year.","As I said at the outset, 2015 was a very productive year and we have a lot in store for 2016. I would like to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for continuing to deliver for patients.","Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thank you, Sean. Jake, we're ready now for questions. So if you could just remind our callers of the procedures, we'll open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, maybe if I could just start with one for Sean. On romo [romosozumab], people are obviously focused on this data and focused on the potential safety of that molecule. Could you just address for us how you think about the potential for some imbalances and falls or hearing loss or some of the brain volume growth that obviously make people worried about neurological symptoms? And then in addition to that, just talk about, to the extent you can, what the DSMB has looked for, what sort of monitoring you have, and the study around those issues. Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Yes, so I think obviously when one looks, this is a genetically validated target, and when one looks at the rare familial forms of absence of sclerostin or partial absence of sclerostin activity such as van Buchem's disease or sclerosteosis, these individuals from conception are deficient in sclerostin. And so as a consequence of course, over time, often in their third or fourth decade, they begin to have some untoward effects from this, such as very thick skull plates and the foramina in which cranial nerves that exit from the skull can impinge on the nerves due to overgrowth of bone. I think that this is something that is an effect developing from conception with the absence of sclerostin. And I just would contrast it sharply with giving one year of therapy to generally quite elderly, at least middle-aged at minimum, osteoporotic patients.","So I think of course in an abundance of caution, we are doing testing on hearing and some other things that are designed to assess these kind of theoretical risks. But I would certainly be very surprised to see a pharmacodynamic response from the drug that would result in those kind of complications. The DSMB, of course, is fully aware, as all our investigators are out doing the trials, and patients through informed consent that all of the theoretical and established potential risks of these kinds of investigative products.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Maybe for Tony on Repatha's uptake, you noted the happiness on your part with the share gains. But are you disappointed overall with the size of the pie at this stage? I know you're seeing reimbursement headwinds. But nonetheless, I guess is this on a more shallow trajectory than you thought? And assuming we do get the positive outcomes data toward the second half of the year, should we see an immediate benefit from that, or would you think it would still take some time to work with payers to work through these headwinds?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Thanks, Eric. So I'm glad you see the relative performance in the marketplace. The hub we put together was clearly done because we understood there was going to be a little bit of time before the payers made a decision around formulary approval. And to me, the hub has therefore been a surrogate to the level of prescriptions that cardiologists and endos and primary care physicians are prepared to prescribe.","We are seeing a really robust level of prescriptions coming through the hub. So to me, that continues to give me great confidence in terms of physician willingness to prescribe this drug for patients who fit inside the label.","The prescriptions themselves in terms of both the NBRxs and the TRxs are continuing. It's clear that the utilization management criteria in place is restricting the number of prescriptions that get dispensed. And we are working with payers at the moment to make sure that patients who are eligible actually get access to these drugs.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Then on the outcomes study.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So the outcomes study, clearly I think one thing that's clear what the value of this drug is, physicians, patients, and payers will realize a tremendous amount of value. Now I think there will be a time between the data becoming present and the data moving into the label that we'll be negotiating with payer by payer. But once it's in the label, it's clear that we should see some dramatic uptake then, yes.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Jake, let's take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, a couple on Repatha as well. So, Tony, when you look at the subtleties, either reimbursement or populations or clinical practice, can you compare the EU and Japanese markets to the U.S., assuming that you do get an outcomes data this year?","And then just to follow up to Eric's question on the U.S. market, what can you tell us in terms of leading indicators of demand? In other words, like physician prescribers or visits to your hub or things like that? Just want to get some demand metrics beyond TRx. Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","I think I understand your question about access outside the U.S. So one has to remember that outside the United States, once access is granted, physicians are not making a decision on anything other than a clinical decision around the value for patients. So there is no economic decision once you have access in Europe and in Japan. So the negotiation is to get access as quickly as possible, and then to move patients onto the drug as physicians prescribe.","From an inside the U.S. perspective, yeah, it's the number of prescriptions we're seeing across the range of physicians who have been prescribing it is encouraging. And I'm not quite sure what more you want to hear about it, Geoff, sorry. Did I answer your question? Or did I miss a question there?","Operator","And your next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah, hang on, Jake. Before you move on to Alethia, Tony was asking if he had addressed Geoff's question.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Geoff, was that okay? Was there anything else?","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, looks like we might have lost him, so let's go on with the next question from Alethia. Alethia, go ahead.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Alethia, we can hear you. Go ahead.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","On NEUPOGEN, I know you said you were going to compete account by account. And so far you have share \u2013 you still have 76% share. But can you give us a little flavor on the progress that you've done there? Have you spoken to the majority of accounts? Just help us think about how much defense you're playing and how much success you're having.","And then on Neulasta, I guess I wanted to think about \u2013 with the Onpro device, do you think that business is now sticky? And we should think about that as share that's now protected if there were a biosimilar to emerge in 2017?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Okay. So NEUPOGEN, tough to answer your question. We clearly segment the NEUPOGEN account between large, medium, and small. And we decide which ones we're going to defend and which ones we're going to be letting go. As you know we've had competition on the market for over a year now plus a biosimilar competitor for close to six months. And we still hold 76% of the market share.","As regard to the on-body injector for Neulasta, the main reason we brought it to market is the unique distinctive value this drug \u2013 or that this device brings to patients and to the physicians and clinics and institutions. Most patients try and get their chemo on a Friday; then they can spend the weekend recovering before they go back to work. Neulasta requires them to come back on a Saturday morning to get their last injection. So sometimes what was happening is patients were getting the injections too early, which is actually not good. It actually reduces the effectiveness of the drug quite dramatically. Or two, they were not coming back for the injection at all, so exposing themselves to potential febrile neutropenia.","So the real value that we've picked up from patients, from nurses, from physicians, and from institutions has been we are increasing the opportunity to give patients the right number of cycles at the right time and really reduce the possibility of febrile neutropenia dramatically. This is the benefit we sell the device on consistently, which I'm sure will continue and stick.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I was wondering, you talked about the label expansions and some of the benefit there. But I was just wondering if you could comment on the potential future contribution from once-weekly dosing? Is that really one of the key drivers of an inflection here? And then any commentary you can provide on average treatment duration trends for Kyprolis? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So I think with Kyprolis, we have to start with our true belief that driving deep remission is where clinical practice is going to go. And the combinations using Kyprolis as one of the products in the backbone is clearly showing us these huge extended periods of PFS, which by definition is helping us drive deep remission.","Patient convenience down the line will become important. And I think the once a week dose will certainly help with patient convenience to ensure that patients stay on the drug for as long as we can.","As regards to duration, when we look at the chart orders, we see that products in this category in second line are probably being used between about seven months to eight months at the moment. It's difficult to quote Kyprolis data yet, because we only got approval for the second line in July. So we're hoping to see some extended data in the next couple of quarters.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much for taking my question. I want to go back to romosozumab. Just wanted a little bit more from the commercial side, because if the trial works, we're all going to be interested in the opportunity for the product. So to that end, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the strategy to at least initially administer the drug in the doc offices by a healthcare provider. Can you just talk about why you think that's beneficial for the patient? And whether or not you think that that's the best way to maximize the potential to impact patients?","And then I guess a related follow-on to that would be, can you talk about what work you're doing to maybe provide a self-injection option down the line? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So let's start with Prolia because we've spent the last four or five years now building a level of expertise on Prolia. And we were the first biologic, injectable biologic to launch into a GP-type market, a complex process which I think the team have got their hands around. And as you see the data in the U.S., Prolia continues to grow in leaps and bounds as we get both breadth and depth of prescribing happening.","It's clear to us that a lot of these patients are elderly, and coming back to the doctor is important to ensure they get the injection. When I think about any other potential competition to romo, the biggest complaint they have is the difficulty of daily injections, of course. So we do see that the same targets that are prescribing Prolia would be targeted to go to, to talk about romo. And we think that the large unmet opportunity in the marketplace, this is quite a large opportunity for us to go to market with.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Do you want to say anything about future plans on administration?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","We are always looking to advance and improve on the way we actually bring to market a combination device product, and we will continue to look at effective and efficient ways for those patients who decide that self-injection could be an option, yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I had a question for Sean regarding romo. I think that certainly we think that should work, but I actually wanted to ask scientifically. Could you remind us how confident you are in translating that superior BMD data to superior fracture data, particularly against a high-efficacy drug like Forteo, if similar or to what magnitude it could be much better numerically?","And then in year two \u2013 I know you're testing the hypothesis of that design in your study. But what would you expect in year two? And is there any reason that it would not be maintained across year two? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","What I would say is that the confidence level we have about the BMD, which as you know is the most impressive BMD increase that's been seen in humans with any treatment, translating that into fracture resistance, that confidence is high. I think that the genetic validation that exists for the pathway is very convincing to people in the field.","Also, we saw \u2013 this is one of the few areas where the preclinical models, particularly those performed in non-human primates, are really quite predictive of what you'll see in humans. And then in a non-human primate, we were able to do biomechanical testing of bone, of course, after animals are sacrificed. And so we know that we achieved extremely high bone strength in these animals commensurate with the BMD increases.","And finally, we've done very advanced imaging of humans that have been treated with romosozumab and compared it head to head to what we see with Forteo. And as you probably know, Forteo has its major impact on trabecular bone and has a relatively limited impact on cortical bone. And cortical bone really is what matters for the majority of long bone fracture risk, which is really where the clinical need is.","And so we have multiple reasons to believe the genetics, the preclinical information, and the imaging that we've done in humans that we should have only not only a greater BMD increase, but that the quality of the bone that we're producing is of a higher quality than what one gets using PTH analogues.","One way of thinking about this is there really are two master regulatory switches for controlling BMD. One of them is RANK Ligand, which controls osteoclast function that we direct in us met (52:27) there. And the other is sclerostin, which controls osteoblast function, and there sclerostin is the key mediator. So what you're doing here like with romosozumab is throwing a master physiologic regulatory switch. And so what you're expecting to get and what we see in everything that we've observed is physiologic high-quality bone formation.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Can you talk about year two, Sean?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Year two, I think the thing that is interesting here in this paradigm is that this is a one-year treatment. And so the first year of the study is very important because it's a placebo-controlled period. We know from our experience with humans that we can't just withdraw the product and leave patients on no therapy, so the gains that are so impressive will melt away relatively quickly. And so it is necessary to lock in these gains with an antiresorptive agent. So what we expect to see is \u2013 we obviously know a lot about Prolia. We expect the placebo group to respond well to Prolia in the second year, but the patients on romosozumab will also get substantial benefit.","And so if there's a meaningful difference in fracture risk at the end of year one, that should persist more or less out to the second year and even in theory well beyond that. But this is a new paradigm in osteoporosis, this relatively short period. And the study designs are quite different than what people are used to seeing in the field, so we'll all be fascinated to see the results obviously.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Jake, before you go on to the next question, Tony had an additional comment on Geoff Meacham's question about the Repatha demand indicators. Tony?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Sure. So, Geoff, I think I better understand your question now, more around in addition to TRx's, what else should we be looking at to see future growth in the marketplace. Like always, to me TRx's and MDRx's in terms of new naive patients are the most important thing to measuring in terms of the growth.","But with a new launch like this where the plans are put into place at the formularies, one has to remember that IMS only reports dispensed prescriptions; i.e., prescriptions that come to a pharmacy or a specialty pharmacy and the patient actually walks away with the drug. What you have to be able to look at inside that data is how many prescriptions get to the pharmacy and how many are rejected versus how many are abandoned. So we are seeing that the majority of prescriptions getting to the pharmacy at the moment are being rejected, rejected because the prior authorization process has not been properly completed or there's some outstanding information and patients have to go back and get some more data. All patients are seeing the copay at this particular stage because the product is not properly on formulary yet as being too high a copay, and they abandon the prescription and they walk away.","So the data you're seeing is really important, but you have to understand that the majority of prescriptions getting to the pharmacy are either being rejected or abandoned at the moment while the plans complete their process, which is why we spent so much time with the plans at the moment showing them the number of eligible patients who are on label getting to pharmacy and not getting product. It really is a concern. And when you think about the potential Repatha patient, these are patients that are at risk right now for a cardiac event and therefore early intervention is essential, so we're spending quite a bit of urgent with the payers.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Tony. Jake, let's take the next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Schimmer from Piper Jaffray.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to come back to the Repatha management criteria that are limiting uptake. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the primary causes for rejection are? Give us any sense as to the evidence that you are making progress in addressing some of these issues. And then given what those issues are, what gives you the confidence that the cardiovascular trial data may ultimately resolve that as a barrier? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So it's Tony here, Josh. Utilization management criteria obviously differ plan by plan, but they include things such as patient must restate naturally tolerated statin dose or someone requires you to be on one or two statins. Some of them require you to have done statins plus a step-through to Zetia. There's clearly a requirement around your LDLC level, they have to be at a certain level. But probably the more complex thing is the prior authorization documents. There are five pages of handwritten stuff that physicians have to find out about. And most of the rejections are because the form is not properly completed, and this is the time to collect the data. So as we get the process running a bit more efficiently and hopefully moving from paper to an electronic process, the prior authorizations could go faster. And then as we show the payers the impact of too draconian a utilization management criteria not getting to the right patients, we will see some changes there. The outcomes data of course will dramatically change the value of this particular drug, and we do expect to see some changes in the utilization criteria once we have that turn.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, three questions. First, I'd like to know where Arvind buys his ties. Second question is Pfizer has made the decision to enroll primary prevention patients I believe into their Phase 3 PCSK9 outcomes trial, Sean and Tony, and I was wondering. They expect to have a label indication for that, and they believe that that's very important for the payers. Why did you make the decision not to design your trial that way? Maybe that's a Sean question. And for Tony, what commercial implications, if any, is this going to have in your mind?","And then third, just to follow up on someone else's question, just to be more direct, I think what's going on, on the Street right now is people are concerned that the romo fracture reduction magnitude may look optically less than what is contained, for example, in the Forteo label or some of the data that Radius has produced for the PTH analogue, primarily because at two years you're comparing obviously your sclerostin antibody to an active comparator versus these other agents which were compared to placebo I believe. So the question is should we be expecting, Sean, can you just talk about, is this an apples-to-apples comparison or apples-to-oranges comparison when we actually see that number? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sean, why don't you do romo and the Pfizer PCSK9 question, and then Tony can do part of it.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Okay. So with respect to room, what I would say is that you're right that this will not be so straightforward as to make cross-trial comparisons of those sort. They're fraught with difficulty always, these Santa Claus trial comparisons. But in osteoporosis, because the trials are very large and of very similar design, in general people have felt pretty comfortable doing that. and you've seen that, for example, when we had our three-year fracture data for Prolia, people compared it to three-year fracture data with bisphosphonate, either oral or IV, et cetera. And I think in this case it's going to be much more difficult to make those kind of simple comparisons.","I think what will happen here is that the data will be interpreted by the experts in the field. And as always is the case with a specialty product like this that's targeted at a very specific patient population, the experts in the field will make the determination whether they think that the data are impressive and who ought to be getting the product, and that will influence prescribing outside the expert community.","With respect to the primary versus secondary prevention strategies, I think that the companies that were in the lead on PCSK9 wanted to get outcomes data for these products as fast as was possible. And the fastest way to get the outcomes data is to study a patient population that has a fairly high event rate, and that generally is achieved \u2013 or one of the main levers you can pull is to have patients who have suffered a prior event. That's one of the strongest predictors of a subsequent event. As you know, there have been slightly different flavor variants on that that have been pursued by us and by Regeneron, but that's been the basic approach. Moreover, it's never been necessary in this field to do outcomes trials in various different populations in order to have a label the covers broad patient populations.","So what you really need to do is demonstrate convincingly that the LDL level reductions that you're achieving with your agent translate unequivocally into reductions in cardiovascular outcome risk. That's all you need to do. And we feel that the studies will do that. Obviously, a company coming behind, it has to think about what they're going to do to try to differentiate their position.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So I think that the payers will be looking at high-risk patients. Physicians will be making decisions around patients to prescribe that have a high risk. And I think the clinical trials we have will take into account all patients that are high-risk. Clearly those who have an event or have concomitant disabilities will be a higher chance of getting a drug and getting it prescribed.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Jake, let's take the next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line Eun Yang from Jefferies.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. So when you look at Forteo sales, ex-U.S. sales are higher than U.S. sales despite limit of aggressive price increases. But when you look at Prolia, U.S. sales account for 64% of total sales. Why do you think that there is a difference in usage between anabolic and entire result of Asia, or so you think this is due to several of the administration versus efficiency of the administration (1:03:40)?","And the follow-on, that is romosozumab is going to be used one-year treatment whereas the PTA channels are going to be used two-year in use, countries is two years. So how do you think about the pricing of romosozumab? Thank you.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Let me try and answer the first piece about the difference in the sales globally. I think Prolia was simply a timing around coming to market. We came to market during a fiscal crisis, and the entire reimbursement process outside the United States took a number of years. In fact, in France it took us 4.5 years from approval to get the final decision made on pricing. So outside the U.S. they are running to catch up in terms of the patient usage. And then we are sure that eventually we should get to a decent balance. Sean?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the other question...","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Another question had to do with pricing.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Pricing, value, Tony?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","I imagine it's premature.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","I think the price we'll be able to charge will be clearly linked around the value proposition we see coming out of the clinical trials.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, Jake, let's take the next question please.","Operator","And your next question from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Kyprolis for a minute, and just wondering if you have an efficacy interim look built into CLARION similar to what you had for ENDEAVOR? And if you do, what triggers it? And what kind of action can be taken? Would it just be \u2013 it could be stopped for either futility or overwhelming efficacy? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Yeah. So these trials were all designed more or less at the same time by the same group of people. And they all have a generally similar design in that they have interim analyses. Obviously, that interim analysis has in it the ability to stop the trial for clear futility and to stop the trial for overwhelming efficacy.","And if you, I'm sure will recall, both ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR were stopped for overwhelming efficacy. I think this is a reasonable design. But I don't think that we are in any way planning on seeing a first-line study stopped for overwhelming efficacy at the interim, but it is a possibility.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As we said, Cory, we're expecting this in 2017. Okay, let's go to the next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from BofA Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If you don't mind, can you spell out the sales of Repatha last quarter? I know it's a small number, but just a housekeeping question there.","And then secondly on romosozumab regulatory path, do you believe firmly that the first Phase 3 trial that would read out in 1Q this year should be sufficient for FDA approval? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry. Did you get the second question, Sean? Okay, why don't you go ahead in the second question?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Yes, on the romo study, yes, we believe based on the published guidances by regulators around the world and our interactions with the regulators around the world that if successful, the placebo-controlled study we were just talking about earlier, the first of these studies that reads out, will be sufficient for global registration.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. And as to the Repatha sales, you're right, we're not breaking those out by line item at this time.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Jake, let's go ahead and move on to the next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just thinking a little bit more about the outcomes data for Repatha expected later this year, where do you think the range of outcomes can fall in terms of how we extrapolate the reduction in LDL capability of the drug to what we've classically seen in terms of CV reduction? And kind of maybe think about what the range should be based on that? And how it could deviate from that classical extrapolation, whether it's due to different types of patients or just the trial design? How we can think about that? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Yeah. I mean this is the kind of subject than one can sit around and talk about for many, many hours with experts, which I've done. And I think the best thing I can say is that we have a remarkably linear relationship that we've established, most recently with IMPROVE-IT, extending that line in just a remarkably linear fashion. Extending the line that was created by statins and by other interventions, such as ileal bypass surgery and so on, and the genetics of course.","And so when you put it all together, what you have to believe scientifically is that what the truth is, that you're going to fall right on that line in the same way as if you achieved that additional LDL lowering with a statin or with ezetimibe, were that possible. Obviously it's not.","Could it deviate from the line? Sure. I mean it is always possible that some of the foibles of the way that the clinical trials are designed and conducted \u2013 there is of course, for example, a treatment lag of some sort that occurs when you start therapies. And so when the study reads out very quickly instead of over a longer period of time, that has a bigger influence, et cetera, that could make it come off the line slightly in one direction.","We also know that the agent does have some activities that statins don't have. For example, there is an effect on Lp(a), which is present in some individuals and seems to be a strong prognostic factor that could make the dot come off the line a little bit the other direction.","So there's some variability that you could expect. But from a scientific perspective, based on the human genetics and everything we know, one would expect that you're going to see a reduction that would be proportional and dissimilar (1:10:26). And that would be roughly this ballpark around the one-third level reduction of the risk.","So that's the kind of number that many people \u2013 keep in mind I think the 50% reduction in risk that was suggested by the analyses that were published in The New England Journal, there's a very wide confidence interval around those. And while you can't rule out the possibility that you'll see that big of a reduction, that's a bigger reduction than you would expect to get if you were achieving the LDL lowering that we're achieving with a statin.","So it requires some other biology like Lp(a) or something to be going on. And I can't tell you that's not happening, but it sure wouldn't be my base case.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll know in a few months, so, okay?","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Lots to talk about today. So we have exceeded our prescribed hour, Jake. Why don't we take two last questions?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo.","Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. This is Nick in for Jim this afternoon. We've spent a lot of time talking about the very late-stage pipeline, and clearly you've done a pretty impressive job developing those molecules. But what are you pointing investors to in terms of the early stage? If I look at the Phase 2 pipeline, half of those AMGs are with Astra. There's the CTEPH inhibitor that I guess you're all wondering what to do. And then many of those Phase 1 molecules have been around for a long time. So Phase 3 looks really good, but what about Phase 2 and Phase 1? What should we be focused on?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","We're actually really excited. I think it's fair that we've had so much going on in the later stages that we haven't spent as much time focusing on talking about what's going on in the earlier pipeline. But we're really excited about quite a number of things in the earlier pipeline. Obviously, omecamtiv mecarbil is very exciting. We have the migraine, new migraine antibody PAC-1 that I mentioned. We have a novel heart failure molecule which will be entering in the clinic this year. That's something that we've developed in-house. We have a completely novel inflammation mechanism that no one else is pursuing that I think is extremely interesting that's entering Phase 1 now. And we have quite a range of bites (1:12:57) targets that are moving forward into the clinic either now or in the relatively near future.","So I think there's plenty to look forward to in that space. And we also have earlier than that really the most exciting stuff, which is some of the targets that we believe we are uniquely working on because they've arisen from our advanced population-based human genetic efforts like this sort of Gene X example that some of you may recall from our business review, which is moving along very nicely. So I think in a future business review type setting we'll probably talk a little bit more. It's been hard to do that with everything that's been going on in the late-stage work.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Jake, let's take one last question, please.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time, sir.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, great. In that case, let me thank everybody for your participation in our call. Between myself and my team, we'll be around for a while. So if there are any other questions, feel free to call us. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's fourth quarter and financial results conference call.

I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may begin.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the second quarter. It's another strong quarter that provides good evidence that we are on track to achieve our long-term objectives. I'm joined by several members of our leadership team today, including our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway; our CFO, David Meline; Tony Hooper, who heads our Global Commercial Operations; and Sean Harper, our head of R&D.","We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome all of you who have dialed in for our second quarter earnings call. The strategy we laid out at our 2014 Investor Day continues to deliver strong results, and our Q2 financial and operational performance is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives.","This is an exciting time at Amgen. Not only are we delivering strong financial results, but our new product story continues to take shape as well. It was a successful second quarter on this front, both with recent launches and preparations for upcoming launches well underway. We entered the year excited about six new product launches, and at the halfway point we're already reporting progress on five of them.","With its European approval, Repatha was the first PCSK9 inhibitor approved globally. We were pleased with the FDA advisory committee recommendation for approval in the United States and look forward to an approval on or before our PDUFA date next month. When we acquired Onyx, we believed that Kyprolis would become part of the backbone of multiple myeloma therapy by demonstrating superiority over the current standard of care and moving into earlier lines of therapy. The results of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR exceeded our expectations, and we clearly have an attractive opportunity now with Kyprolis in our expanded indication in relapsed multiple myeloma.","The response to BLINCYTO has been positive with physicians, and it's making a difference in certain leukemia patients who have exhausted all other treatment options. The Neulasta on-body injector, our innovative delivery system that provides differentiation in the filgrastim marketplace, is performing well in the few short months since its launch.","We're making progress with Corlanor as well by communicating the value proposition to physicians and payers while paving the way for Repatha in the US cardiology community. It's very rewarding to see the difference that these innovative products are making for patients. Beyond these products, our pipeline continued to deliver results, and Sean will provide additional details on our progress in a moment.","In addition to what was accomplished in the second quarter, we have other pipeline milestones in the near term including global regulatory submissions for AMG 416, our innovative calcimimetic, and upcoming data from omecamtiv mecarbil in heart failure, romosozumab in osteoporosis, and of course our biosimilar, bevacizumab as well. All of what I've just talked about gives us confidence in the long-term growth of our business. And for this year, we're raising guidance again and David Meline will share details of that with you momentarily.","In summary, I'm very pleased with our continuing strong execution against our priorities for the year, and this includes our progress on the five newly launched products, the strong growth in our key products like Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectivix, Nplate, and our ongoing transformation efforts.","Before turning over to David, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders. David?","David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the second quarter on page five of the slide deck, revenue at $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with product sales growth driven at 6%, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 million year-over-year due primarily to milestones recognized in the second quarter of last year. Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% due to foreign exchange headwinds. Adjusted operating income at $2.6 billion grew 10% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 2 points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation initiative.","On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved 0.8 points, driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price. Research and development expenses at $918 million were down 6% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation in process improvements across the area, partially offset by increased support for later-stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. Increased commercial investments in new product launches were partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. Total operating expenses declined 1% year-on-year and increased 9% sequentially.","For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We also saw an increase of spending in Q2 versus the prior quarter, which is a typical pattern for the business. In the second half of the year, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical experience, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015.","Other income and expenses declined by $65 million or 45% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $79 million in the quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by gains in our strategic and venture investments. I would note that Q1 is a better indicator of the underlying run rate for other income and expenses in light of the investment gains in Q2.","The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter, a 3.8 point increase versus Q2 2014. This increase was primarily due to unfavorable tax impact of changes in our geographic mix of earnings. Our tax rate for the first half of the year was 18.6%, consistent with our guidance for the year. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 8% on a year-over-year basis.","Turning next to cash flow on the balance sheet on page six. For the second quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.6 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by improved working capital and higher operating income as well as cash gains realized from a portion of our foreign exchange forward contracts. Total debt outstanding ended Q2 at $32 billion, and cash and investments totaled $30 billion. Additionally, our second quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.","Finally, in the second quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $500 million of cash deployed through share repurchases, or approximately 3.3 million shares in the period. We continue to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year end 2015, and as of now, we have repurchased a total of $1.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $157 since our business review last October.","Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on page seven. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. In 2015, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of efficiency savings from the transformation, most of which will be reinvested in the business.","With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are increasing our guidance to $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion from our prior range of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion, reflecting continued solid revenue performance. Versus 2014 results, we'd expect an unfavorable revenue impact of almost $400 million, or 2% in 2015, assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through year-end. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics.","We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.55 to $9.80 a share from the previous $9.35 to $9.65 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong performance, including lower expenses due to cost discipline. Versus 2014 results, we expect an approximate $0.11 adjusted EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates.","Turning to the tax rate, for the full year we expect to have an adjusted rate within the range of 18% to 19%. As a reminder, this excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015. We now expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, which is $100 million lower than our previous guidance. As our results through the first half of the year highlight, our transformation efforts are now well established, and we are encouraged to see cost improvements across the business.","This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","Thanks, David, and good afternoon folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on slide number nine. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, growing our newer products, defending filgrastim and EPOGEN, and launching important new medicines. Globally, product sales grew 6% year-on-year and our US business delivered 9% year-over-year growth, with our international business growing 5% year-over-year excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.","Let me now turn to the products, beginning with Enbrel. On slide number 11, you'll see that Enbrel delivered strong growth of 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 28% respectively. Quarter-on-quarter, we held our share in rheumatology at 29% while share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point to 26%. New dermatology entrants are not simply taking share from the incumbents, but also are growing the market. Quarter-on-quarter, Enbrel sales increased 21%.","You will recall that in April, I described how the first quarter was negatively impacted by lower wholesale inventories and end-customer inventory burn-off. In the second quarter, inventories returned to normal levels. Enbrel has delivered significant growth for us. With exclusivity in the US until 2029, we will continue to invest in Enbrel and believe it is well on its way to becoming a $5 billion brand.","Sensipar grew 15% year-over-year, driven by strong unit growth in both the US and Europe.","I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia delivered 29% growth year-on-year, driven by volume increases in both the US and in Europe. The graph on slide 13 will remind you of the historical path in Prolia's sales, in which the second and fourth quarters are our strongest. Our focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and simplifying patient access in the US continue to drive higher new patient starts and improve patient adherence once on Prolia. This has led to unit share gains of about 4% in the US and about 3 percentage points in Europe.","XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 4 percentage points in the US and about 6 percentage points in Europe. The quarter-over-quarter decline in the US was driven by a Q1 customer buy-in. Absent the buy-in, the US sequential unit growth was 6%. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition. We've also recently successfully negotiated expanded XGEVA access for patients in France, one of our largest markets outside the United States.","The expansion of Vectibix into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the US and Europe continue to deliver growth. We continue to see unit growth in the US of close to 40% and in Europe of nearly 10%. The second quarter was also positively impacted by timing of shipments to our Japanese partner.","Nplate grew 6% year-over-year, driven by a 7% unit growth.","Now to Kyprolis, which delivered year-over-year growth of 53% and a quarter-over-quarter growth of 10%. We are very excited about the recent US approval in relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma. The ASPIRE data clearly demonstrated the longest period of progression-free survival in any Phase 3 trial to-date. This is an important treatment regimen that now will become available to a greater number of relapsed patients, as shown on slide number eight (sic) [18] (16:44).","The US team launched this new indication on Monday this week. The ASPIRE data coupled with our compelling ENDEAVOR data which we've just submitted to the FDA, demonstrating superiority over VELCADE in relapsed multiple myeloma, strengthens Kyprolis' position as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. We anticipate further approvals for Kyprolis outside the United States by the end of this year, including Europe, Canada and South America.","Let me now turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 2%, driven mainly by net selling price. The launch of the On-body Injector for Neulasta is going exceptionally well. As a reminder, the on-body injector means that patients no longer have to return to the hospital or clinic 24 hours after their chemo. The On-body Injector simply delivers Neulasta at home at the appropriate time. I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta On-body Injector has already achieved 8% market share of the Neulasta business in its first full quarter on the market. And we continue to grow both the depth and the breadth of prescribing. Over 50% of our Neulasta accounts have purchased the On-body Injector.","NEUPOGEN declined 14% year-over-year in the second quarter. This was primarily due to branded short-acting competition in the US, which came to about 2 share points versus the first quarter. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and safety as well as our ability to supply patients reliably.","Turning now to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 4% year-over-year, including an 11% decline. About a third of this unit decline was due to competition. The remaining unit decline was a shift in purchases to Aranesp in some of our US dialysis accounts. With select US dialysis customers having an increasing interest in a long-acting ESA, we are actively promoting Aranesp to them and have some seen some early success.","Global Aranesp sales declined 7% year-over-year. There are some important underlying dynamics however, as the US saw an 8% unit growth per year, driven by the shift in some dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I just mentioned, while international sales declined year-over-year because of foreign exchange rates. Although Aranesp has prolonged exclusivity in the US extending to 2024, we know that biosimilars to EPOGEN, NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are making plans to launch the US market.","Sandoz announced its intention to launch a short-acting filgrastim biosimilar in the US sometime after September 3 this year, and we expect other biosimilars may come in 2016. Although Sandoz's biosimilar against NEUPOGEN will serve as the first true biosimilar entrant into the US market, Teva's GRANIX has served as somewhat of a proxy, having captured about 17% share of the short-acting filgrastim market after about 18 months in the market.","We're planning for the arrival of new competition and are prepared to compete. We will leverage the success that we've had in the US versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience competing against ESA and NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe. We expect our products to continue to generate substantial cash flows for years to come, even after competitors enter the market.","Let me now update you on our new product launches. As you know, our cholesterol lowering medication, Repatha, was approved in Europe earlier this month. We are very excited to be making this new cholesterol lowering medication available for patients and are actively engaged in obtaining reimbursement across Europe. We anticipate the first European launches to begin during the third quarter of this year. In the US, we look forward to upcoming FDA approval. If you remember, our PDUFA date is August 27. Our cardiovascular sales force is already in the field with the recent launch of Corlanor, which I'll discuss in a moment, and we're hearing a lot of excitement from our customers about the imminent launch of Repatha.","We have already achieved 60% plus penetration of eligible patients in the US for BLINCYTO, our innovative antibody for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With an approval based on Phase 2 data, we continue to expand awareness of the significant benefits of BLINCYTO across a physician base that treats these seriously ill patients. We look forward to expanding BLINCYTO's label and our BiTE platform into other cancer types.","Corlanor was approved in the second quarter as an add-on to CHF standard of care, and the team is making great progress with penetration and access. With Corlanor, we're also paving the way for our Repatha launch. Our CV sales force has already called on the majority of our targeted cardiologists.","As I look ahead, this is a very exciting time for Amgen. I am pleased with the strong performance in the first half of this year, led by our growth products, Enbrel, Sensipar, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate, and of course Kyprolis. This has given us some excellent momentum into the second half of the year. We've also made tremendous progress with four of our six innovative new launches this year, BLINCYTO, Corlanor and the Neulasta On-body Injector are all off to great starts.","And on Monday we launch Kyprolis into the expanded indication of relapsed multiple myeloma. We are anticipating the approval in the US for T-Vec, our novel oncolytic for metastatic melanoma later this year, and Repatha in the US imminently. Our teams are laser focused, poised and ready for launch. We look forward to bringing these new innovative medicines to patients following the FDA approval.","Before I close, I would like to express my thanks to our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world for their unwavering focus on delivering value to patients and shareholders alike. And then I'll pass it to Sean.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. It continues to be, as Tony said, an exciting time at Amgen. And I'd like to begin from an R&D perspective with Repatha, which was the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor in the world, based on our recent approval in the EU. It's important to keep in mind I think, it was early work by Amgen research scientists that led to significant advances in elucidating the pathway by which PCSK9 regulates LDL-cholesterol, and which led to the publication of the crystal structure of PCSK9 in 2007. I just want to recognize the effort within the Amgen R&D organization to advance this program from discovery research to the clinic in less than a decade. As I've said before, having the in-house scientific expertise to elucidate complex biology is an often underappreciated attribute, but it's critical in establishing strong intellectual property.","In the US, we were quite pleased with the vote of the FDA advisory committee, and are working with the agency to get Repatha to patients as soon as possible. The FDA's target action date is August 27. We continue to be inspired by the potential for Repatha to help us drive a revolution in the global fight against cardiovascular disease, the world's greatest killer, and are looking forward to the results in 2016 from our intravascular ultrasound imaging study that we're conducting in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic, as well as our 27,500 patient outcomes trial, which has completed enrollment, and for which we expect results no later than 2017. This is an event-driven study, and as we stated before via the FDA advisory committee meeting, there's a possibility we could see the data in 2016.","Turning to oncology. We were very pleased to receive approval from FDA for our Kyprolis submission for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. Recall that addition of Kyprolis to Revlimid and dexamethasone resulted in the longest progression-free survival ever reported in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting. And this regimen was considered by the expert discussion at the recent ASCO multiple myeloma session to be, quote, the standard of care. Again in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the response of physicians at ASCO to the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression-free survival in patients randomized to Kyprolis compared head-to-head with VELCADE in the context of much lower peripheral neuropathy risk with Kyprolis. We've submitted the ENDEAVOR data in the United States and will submit these data after the ASPIRE accelerated assessment approval in the EU.","We've recently completed enrollment in our Phase 3 CLARION study of Kyprolis versus VELCADE in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, and look forward to those results sometime in 2017. We have also initiated our Phase 3 study of once weekly dosing of Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting, potentially providing patients and physicians with a more convenient dosing option.","In our continued effort to develop medicines that provide the greatest benefit to patients, we recently reported the results of the studies demonstrating that Vectibix had an overall survival benefit versus best supportive care in a Phase 3 study of chemo refractory metastatic colorectal cancer patients with RAS wild-type tumors.","We were gratified to see the support of the FDA advisory committee for the use of T-Vec as a monotherapy in the metastatic melanoma setting, and we continue to work with regulators to bring this agent to patients. We see the greatest potential of T-Vec in combination with the so-called, and we continue to advance our collaborations with the Merck anti PD-1 and Roche anti PD-L1 antibodies that we've recently announced.","We also very recently announced the positive Phase 2 study of BLINCYTO in Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed refractory ALL, which demonstrated similar efficacy and safety to our US-approved indication in Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL. Approximately one-quarter of adults with ALL are Philadelphia chromosome-positive, and our study included relapsed patients that were refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies who have very poor prognosis. We look forward to discussing the results with regulators to determine next steps.","At ASCO, we presented data that demonstrated Prolia significantly reduced bone fractures in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors, suggesting a potential benefit of initiating Prolia with aromatase inhibitor therapy to decrease the risk of fracture. Also in our bone programs, we're getting closer to seeing the fracture data from romosozumab, with the first placebo-controlled post-menopausal osteoporosis study expected to read out in the first half of 2016. Recall that romosozumab is our anti-sclerostin antibody we are developing with UCB. Due to the extent that romosozumab is able to increase bone formation, the high quality of that bone, coupled with strong human genetic validation for the pathway, all of this leads us to believe we will see a significant reduction in fractures and romosozumab will become an important addition to the treatment of osteoporosis.","One final regulatory update as we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the third quarter for our innovative peptide calcimimetic, AMG 416, in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, is now enrolling Phase 3 episodic migraine studies. The 52-weeks data from our Phase 2b episodic migraine study were recently presented at the meeting of the American Headache Society, demonstrating durability of effect with no new safety signals. Our Phase 2b chronic migraine study continues to enroll patients, and we look forward to seeing those data next year. We continue to view AMG 334 as a very exciting opportunity to help patients suffering from this debilitating condition.","In our earlier stage pipeline, we're looking forward to data from our Phase 2 study of the oral formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil, a myocin activator we're developing with Cytokinetics in the heart failure setting in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to make progress on our BiTE platform, with our next molecule, AMG 330, close to initiating Phase 1 in the acute myeloid leukemia setting, an area of profound unmet need. We're also advancing new molecules in the clinic, in neuroscience and amino oncology areas, and I look forward to speaking with you about these programs in the future.","Finally, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, I was very proud of our command of the science and the data at our recent FDA advisory committee meetings. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, thank you. As you can see, there's quite a lot happening at Amgen, both in the current quarter and things that are setting us up for long-term growth as well. So let's turn to questions. And Brian, before we open the lines, could you remind our callers of the procedure for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys, afternoon and thanks for taking the question. For Repatha, assuming that you have a similar label to your competitor, I wanted to get a sense from, and whether you would push to submit imaging data for differentiation, or do you think it makes sense just to wait for the outcomes data? I guess the question is, do you think the imaging data ultimately could be dramatically differentiated in the marketplace. Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development","Yeah, it's a good question, Jeff. I think that the data from these two types of investigations are really quite complementary. And while we will see from the outcome study, obviously reductions in events, we hope, as we all know how those studies read out. But being able to really understand the degree to which one can observe actual disease modification and regression potentially of the atherosclerotic burden in patients is pretty important information to understand. So I think that we believe that the data are important. There are other precedents for these kind of data appearing in labeled statins. The exact timing relative to when we have the outcomes data is a little hard to judge. But I do think it's differentiating data, and I do think it's going to be very important data for the cardiology community in particular to see this study.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question, and good job on the quarter. So we've been able to see your label in Europe and your competitor's label here in the US. Your programs were similar, but a little bit different in terms of the patients you enrolled. So I guess the question is, would you expect a US Repatha label that's more similar to your EU label, which is little bit broader, or the Praluent US label which is a little bit narrower. And what would be the basis for that position? Thanks very much.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development","Yeah, Matt, I'm not going to speculate about the label that the FDA's going to grant us at this time. We're very close to this process right now with the agency back-and-forth, and I think it's just not our place to speculate on the label they're going to grant us.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the dialysis franchise, you talked a little bit about EPO and Aranesp. Maybe if you could just expand, what sort of competition are you seeing, and would you expect that to get more heated as the quarters progress? And then do you think that the growth in Aranesp's use in dialysis is sustainable, or would you expect that to sort of tail off a bit? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","All right. Tony?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","So I mean I think the numbers that have been made public is that FMC have moved about 45,000 patients to Mircera in the second quarter, so those number of patients will continue into the third and fourth quarters, and that's our competition we're up against (34:47).","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","And the use of Aranesp in dialysis, the sustainability of that, do you want to comment on that?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","Well, I mean Aranesp is clearly being used. It's being purchased by the customer, and they have a couple of thousand patients on Aranesp at the moment, and they continue to grow their business as well.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Brian?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Next question?","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Do you want to go on to the next one?","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a two-part one for me. Just on Kyprolis, I was wondering if you can give us any commentary with respect to duration, what you're seeing, and broadening the prescriber base? And then congrats on expanding the board. Just wondering, any comments there that you can provide in terms of that decision? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Terence. This is Bob. I'm happy to take the second question. We're delighted to welcome Fred to the board. He has terrific experience in the global biopharmaceutical industry, and I think he shares our enthusiasm for the innovation that's being generated here at Amgen and for our long-term growth prospects. So we're happy to have him on the board. And Tony, why don't you talk about the progress we're making on Kyprolis.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","So in the third line at the moment, our length of therapy is running at about 5.6 months on average, and when we look at the data in second line, the existing therapies as well as our own clinical trial, we expect the duration of the therapy to at least double over time.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Brian, let's move on to the next question.","Operator","Yes. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thank you for pronouncing my name correctly, and a good quarter. Guys, I was just wondering, I didn't understand, or I just couldn't hear. I got a lot of emails, a lot of other people couldn't either, your answer to someone's question around what's going on in the dialysis marketplace. Fresenius gave out a figure today that 44,000 patients are on Mircera and they also made comments that suggested that the price point of Mircera is dramatically below EPOGEN. So I was just wondering if you could talk about that.","And also just update us on the balance sheet. I know after the Onyx deal, you wanted to go through a period of deleveraging where you felt like you probably weren't in a position to do an Onyx type of deal. What about now? How does the balance sheet look now, and if an Onyx sized opportunity came along now, do you believe you've got the financial flexibility to do it, or do you want to continue to delever? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","So let me clarify the question on dialysis. There are 45,000 patients at FMC on the Mircera product, and there about 15,000 patients on Aranesp. I'm afraid I can't tell you what the difference in price is. You'll have to talk to FMC for that.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Mark, on the balance sheet, balance sheet's strong. We have emphasized our desire to return capital to our shareholders through a mix of dividend and buyback. As David noted in the call, we increased the dividend by 30% versus this quarter last year, and we're on track to continuing to continue to grow the payout and also repurchasing shares. As David mentioned, we've repurchased $1.3 billion since the investor meeting last October, so we're continuing to focus on returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our focus is on earlier-stage transactions that we think can bring innovation to the company that we can add value to, but we have the flexibility in the balance sheet if attractive opportunities arise that are of the larger size.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks a lot.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. This is Mohit for Robyn. Congratulations on a good quarter and progress through the quarter. So my question is regarding the biosimilars. If you could help us understand the implications of the latest ruling in the Sandoz case about that BLA sharing is not necessary under BPCIA. How does it impact your thought process around biosimilar filing? And the second part would be that is Apotex following the BLA sharing process for their Neulasta biosimilar? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Mohit. I think there are two questions there. But Tony, why don't you pick those up?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","Mohit, it's Tony. In all the strategic planning we've done with the biosimilars, we have accepted the 180 days as part of the legislation and have planned accordingly. As to whether the other organizations have been supplying us data or not, we're not prepared to comment on that at the moment.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Let's go to the next question.","Operator","Yes. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.","Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Maybe just a bigger picture question for Bob on M&A. It's kind of a frenetic environment out there, as you know. Some have viewed Amgen as a target, some view you as an acquirer. I mean how are you thinking about M&A and building shareholder value in today's environment?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","We're very focused. As I've said earlier on the call, Eric, very focused on executing our long term plan for growth, which we outlined in some detail last October. And I think we're making great progress on advancing the things that we think will enable us to grow and deliver real value for shareholders. So that includes the transformation activities we've talked about, the progress that we're making with our legacy molecules and the new product story that's emerging so powerfully with the five products that we've launched already and those that we expect to launch after this. So very focused on executing our long-term strategy for growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang from Jefferies.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much. Recently, Merck indicated that REMICADE biosimilar pricing is down about 45%, but then it seems like in some European countries, discounted at close to 60%. So what do you think operating margin for Amgen's biosimilar products would be once they're marketed?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well Eun, I think if your question's about operating margins for the products that we expect to launch between 2017 and 2021, we'll probably hold off giving you operating margin guidance at this point. If your question was more generally about the pricing environment for REMICADE, happy to share our perspectives on that. Tony, do you want to?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","Right, so I mean as we watch the marketplace, obviously as the number of biosimilar competitors come to market, so potentially it could be some more price erosion. The countries outside the United States where REMICADE has experienced such a dramatic reduction in price with the biosimilars, but generally the smaller countries where it is a hospital-based business which is tender driven and the tender winner takes it all. So it's clear that a different structure and a different process in terms of deciding which drugs to use, not by a physician but by the government tenders.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Sean, I just wanted ask you about romosozumab. You highlighted that data coming in the first half of 2016. Could you clarify whether that's the 12 months or the final 24 months data and when you would anticipate filing that program? And I also just wondered what dose you would expect to be filing with them, whether you have a formulation that can deliver it in a single 1 ml injection? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development","So yes, we're talking about the primary analysis in the placebo-controlled study, and so that would be at the 24 month time point. And we plan on filing it as soon as we can put it together and file it, obviously. We always do that as fast as we possibly can. It's hard to anticipate without seeing the data what kind of additional questions might be required to be answered and that sort of thing, but this is a very high priority program for us. So we'll certainly be focused on that. And I think it's premature for us to be able to talk about the format in which we would be providing it commercially, but we do feel that it can be delivered once a month likely in a single injection.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks for the question. Congrats on the quarter. I had a question for Sean on CGRP. You previously spoke about the advantages of blocking the receptor. Your data as well as others have come out now, so although it's still early, do you think that thesis that you had is playing out? And how do you think your DNA is positioned and how is this going to be differentiated as we go forward now that some of this data has all come out now?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development","Yeah, yes good question. I think that there's no doubt that the potency of a receptor antagonist is expected from first principals in all the pre-clinical data to be higher than that of ligand sequestration, and that's exactly what we're seeing in humans as well, is particularly you can measure that in the doses that are required to suppress the skin reactions in the capsaicin PD assays that were used by many of the companies in the early phase development. I think really what it comes down to and what I've always referred to is that this will be, this is an ambulatory otherwise well patient population. They're going to want the easiest potential dosing format, once a month let's say, small volume, low-pain injection and a disposable auto injector.","The question is whether all of these products can achieve that kind of profile. It's going to be easier for us to do that, we believe, because we have a more potent agent, and so there's only so much antibody that can be packed into a milliliter. And so it remains to be seen whether the ligand antibodies can thread that needle and get to a single injection monthly. Some may, some may not. We're quite confident about being able to do that. So I think it's bearing out scientifically, but we'll have to see whether it translates into a real clinical differentiator in the marketplace, and time will tell.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow up on Eric's questions on M&A. You just announced that Fred Hassan was assigned to the board and we all know that he played an instrument role in Pharmacia, Schering-Plough, Bausch & Lomb. Should we read that into some sort of indication, or we're reading too much into the tea leaves? And then secondly, Enbrel year-over-year growth was mostly driven by pricing. I was wondering if you have any thought on longer-term pricing strength in this market. Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Ying, I think you're over-reading the tea leaves there. As I said, I think Fred shares our excitement about the innovation that's emerging here and the long-term growth prospects for the company. But, Tony, why don't you talk about Enbrel?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","So Ying, the pricing of Enbrel will continue to be a consolidation of list prices as well as adjustments in contracts we have with various payers and players in the marketplace, and we continue to see movement or ability to move prices in the future as well, yes.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. For Repatha, do you have any indication as to whether or not you may need to negotiate exclusive formulary contracts with payers, or are you confident that you'll be able to coexist with Praluent on parity contracts? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","So it's Tony. Let me just say again, we've had some preliminary discussion with payers on a very broad medical basis. Clearly, we're not able to do any negotiations with them until we get full approval from the FDA. Our position has always been that the choice given to both patients and physicians is the most important thing in our marketplace, so we will continue to strive to look for choice.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations","Yeah.","Operator","And our next -","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Brian, do we have any other questions?","Operator","Yes, we have one more question from the line of Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities","Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get a sense from you whether the PCSK9 class will be subject to, I guess, class labeling. Or is there potential for nuances, differences in label claims across the I guess two or three drugs that we kind of all know of?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development","I think you may have gotten cut off there. But this is Sean. Of course, they'll be a degree to which the labeling will look similar across the products, no matter how many there are. I think that will be pretty evident as you see for example the first two labels, whether it's Europe or the United States. However, the products are not developed identically. They don't all have the same studies. They don't all have the same safety profile, in fact. And so I think that you will see differences between the products. And I anticipate that that will be true, because not all of the safety profile for example is mechanism-based. Some of the safety profile issues result from differences in molecular structure formulation and that sort of thing, which can lead to differences in the way that the body reacts to the protein formulation, as an example. And to our knowledge, we're only company doing an IVUS study, for example. So yeah, you'll see differences between the labels, but there will be similarities from a class perspective, for sure.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","All right, well let me thank you all for joining the call. We're looking forward to the second half of the year. A lot of exciting things to come ahead. So we'll look forward to seeing you and having a chance to talk to you on the third and fourth quarter calls. Thank you.","Arvind K.

Thanks for joining us today. Lets go ahead and jump right in as we have a lot of ground to cover.","I think 2018 is a good illustration of how the capabilities we have developed over the past five years will help drive long-term growth for our shareholders. To describe this in much greater detail I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO Bob Bradway. After Bob's strategic overview, our CFO David Meline will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 and provide guidance for 2019.","Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon, will then review our product performance, following which David Reese our Head of R&D will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides to guide our discussion today and you should have received a link separately.","Just a reminder that we will use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bradway","Okay, thank you Arvind. And let me welcome all of you to our fourth quarter call. Well the bulk of this call will be dedicated to discussing our performance in 2018 and our outlook for 2019, I'd like to begin the call today by discussing the transformation journey we've been on at Amgen for the past five years.","One aspect of that transformation was significantly improved financial performance. Five years ago we made a number of financial commitments, earnings per share, margin expansion and so forth, and I'm pleased to announce that we met or exceeded each one of these ambitious financial targets.","David will provide more specifics on this in a few moments. Larger goal of our transformation, however, was to dramatically enhance our ability to compete. And here too, we've made great progress. Over the past five years.","We launched nine new products including \u2013 in two new therapeutic areas, expanded our global presence to about a hundred countries, generated our largest ever number of innovative and first-in-class molecules in our pipeline. Reduced our development cycle time by an average of about 36 months. Expanded our industry leading human genetics capabilities, stood up a biosimilars business and deployed a first of its kind, highly efficient next generation biologics manufacturing capability.","While our transformation is not complete, we're in a much better position than ever before to serve patients and to deliver long-term growth. Our performance in 2018 is a good example of our capabilities. We generated double-digit volume driven growth, which was a key focus of our strategy from innovative medicines that address serious unmet needs, including Repatha in cardiovascular disease, Prolia in osteoporosis, a Kyprolis in cancer, Aimovig in migraine.","Our ability to develop and commercialize innovative therapies is particularly illustrated in the early success of Aimovig. Our first-in-class differentiated biologic for the prevention of migraine where we quickly established and have since maintained a leadership position.","We also believe that biosimilars represent an important evolving growth opportunity. We achieved several important milestones with our biosimilars portfolio last year, including our first two launches, and we expect many more milestones in the years to come. Lifecycle management has also been an important source of our performance over the last several years.","We believe we will continue to generate strong cash flows from mature brands including Enbrel, Neulasta and our ESA and calcimimetics franchises. Murdo will provide more details in a moment about our commercial success.","Our R&D strategy is aimed at advancing differentiated best-in-class or first-in-class molecules that deliver large effect sizes against serious illnesses. We've made tremendous progress both in terms of the quantity and quality of potential new medicines in our innovative pipeline.","We continue to leverage our industry leading human genetics work at deCODE to identify, prioritize and accelerate R&D programs, with genetic validation. And we've made great strides with respect to the speed with which we are advancing our pipeline, cutting years out of the cycle-time for certain molecules, several of which will have important data readouts this year.","Dave Reese will cover our position in R&D in greater detail momentarily. As you're well aware, innovation is flourishing in our industry and with the flow of new medicines. There are acute concerns about the price of innovative therapies and ensuring patients have access to them. We remain committed to working with the administration and congressional leaders in the House and Senate as well as stakeholders throughout the healthcare system to address concerns over the cost of prescription drugs without sacrificing innovation.","You will recall our decision to forego price increases scheduled for July of last year, as well as our recent decision to lower the list price of Repatha by 60%. In fact, our net selling prices declined in 2018 and will decline further in 2019. For many Amgen medicines, there are no planned price increases.","As has been the case for the past few years, our strategy for growth will be driven by volume, not price. Our fourth quarter product sales growth of 8% is evidence of our ability to succeed in this new environment. With a solid balance sheet, strong and consistent free cash flow generation, robust investments across the portfolio, and a thoughtful capital deployment strategy we are confident in our ability to drive long-term volume driven growth and provide attractive returns for our shareholders.","I'm excited about the future of Amgen and the potential for long-term growth driven by medicines like Repatha, Prolia, Kyprolis and Aimovig. Our emerging portfolio of biosimilars and the many potential new innovations advancing rapidly through our pipeline.","While we have profoundly transformed the Company over the last several years, our mission to serve patients has not changed. And on that note, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues around the globe for their continued devotion to supporting Amgen\u2019s mission to serve patients.","With that, let me turn the call over to David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer","David Meline","Okay, and thanks Bob. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I would also like to take a moment to reflect on our performance over the last several years. In 2013, we anticipated the coming realities of an increasingly competitive and dynamic industry landscape. Accordingly, we embarked on an organizational initiative to prepare for long-term success by transforming the business to achieve maximum speed, agility, and efficiency.","We also set aggressive operational goals for the period through 2018 that would enable us to better serve patients and deliver solid sustainable returns to shareholders while investing to ensure the long-term health of the business.","As we have now completed the first five years of our transformation. I wanted to summarize the results of our efforts. First, I'm pleased to confirm that we achieved double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth with 14% annual growth for the period with EPS rising from $7.60 to $14.40 or 89% in the period.","Second, we exceeded our 1.5 billion gross cost savings target by delivering 1.9 billion of annual savings versus the 2013 base. Transformation efforts reduced 2018 operating expense on a like-for-like basis as a percent of sales by nine percentage points. It is important to recognize that we deliver these financial results while launching multiple products and building new capabilities.","Third, we had an operational goal to achieve significant improvement in our operating efficiency, agility and speed. With the resulting outcome of a non-GAAP operating margin between 52% and 54% by 2018, a goal that at the midpoint represented a 15 point margin improvement. As you know, we achieved this objective starting in 2016 two years ahead of our commitment.","Fourth grew our next generation Biomanufacturing capability as well as other efforts to optimize our fixed capital infrastructure. We\u2019ve reduced our facility footprint by about 24% exceeding our target of 23% footprint reduction.","Finally, based on today's 2018 earnings report, we've provided returns to shareholders of 89% or $42 billion in total well above our goal of returning at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the 2014 to 2018 period.","In summary, we delivered on all of our commitments which positions Amgen very well for the next phase of its development. Looking ahead, we are excited to build on our recent transformation successes including maintaining and improving on our leading process development and manufacturing capabilities, driving our research and development innovation and continuing to build our market in global presence.","Additionally, we're embedding a permanent productivity capability into our business. We expect our productivity capability will continue to support disciplined cost management, contribute to funding strategic growth investments such as the 2019 investment in our early oncology programs and continued optimization of our operating model.","Now let's turn to the fourth quarter financial results on Page 7 of the slide deck. Revenues at $6.2 billion increased 7% year-over-year. This quarter we saw worldwide product sales growth to 6 billion as unit demand from our growth and launch products more than offset the mature product declines. We are particularly encouraged by our 10% year-over-year volume growth in total worldwide business. Foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact to fourth quarter worldwide sales on a year-over-year basis.","Other revenues at $229 million were down 2% versus 2017. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income at $2.7 billion increased 6% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 45.3% for the quarter. As previously indicated, our operating expenses reflected the typical underlying fourth quarter pattern. We also increased investment in Aimovig in support of its rapid growth as well as other in-market products in support of greater volume driven growth.","Additionally, this quarter we invested an incremental $90 million year-over-year in external innovation opportunities including expansion of our genetics capability. These increases were partially offset by continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories.","Other income and expenses were a net $197 million expense in Q4. This is unfavorable by $166 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year unfavorability was due primarily to lower interest income on lower cash balances as well as market value fluctuations of publicly-traded securities held in our ventures portfolio.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 13.3% for the quarter a 3.3 point improvement versus Q4 of 2017 reflecting favorable impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP net income increased 4% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 18% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, supported by a 12% reduction in share count versus Q4 of 2017.","Please find a summary of our 2018 full year results on Page 8 of the presentation. Our 2018 full year revenues increased 4% to $23.7 billion, while our non-GAAP earnings per share grew 14% to $14.40 per share.","For the full year, we saw a 3% increase in worldwide product sales growth at $22.5 billion. Other revenues increased $160 million to $1.1 billion due largely to the year-over-year favorable impact of milestone payments. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income at $11.9 billion grew 2% from the prior year. And our non-GAAP operating margin was 52.6% for the year. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year to $11.9 billion has increased investment in both R&D and our launch products exceeded the benefits from our ongoing transformation initiatives.","To put this in perspective through the end of 2018, overall net operating expenses increased less than 1% on a five-year CAGR as we reinvested our transformation savings to broaden our capabilities, launch multiple products in new therapeutic areas and generate innovative first-in-class molecules including our emerging oncology programs.","Other income and expenses were unfavorable by $410 million on a year-over-year basis due to lower interest income on our lower cash balances and portfolio rebalancing. The non-GAAP tax rate was 13.5% for the total year, down 4.5 points versus 2017 due to the impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 9. For the full year 2018, Amgen continued to demonstrate strong and stable cash flow generation reflecting a portfolio dominated by differentiated biologic products coupled with an industry competitive cost structure.","2018 free cash flow was $10.6 billion versus $10.5 billion in 2017. Debt outstanding at year-end totaled $33.9 billion and carries a weighted average interest rate of 4% and an average maturity of 11.5 years. In 2018, we returned a total of over $21 billion to shareholders including deployment of $17.9 billion to repurchase 94.5 million shares at an average of $189 per share.","Additionally for 2018, we increased our dividend per share by 15% to $1.32 per quarter with dividend payments totaling $3.5 billion. Based on our confidence in the future outlook for the enterprise and our continued commitment to a balanced capital allocation strategy, we also announced a 10% increase to the dividend to $1.45 per share for the first quarter of 2019.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2019 on Page 10. 2019 will be another important year for Amgen as we continue investing in the pipeline, building out our global business and supporting our new product growth. In anticipation of this opportunity, we transformed the business over the past several years and more recently embedded a permanent productivity capability to enable us to fully invest from a position of strength.","This business model enables us to deliver industry leading financial performance while continuing to invest for long-term growth and success. Our 2019 revenue guidance is $21.8 billion to $22.9 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $13.10 to $14.30 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 14% to 15% and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.","There are several key assumptions embedded in our outlook that I will take a moment to share. First, our revenue guidance range reflects both continued solid positive growth momentum from our newer products as well as evolving competitive dynamics related to our mature products. We have important incremental growth opportunities driven by recently launched products including Aimovig, Repatha and biosimilars and international expansion as well as our emerging oncology programs.","We also recognize the potential challenges including further generic competition to Sensipar, continued competitive dynamics for Enbrel and competition against Aranesp and Neulasta. With regard to net selling prices, as referenced, overall net selling price decreased by 1% in 2018, we expect net selling prices to decline by mid single-digits in 2019. Finally, we benefit from the added flexibility enabled by our transformation and productivity capabilities to use our strong cash flow and balance sheet to invest in the continued growth of the company.","With regard to Sensipar, we're confident in the strength of our intellectual property. However, uncertainty as to the timing and intensity of competition will remain until the outcome of litigation becomes clear. Our guidance reflects this uncertainty. Note that Sensipar sales will be lower than 2018 in all scenarios as the result of recent short-lived generic entry, continued adoption of Parsabiv and the non-recurrence of the substantially higher purchases in Q1 of 2018, due to the reimbursement change from Part D to Part B.","As you recall, revenue in 2000 \u2013 as you model revenue in 2019, note that historically the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year. As a percent of the full year, product sales for the first quarter should look similar to the percentage we saw in Q1 of 2018. Murdo will provide further details related to first quarter sales in his remarks.","With respect to other revenue, we expect about $1.1 billion for the full year 2019, reflecting the nonrecurring nature of milestone payments received in 2018. From an operating expense perspective, our transformation enabled us to establish a highly efficient cost profile. From this lean baseline, we expect to continue to generate incremental savings through our productivity improvement capability and manage costs in a very disciplined manner, while making the investments required to rapidly advance our pipeline and maximize the value of our marketed products.","Overall, we expect 2019 operating expense to be flat to down from 2018 on an absolute basis. We anticipate R&D expenses to rise as our pipeline advances. Cost of sales to be flat to slightly up depending on volume and SG&A to decline as launch expenses normalize and we continue with a resource allocation discipline. Finally, we expect all categories to benefit from our productivity program.","With regard to our 2019 guidance, our non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted between 14% and 15%. This incorporates a 21% tax rate on U.S. earnings and a 10.5% tax rate on ex-U.S. earnings.","With regard to capital deployment, our actions will continue to reflect the following principles. First, we will invest in our business to expand our pipeline and seek to drive long-term revenue through volume growth, globally in both large and specialty care markets. Second, we will remain committed to achieving an optimal capital structure in order to minimize our weighted average cost of capital by fully deploying cash flows over time, as well as deploying excess accumulated capital.","Reflecting our confidence in the future and remaining excess cash position, will continue to support our growing dividend including the 10% increase in the first quarter of 2019, as well as continued share repurchase in 2019 and beyond. At year-end 2018, we have a remaining unused board authorization to purchase up to $5.1 billion of our common stock.","Finally, today's revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges are again wider than we have historically provided at the start of each year. This wide range is primarily a reflection of uncertainties related to our Sensipar sales, coupled with other ongoing uncertainties that I outlined earlier. Consistent with our usual practice, our guidance today does not include the impact of potential business development activities. In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2018 and we remain confident in the outlook for Amgen success in 2019 and beyond.","This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Murdo.","Murdo Gordon","Thanks, David. I'll take a few minutes to reflect on our 2018 performance and then review our Q4 products specific performance. In 2018, we accomplished a great deal of growing sales 3% driven by 5% volume growth. In the U.S. we launched two products; first, Aimovig, an innovative first-in-class therapy for the prevention of migraine. Aimovig reached over 150,000 patients during 2018 and represents a strong launch trajectory. We also launched Parsabiv, which provides nephrologists with better control for their SHPT patients given as motive administration.","Parsabiv generated over $300 million of sales in the U.S. the first year of launch, again, representative of the benefit that it brings as well as Amgen strength in nephrology. We make great strides in driving volume growth across much of our portfolio. Take Prolia as an example. In the eight-plus years, since launch, we've delivered double-digit volume growth in every quarter. This illustrates that consistency and durability of growth opportunities in diseases with large underserved patient populations.","With Repatha, we've demonstrated our competitiveness with leading market shares, while improving patient access and affordability. The fundamental characteristics of Repatha are similar to Prolia, both address an asymptomatic disease with high numbers of undertreated patients. The physical, emotional and financial costs of events to patients in society, whether they be fractures in the case of Prolia or stroke or heart attacks in the case of Repatha, are exceedingly large. The patients at highest risk are identifiable and therapies such as Prolia and Repatha can prevent such outcomes.","Sales of our hematology and oncology portfolio of XGEVA, Kyprolis, Vectibix, Nplate, BLINCYTO and IMLYGIC exceeded $4.4 billion growing 14% over last year. This is a therapeutic area where we have strong global capabilities that we will leverage as our pipeline matures. While our mature brands of Enbrel, Neulasta, NEUPOGEN, EPOGEN, and Aranesp face intensifying competition, our teams continue to promote and demonstrate the value that these brands provide. With decades of clinical experience and Amgen\u2019s assurance of high quality supply, we expect these brands to continue to generate value for many years into the future.","Outside of the U.S. we launched our first two biosimilar products; KANJINTI, a biosimilar to Herceptin; and AMGEVITA, a biosimilar to Humira. We expect to launch additional biosimilars in 2019 across multiple geographies and continue to advance additional biosimilar assets through development. We remain confident in the biosimilar business opportunity that we embarked on nearly a decade ago and expect these assets to contribute significantly to Amgen\u2019s growth.","Also outside the U.S., where we faced biosimilar competition for many years, we had strong volume growth of 14% in 2018, demonstrating the growth potential of our newer portfolio. These markets serve as a model for Amgen\u2019s future growth profile. In addition, our ex-U.S. business represents a growing portion of our overall revenue base due to our international expansion efforts.","Finally, we continue to invest in our portfolio, particularly those brands with longer periods of patent protection, including Enbrel, Prolia and Aimovig. Those investments have taken the form of evidence generation, patient friendly devices and formulations as well as consumer and healthcare provider awareness efforts. We are encouraged by the promotional responsiveness of these brands and continue to seek additional investment opportunities that can both drive volume growth and generate shareholder returns.","Now moving to fourth quarter results, you'll find reference information on our product sales on slides 12 and 13. Fourth quarter reported sales grew at 8% year-over-year, driven by 10% volume growth.","Let me start with Repatha on Slide 14. Q4 sales of Repatha grew by 62% year-over-year as we continue to compete effectively with a leading share in the PCSK9 class of approximately 60% globally. For the full year, Repatha grew by 72% with volume nearly doubling versus 2017. In 2018, we were able to secure improved payer utilization management criteria and help HCPs treat more patients. Additionally, we launched our new lower list price Repatha, where we reduced the list price by 60%. We've seen strong uptick of this product representing over 25% of all units in the U.S. as we exited the fourth quarter.","To-date, plans formally covering lower list price Repatha represent only 43% of Medicare lives. We're encouraging plans to move more rapidly to not only cover lower list price Repatha, but also to provide coverage with low fixed co-pay given the significant potential benefit this can provide Medicare patients and to reduce their out of pocket costs. We look forward to working with the plans and the U.S. administration to see how we can get this important treatment to patients more rapidly.","At a macro level, I'll remind you that the blended net price for Repatha in the U.S. will decline in 2019 as new contracts went into effect in January. While there's lower net price may impact reported Repatha sales near-term, we expect to see a positive impact on volume growth and reported net sales over the longer timeframe. Regarding our ex-U.S. business, we continue to work with country authorities to optimize access. Overall, our priority remains to help the large population of high risk cardiovascular patients that can benefit from Repatha.","On to Prolia on Slide 15, Prolia delivered another strong quarter with sales increasing 14% year-over-year driven by 12% volume growth. As we typically see, we also had sequential growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Prolia grew 16%. Let me remind you, the overall penetration is still in the mid 20% range across many markets, indicating significant potential for improved treatment. We expect Prolia will remain a very strong growth driver.","Moving to our Hem\/Onc business, the portfolio of Kyprolis, XGEVA, Nplate, Vectibix, BLINCYTO and IMLYGIC collectively totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 13% year-over-year. While there may be periodic quarterly fluctuations due to purchasing patterns, we expect this portfolio to continue as a growth engine and provide the foundation for both innovative and biosimilar additions to our oncology portfolio.","Looking at additional details for some of the larger brands, as we start with XGEVA on Slide 17, in Q4 XGEVA grew 17% year-over-year, primarily from volume, as we hold close to 60% share in the U.S. Our share in multiple myeloma patients continues to grow steadily with our label expansion in 2018. On a full year basis, XGEVA grew 13%. On to Kyprolis which in Q4 grew 11% year-on-year, driven primarily by growth in markets outside of the U.S. Since its launch, Kyprolis has delivered a suite of clinical evidence demonstrating its ability to meaningfully extend overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.","Our team continues to emphasize Kyprolis overall survival benefit and we've seen new patient share gradually increase. Also, there are promising signs for our newly introduced once weekly administration with incremental growth in second line usage of Kd. On a full year basis, Kyprolis grew 16%.","Let me also cover our filgrastim brands starting on Slide 19. In Q4, Neulasta sales increased 5% year-over-year, which included a $55 million purchase from BARDA. For the full year 2018, Neulasta sales declined by 1%. As we anticipated, we now have two biosimilar competitors in the U.S. facing one competitor during Q4, we retained 96% share of the long acting market, with Onpro, a majority share at over 60%.","Second U.S. competitor was approved in late 2018 and it launched early this month. Our guidance anticipates possibility for other competitors to enter the U.S. during 2019. In Europe, we now face three long acting biosimilar competitors, which have launched over the last four months and expect additional entrance during 2019. Consistent with our long held expectations related to Europe with numerous competitors launching in a short time window, we expect European sales to decline over 25% year-over-year. More broadly, with the uncertainty over the eventual number of competitors on a global basis and their launch timing there is a range of possible outcomes for Neulasta in 2019. We remain confident that our experience, established record of quality, dependable supply, and innovative solutions such as Onpro will serve as well.","Turning to Slide 20. NEUPOGEN exited the fourth quarter with roughly a third share of the short acting segment in the U.S. Moving to Enbrel for both Q4 and the full year sales declined 8% primarily driven by volume and net selling price declines. In general, we expect recent trends to continue. Recall that the first quarter represents the lowest sales of the year, due to insurance reverifications and the resetting of deductibles in channel inventory fluctuations. As a percent of the full year, the first quarter should look similar to 2018.","Switching to nephrology, starting on Slide 22, Q4 EPOGEN sales declined 2% due to lower net selling price in a category that's becoming increasingly competitive. For the full year 2018 sales declined by 8%. With the launch of a biosimilar competitor late last year and our contractual pricing commitments with DaVita, the net price decline for EPOGEN will increase significantly in 2019 and is already in effect.","Aranesp declined 3% year-over-year in Q4 primarily driven by increased competition from a long acting product in the independent and midsize dialysis organizations. For the full year Aranesp declined 9%. Recall that the short-acting biosimilar is approved to compete in all market segments in the U.S. As referenced Slide 24 shows the breakout by segment of our ESA business. We expect sales to decline at a faster rate in 2019 than 2018 with both long-acting and short-acting competition in the U.S.","With regards to calcimimetics, we continue to see strong utilization of Parsabiv at independent and mid-sized dialysis providers who have incorporated it into their protocols. However, the rate of adoption with those customers slowed in Q4 as Parsabiv already represented a majority of calcimimetic utilization for their patients. We continue to see gradual adoption of Parsabiv with FMC and DaVita, and expect most of the future growth to come from these customers.","Turning to Sensipar, the outlook remains uncertain given ongoing litigation leading to a range of possible outcomes. And you heard David characterize our guidance related to Sensipar. Let me reiterate the points that he made. Recall that Q1 of 2018 had substantially higher purchases than normal run rates due to the reimbursement change from Part D to Part B. Also looking forward, there will be volume erosion due to continued Parsabiv uptake.","And finally, the short-lived generic entry will impact 2019 sales. Regarding 2018 performance, Q4 sales increased 8% primarily driven by changes in accounting estimates offset by lower volume due to the continued adoption of Parsabiv. Sales grew 3% on a full year basis.","Shifting gears from our innovative products to our biosimilars portfolio, our European launches for KANJINTI and AMGEVITA are underway. While it's still early in the launch cycle, the market is playing out, as we anticipated and we're pleased with our performance to date. Outside of the U.S. we see important differences between products and markets in terms of biosimilar uptake in price erosion, recent launches in markets such as Norway in the Netherlands are experiencing strong uptake at more discounted pricing levels, while another larger markets including Germany and France, there is a more balanced dynamic and sustainable opportunity.","Our strategy is to focus primarily on these more sustainable markets, which we expect will drive our biosimilar revenues in the next several years. We also expect incremental contribution from competing selectively in certain tender driven markets. Across Europe, there's significant demand for high quality reliable biosimilars. While some have speculated as to the strength of the biosimilar market in the U.S., we see biosimilars representing an important market for the future. Using NEUPOGEN as an example, where biosimilars continue to gain share, demonstrating that they can successfully compete in the U.S. market. We're planning for additional launches in 2019, and expect this business to be a growth driver for years to come.","I'd like to close the product review section of my comments with Aimovig. We continue to be excited by the strong response from physician and patient community following the launch of this innovative therapy. Overall, the CGRP market grew at over 150% quarter-over-quarter in Q4, with Aimovig exiting 2018 with a majority share, demonstrating our first-mover advantage, strong product profile and ability to compete. We recently launched our DTC campaign and see early promising results. I know there's been a great deal of interest in the number of prescriptions that are being paid for, so let me share that. During Q4 the percentage paid was 50% which was up from prior quarter at 35%. We also expect to double contracted coverage in Q1 versus Q4.","Before closing our Aimovig comments, I should call out that the fourth quarter sales of $95 million benefited from $20 million of changes in prior period accounting estimates as we realized higher average net selling prices from quarters two and three versus our prior estimates. And like Enbrel, the first quarter for Aimovig will also experience insurance reverifications and resetting of deductibles, leading it to be a lower quarter than subsequent ones. We expect Aimovig to continue to be a growth driver for Amgen.","In summary, we continue to market a portfolio exemplified by important medicines that treat serious diseases. I\u2019m pleased with the execution and consistency of performance in 2018, demonstrating that we have established a strong foundation for the future. Our portfolio will continue to evolve during 2019 and we're prepared to maximize on the opportunities to bring Amgen\u2019s products to a greater number of patients.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Reese.","David Reese","Thanks, Murdo. As we enter 2019, I've never felt better about our effort, progress and productivity in R&D. Our investment in human genetics continues powered by decode and their work on the Icelandic population more then 1 million participants from outside Iceland and in the future up to an additional half million patients following our agreement with a leading U.S. integrated delivery network. Today over 75% of our pipeline has some degree of human genetic validation compared to just 15% five years ago.","This increase is the conviction we have in certain programs and gives us the confidence to make more aggressive strategic investments from discovery through clinical development that can improve cycle times significantly. In fact, through our use of genetics and our transformation efforts, we estimate that we have reduced the development timelines in some of our programs by an average of three years. To compliment our human genetics work, we have partnered with SomaLogic to analyze 5,000 proteins and up to 40,000 individuals for whom sequencing data are available. To our knowledge, this is the largest proteomics experiment ever conducted and may enhance our insights into disease biology.","R&D is firing on all cylinders as we have advanced a record number of programs. One of our key productivity metrics is the number of molecules we commit to take forward into human testing the formation of so-called product teams. I\u2019m pleased to report that over the last two years, we formed more product teams than any prior two years in Amgen\u2019s history. In the same period we also filed 20 INDs, approximately 70% of these being first-in-class molecules and we also began 15 first-in-human clinical studies. Several of these will begin reading out this year.","I'll begin with an update on oncology. In December, we have the opportunity at ASH to present the initial clinical data from our BCMA BiTE, AMG 420 in multiple myeloma, and our CD33 BiTE, AMG 330 in AML. The data were very well received by the medical community, most notably the AMG 420 data which demonstrated a 70% response rate and a 40% MRD negative complete response rate at our target dose in heavily pretreated patients. We look forward to additional data from those programs this year along with initial data from our half-life extended BiTE programs, AMG 701 directed against the BCMA and potentially AMG 673, directed against CD33. We also expect the initial data from our small molecule KRAS G12C inhibitor, AMG 510 in the first half of the year.","This particular mutation is easily identifiable and present in about 15% to 25% of lung adenocarcinomas and 2% to 4% of a wide range of other solid tumors including pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer. This is an example of a program that we accelerated significantly. We were the first into the clinic and are now moving through dose escalation where we are seeing interesting early hints of clinical activity. We also expect data from our MCL-1 inhibitor program in multiple myeloma and AML from both our IV and oral formulations, AMG 176 and AMG 397, respectively.","Our preclinical data suggests that these molecules could be additive or synergistic with the BCL-2 inhibitor, and we will be advancing combination studies as we move forward. We also expect data this year from AMG 596, the first generation EGFRvIII BiTE under investigation in patients with glioblastoma, a setting where a short half-life molecule is preferable due to potential on target toxicity within the CNS. This mutation is present in about 25% of glioblastomas and represents a true tumor-specific antigen. We are also pleased to report at a single-arm Phase 3 trial of Kyprolis and dexamethasone. Kd met its response rate primary end point in China in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.","Finally in the oncology pipeline later this year, we expect to conduct the primary analysis of our Phase 3 study of Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone and Darzalex, Kd Dara versus Kd alone in relapsed or refractory myeloma. In cardiovascular the Repatha indication was recently expanded in China making it the first PCSK9 Inhibitor approved there to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary revascularization in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","In our other atherosclerosis clinical program, we are impressed with the initial clinical data we were seeing with AMG 890 and siRNA that targets Lp(a), high levels of which are genetically determined and associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We look forward to sharing those data with you later this year or in early 2020.","In bone, EVENITY was recently approved in Japan for the treatment of osteoporosis patients at high risk for fracture and we were pleased that the FDA advisory committee voted in favor of approval for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture in the United States.","We will continue working with FDA towards registration and along with our partner UCB look forward to bringing this effective medicine to osteoporosis patients at high risk for fracture in the U.S. and around the world.","Finally, we continue to advance our biosimilar programs with regulatory submissions completed in the U.S. and EU for ABP 710 our biosimilar Remicade. On December 28th we refiled our BLA with the FDA for KANJINTI our biosimilar Herceptin and expect a six month review.","ABP 798 our biosimilar Rituxan, met all of its primary and secondary end points in a Phase 3 trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. And we anticipate the completion of the second Phase 3 trial in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma later this year.","We've also begun screening patients in the Phase 3 study of ABP 959 our biosimilar Soliris. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay, thank you. We've covered a lot of ground now. Ian why don't we open up the line to questions. If you wouldn't mind please remind the callers what the process is for asking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is line of getting Ying Huang from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First question I have is, regarding your assumption for Neulasta in the guidance. Are you assuming there will be a third entry for Neulasta biosimilar? And then are you also assuming the net price, similar in terms of decline similar to the 2018 or not?","And then next question is, if you don't consummate a big M&A transaction, would you consider another ASR this year in 2019. Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Okay. I guess, a couple of questions there. First on Neulasta, I think both Murdo and David addressed it. So Murdo do you want to reiterate what you said on the call?","Murdo Gordon","Yes, sure. On Neulasta we\u2019re assuming that we will have as expected, the two competitors in the market as well as potential additional competitors before the end of 2019 in the U.S. We're also assuming some additional competition outside the U.S.","Bob Bradway","David, do you want to just describe this more broadly.","David Meline","Yes, sure. In terms of the capital and cash deployment, of course, our priorities are the same, which is, our first priority is to invest in the business both internally at Amgen as well as looking very actively at potential additions to the portfolio through business development.","And obviously we have plenty of financial flexibility to be able to accomplish that. We're also committed to return excess cash to shareholders through time. And I would observe that, we had quite significant, returns to shareholders last year, over $21 billion. And I would say from a repurchase perspective, I would look at the pace at which we've been operating as a reasonable guide, for us into 2019 and then more specifically as to the ASR question, we haven't made a determination as to whether we pursue something of that sort. But obviously if we decided to we'd be communicating that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Great, good afternoon. So, two questions for me just related to guidance as well. Can you just help us, it's still not clear to us how much inventory Teva launched in the channel for Sensipar. Can you just tell us how much of a headwind that's expected to be for Sensipar this year.","And then on EPOGEN and I guess Aaron asked as well, you talked about significant year-over-year price declines. Can you help us with order of magnitude are these single or double digit year-over-year kind of price declines for those products? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Yes, so maybe I'd start on the Sensipar question. And I guess what I'd say first of all, in all scenarios that we've got for Sensipar in 2019 and as I said, we do expect a year-over-year decline in sales driven by the part D to B switch last year, Parsabiv taking more share of the market and the fact that there was the temporary entrant of a generic competitor. What's true is our agreement does not allow us to comment on the amount of product put into the market.","But what I would say is we did indicate that if you look at our overall sales in the first quarter, we think as a percent of the total year, they'll be comparable to 2018. And I think it's fair to assume that the impact on the market from the Sensipar generic was likely to be certainly impacting Q1.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. Matthew, we were expecting trends to be fairly stable in our Aranesp and our EPOGEN business going forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Chris Raymond","Thanks. Maybe just a Repatha question. Murdo I just want to make sure I understand what you're talking about with respect to net price. I think when you guys announced that the new pricing structure and the new SKU, you took pains to say that not to expect a change in the blended net price going forward. But I look at slide 14, it looks like you're guiding to a lower net price.","So, is that sort of a long-term, data point or is there something else going on there? And then maybe just a part two to that question. Just kind of curious, you've mentioned 12 to 18 months to get folks to migrate to that lower priced SKU. I just kind of curious how that conversation goes with payers who continue to opt for the higher priced SKU. Thanks.","Murdo Gordon","Yes, thanks for the question. Overall, the experience with Repatha has been very good through the fourth quarter. And we're optimistic that we'll continue to make good inroads this year. If you recall, we were contracting through the middle of last year to improve utilization management criteria for Repatha and we've been competitively doing that. In addition, with the introduction of the new low list price, we were able to directly address the out of pocket expenses for some Medicare Part D patients.","What we're signaling is that we will have some step down in net ASP with new contracts going into effect in 2019. However, we do expect that that will be offset with volume growth throughout the course of the year.","The other thing that I would point, I would \u2013 just to your question on how those conversations go, is we did launch the low list price for Repatha late in the bid cycle for Medicare Part D plans for payers at the end the last year. So, we weren't expecting to be broadly used and listed on their formularies in the first part of this year. So we're working for off-cycle additions and we've been able to do that.","And we've been able to drive about 25% of our out movement as the low list price of Repatha and that continues to climb. And we've been able to see some out-of-pocket costs being reduced at the counter for Medicare Part D patients who need access to this medicine. I would say it's going according to plan, but we are doing everything we can to work with payers to accelerate that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering with respect to Aimovig, if you can give us any update there on the formulary dynamics in terms of where you stand, how many decisions are outstanding, any key differences versus Repatha as we think about the longer term pricing outlook there? And then would love an update on the monthly formulation in terms of when we might expect that to launch? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon","Yes, I'll handle the first part and then maybe turnover to Dave Reese for the change in formulation. Overall, we're really pleased with Aimovig. We priced this product for access, it's been well received by payers for the most part. What's happened to-date has been that we've received pretty good coverage with most payers even on an on-contracted basis allowing the product to be reimbursed on the basis of physician attestation alone.","What we are seeing now into the first quarter is an increase in the number of paid prescription, so that jumped from 35% to about half of our total prescriptions in the fourth quarter. What we will see though is from Q4 to Q1 is we will see an increase in our contracted business and that will have a short-term step down in net selling price. But then as the year progresses, we should stabilize because we'll have a smaller and smaller percentage of our business that is through free goods program versus contracted paid for.","Bob Bradway","Another question Terence of when we're going to \u2013 when we expect to hear from FDA.","David Reese","Yes, I mean, we've \u2013 this is Dave Reese. We've submitted that it's under FDA review. We'll provide guidance as those discussions are moved further along with the agency.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Hey everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Question for Dave on the oncology pipeline, there's a lot to digest on Slide 30. And you've got a lot of programs and I don't think this includes your recent I-O collaboration. So the question is how do you prioritize? And then more importantly when you look at trying to fill the revenue gap from biosimilars, are there oncology programs that you call out that are closer to starting a Phase 3? Thanks.","David Reese","Sure. So I think you raise an important question about how we prioritize, that's really based on emerging data. As we develop the broad based plan to advance these agents. We went through a detailed prioritization exercise and we would expect that over the course of the year there will be puts and takes based on emerging data. And we fully intend to invest resources behind those programs that are showing evidence of efficacy, the kind of transformative efficacy that we're aiming for.","Bob Bradway","In terms of those programs that may be closer to Phase 3, that's a little harder to speculate on I think KRAS program, the MCL-1 programs and some of the BiTEs in the \u2013 the BCMA BiTEs in the early portfolio can transition to potential registration quality trials. I wouldn't necessarily use the Phase 3 nomenclature here. Again, all of that will be driven by emerging data.","Murdo Gordon","I think Geoff, if you look at the oncology portfolio, just that segment alone, I think we're expecting report results on seven of these assets during the course of 2019. So this will be an active year for us to share data with all of you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","Good evening. Congratulations on nice results and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, just like my peers, I'm trying to kind of work through the ups and downs of the guidance. So really two questions there, first, when we think about additional Sensipar competition, when is the earliest in your \u2013 low case you simply could comment it, is it midyear or is it even earlier than that just based on the timing of the trial?","And second, if we look at Aimovig, you kind of mentioned that you have higher paid prescriptions. I was wondering if you can give us a feel for where the pricing might and on the contract, I think David mentioned something between 4K and 4.5K as that kind of like the prevailing price when the market settles down. Is that roughly around what you guys think would wind up or is that range going to be higher than that?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Why don't we do it in two parts? David, why don\u2019t you address Sensipar?","David Meline","Yes. So in terms of if you look at the guidance that we provided, which as I said is a wider range than traditionally we would have, the primary driver of that increase in range of course is the uncertainty on Sensipar. And as to your question specifically, what we're anticipating now is that the litigation that's presently underway would conclude by around midyear. And that's how we're reflecting one of the scenarios in guidance to reflect that scenario.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. On Aimovig, I think I answered most of this before. And rather than give a price specific guidance on the product, I would say that we're pleased with how we've contracted for access so far, it is a competitive category. And then the other variable that we have to think about is the percentage of our prescriptions to get filled as paid prescription versus free goods.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.","Michael Yee","Thanks. Good afternoon. A question for Bob. In the past you've talked about various degrees of appetite for M&A, we've talked about overcapacity industry. Maybe you could just revisit your thoughts around the degree of appetite and more importantly, I'm sure you're aware of the various industry chatter about mega-mergers and where Amgen\u2019s view is on mega-mergers. So maybe just comment about that and to what degree you can knock that for people? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Sure. Michael, I think our view on this has been consistent now for a while, which is we're looking at opportunities to invest in the business, our focus is on innovation. We're likely to look most closely in those areas where we feel we can add value and create value for our shareholders. So that would imply the therapeutic areas that we're focused on. We do think there will be opportunities. We think we have the flexibility to look at those, the balance sheet and the management resources, if you look at those transactions and with stocks down considerably from where they were a year ago.","I would expect that we will continue to look and look across the waterfront of smaller and larger deals. Obviously there are more smaller ones than large ones, so we tend to spend more of our time looking at those. But we're consistent with what we said now for a while. We're looking across the waterfront to find ways to invest in the industry in ways that we think we can add value for our shareholders, not just the target shareholders.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much. David, you spent quite a bit of time talking about the last five years. And I just would like you to give us some sense of your outlook for the next five years. I'm sure you have a very detailed operating plan in place already, but many of the trends that have been highlighted on this call and your guidance have been coming for some time, Neulasta, Sensipar, et cetera. So could you give us a sense of how long it might be before you see the current R&D portfolio of providing enough opportunity to offset what's likely to be several years of erosion of these very successful legacy products?","David Meline","Sure. So, yes, I'm trying to think of how to frame the answer to the question, Geoff. So certainly what we see now, and if I look as an example, the performance in the fourth quarter or even the full year in 2018, where we have had and we continue to see increasing competition against our legacy products, we were quite pleased to see that our global volume growth last quarter was 10%, and for the company in 2018 was 5% volume growth.","So that gives us some positive confidence as we look at the existing portfolio of products that are in the market right now, that they are going to provide very strong and stable growth, which will help us to offset the impact of our legacy declines. What's also true this year is we have an increasing portfolio of our own biologics \u2013 biosimilars in the market, which are also going to support growth for the company.","And then finally, as you're asking about what about the emerging portfolio, both of our late stage trials of products that are more in Phase 3 already and the emerging oncology portfolio. Quite frankly, it's a little bit early, notwithstanding you\u2019re giving me credit for a lot of detail, it's a little imprecise right now, especially on these earlier stage products. But we are encouraged by the speed at which they're coming forward, and certainly in the oncology area, these products have a chance to impact quite quickly as compared to in some of the other therapeutic areas. So that's the best I can offer you.","Bob Bradway","Yes, I think I'd reiterate, Geoff, what we've said in a variety of different ways, which is we think we're well positioned now to deliver in our long-term growth aspirations. So look forward to doing just that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I actually had a question for David and David. So, first one was on, and they can pick whichever one.","David Meline","Okay.","Umer Raffat","The first one was on operating margin. And my question really was not so much looking for guidance, but I'm hoping to understand \u2013 is there \u2013 as we enter \u2013 as revenues grow in future, would you expect the dollar OpEx to grow slower than that. That was the first.","And the second one is, KRAS is something, and I think some of your comments at a few conferences in the last few weeks have generated a lot of investor interest. So my question is from these early scans in this relatively new trial, what are you seeing on the G12C, and would you think of this drug as a potentially best-in-class? Thank you very much.","David Meline","Yes. So in terms of, Umer, operating expenses and trends there, what I would say is a couple of things. One is, as we know, we put the company in a really nice position in terms of our financial performance based on the work that we've done over these last several years and we enter the period in 2019 with a quite a lean cost structure. What's also true is I mentioned in my comments, the good news is, is there's always more opportunities, the business changes, we see that there's more productivity to be had, and we think that'll be an important source of financial flexibility to allow us to continue to invest going forward. And I talked about the trends that we expect in the different categories this year.","I think your longer term question, which is do we expect that in the context of a growing revenue base that we're going to get leverage off of that revenue vis-\u00e0-vis our expenses. I would say that\u2019s certainly we'd be committed to that type of performance for the company through time. And I would say as we move into the future, we'll be able to give you some more specifics as to how we're thinking about that.","David Reese","Yes. And regards to the KRAS question, as you know, this has been a Holy Grail target for 35 years or 40 years now. We are very happy to be first in the clinic. We are moving briskly through the Phase 1 dose escalation. We expect to be able to share hopefully by mid-year initial results from that first-in-human trial in terms of best-in-class. We're really only right now in terms of where we are in dose escalation. Ultimately, everything will depend on clinical date. I don't think it's really helpful to speculate much beyond that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to clarify a couple of things on just the Neulasta guidance. So first of all, is Onpro protecting you at all? I know Meline said that they have 18% to 20% share in the injectable market. And going with that, do you \u2013 how much insight, how much comfort do you think you really have into the two generics that are on the market right now and their impact on 2019? Meaning is that like, is the range a little bit less than what you're saying that you described with Sensipar for your guidance? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. Robyn, let me try to go over some of the things that we are seeing with Neulasta. As we expected at the end of last year, we saw an additional long acting biosimilar approved and we have so far seeing their actions in the market as consistent with what we had expected. We are seeing very good uptake of Onpro, we are over 60% penetrated now with Onpro across our business.","And we would anticipate that differentiated offering of having both Onpro and our other formulation that we will be able to drive some differentiation with institutions, clinics and providers. And so that that is indeed the differentiated strategy that we'll pursue going forward; however, given that we are going to have now two long acting biosimilars and we're assuming that there's a potential for additional before the end of the year, we would expect to see some share erosion in 2019.","Bob Bradway","Let me add. If you look, it comes back a bit. I think your question to the guidance and how broad it is. And as I said earlier, Robyn, the primary driver of that additional guidance range is, of course Sensipar. But I think it's fair to say that there are other factors embedded there. So if not for Sensipar, perhaps our guidance would have been a little bit broader than traditionally would be the case, including the uncertainties around the path for path for Neulasta which is obviously an important product for us.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov JP Morgan.","Cory Kasimov","A good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask about when you have \u2013 you might expect an initial verdict from the litigation around Enbrel's IP? And can you walk us through the potential scenarios that you see there?","David Meline","Well, Cory, as you point out in your question, we were in the District Court, defending the intellectual property around Enbrel. We feel good about the intellectual property surrounding Enbrel, but the district court needs to render a judgment and we think that'll happen at some point later this quarter. And then obviously \u2013 or could even be later than that, Cory. But then, obviously whatever the decision is and I will remind you that Sandoz has agreed they infringed. So the question is whether the IP is valid, and whatever the decision on trees and expect that there will be appeals. So this process will run on now for a little while, I just suspect.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Alethia Young","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just one on EVENITY, if it happens to be approved, I guess have your perspectives or views changed on what the potential market opportunity. And then just one quick one on Enbrel, I see that the quarter-over-quarter trends have been fairly stable. I'm just wondering if we should think about kind of the trends over the next couple quarters in 2019. Should they be stable as well? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon","Maybe I'll start with Enbrel. I would say that we've \u2013 we have seen stability in Enbrel both in share performance as well as a price evolution. And I think that those \u2013 both of those will continue to be stable going into the new year at least over the foreseeable few quarters. And then on EVENITY, we continue to see EVENITY as a really good compliment to our overall focus on bone health and with the approval in Japan for high risk patients. The FDA decision with the ad-com, most of that is consistent with what we had planned for the product and how it would be positioned in the market. But however, there's still a lot of work and discussions still to have with the FDA.","Operator","And our next question is from line of Kennen Mackay from RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen Mackay","Hi, thanks for taking the question. David, on the biosimilar franchise, you mentioned you've done the Phase 3 study on biosimilars formularies. Can you confirm that you've enrolled patients into that study? And if so was the team waiting on any gating factors prior to moving ahead with that trial?","David Meline","Yes. I can confirm that we're screening patients, we expect enrollment to begin anytime now. The launch of the trial was really predicated on regulatory discussions that we have around the world to agree on the appropriate design, endpoints and approvability.","Bob Bradway","I think the other thing, maybe I'll add Kennan on those, we think we're pretty good shape here we think we're excited to run the trial and establish biosimilarity safety and efficacy and with the recent patent decision in Europe in our favor. We're looking forward to having those data seeking registration and beginning to serve patients.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho.","Salim Syed","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. On \u2013 one on just Repatha, the lower price SKU. So when you're looking at your percentage of revenues coming from that lower price SKU, could you give us the payer split in the Medicare, Medicaid and from commercials, is it anywhere close to the natural distribution that you put out when you have the call in October? Thank you.","Murdo Gordon","Yes, thanks Salim It's actually right now of total units that were sent \u2013 that we're selling. It's over 25% and it's roughly a 43% of Medicare lives that have coverage. And it does skew a little more to Medicare than it does commercial at this point in time. But it's evolving fairly rapidly and as I wouldn't say that steady state by any stretch.","Arvind Sood","As a 6:15 on the East Coast, why don't we take two more questions please?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from line of Philip Nadeau from Cowen & Company.","Philip Nadeau","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the overall pricing dynamics. David in the prepared remarks, you that pricing was going to decline mid single digits in 2019, that's versus 1% in 2018. Can you discuss what you expect longer term on pricing? Is 2019 the new normal are there some elements in 2019 due to the competitive product launches and price cuts, they will make that a more senior for net pricing then we should expect in the future. Thanks.","David Meline","Yeah. So we wanted to communicate the outlook for a net price for 2019, then I guess what I would say is that from a macro perspective in the U.S market, I think we've been quite consistent in expecting that we would see more pressure on price, combination of increasing intensity of competition. The concerns about affordability that are expressed and \u2013 in the regulatory and political environment. And then I would say in addition of that for us specifically in 19, as Murdo commented, there's some specific cases where we have products that are either facing new competition in their post exclusivity period or other factors that are impacting pricing.","So I wouldn't draw a conclusion that that's a new permanent level of price performance for Amgen, but I would say that it is fair to assume and we'd been assuming a tougher pricing environment, which is why we've gone about putting ourselves in a very competitive position from a efficiency and cost perspective and why we continue to be very careful in terms of making sure we're going after new pipeline products that really change the standard-of-care because those are the products where we'll be able to get a return going forward.","Arvind Sood","And let's take one last question after which Bob will make some concluding comments.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Okay, if there are no further questions. Bob, do you want to make some closing comments?","Bob Bradway","Sure. Thank you all again for dialing into our fourth quarter call. We're excited about the outlook for the future. I hope by now we've established with you and our shareholders as I know we have with our staff, a good track record of delivering against our financial commitments. And we look forward to doing that again this year. With the actions that we've taken to transform the company, we think we're well positioned to deliver our long-term growth aspirations. And we're encouraged, as you've heard us say in this Q&A, about the momentum that we see for our newer products and the pipeline of differentiated first-in-class molecules that we\u2019re rapidly advancing.","So with our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we expect to continue to invest in this business, and to deliver return for our shareholders. So thanks for joining and we'll look forward to talking to you again in April. And of course, in the meantime, Arvind and his team are here to take any questions, if you didn't get a chance to ask them on the call.","Arvind Sood","Thank you everybody."],"2255":["Amgen Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Okay. Thank you, Ian. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. So we have a lot of ground to cover, so I'll keep my comments very brief. I'd like to begin by acknowledging those who are new in their coverage of our company with the most recent being Geoff Meacham, who's now with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. I also want to correct an oversight on my part from our Q2 call, as I inadvertently forgot to acknowledge Evan Seigerman of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, who initiated back in the second quarter. A warm welcome to both Evan and Geoff.","Okay. So on to our Q3 results. Continued execution on our strategy, launch progress and pipeline advancement are some key themes that come to mind as I think about our third quarter results. To discuss these in some detail, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO. After Bob's comments, our CFO, David Meline will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated guidance for 2019. Our Head of Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon will then review our product performance followed by Dave Reese, our Head of R&D, who will provide a pipeline update.","We'll use slides to guide our discussion today and a link to those slides we\u2019ll sent separately. Just a reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of those statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you, Arvind and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin the call today with some comments about our third quarter performance while also touching on the industry environment and how we're responding to it strategically.","Several years ago, we realized the need to transform certain aspects of our business to stay ahead of the curve and position ourselves for a sustained long-term growth. Anticipating pressure on drug pricing for example, we emphasized the importance of innovative medicines that can grow over time through volume and access increases. And that's what we're seeing again in the third quarter from brands like Prolia, Repatha and Aimovig, generating double-digit volume increases.","It's not just these brands that are exhibiting volume growth. A number of our specialty products including Parsabiv, KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO also registered double-digit volume increases and in aggregate for our portfolio, this is the seventh quarter in a row that we've reported volume growth globally. We think that bodes well for our long-term outlook.","As you're aware, drug prices have indeed come under pressure. In the U.S. for the first time in more than 40 years, as the Council of Economic Advisers recently reported, CPI prescription drug index actually declined over the previous 12 months by 0.7%. This broad price decrease in 2019 is consistent with our own experience.","Against this backdrop, a flow of innovative medicines that address major unmet medical needs will be more important than ever. As Dave Reese will discuss in a moment, we're excited about our pipeline and we're investing to rapidly advance it. Thanks to a set of productivity capabilities embedded throughout our organization, we've been able to increase our R&D spending this year, up 8% in the third quarter while keeping overall expenses flat.","We've been especially focused on building differentiated capabilities in Discovery Research. For example, we think recent collaborations with the U.K. Biobank and Intermountain Healthcare will enable us to extend our industry-leading human genetics capabilities.","Over time, we expect a better understanding of human genetics will enable us to dramatically improve both R&D cycle times and success rates. And with our Nuevolution deal completed earlier this year, we're positioning Amgen for what we anticipate will be a new era of multi-specific drug development, focusing initially on targeted protein degradation.","We've made a strategic decision several years ago to build a branded biosimilars business, leveraging our world-class Biologics development and manufacturing capabilities. Our first three biosimilars AMGEVITA, KANJINTI and MVASI, generated about $173 million in the third quarter and are annualizing at approximately $700 million. We expect our growing portfolio of reliable, high-quality biosimilars to be an important growth opportunity for us in the years ahead.","The demand for quality health care is growing globally and this has led us to steadily expand our geographic presence. In the third quarter our product sales outside the U.S. grew by 15% with volume growth of 23%. We expect sales outside the U.S. to account for an increasing percentage of our total product revenues over time.","We're excited for example to have recently launched Repatha in China, our first product entry into the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market. We expect this to become an important market for us through time just as we can now see Japan emerging as an important new opportunity for us.","In 2020, we look forward to assuming full ownership of our very successful collaboration with Astellas in Japan, the world's third-largest pharma market. We think our portfolio of product is well suited to the needs of an aging population in China and Japan, particularly.","And finally, let me reiterate that we're excited about our planned acquisition of Otezla, as announced in August. Amgen has been a leader in the treatment of inflammatory diseases for decades. With Enbrel, our recent launch of AMGEVITA in Europe, pipeline opportunities like tezepelumab, Otezla will significantly strengthen our inflammation portfolio. It will also enhance our geographic presence as we're acquiring global rights to the product, which is approved in more than 50 markets worldwide.","We expect the Otezla acquisition to close before the end of the fourth quarter giving us an asset that will add to our long-term growth. Of course, we look forward to welcoming the Otezla team to Amgen. Our capital allocation priorities remain intact. We'll continue to invest in the growth of our business internally and through business development aligned with our stated strategy while also providing attractive returns to our shareholders, through our growing dividend and continued share repurchases.","Before I turn the call over to David, let me just note that I'll say a few words about him and his planned retirement at the end of our call. David over to you.","David Meline","Okay. Thanks, Bob. Overall, we're pleased with the strong performance in the third quarter as investments in support of our newer products continued to deliver volume-driven growth including over 20% in our ex U.S. markets enabling stable performance again this quarter.","Turning to the financial results in page 6 of the slide deck. Worldwide revenues at $5.7 billion, declined 3% year-over-year. Worldwide product sales at $5.5 billion, declined 1% year-over-year as growth for our newer products was slightly outpaced by declines in our mature brands impacted by increasing competition due to patent expirations. Other revenues declined $120 million year-over-year, due to a prior year milestone payment. We expect full year other revenues of between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion.","Non-GAAP operating income of $2.8 billion declined 6% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 51% for the third quarter as we continue to make incremental investments in our products and pipeline to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. Consistent with prior guidance, third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year. We expect full year 2019 operating expenses on an absolute basis to be up slightly versus 2018.","As a reminder, we expect to see a 15% increase in non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 versus Q3, reflecting the typical pattern for the business. On a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales was flat year-over-year at 13.9%. We continue to anticipate 2019 full year cost of sales on an absolute basis to be slightly up based on volume growth reflecting our industry-leading manufacturing capability.","As you begin to model 2020 financials, note that we expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be generally consistent with 2019. Third quarter research and development expenses of $977 million were 8% higher year-over-year due to increased investments in support of our early- and late-stage oncology programs. Research and development expenses as a percent of product sales was 17.9%.","For the full year 2019, we continue to expect the R&D spend trajectory on an absolute basis to increase by a high single-digit percentage as our pipeline advances. As communicated in our August call, we highlighted that we expect 2020 R&D investment to increase by about $500 million as we invest in our innovative pipeline programs and new Otezla indications.","SG&A expenses decreased 5% on a year-over-year basis in Q3 driven primarily by reduced general and administrative expenses and productivity efforts. We expect that for the full year SG&A expense on an absolute basis will decline year-over-year.","With regard to 2020 in addition to the $600 million to $700 million increase related to the Otezla acquisition, we also expect SG&A expense for the base business to increase modestly year-over-year as we continue to expand our international business including China and Japan, grow our biosimilar business and begin product launch preparation for advancing innovative oncology and nononcology pipelines. These investments will exceed the benefits of our 2020 productivity initiatives.","Other income and expenses were a net $199 million expense in Q3. This is favorable by $23 million on a year-over-year basis. We expect full year 2019 expense of about $675 million. Looking ahead to 2020, we expect OI&E net expense to increase reflecting a cash drawdown for the Otezla acquisition.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 15.2% for the quarter, a 2.2 point increases versus the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to a prior year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP net income decreased 8% and non-GAAP earnings per share decreased 1% year-over-year for the third quarter to $3.66 per share.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2019 was $3.2 billion. This was in line with the results from the third quarter last year of $3.1 billion. Consistent with our principles, we continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders.","In Q3, we deployed $1.2 billion to repurchase 6.2 million shares at an average price of $188 per share. We plan to repurchase an incremental $1 billion to $1.5 billion of our shares in Q4. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1.45 per share an increase of 10% over last year.","Cash and investments totaled $20.9 billion, a decrease of approximately $9 billion from the third quarter of last year, primarily due to share repurchases and debt repayments. Our debt balance stands at $29.8 billion as of September 30, a reduction of $4.6 billion from a year ago as we paid down maturing debt.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2019 on page 8. We remain on track with our plans to deliver solid results while investing for the future. With regard to our updated outlook for 2019 revenue, we're increasing our revenue guidance to $22.8 billion to $23 billion from our prior range of $22.4 billion to $24.9 billion. This reflects solid revenue performance as well as ongoing competitive dynamics associated with Neulasta and other legacy products.","We're also increasing our 2019 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $14.20 to $14.45 per share from the previous $13.75 to $14.30. In terms of the non-GAAP tax rate, our 2019 guidance range of 14% to 15% is unchanged. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $650 million this year.","Note that our guidance excludes the impact of the Otezla acquisition, which we expect to close by year-end. As we approach the end of 2019, we're pleased with our progress again this year. As is customary, we will provide full 2020 guidance on our January call.","This concludes the financial update. I now I'll turn the call over to Murdo.","Murdo Gordon","Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. Find product sales information starting on slide 10. In the third quarter, volumes grew by 3% year-over-year, which represents, as Bob mentioned, the seventh consecutive quarter of volume growth. Net selling prices declined 4% year-over-year, resulting in reported net sales declining by 1%. We have a stable outlook for our base business in 2020 and with the anticipated addition of Otezla, we expect revenue growth next year.","Now let me share some product details starting with Prolia on slide 12. Prolia delivered another strong quarter with 18% growth year-over-year, driven by volume coming from increasing rates of new patient growth as well as strong repeat rates. Recall that Prolia experiences consistent seasonal trends.","The launch of EVENITY which has been recognized by the osteoporosis community as a highly innovative therapy is off to a solid start as sales more than doubled sequentially. Worldwide 8.9 million fractures due to osteoporosis occur each year. That's a fracture every three seconds.","In the U.S., there are approximately 2 million patients who have had an osteoporosis-related fracture and are at greatest risk of having another fracture within the next one to two years. We believe EVENITY is an important option to offer these patients.","Within the U.S., we've received a permanent reimbursement J-code, which should facilitate uptake. In Japan, which currently represents the majority of EVENITY sales, uptake has been very encouraging. EVENITY creates a solid foundation in Japan upon which we anticipate adding Otezla and that will give us an ability to deliver on our international expansion strategy.","Next on to Repatha on slide 14. Q3 sales grew by 40% year-over-year, as we continue to be the market leader of the PCSK9 Class. Worldwide unit growth was 87% year-over-year driven by the U.S. New-to-brand U.S. prescriptions are steadily improving, growing at 58% year-over-year.","Although, we're pleased with the growing use of Repatha in helping to lower LDL cholesterol, the fact still remains that cardiovascular disease is much too common in our society today. Every year 30 million people globally will suffer a heart attack or a stroke.","Approximately seven out of 10 adults in the U.S. with cardiovascular disease have elevated LDL-C despite optimal lipid-lowering treatment. The importance of lowering LDL-C levels as a means to lower the risk of cardiovascular event in high-risk adults is increasingly recognized by professional cardiology societies, including the American Heart Association, the American Oncology Cardiology and most recently, the European Society of Cardiology which now recommends LDL-C levels of less than 55 milligrams per deciliter in high-risk patients and less than 40 milligrams per deciliter in patients with two prior cardiovascular events.","PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha can play a critical role in helping patients achieve their cholesterol-lowering objective. Removing barriers for PCSK9 use is an important factor in ensuring this health crisis is effectively addressed.","In the U.S., we're pleased that access is improving. A 72% of commercial plans now require physician attestation only and that's up from just 23% last year. Additionally, more plans are removing specialty pharmacy mandates, moving Repatha to more accessible retail pharmacies, which now fill a majority of Repatha prescriptions. Overall, in the U.S., commercial approval rates increased from 39% to 59% and the abandonment rate for Medicare patients has improved meaningfully.","Affordability is a concern for Medicare patients and in 2020 approximately half of all Medicare patients who are prescribed Repatha will have an affordable co-pay of less than $50. Although, the blended net price of Repatha in the U.S. declined in Q3, 2019 versus the previous year, partly due to contracting for better access and partly with the advent of the lower-list-price Repatha, net selling price was relatively stable sequentially. With lower-list-price Repatha now representing over 50% of total prescriptions, the original list price SKU will no longer be available for sale effective December 31 of 2019.","Now on to Aimovig on slide 15. On a quarter-over-quarter basis unit volume grew 12%, although reported net sales declined by 20%, primarily due to $19 million of unfavorable changes in accounting estimates for sales discounts in prior periods. These adjustments result from a higher proportion of our paid business coming from the lower-priced Medicaid population than initially anticipated.","As a reminder, we reported $20 million of favorable changes in accounting estimates in Q4 of 2018, demonstrating the impact on net price of early variability and source of business. Considering there are 4 million migraine patients in the U.S. who are eligible for CGRP treatment, Aimovig has significant potential remaining to penetrate this market.","Each week approximately 7,000 patient starts a CGRP therapy and to date more than 260,000 patients have been prescribed Aimovig. Additionally, the number of prescribers is consistently increasing as more than 30,000 physicians have now prescribed Aimovig since launch, including 10,000 primary care prescribers. Aimovig is the market leader with 50% of total prescriptions exiting Q3.","Regarding pricing, we're pleased to see the transition of patients from our free drug program to paid demand is progressing nicely increasing from 74% in Q2 to 81% at the end of Q3. Additionally, our recent agreement with CVS Caremark rounds out our strong access position going into 2020.","Moving to our hematology and oncology business. The portfolio of six brands collectively totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing again by double digits at 12% on a year-over-year basis. As for some of the larger brands within this portfolio, XGEVA grew 10% in Q3 year-over-year, driven by volume. As a reminder the NCCN guidelines recognize XGEVA with preferred status over zoledronic acid in castration-resistant prostate cancer, reinforcing XGEVA's superiority in this indication.","KYPROLIS grew 15% year-on-year, driven primarily by 12% volume growth with the breadth of prescribers continuing to increase. We continue to invest behind KYPROLIS and add to the growing body of clinical evidence demonstrating KYPROLIS' important role in the treatment of multiple myeloma, as the recent results of the CANDOR study indicate. And you'll hear more on this from Dave Reese.","Moving on to Enbrel. Sales increased 6% year-over-year, driven by increases in net selling price and changes in accounting estimates offset by unit volume declines of 2% due to continued competition. Q3 results included a benefit of approximately $60 million in changes in accounting estimates related to sales discounts.","We're making investments in Enbrel including the ENBREL Mini with AutoTouch device, a multi-use product, which continues to receive positive feedback from rheumatoid arthritis patients. Overall, we expect volume trends to continue while we anticipate a modest benefit from net selling price on a full year basis in 2019.","We're investing substantially behind our inflammation portfolio, which has been strengthened by the reaffirmation of Enbrel's intellectual property; our pending addition of Otezla; our biosimilars of AMGEVITA and ABP 710, which is our biosimilar to REMICADE; the potential of tezepelumab for asthma as well as a number of other assets that are earlier in the R&D pipeline.","Now on to some of our more mature brands on slide 20. In Q3, Neulasta sales declined 32% year-over-year with a 31% decline in the U.S. Exit share of Neulasta in the U.S. was comparable to Q2 just under 80% in the long-acting segment with Onpro unit volume declining slightly on a sequential basis.","We're encouraged by how well Onpro has performed so far demonstrating the confidence that our customers have in the reliability and quality of our supply along with our broader commercial services. We anticipate that additional competitors could launch in the U.S. sometime in the future, but the timing is uncertain reflecting the complexity of developing and manufacturing molecules in the space.","Looking forward recall that Q4 of 2018 benefited from a $55 million BARDA order that we do not anticipate repeating this quarter. Finally, outside of the U.S., Neulasta declined 40% due to increasing competition.","Switching to nephrology starting on slide 21. Q3 EPOGEN sales declined 15% due to lower net selling price, which is a function of our contractual pricing commitments with DaVita. Meanwhile Aranesp declined 5% year-over-year in Q3 driven by lower volume due to increased competition. We expect Aranesp sales to continue to decline at a faster rate with both long-acting and short-acting competition in the U.S.","Turning to Sensipar on slide 23. As a result of some at-risk generic launches year-over-year sales declined 73% to $109 million for the quarter. Given the ongoing legal proceedings there remains an uncertainty about the magnitude of future U.S. Sensipar sales.","Parsabiv grew by 54% in the third quarter. As a reminder, independent and midsized dialysis providers already utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcimimetic patients while FMC and DaVita are slowly increasing adoption. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, trends were impacted by purchasing patterns, which included a larger purchase in Q2.","Our biosimilars recorded sales of $173 million in Q3 and are noted on slide 25. Our biosimilar strategy continues to come to fruition with two successful launches in Europe and two recent launches in the U.S. Our global sales are already annualizing at approximately $700 million with adoption of KANJINTI and MVASI in the U.S. and continued growth of KANJINTI and AMGEVITA outside the U.S. The uptake is a result of customers recognizing the quality and importance of Amgen's supply chain as well as our commercial capabilities and services.","Our experience in commercializing innovative products along with our established presence in existing commercial resources in these therapeutic areas provides us with a productive operating model. These factors help to reduce costs to the health care system, while also generating a return for shareholders.","When looking at factors for success in the U.S. in terms of access, we have attained coverage in the majority of national commercial accounts and are making good progress in Medicare accounts. As of Q4, we've received reimbursement codes for both KANJINTI and MVASI and believe this will be a catalyst for further uptake.","When looking at prescribers, we're seen very encouraging adoption rates in the clinic segment while non-340B hospitals adoption is showing signs of acceleration. Outside the U.S., we continue to see important differences between products and markets in terms of uptake in price erosion. Some markets are experiencing strong uptake at more discounted pricing levels, while other larger markets, including Germany and France exhibit a more balanced and sustainable opportunity.","Here again, we're able to leverage our expertise and footprint in oncology, while AMGEVITA will benefit from and synergize nicely with the addition of Otezla. In summary, we plan to continue to drive volume uptake of our more recently launched products, while defending our mature brands to deliver better outcomes for patients and the health care system.","Now let me turn over to Dave Reese.","Dave Reese","Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon everyone. As we've previously discussed, our key strategic priorities in R&D include increasing our success rates, improving our speed to market and ensuring access and use for our innovative products. A core component of this strategy is to the use of human genetics and allied genomic and proteomic technologies.","Following on our collaboration with Intermountain Health disclosed last quarter, we're pleased to announce that we joined a public-private consortium to complete the whole genome sequencing of nearly 0.5 million individuals in the U.K. Biobank. deCODE with the Wellcome Sanger Institute will perform sequencing to rapidly generate data in this most ambitious whole genome project to-date. We believe in the power of human genetics to transform medicine, have built an industry-leading platform and anticipate well over two million participants in our databases at the conclusion of these products projects.","In inflammation, our collaboration with AstraZeneca on tezepelumab continues to advance. Enrollment in our Phase 3 study in adults and adolescents with severe uncontrolled asthma has completed and we expect the primary analysis in late 2020. We also recently began enrolling patients in the Phase 2 study of tezepelumab for the treatment of COPD and we continue to accrue patients on our Phase 2 atopic dermatitis study.","Also in inflammation, we're enrolling patients in the Phase 2 study of AMG 570 for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus or SLB. AMG 570 is a first-in-class bispecific antibody-peptide conjugate that targets ICOS ligand, which modulates T cell function and B cell-activating factor or BAFF. These two inflammatory mediators are elevated in SLE -- for patients suffering from this disease.","Finally, we continue to enroll proof-of-concept studies with AMG 592, our IL-2 mutein designed to enhance regulatory T cell function in autoimmune diseases and we expect data from these trials beginning in 2020.","In bone health, we were pleased that the CHMP issued a positive opinion for EVENITY in the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high-risk of fracture and with no history of myocardial infarction or stroke. This is an important step and along with our partner UCB, we look forward to the European Commission's final decision later this year.","Working closely with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan, EVENITY's prescribing information was updated by making the potential cardiovascular risk more prominent and adding information to help ensure its proper use.","Turning to oncology. I'll begin with AMG 510, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. We have the opportunity to present data from 76 patients in our first in-human monotherapy study at the World Lung and ESMO conferences where we reported responses in multiple tumor types with no dose-limiting toxicity.","In our monotherapy program, our Phase 2 study in non-small cell lung cancer continues to enroll briskly since initiation in August. We have also rapidly enrolled an initial Phase 2 cohort of colorectal cancer patients at the target dose and as the data mature, we will determine the development path in colorectal cancer.","We are also moving forward with a suite of Phase 1b combination studies including PD-1 MEK and other targeted therapies. Our next clinical update will be in 2020, when we have accumulated a meaningful amount of data from these Phase 2 and combination studies.","In our BiTE development program, two BLINCYTO Phase 3 studies in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at first relapse were stopped early due to the treatment benefit of BLINCYTO when substituted for a portion of the standard chemotherapy blocks. These results have the potential to be practice changing since patients with high-risk relapsed ALL have a poor prognosis with standard therapeutic approaches.","Later this year, we will be presenting data on AMG 673, a half-life extended BiTE molecule targeting CD33 and AML; AMG 596 directed against EGFRviii in glioblastoma; and we anticipate data for AMG 701, our half-life extended BCMA BiTE molecule next year.","In the KYPROLIS program as Murdo mentioned, the Phase 3 CANDOR study investigated KYPROLIS, dexamethasone and Darzalex KdD versus the KYPROLIS-dexamethasone doublet in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The study met its primary progression-free survival or PFS end point with KdD, reducing the risk of progression or death by 37% compared to KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone alone.","The median PFS for KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone was 15.8 months while the median PFS for KdD was not yet reached. These data demonstrate that these two potent therapies can be effectively combined and may provide a potential treatment option for patients who have relapsed but need a Revlimid sparing regimen. We look forward to discussing these results with regulators.","In hematology, FDA approved and updated indication for Nplate that expands treatment to newly diagnosed and persistent adult patients with ITP who've had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy. We have also begun enrolling a Phase 3 Nplate study for the treatment of chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia.","Before leaving our therapeutic areas, I'd like to say a few words about the decision we've made to reshape our neuroscience research efforts. We believe that in order to compete effectively, we need to make investments in the areas and platforms that will position us for long-term success.","Upon careful evaluation of our pipeline and the challenges inherent in developing drugs for major neurologic diseases, we've made the decision to end our neuroscience research and early development programs with the exception of programs centered on neuro inflammation that will be pursued by our inflammation TA.","This was a very difficult decision and we know it will be a disappointment for our staff and the scientific community. Over the years, many people at Amgen have devoted time and energy toward developing medicines for patients with neurologic conditions and I'd like to thank and acknowledge them for their efforts.","In particular bringing Aimovig to migraine patients is the first and innovative new class of medicines with a tremendous achievement. Aimovig is making a meaningful impact on the lives of migraine patients around the world and we will continue to actively support the program including ongoing clinical development.","At the same time, we're exploring other models to capitalize on our generics capability and advance our broader efforts in neuroscience and we'll provide guidance on those activities in the future.","Let me conclude with a quick update on biosimilars. Our Phase 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma study of ABP 798, our biosimilar Rituxan has successfully completed and we expect to submit a BLA in the U.S. in Q1, 2020. And finally the FDA review of ABP 710, our biosimilar Remicade continues to progress towards the PDUFA target action date in December. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you, David. Let's turn over now Ian to you and perhaps you can open up the lines for questions and remind our callers of the procedures that will follow. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny?","Ronny Gal","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I'd like to start actually with the last comment you made about ending neuroscience. I'm sure it was a difficult decision and a lot of us are following it through other companies and we've seen some really interesting breakthroughs, especially when it comes to nucleic acid-based medicine. Can you talk a little bit about that decision your decision? The other option, obviously, was to double down and go even more innovative. What drove that decision in terms of your thinking? And if you can like coach it in terms of how you feel about the neurology market and what it takes to succeed that will be great.","Bob Bradway","Yeah. Dave, why don't you take a shot at that and I'll offer any thoughts at the back end.","Dave Reese","Yeah Ronny, so this was a very difficult decision. And as you pointed out there are new therapies becoming available, some of them nucleic acid-based. Many of those I think are targeted at orphan or niche diseases. And consistent with our desire to generally target diseases with a large public health impact based on what we felt was the state of the art in terms of understanding the pathogenesis of major diseases especially neurodegenerative diseases and our overall portfolio, we made that decision to end our early neuroscience research efforts.","As I mentioned, we are looking at ways to maintain a hand in neuroscience through alternative models and we'll discuss some of that in the future. We believe that genetics will ultimately drive progress in this area and we'll continue to work with deCODE to generate insights. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Yeah, I would just add Ronny just on the last point that half the genes in the body are expressed in the brain and only the brain and we think we have some unique resources to try to capitalize on insights around that. And as Dave suggested, we'll be exploring potentially different models for doing that with venture capital and perhaps academic institutions as well.","And I think more broadly we're focusing our efforts on where we think we can be successful. So we're focused as you know in cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease and -- cardiovascular disease, oncology of course. So those are the areas that we're focused on and expect to be successful advancing molecules in those areas over the coming years.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Do Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Do?","Do Kim","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about Otezla, as you look past the closing of the Otezla acquisition, how do you think about the disruption \u2013 potential disruption to the ongoing commercial operations of Otezla? And how long it will take to fully onboard the drug and its components?","Murdo Gordon","Yeah. Thanks, Do. It's Murdo here. We've met with our potential future colleagues several times now around the world at different forms. We met at a few old staffs in town halls. We've extended conditional offers of employment, and we're really pleased by the uptake there. From Japan to the U.S. and the rest of the world, we see an eager highly engaged workforce that's very interested in joining Amgen. So, I would say that, we expect minimal disruption, if any to ongoing operations. I mean, we did set patient continuity as our north star in this integration, and everybody has been very focused on following that.","Do Kim","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Chris?","Chris Raymond","Yeah. Thanks. Just on the Repatha pricing I know you announced a while back that you're phasing out the higher-priced SKU beginning in next year. But it's been I think just over a year, I guess since you announced this move to have the dual SKUs. And it looks like so far this transition has been a pretty decent success. I mean, looking at numbers they're relatively stable in the U.S. So, I guess I'm just wondering, if commercially, if there have been some learnings from this conversion and actually in this move that can be applied maybe to other areas or perhaps there's like a healthy distributor margin where high-list price perhaps can impact Medicare patient access. Thanks.","Murdo Gordon","Yeah. Chris, if I understand your question correctly you're looking to see if there's any lessons learned apply to other products.","Chris Raymond","Other therapeutic areas, yes.","Murdo Gordon","Yeah, its in the specialty category. Look, I think lessons have already been learned from Repatha. I think we've applied them to the launch of Aimovig and how we priced that product. I think that that's been a major reason for why patients have been able to access Aimovig at relatively affordable co-pay levels. I'm also pleased with the progress, we've made in the commercial side with Repatha. I think where it's less clear to us and it's still an area of work in progress is how we are advancing the evolution of access to Repatha at a fixed co-pay-preferred tier benefit in Medicare Part D. We're happy that we're going to go into next year with roughly half of the lives in Medicare Part D being able to access Repatha at an affordable less than $50 co-pay, but we think that number should be much higher.","And we think that national plans and PBMs should be moving to add Repatha as a preferred benefit. So it's a very fragmented health care system with a lot of different actors in the supply chain, and I think that improvements can be made. And we along with other companies in our industry and our partners on the insurance and PBM side will hopefully come up with better solutions going forward.","Operator","And our question is from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff?","Geoff Meacham","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. Glad, you back Arvind. Just had one for Murdo. On Aimovig, it's probably the highest profile launch I think at Amgen with a lot of prior discussion from you and others on the big unmet need in millions of eligible patients. But when I look at your slide 15, and I understand the impact payers have on adoption, but why isn't there more of a tipping point more than a year into the launch? If you look at Lily, they've seen good growth as well, but no real inflection point either. So I guess the question is what do you think is holding back the class? And how could you help accelerate the launch from here? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon","Yeah. Thank you, Geoff. Look it's still very early days. And we're pleased with the uptake over 260,000 patients treated so far with Aimovig since launch. We are really \u2013 if you think about it we are really only now reaching a point in the market where good access has been provided. We're now at 81% of our prescriptions being paid through some insurance benefit. We're also really only scratching the surface, as you mentioned looking at roughly four million eligible patients in the U.S. alone. So there's a number of activities. We are investing heavily in direct-to-consumer promotion. We have a very extensive and sophisticated digital campaign along with as we have done since the very early days of our work in migraine been able to activate a lot of the different patient organizations in this area.","So, I think given the benefit that patients are experiencing with Aimovig, given the way in which it's transforming the lives of migraine sufferers and we see the letters coming in from patients there's really \u2013 we have a lot of confidence that this market will evolve. And I think throughout the course of 2020, we're looking for changes in the number of new patients that are coming in to the CGRP category on a weekly basis. We're running at around a 7,000 patient per-week clip, new patients to CGRP. We're hoping that, that grows into double-digits throughout the course of next year.","Dave Reese","Yeah. And just to add a clinical perspective. The drug works. We've got data out to four years now in some patients and we think that that foundation will simply lead the increased uptake over time. So, we remain very optimistic about the prospects for this. It's really a transformative medicine.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence?","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two from me. Murdo just wanted to confirm that you said, I think I heard this correctly that for 2020 you're expecting revenue growth for next year ex Otezla and then wondering what that assumes for overall price. And David on margins, any reason why we would expect a step-down versus of this year? And then on the pipeline, obviously there's some competitor KRAS data yesterday at a conference just wondering if you can offer your perspective. Thank you.","Murdo Gordon","Terence thanks for the opportunity to clarify. What I said was, our base business will be stable going into 2020 and with the anticipated addition of Otezla we will grow.","Bob Bradway","David, I think you've been pretty comprehensive with margins. Do you want to add anything to Terence?","David Meline","No. I've tried to give a preview in terms of the components of cost for next year. And so a combination of what we're doing with revenue and those costs, I think gives the answer. And I think importantly, we've said in the past and we continue to believe that the company's overall capability in terms of delivering profitability is very good and will continue.","Bob Bradway","Dave, I think there was a third question in there about KRAS.","Dave Reese","Yeah. May related to this molecule called KRAS. We \u2013 of course, we're aware of the data. I'll let others comment on those data. As I mentioned, we are enrolling very briskly in our Phase 2 non-small cell lung cancer program. We've enrolled a cohort in colorectal cancer in Phase 2 that will believe will inform the development pathway there. And we've got a wide-ranging combination therapy program that's opening up. So, I think 2020 will be a very data-rich year for the KRAS program and we'll understand where to go from there.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Evan?","Evan Seigerman","Hi all. Thank you for taking the question and I want to congratulate David on his retirement and I wish him the best. And I have a question for the other David following up on what Terence just asked. So, we've seen a lot of KRAS data recently. Much of it remains pretty early. But looking ahead what is your view on the eventual role of 510 as monotherapy in lung cancer? Or do you ultimately believe that this is probably best served in combination maybe with chemo or a checkpoint? Just to get your thoughts there on how we think about potentially moving that up-line. Thank you.","David Meline","Yes. Evan thanks and that's a great question. I think the ongoing clinical program is really designed to answer that question in monotherapy. Key things that we will be looking at in the data set over time in addition to the response rate will be importantly duration of response and then I think progression-free survival or median progression-free survival.","Many of the patients that we've treated to date are third, fourth, fifth-line patients where response rates to single-agent chemotherapy are quite low with progression -- median progressions often on the order of a few months. And so those are some of the benchmarks that we'll be looking at in terms of monotherapy.","In terms of combinations in different indications, tumor cells can have very different wiring and I think as over time as we generate these data sets, we will determine in individual settings whether monotherapy or combination therapy is most appropriate.","And then finally, of course, we do have a keen interest in advancing the drug into earlier lines of therapy where we would hope that the magnitude of benefit will be greater and we will be orienting the development program in that direction as well.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen and Company. Yaron?","Yaron Werber","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe David I was going to maybe just ask you another follow-up KRAS question. With -- just piggybacking on what you said assuming that monotherapy is where you're going to go into in terms of a potential filing path from the Phase 2 in lung cancer is what is your latest thinking? Is 50% response rate a PR with six-month durability, is that really where the latest bogey is for a TKI failure directed? Or is there a chance to file if the data shows you four and a half, five months durability if that's going to be where it ends up?","And then just a question on your formulation. Can you just give us a sense is that what's the size of the tablets in the current 960-mg dose? Thank you.","Dave Reese","Yes sure. So, in terms of the monotherapy, I don't know that I would want to put a stake in the ground there. And it depends also on the patient population in prior lines of therapy. The patients that we have treated to-date have all 100% received platinum-based combination chemotherapy and a very large majority 90% or so have received a prior checkpoint inhibitor. Beyond that there are a very few available therapies.","And so I think it's against that backdrop that we will be looking at the efficacy and safety results. In terms of the dosing, the 960 milligrams is eight tablets. We have not had any reports of tolerability issues and quite frankly, that part is a nonissue in the program right now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael?","Michael Yee","Thanks. Question for David Reese as well. On BCMA you've commented that you expect half-life extended data perhaps in early 2020. I wanted to ask your confidence on the ability for that program to move forward to a pivotal, what you're looking for, what's the hurdle? Is there any chance that that doesn't move into a pivotal? Maybe just comment on that update and what you're looking for.","Dave Reese","Yes. So, I think in addition to standard and efficacy and safety, we will be looking at how the molecule stacks up in what's a crowded treatment landscape. Based on what we've seen from the continuous infusion BiTE molecule AMG 420, we remain quite enthusiastic about the platform.","In general, our approach in the BiTE after we've done dose finding and an expansion cohort, our intention will be generally to progress to a registration phase of the program. And that would be our goal for AMG 701. All of this of course is contingent on data that we generate.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew?","Matthew Harrison","Hey, great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask Murdo on biosimilars. You gave us a nice sort of run down on some of the market dynamics. I was hoping maybe you could just talk a little bit more detail about what you're seeing in the oncology launches versus the inflammation launches and maybe just give us some sense for what's the breakdown of the revenue mix is right now.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. Thank you, Matthew. We're pleased with the U.S. oncology uptake. I think what's really important to note is Amgen's capabilities across our company are known for our strength in biologics manufacturing and providing a reliable quality supply to customers.","So, I think that first box that you would anticipate oncologist would be concerned about is well checked with the capabilities at Amgen. And we've proven that on our innovative side and now we're demonstrating that with being the innovator total portfolio and of course the launch with our biosimilars.","I think from a behavioral standpoint, providers in the oncology market are more than willing to try high-quality biosimilars and we're seeing good adoption. We're able to open accounts relatively quickly. So, our breadth in the community oncology market is good. We've provided good coverage in terms of payer reimbursement. And now what we're working on is our non-340B and 340B hospital coverage. And now that we've got permanent J-code -- or permanent coding for reimbursement we're in really good shape.","So, I think oncologists have behaved very consistent with what we had expected given some of the uptake that we've seen on the supportive care side with the long-acting filgrastim franchise. And I think we're looking forward to continuing to supply those community oncologist providers and academic oncology cancer centers with good commercial services and good patient support as well as that quality and reliable supply that we're known for.","Bob Bradway","Different region Murdo, but do you want to comment on the experience with inflam in Europe?","Murdo Gordon","Yes. We've seen very quick uptake and penetration of the biosimilar into the innovator compound with AMGEVITA. We've been pleased to see that despite having multiple products early in the launch of that, all launching at the same time that we've been able to settle in on price points that are good for our profitability. And as I mentioned earlier, we're also excited now that we've got an on-the-ground inflammation-focused customer-facing organization. The addition of Otezla to that is a very efficient one as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey?","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you, very much. And just so a couple of follow-ups for Dave if I may. Dave, I'm sure in reviewing a competitor's data, it will not have been lost on you that your competitor has a longer half-life, but a greater dosing frequency as well. So wondering in the context of that, will you be studying BID dosing with 510 in any of the studies? And then, could you just talk a bit about ongoing research? I mean this field is obviously exploding. Does Amgen have a continuing research investment in KRAS? And do you have backup molecules that you believe could have some of the attributes that -- compared to these molecules that are emerging that you're going to have? Thanks.","David Meline","Thanks, Geoff. Those are both good questions. I would -- to start I would say that when we were developing AMG 510, we outlined a set of target parameters for the molecule that we wanted to achieve biochemically in terms of pharmacokinetics et cetera. Most importantly is the ability to inhibit the target over a dosing interval of 24 hours. We have -- we believe a wealth of data suggesting that with a covalent inhibitor, a couple hours of exposure above a threshold leads to complete inhibition of signaling over that dosing interval. And we're convinced that our 960-milligram dose achieved that and in fact is well above that target threshold.","Now that said, of course, it's very common in small molecule development programs early in the clinical development program to explore alternative doses and schedules and we will do that as part of the clinical pharmacology program going forward, including split dosing such as BID.","And then finally, as you noted the field is exploding. That's a fact that is not lost on us. We have a variety of preclinical efforts ongoing there, which we'll be happy to talk about at the right moment in time. I think it's important as you follow this field to keep in mind that not all of those molecules are directly KRAS inhibitors, but inhibit other signaling or co-signaling molecules in the pathway or have slightly different mechanisms of action. And as we've seen in oncology over the last several decades, we would expect a sort of plethora of different approaches around these targets.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer?","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. David, back to you again on KRAS as a surprise. We've seen two very different AUC disclosures on AMG 510 at the 960 milligram. It was 140 at ASCO or the AUC. And then the AUC declined to 65 at World Lung. So my question to you is what do we know about the median AUC among patients that ended up being responders versus the median AUC among patients that were not responders? Thank you, very much.","Dave Reese","Yes, Umer. Thanks for that. And I would point out that it's not unusual when you initially report Phase I results are often on just a handful of patients on with small molecules it's typical to have quite large error bars around the various pharmacokinetic estimates. So to see those move over time, is not surprising. And as I mentioned, we're still at a target exposure.","In our view Cmax here is probably the most important parameter and we believe we're well above our target threshold for quite a number of hours. In fact essentially through the entire dosing interval we believe we only need to be above it for a couple of hours to extinguish signaling. So, that's really what drove us forward in terms of dose selection in the program. And as I just mentioned, we'll continue to explore other approaches as part of the standard clinical pharmacology program.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho. Salim?","Salim Syed","Thanks so much guys and my congrats to David on his retirement. Just one for me on Neulasta if I may. So when I look at the NEUPOGEN ASPs over the last five years when the biosimilars launched, it seems like you guys have held your ASPs more or less flat over the last five years. Meanwhile, the biosimilar ASPs for NEUPOGEN have come down substantially. And I'm wondering how you guys thinking about that given what we're seeing with the Neulasta numbers declining pretty quickly. Should we be expecting a similar strategy here to be price-disciplined? Or what breaks price discipline? Can Sandoz do it? If you can just opine on that. Thanks so much.","Murdo Gordon","Yes, thanks Salim. The general rule in these types of markets is that the more competition you have the more number of players, the more price competition you usually see. So I think it's too early to tell in the U.S. in the -- at least the two oncology categories we're in with both bevazuzimab and trastuzamab. And I think overall we're pretty pleased with how price is holding in the long-acting filgrastim arena.","I think, what we'd we continue to do is make sure that people understand that our ability to supply a high-quality product with reliability of that supply. along with our patient programs we're able to hold on to share quite well. And there's usually some ability for the innovator to hold on to share even at a price premium and that's usually in the 10% to 20% range.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Jay?","Jay Olson","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I'm curious about tezepelumab. Congratulations on completing enrollment of the 1000 patient NAVIGATOR study. Can you describe the plans for submitting a BLA? You have a number of other studies running including a steroid-sparing study in adults. What do you -- what data do you need and what is the time line to file? And then as you contemplate commercialization, who are the target prescribers? And how will tezepelumab fit into your commercial infrastructure? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Let's take it two parts. Dave why don't you start?","Dave Reese","Yes I'll start. Typically, we don't comment on regulatory filing time lines. I would point out as you mentioned, the core of any filing package will be NAVIGATOR study. And there are a number of other studies that will provide supportive data. We expect -- those studies are 52 weeks in duration. And so given that we completed enrollment to that trial you can expect roughly a little after a year from last patient enrolled that the primary analysis reads out following within -- following that would then be filing.","Let me turn it over to Murdo who can address some of our commercial thoughts on the opportunity for tezepelumab.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. Clearly we're working very closely with our partners at AstraZeneca who are very experienced in this area across respirology, pulmonology and even allergists which are our target customers for at least the asthma indications. So a lot of work being done there and we're looking forward to hopefully successful data and approval.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'll skip another KRAS one instead ask on the BD front. So given that you recently announced a meaningful transaction for Otezla and now you have CFO transitions going to be taking place. Would it be fair to assume that you'd hit the pause button on other deals in the near to intermediate term? Or is it basically business as usual during this transition?","David Meline","Well, I think it's very much business as usual Cory. We're very clear that our capital allocation priorities remain intact. We're continuing to look for ways to invest internally, externally and while also growing the dividend by next year. So we've got an active BD effort in those areas of our stated strategic focus therapeutically and geographically and we'll maintain that.","Murdo Gordon","Ian as it's past 6:00 p.m. on the East Coast, why don't we take two last questions after which Bob will make a few concluding comments.","Operator","Very well. Our next question is from the line of Mohit Bansal from Citigroup. Mohit.","Mohit Bansal","Great. Thanks for taking my question. And I would like to start with thanking David for all the help over the years. Moving to KRAS, we have recently learned that patients with LTV1 mutations do not respond well to checkpoint inhibitors and they also represent about 30% of KRAS-mutated cancer. So just wanted to see if this is an area you have looked at and could this be your entry as a first-line agent for your AMG 510? Thank you.","David Meline","Thanks Mohit and that's a great question. So we've got a very active biomarker program. We are sequencing as many of these tumors as we can. And as we accumulate a larger number of patients who are both responders and non-responders we will look to see if there are signatures -- molecular signatures that predict response or lack of response.","The particular mutation that you called out is one of course that we will be keenly focused on. And as you mentioned, it seems to associate with relative resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.","So I think there's a lot to learn. It took 40 years to get into the clinic with an inhibitor. We've been there, a year. We are very rapidly generating data. I would think that when we present clinical data next year, we will also be able to have a first pass at a fair amount of biomarker data as well.","Operator","And our final question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen?","Kennen MacKay","Thanks for squeezing me in. Let me offer my congrats on the quarter and guidance raise, as well as congrats on the decision to pull the high-priced Repatha from the market by New Year's Eve. And on that note, just a question for Murdo, Repatha's share of the PCSK9 market has increasingly gained over probably 1.5 or the last couple of years.","I was wondering if you could comment on what you see is the big driver for that and also how you're thinking about the potential competitive impacts of the entry of bempedoic acid and inclisiran in high cholesterol? Thanks so much and congrats again.","Murdo Gordon","Thanks Kennen. So why don't I start with the Repatha question and then perhaps turn it to Dave Reese to talk about the development of other competitors in the cholesterol-lowering category. First off thank you for recognizing the price -- sorry the decision to remove the OLP from the market.","I think this was something we signaled, but it's something we feel is important to do to ensure that other actors in the supply chain make the right decision and provide the low list price Repatha on their formularies and within their benefits so that patients can lower their out-of-pocket costs.","So this is one where we've worked very closely with payers and we've made sure that both the prescribing community and patients understand, what we're trying to do here and that's to provide a very effective medicine for serious cardiovascular disease patients who can benefit from it.","Overall I think the execution on the ground has been very, very strong. The field teams both on the medical side and on the commercial side that are calling on cardiology have been very good at explaining who the ideal high-risk cardiovascular patient candidate is for Repatha.","And so, we're running at approximately 70% share right now. We don't see that declining. We see it holding or modestly increasing. We'll continue to invest in Repatha to ensure that prescribers and patients alike receive the option of using Repatha to lower cholesterol and to reduce cardiovascular risk going forward.","So we're feeling confident and we're feeling like, we're finally making some inroads here in addressing these -- the risk reduction for these patients.","David Meline","Yes. And in terms of other LDL-targeting molecules bempedoic acid is an oral. We think it is really going to occupy different niche in the clinical landscape. This will be used either on top of statins or with patients who are close to goal or in those who are not tolerant to statins. We don't -- it's got a modest LDL-lowering effect. We really don't see it as a direct competitor to Repatha.","Inclisiran, I think what we will pay attention to in the long term -- long-term safety and then of course cardiovascular outcomes data which are still -- we think some years out. That's what we'll be looking for in that space. And I think now, I'll turn it back over to Bob.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you. Let's wrap up. Let me just note that we're pleased with our performance through the first nine months of the year. We hope to share our enthusiasm for the long-term outlook at Amgen, driven by our recently launched innovative products as well as our biosimilar medicines and our rapidly advancing pipeline opportunities.","We think we're in a strong position to deliver long-term performance for our shareholders and the patients whose needs we're seeking to address. And as previously announced, David Meline will be retiring next year. And though this is not his last call with investors, I wanted to take a moment fresh from his announcement to thank him publicly for his contributions. He's been an extraordinary leader for us as our CFO and he will leave Amgen, a strengthened enterprise.","At the same time, I'm delighted to welcome Peter Griffith to Amgen as David's successor. And Peter's extensive financial and operational experience will benefit Amgen as we continue our efforts globally to serve more patients and drive long-term growth. I know the whole team joins me in welcoming Peter aboard and we look forward to introducing him to all of you.","Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't also thank the Amgen staff around the world, who continue to deliver on our mission to serve patients and to drive value for our shareholders. Thanks for your interest in the company and we look forward to talking to you on the next call.","Arvind Sood","Great. Thanks to all of you for your participation. If you'd like to continue the dialogue feel free to call me. The IR team will be standing by for several hours. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Okay. Thanks, Ian. Good afternoon everybody, and thanks for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. As I've done in the past, I would like to extend a special welcome to those who are new in their coverage of our company. And this quarter, it's Mohit Bansal of Citi. Welcome Mohit. I think our performance in the second quarter can be best characterized as continued execution while staying focused on sustained long-term growth.","Leading the discussion today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic perspective on our business particularly within the backdrop of a fast-changing business environment. Our CFO, David Meline will then review our financial results for the second quarter and provide updated guidance. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon will review our product performance; followed by our Head of R&D, Dave Reese, who will provide a pipeline update.","As we have done in the past, we will use slides to guide our discussion today and you should have received a link separately. Just a reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you, Arvind and thank all of you for joining us. Halfway through the year we're making clear progress in delivering on our strategy for long-term growth and at the core of this strategy of course are innovative first-in-class medicines addressing serious diseases globally. While our strategy embraces medicines like BLINCYTO, which is our bispecific T-cell engager for example with its large effect size in a specialty market, our strategy also explicitly addresses diseases where the unmet need is measured in many millions of patients.","Over time, we think this balance is going to be essential and expect that increasing global price pressures will highlight the importance of products that can deliver sustained growth through volume gains rather than annual price increases.","Prolia is a great example of this. Now more than 10 years after launch it once again posted double-digit volume growth this quarter and its long-term prospects remain bright as there are still millions of women at high risk of fracture, who are not yet on a preventative therapy like Prolia.","The recent launch of EVENITY will enable us to extend our industry leadership in bone health, and bring more options to positions seeking to address the global epidemic of osteoporosis. More generally, Prolia points the way for other products in our portfolio like Repatha, Aimovig and potentially tezepelumab.","Let me touch briefly on Repatha. I think all of us know that cardiovascular disease is a leading health problem globally. The numbers are so large that some seem to have been numbed or lulled into a sense of complacency about them, but that's changing partly because after decades of decreasing morbidity and mortality, the trends have worsened and the death rate from heart attack and stroke is now actually increasing in the U.S. and internationally.","We know one of the reasons for this is that LDL levels are too high in too many people. We believe Repatha offers a solution to that problem for many people. And given demographics, health systems cannot continue to ignore the meaningful uptick in cardiovascular events and deaths. It will only get worse without more widespread use of innovative medicines that address atherosclerotic disease. We see increasing recognition of this here and abroad, and of course we're seeking to do our part including taking actions as we did last year in a competitive context to lower the out-of-pocket costs for patients to use this therapy. We will continue to advocate for high-risk patients and those who recognize the urgency of getting in front of the growing problem of heart disease in our society.","With Aimovig, our first-in-class CGRP medicine we're transforming the treatment of migraine. Like Prolia and Repatha, it addresses a chronic debilitating disease afflicting millions of people worldwide. We recently presented important new data at the American Headache Society meeting demonstrating that Aimovig's efficacy improves over time. We expect this medicine to be of increasing importance to migraine sufferers and a key growth driver for years to come.","Turning to our growing hematology and oncology products, we posted 10% growth for KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Nplate Vectibix, IMLYGIC and BLINCYTO which together are annualizing at more than $5 billion revenues. We see more growth ahead from these medicines. Our confidence in BLINCYTO was bolstered by the compelling five-year survival data we reported in MRD-positive ALL patients. Based on this and other data emerging from our BiTE platform our confidence in that therapy is high.","The demand for innovative medicines is growing rapidly outside the U.S. and the larger European markets. Looking at demographic trends, we expect this to continue for some time. That's why we've made international expansion an important part of our strategy.","We're beginning to see measurable returns from our efforts. Internationally our volumes were up 18% in the second quarter. And if you look at markets where we were historically absent like Japan and China, you can also see the benefits of our strategy coming to light.","Japan was the first country to approve EVENITY globally and was our first market launch. We're very pleased with the uptake there. Similarly, BLINCYTO is performing well in Japan. And overall, we're encouraged by the performance of our Amgen-Astellas biopharma partnership.","China, though it is still early days for Amgen, represents another attractive long-term growth opportunity for us and we're encouraged by the progress in advancing our medicines for that market with the early launches of Repatha and XGEVA.","At Amgen, whenever we talk about delivering in the long-term, we're always clear that you only get to deliver in the long-term, if you succeed in the short and medium-term. Our results in Q2 show that we're doing that. With pressure following patent expirations across a number of our products, we maintained strong operating margins, attractive returns on our capital and ongoing steady return of cash to our shareholders in dividends and buybacks. And our stewardship of the business is also reflected in our competitive market share performance across our mature and recently launched portfolio of products.","We'll be staying closely focused on execution and productivity, as we seek to invest in the long-term opportunities that will enable us to reestablish our long-term track record and growth. Our long-term opportunities include many novel first-in-class therapies across all phases of our pipeline. One of these of course is AMG 510 our KRAS G12C inhibitor, which has generated significant interest and continues to move very rapidly through the clinic.","We anticipate many important data readouts across the portfolio over the next 12 months as we advance therapies against cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and other inflammatory disorders. Additionally, I'd like to note in Q2 we bolstered our industry-leading human genetics capability with our collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare and we added a new important research platform through our acquisition of Nuevolution. Dave Reese will share more information about our pipeline as well as these collaborations when he talks about research and development in a moment.","Now let me share a couple of thoughts with you on the drug pricing debate here in the United States noting first that the environment remains fluid. The administration and Congress as you know are considering various proposals, but it's too early to speculate on whether there will be any changes and if there are any what the impact of them might be given that the process is still playing out.","I know the Senate Finance Committee bill in particular has attracted attention and is an important example of this focus, but many provisions in the bill remain controversial and will likely be modified before advancing.","Amgen's particularly focused on ensuring that patients benefit more directly from any savings that are generated by legislation that's advancing and we think that in general more can be done to help patients who bear in present anyway a disproportionate share of drug costs through out-of-pocket expenses. And we'll continue to engage in a thoughtful dialogue with the administration and Congress on drug pricing issues and we're committed to find ways to drive change that still promotes innovation and respects our market-based initiatives that will help address financial and societal burden of some of the world's most serious diseases.","One solution to alleviate some of the financial and societal burden is through the introduction of biosimilars. Last year, we launched our first biosimilars in Europe, KANJINTI, our biosimilar to Herceptin, and AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to Humira.","A couple of weeks ago we launched KANJINTI and MVASI, our biosimilar to Avastin in the U.S. We believe biosimilars will play an increasingly important role in helping to address issues of access and affordability in the U.S. and around the world, and we're excited to be a leader in this emerging space.","I'll end by highlighting that we continue to generate strong cash flow, continue to invest in R&D aggressively and to prudently return excess capital to shareholders. We're in a strong position to grow our business organically and externally, but we'll remain disciplined in business development opportunities. As I stated earlier, Amgen is executing well and we remain excited about our long-term outlook.","I'll turn the call over now to David Meline, who will review our financial performance. David?","David Meline","Okay. Thanks Bob. Overall, we are pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter, as investments in support of our newer products delivered volume-driven growth and year-over-year EPS growth in the second quarter.","Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck. Worldwide revenues at $5.9 billion in the second quarter declined 3% year-over-year. Worldwide product sales at $5.6 billion in the second quarter declined 2% year-over-year, as growth for our newer products was slightly outpaced by declines in our mature brands impacted by increasing competition due to patent expirations.","Other revenues at $297 million declined $83 million year-over-year, due to a prior year milestone payment. We continue to expect full year other revenues of about $1.1 billion.","Non-GAAP operating income was $3 billion and declined 5% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 53% for the second quarter. As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the second half of the year, driven by the timing of expenses.","Consistent with our plans, second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% year-over-year as we continued to make incremental investments to drive growth and maximize shareholder value while benefiting from our permanent productivity capability. As communicated earlier this year, we continue to expect full year 2019 operating expense on an absolute basis to be flat versus 2018.","On a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales was relatively flat year-over-year at 13.2%. We anticipate 2019 full year cost of sales on an absolute basis to be flat to slightly up depending on volume and continuing to reflect our industry leading performance.","Second quarter research and development expenses of $906 million were 7% higher year-over-year due to increased investments in support of our early and late-stage oncology programs.","Research and development expense, as a percent of product sales, was 16.3%. For the full year we continue to expect R&D spend trajectory on an absolute basis to increase in single-digit percentage terms as our pipeline advances.","SG&A expenses decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by reduced discretionary general and administrative expenses and cost management discipline. We expect that for the full year SG&A expense on an absolute basis will decline year-over-year.","Other income and expenses were a net $114 million expense in Q2. This is favorable by $71 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by prior year investment portfolio liquidation losses as well as continued good performance for our Amgen ventures portfolio.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 15.3% for the quarter, a 1.1 point increase versus the second quarter of 2018, primarily due to a prior year tax benefit associated with inter-company sales under U.S. corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP net income decreased 4% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 4% year-over-year for the second quarter to $3.97 per share.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2019 was $1.3 billion. This was lower than second quarter last year as this year's result was negatively impacted by an advanced tax deposit payment.","Consistent with our principles, we continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders. In Q2, we deployed $2.3 billion to repurchase 13.1 million shares at an average price of $180 per shares.","We plan to repurchase an incremental 1 billion to 2 billion of our shares in Q3. Additionally, our second quarter dividend increased to $1.45 per share, an increase of 10% over last year.","Cash and investments totaled $21.8 billion, a decrease of approximately $7.6 billion from the second quarter of last year, primarily due to share repurchases and debt repayments. Our debt balance stands at $30.6 billion as of June 30, a reduction of approximately $3.9 billion from a year ago as we continue to pay down our debt as it matures.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2019 on page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue to advance our pipeline, including our oncology programs, build out our global presence and drive long-term volume growth while delivering solid business performance.","Today, we are revising our 2019 guidance, which reflects our solid Q2 performance and the outlook for the second half of the year. Our revised revenue guidance is $22.4 billion to $22.9 billion versus previous guidance of $22.0 billion to $22.9 billion. This continues to reflect the range of evolving competitive dynamics associated with Neulasta and other legacy products.","With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are revising the outlook to $13.75 to $14.30 a share versus previous guidance of $13.25 to $14.30. Further, we are maintaining our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 14% to 15%. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.","This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Murdo.","Murdo Gordon","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. You'll find product sales information starting on Slide 10. In the second quarter of 2019, we continued to grow volumes across our newer portfolio, while competing effectively with our more mature brands.","Moving to second quarter results, let me start with Repatha on Slide 12. Q2 sales grew by 3% year-over-year as we continue to hold leading share of the PCSK9 class in this competitive market.","Worldwide unit growth was 59% year-over-year with 66% unit growth in the United States. In the first half of the year, over 50,000 new patients were prescribed Repatha in the U.S. which was close to a 55% increase versus the same period last year. The PCSK9 class has shown steady quarter-over-quarter growth which we expect to continue throughout the second half of 2019 as we continue to make it our priority to improve access and affordability for patients.","For Medicare patients, our 60% list price reduction materially improves affordability and key to that patient affordability is access to Repatha at a low fixed co-pay tier. And while the lower list price version is now available to approximately 70% of seniors, we continue to be disappointed that payers have restricted low fixed co-pay coverage to 7% of Medicare patients. So, as we go through the bidding cycle for 2020, we're very focused on improving this number.","Further on the commercial access front, we've recently obtained coverage at ESI which will help to expand access to close to 22 million patients. Recently a study published in circulation demonstrated that high-risk individuals had a 16% increased risk of a cardiovascular event during the 11.5-month study period when their PCSK9 treatment was rejected by their insurance plan.","The findings reinforce the need for continued engagement from all stakeholders from health care professionals to payers to plans and to government agencies to improve access and patient affordability so that patients who need Repatha can get Repatha.","With regard to pricing, the blended net price for Repatha in the U.S. declined in Q2 2019 versus the previous year due to contracts that took effect last July and the introduction of the lower list price SKU last October.","Sequentially, net selling price was roughly flat. We're committed to driving adoption of the lower list price SKU and our current plan is to discontinue the original list price SKU in the beginning of 2020.","With these actions and our efforts to open up access for Medicare patients at a low fixed co-pay, we expect that we will see a positive impact on volume and reported net sales growth over the long-term.","Next on to Prolia on Slide 13. Prolia continued its strong performance with sales increasing 14% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth. Given the seasonality, quarters two and four delivered higher sales versus quarters one and three. We continued to increase our investments in Prolia to drive penetration in this undertreated population and have seen double-digit year-over-year new patient growth in the U.S.","Along with EVENITY, our innovative bone-building therapy, we're focused on addressing this global epidemic and increasing diagnosis and treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis patients. EVENITY has convenient once-monthly physician-administered dosing for 12 months and strengthens Amgen's leading position in bone health. Through our joint venture with Astellas, we launched in Japan and in March sold $25 million in Q2. The U.S. launch in partnership with UCB commenced in April and early feedback has been positive.","Now on to Aimovig on Slide 15. Versus Q1 sales increased 41%. We hold the leading share of the CGRP market and continue to see improvement in our conversion of free-to-paid patients exiting Q2 at 74% paid. That increase in the percentage of paid volume was a significant driver of quarter-over-quarter sales growth.","Penetration in the overall market is currently low considering 4 million migraine patients in the U.S. are eligible for CGRP treatment. However, we remain optimistic as 7,000 patients a week start a CGRP therapy and to-date, 225,000 patients have been prescribed Aimovig with 1 million prescriptions filled.","Additionally the number of prescribers is consistently increasing as 27,000 physicians have now prescribed Aimovig since launch with close to 10,000 primary care prescribers among them.","We expect net price to remain relatively stable going forward as most patients have converted from free-to-paid and an increasing percentage of patients are covered under discounted contracts versus paying full list price.","We launched a single convenient monthly Aimovig a 140-milligram autoinjector replacing the two by 70-milligram presentation. Coupled with a further expansion into retail we believe there's a small one-time increase in the amount of product in the channel in the quarter to prepare for this demand. We're confident that Aimovig will continue to grow and contribute to the strength of Amgen's innovative portfolio.","Moving to our hematology and oncology business the portfolio of XGEVA, Kyprolis, Nplate, Vectibix, BLINCYTO, and IMLYGIC collectively totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter growing 10% year-over-year.","For more detail on the larger brands, let's start with XGEVA on slide 17. In Q2, XGEVA grew 10% year-over-year, primarily from volume. In the U.S. share is approximately 60%.","And we're seeing rapid growth in multiple myeloma patients, while also growing the number of treated solid tumor patients. Kyprolis grew 2%, year-on-year driven primarily by 13% volume growth in the U.S.","Recall, that in the second quarter of last year, our international business recognized $27 million in clinical trial purchases. And when normalizing for clinical trial purchases across periods, the underlying worldwide business grew 8%.","Moving to Enbrel, sales increased 5%, year-over-year driven primarily by net selling price benefits. Overall, we expect volume trends to continue. And anticipate a slight benefit from net selling price on a full year basis.","Next to Neulasta on slide 20, overall, the competitive dynamic is playing out as we expected on a global basis. In Q2, Neulasta sales declined 25% year-over-year, with a 24% decline in the U.S.","Exit share of Neulasta in the U.S. was just under 80% in the long-acting segment with absolute units of Onpro, stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis, as many providers and their patients continued to appreciate the benefits of Onpro.","This performance reflects the confidence that our customers have, in the reliability and quality of our supply. The decline in U.S. Neulasta units continues to come primarily from our prefilled syringe, reflecting a competitive biosimilar market.","Regarding our international business, Neulasta declined 31%, due to increasing competition. Switching to nephrology starting on slide 21, Q2 Epogen sales declined 11% due to lower net selling price.","This quarter also benefited from approximately $15 million of large one-time, end-customer purchases. And $13 million in favorable changes to accounting estimates. Given our contractual pricing commitments with DaVita, net price will continue to decline for EPOGEN in 2019.","Aranesp declined 8% year-over-year in Q2, driven by lower volume due to increased competition. We expect Aranesp sales to continue to decline at a faster rate in 2019 versus 2018, with both long-acting and short-acting competition in the U.S.","Parsabiv continues to experience solid growth, more than doubling sales on a year-over-year basis. Independent and midsize dialysis providers utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcium emetic patients, while FMC and DaVita are increasing their adoption.","Turning to Sensipar, as a result of some at-risk small-molecule generic launches you can see on slide 24, that Q2 sales declined by approximately $300 million year-over-year.","We believe that inventory of generic Sensipar remains in the market. Given ongoing legal proceedings, there remains uncertainty about the magnitude of future U.S. Sensipar sales.","I'd like to highlight the strong performance of our biosimilar products. Our launches of Kanjinti, our biosimilar to Herceptin, and Amgevita our biosimilar to Humira outside the U.S. are progressing in line with our expectations, annualizing at greater than $300 million.","We also recently launched our first-ever biosimilars in the U.S. with Kanjinti and Mvasi our biosimilar to Avastin.","We are encouraged that our experience in the dynamics of both innovator and biosimilar molecules and our expertise in world-class biologic manufacturing will benefit us greatly in shaping and advancing this important market for patients and payers.","In summary, I'm pleased to see, that our careful planning for the evolution of our product portfolio is progressing nicely. I continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver volume growth in the future, as we launch and grow new products, deliver value with biosimilar products and defend our mature brands.","We're prepared for the challenges that face us. And continue to drive toward providing patients with high-quality, innovative and biosimilar products in markets across the globe.","Now let me turn it over to Dave Reese.","David Reese","Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a year since I assumed leadership of the R&D organization.","And I wanted to take a moment to reflect on our progress. Two of the core challenges facing any R&D group, are improving success rates and decreasing the drug development cycle time.","To address these challenges, we've created a research organization that has tightly integrated triple-threat capabilities, namely, one, human genetics as a foundation, two core strength in biology, and 3 world-class molecular engineering.","We have made tangible progress on all fronts. And I would like to highlight some recent announcements that build on this. The acquisition of deCODE Genetics, gave us the industry-leading human genetics platform. And we have expanded that capability.","Today there are about 1.6 million participants in the deCODE database. Last month, we announced the collaboration with Intermountain Health, a leading integrated delivery network here in the U.S. which will increase our sample size by up to 0.5 million, over the next five years.","This unique collaboration will give participants access to important genetic information as appropriate, allow the leaders of Intermountain to use genetics to improve population health. And enhance our target discovery and development efforts.","The platform we have put in place will solidify our lead in the use of human genetics for years to come. Another investment in our innovation engine was the acquisition of Nuevolution now completed. We'd like to welcome our new colleagues in Copenhagen and look forward to integrating their world-class expertise in DNA-encoded library and other technologies into our research platform.","These technologies enhance our small molecule capabilities and our ability to engineer molecules that induce targeted protein degradation, on which we will place a major emphasis going forward.","Turning to our therapeutic areas. In cardiovascular disease, we have completed enrollment in our Omecamtiv mecarbil Phase 3 outcome study. At over 8,000 patients, GALACTIC-HF is one of the largest heart failure clinical studies ever conducted and speaks to the emphasis we have placed on building a clinical trials platform that can deliver rapid and efficient study execution. This is an event-driven study and we will provide updates on expected timing as events accumulate.","With AMG 890 our LP(a) small interfering RNA program, we are now enrolling patients with known elevated LP(a) based on the data on the healthy human volunteers and anticipate launching the next phase of development in the first half of next year.","In inflammation, enrollment in our tezepelumab Phase 3 asthma study continues on schedule with data expected next year. We are also advancing AMG 570, a bispecific antibody peptide conjugate that targets ICOS ligand and BAFF into Phase 2 for the treatment of systematic lupus erythematosus. I will have more to say on AMG 570 as the program progresses.","In our migraine portfolio, we recently presented additional long-term Aimovig data at the American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society meetings that demonstrate sustained reductions in monthly migraine days. Aimovig is the only CGRP inhibitor with four-year clinical data in migraine with 77% of Aimovig patients achieving at least a 50% response more than half achieving at least a 75% response and one-third achieving a 100% response in monthly migraine day reduction. No new safety signals were detected over the extended treatment period.","In bone health, EVENITY is now approved in Japan and the U.S. as Murdo discussed and we also recently received approval in other countries including Canada, Australia and South Korea. We were disappointed by the negative opinion for EVENITY in Europe by the CHMP. UCB has submitted a written notice to the European Medicines Agency requesting reexamination of the CHMP opinion and we will support UCB in this endeavor. We strongly believe that EVENITY is an important treatment option in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture.","Turning to oncology. I'll begin with AMG 510, our KRAS G12C inhibitor. After nearly four decades of research in the pursuit of a KRAS inhibitor, the response from the medical community to our first-in-human data at ASCO was simply overwhelming. We reported a 50% response rate in non-small cell lung cancer and very encouraging stable disease data in colorectal cancer with a tolerable adverse event profile.","Today I am pleased to report that we now have formal tumor responses in colorectal and appendiceal cancer patients and the program is moving forward rapidly. We have completed enrollment in our monotherapy expansion cohort and are also now enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients in the PD-1 combination arm.","We will also begin enrollment of lung cancer patients in the coming days in the potential registration enabling Phase 2 monotherapy portion of the program and we'll provide an update of our progress in lung cancer at the 2019 World Conference on Lung Cancer in early September.","I would highlight that we are coming up on just one year since initially entering the clinic in August of 2018. We remain extraordinarily enthusiastic about the promise of AMG 510 and continue to aggressively prosecute the development program.","Turning to our BiTE platform. We presented the first solid tumor data from a BiTE molecule at ASCO with AMG 212, our prostate-specific membrane antigen BiTE molecule for castrate resistant prostate cancer. The initial data were very encouraging and we are currently in dose escalation with an extended half life BiTE molecule AMG 160.","At ASCO we also provided an update on our BCMA program with our canonical BiTE molecule AMG 420, showing durability out beyond a year in some multiple myeloma patients. AMG 701 our half-life extended BCMA BiTE molecule continues to advance nicely through dose escalation and we expect to present the initial first-in-human data at a medical meeting next spring depending on data availability.","Before I leave oncology, I would note that we have paused our DLL3 and FLT3 CAR T programs in the Kite collaboration. We continue to have a keen interest in cellular therapies. However, in light of our growing confidence in the BiTE platform, we will maintain our immediate strategic focus on the BiTE molecules and direct our efforts and cellular therapy towards developing new-generation technologies likely through collaborations.","Briefly in biosimilars. We received FDA approval for KANJINTI for all approved indications of Herceptin. The non-Hodgkin's lymphoma study of ABP 798, our biosimilar Rituxan has completed dosing and we expect to have the data in-house by the end of Q3.","And finally, the FDA review of ABP 710, our biosimilar REMICADE continues to progress toward the BsUFA target action date in December. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thanks, David. Ian now let's turn to questions. And out of respect for the fact that we started an hour later than usual, we'll try to move briskly through this, so if you could please remind our callers of the procedure for questions we can get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny.","Ronny Gal","Good morning. Good afternoon, very congratulations on a nice quarter. Biosimilars, I'd like to ask one on attacking and defending side. First, congratulations on the launch of the two biosimilars in the United States. For KANJINTI you have only the 420 mg and not the 150 mg yet. Can you give us a time line for when do you think you're going to get the lower dose then and do you think it will have an impact on the initial uptake? And on the defending side looking at Neulasta. Would you be able to share with us kind of like the trends in the clinic non-340B hospitals and 340B hospitals? Where is the adoption of biosimilars right now?","Bob Bradway","Okay. Ronny. Thanks for the question. We'll take it in two parts. Murdo, do you have the answer to the first question on the 150?","Murdo Gordon","Yes. So I don't have the exact timing for you Ronny but we're not seeing a whole lot of resistance in the market initially to the conversations we're having with payers, hospitals and providers. We're seeing good response to KANJINTI and MVASI and we feel good about our ability to compete with the presentations we have in the market right now. And then on Neulasta, we continue to see the effects of biosimilar competition as we had anticipated. We are seeing an uptick of biosimilars in the 340B channel. We're also seeing a stronger performance of biosimilars in business that we have not contracted.","So again that is as we would have expected. But we're also seeing strong performance of Onpro on a unit basis quarter-over-quarter holding in a majority of accounts. And that's something that we had hoped to see by now and we're feeling good that that continues to happen. And overall, I think it's recognized in the market that the ability for Amgen to supply high-quality reliability on our overall long-acting filgrastim business is being appreciated and continuing to support that franchise.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Chris?","Chris Raymond","Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just on AMG 510. So kind of keen on your commentary on the tumor responses in CRC. So I wonder if you could maybe give some clarity here. Are these new patients that were enrolled and got maybe the 960-milligram dose, or were these -- I know you have had an option for patients to have intrapatient up-dosing. So any color there in terms of who responded would be great. And then maybe a second part of that question also on the registration trial starting this year. I know you said it's in lung, but just kind of wondering if you could give some color on the design in the setting and what constitutes maybe a control in third-line lung would be great. Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Yes. Sure. With regard to colorectal, the majority of patients that we're reporting going forward will have been treated at 960 milligrams. As you may recall at ASCO, we only had I think one patient at that point who was on that dose level. And so we'll provide updates in that particular indication as we accumulate data towards the end of the year and the first part of next year when we have enough patients at the target dose to get a real sense of the clinical activity.","In terms of potential registration plans, we would assume that lung cancer will be the lead indication going forward. As I mentioned in the coming days, we will be enrolling in the Phase II portion of that program. We're moving very, very rapidly and we'll provide updates on that particular pathway as we go forward. But I would say, we've had productive discussions with regulatory authorities and have a good sense of the pathways moving forward.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thank for taking the question. I guess another pipeline question for me. Can you just clarify on the half-life extended BiTEs, what your view on the data that we may see in the fall and what that data needs to look like versus the canonical BiTEs that you've reported so far in terms of efficacy and safety to move those programs ahead? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Yes. I think Matt as we've said in the past in general, we will prefer the half-life extended program all things being equal meaning seeing efficacy and safety profiles that are comparable to what one would expect with a short half-life or a first-generation BiTE. Based on emerging data I think we're getting increasing confidence in the half-life extended program and we'll look forward to sharing those data across both hematologic, malignancies and solid tumors as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Evan?","Evan Seigerman","Hi, all. Thanks for taking the questions. So on your recent biosimilar launches in the United States, how do you really compete with the innovator of molecules? And I guess what structural changes do you need to see in the U.S. health care system to encourage more use of biosimilars? And what's your view on the broad use of rebates to protect branded biologics in light of biosimilar competition? So there's a few in there.","Bob Bradway","Yeah. There's a few questions in there. I'll take these in parts. Go ahead Evan -- or sorry go ahead. Go ahead Murdo.","Murdo Gordon","Thank you. Yeah. Evan, thank you. I mean the gist of your question seemed to surround the viability of the biosimilar market in the U.S. and I think in two parts, we are seeing a very healthy competitive biosimilar market evolve. We're experiencing competition on Neulasta and we anticipate being able to compete effectively with our new biosimilar launches with both MVASI and KANJINTI.","I think competitively where Amgen differentiates is in the fact that we have four decades of high-quality reliable supply in the market. We are able to offer physician and patient educational services and reimbursement support. And we're also able to cover many of these customers, who will be making treatment decisions using our biosimilars given our strong history and experience in the oncology sector.","I also think that the dynamics on pricing and competition while fluid are less of a barrier than they once were. And I think that we'll continue to see deeper and deeper penetration of biosimilars against originator products in the U.S. in the future. And I will just remind you that we have many years of experience now outside of the U.S. in Europe in biosimilars and I think the market in Europe started slow and has since become a very mature, very attractive market for biosimilars manufacturers.","Bob Bradway","And I'll just add there Evan from a policy perspective there. Some in the industry who are advocating for changes that would favor biosimilars over the innovator molecules, we are not among them. We think that what the country needs is a long-term vibrant competitive marketplace for biosimilars, and our fear would be anything that tilts the playing field. Two biosimilars might perversely have the long-term effect of diminishing the competitive opportunity in the U.S.","And we want to avoid what has happened for example in the small-molecule generic industry in the U.S., where there are unfortunate market abuses relating to the fact that there are single companies left with the license to manufacture individual generic products.","So we think that for the long run what the country needs is a vibrant competitive market for biosimilars produced safely and reliably by competitors that can run a fair return for their effort. And we think we'll be able to do that without having to have policies that tilt the playing field in favor of those biosimilar molecules.","Murdo Gordon","Thanks. And if I can just jump in to close Ronny Gal's earlier question. The FDA action date on KANJINTI 150 milligrams SKU is October 28, 2019.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen. Yaron?","Yaron Werber","Great. Thank you. And David I have a follow-up there also on 510 a little bit in two parts. Maybe the first one the -- what can you share with us on solubility or formulation of the compound? We understand that solubility is better and the gastric acidity a little bit lower than the intestinal. So what you see there on your journey especially on the formulation? And then on the CLC side, as you contemplate combo as the next stage now that you're seeing single-agent activity are you thinking a PD-1 combo or is that going to be a TKI combo next? Thank you.","David Reese","Sure. So let me take both of those questions in turn Yaron. In terms of solubility, I would say broadly we've been very happy with the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the drug. And again to remind everyone with a covalent inhibitor, the key is really to maintain exposures above a target level for a period of time that is adequate to poison the target through a dosing interval. And based on what we've seen in the clinic to date now across several dozen patients gives us the confidence that we've got a very attractive pharmacokinetic profile.","In terms of colorectal cancer, obviously, combinations will be of great interest going forward, I would say potentially both with immunotherapeutic agents and additional targeted therapies. And as that program moves forward, we'll provide additional guidance a little later in the year and early into next year.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey?","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much. I appreciate for taking my question. And I'll try and confine myself to three subparts. I guess, the main question that we have been still asked is about the Sandoz litigation. And I think we all expected that we would get a result from the district court by now. And I'm sure you can't really comment, but could you talk hypothetically perhaps about what your fallbacks might be if unexpectedly your issued patent was overturned? Should we be anticipating that there is a risk of rapid erosion of Enbrel, sort of, along in your last trajectory, or could you kind of give us some thoughts Bob on how the outlook is for that?","Bob Bradway","Sure. Geoff, I understand that you're anxious for an answer from the courts and of course, so are we. We are as you know confident in the intellectual property surrounding Enbrel. So we don't know any more than you do about when we will expect that -- when we should expect that decision. But if for whatever reason that decision were to surprise us and go against us as you can imagine we would appeal that because again we feel that we have robust intellectual property for the molecule and we intend for that intellectual property be respected. So I think as to the hypothetical question about competition for Enbrel, we'll defer discussing that Geoff at this time. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer?","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much taking my questions. I had one question with three parts. It's all just a clarification. So thank you for that update on KRAS and you've mentioned formal tumor responses. I wanted to ask just to clarify; a, are these Reese's responses? Number one. Number two, can you confirm if it's more than one response in colorectal or you can only have one colorectal and one appendiceal? And finally also at what dose level? Thank you very much.","Bob Bradway","Yes. So taking those three parts in turn. Yes these are resist responses, which is what I alluded to by saying formal tumor responses. It is a patient niche in colorectal cancer and appendiceal cancer. These many of the patients dosed have yet to have repeat scans done so we expect in the coming few months to have a large amount of additional data at the target dose. Recall that we just opened the expansion cohort not long ago and have had a flood of patients enrolling on that. We are continuing to see very good tolerability. I've been involved in Phase I drug development for a long time now, and I can say I'm only very impressed with the emerging safety profile that we are seeing with AMG 510.","David Meline","Dose levels?","Bob Bradway","Dose levels. Going forward it's all at the 960 milligrams.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Mohit Bansal from Citigroup. Mohit?","Mohit Bansal","Great. Thanks for taking my question, and thanks Arvind for the shout out. A quick one on your Lp(a) candidate. Could you please compare and contrast your siRNA approach versus the oligonucleotide approach mechanistically? And should we expect some favorable results when you see the data later this year or early next year? Thank you. ","Bob Bradway","Yes. I'll be happy to address that question. So the question is around Lp(a). We've seen, I would say very encouraging data in the healthy volunteer portion of the first-in-human study. We are now dosing patients with elevated Lp(a) levels and expect to move into the next phase of that development program -- based on the promising clinical data that we've seen to-date in the early part of next year.","Like the siRNA approach, I can't comment specifically on other's molecules and antisense oligonucleotides. In the long-term safety will be a critical component of any of these development programs. In addition, I would point out that something like siRNA will probably be required to tackle Lp(a) because of the nature of the molecule and the types of modalities that will be necessary to actually lower levels.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence?","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Bob a big picture one. We've obviously seen a lot of M&A in the space recently. Just as you think about your capital allocation strategy how does the Enbrel litigation, I guess, fit into that? And again as you think big picture at what's going on in the industry how are you thinking about where Amgen can maybe play a role or a part? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","I think, Terence as I said in my remarks, we have a strong cash flow, a strong balance sheet. We think the company is performing well. And we think we can grow the business organically and we're also looking at ways to grow through business development. So we're -- I'd expect that we will continue to be disciplined looking at opportunities and our stated areas of therapeutic interest in the geographic regions where we have stated our desire to expand. But again we have a world-class business development effort and we continue to look at opportunities large and small.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen?","Kennen MacKay","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Murdo on Neulasta. I guess, I was just thinking about your guidance on the majority of the erosion coming from the prefilled syringe. Should we think that this is basically gone now given that Onpro still commands, sort of, mid-60% of this market and sales are down, sort of, 30% since biosimilar competition, or have we basically seen the impact of the biosimilars or is there is still more erosion to come? Thank you. ","Murdo Gordon","Yes. Thanks, Kennen. The trends that we're seeing are a function of obviously having now two competition -- two competitors in the market. And since the advent of the second competitor we've seen -- clearly seen more volume erosion and more price erosion. We are assuming that we could still see an additional competitor this year. And I would say that the current trends on the prefilled syringe will continue and we may see some price pressure on Onpro. What we are seeing with Onpro is stable unit evolution quarter-on-quarter and that makes us feel good about the differentiation that Onpro provides both physicians and patients and the convenience and persistency that it offers. I think looking forward we continue to think that this is going to be a competitive biosimilar place \u2013 space.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Jay?","Jay Olson","Well, hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thank you for taking the question. There was a recent German court ruling in favor of Amgen confirming that Praluent infringes on your PCSK9 patents. And I was wondering, if you could please share any thoughts you had on how market dynamics may evolve in Germany or other markets, if there are any where Praluent may no longer be available.","Bob Bradway","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jay. First, the European Patent Office upheld our intellectual property for Repatha and upheld the innovative contribution that we've made to the field with that product. The German courts found that they infringed obviously that IP and instructed them to \u2013 will be removed from the market.","Sanofi filed an appeal and that matter is under review. Our focus of course will be on making sure that, whichever patients need a therapy are able to receive it and we think we're in position to be able to satisfy the needs of that market. But I think you're right that Germany is another market now where our IP has been upheld. As I said, the European Patent Office upheld our IP more broadly in that region. That follows Japan, which has also found in our favor. And of course, as you know, we've had two trials in court in the U.S. on the matter both of which where jury trials had found in our favor. So the IP process continues to move forward in Europe, Asia and the United States.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael?","Michael Yee","Hey, great. Thanks for the question. David Reese on KRAS you talked about responses in colorectal et cetera. Maybe just going back to lung, can you comment on confidence around longer-term durability in monotherapy? And then to the comments around enrollment with the combination PD-1 talk about what you would expect to see there and when we could get first data as I \u2013 obviously, I would assume that's an exciting opportunity? Thanks.","David Reese","Yeah, thanks Mike. Yeah, in terms of durability as I mentioned, we will be presenting a clinical update at the World Lung Conference in September. But I would say that to-date we've been favorably impressed with potential durability. We have to all recall that it's early days and many of these patients have been recently enrolled on trials, so we'll gain further insight into durability as time goes on. But at least, to-date we are not seeing for example the rapid emergence of resistance.","In the PD-1 combinations, we have what I think are very strong preclinical data suggesting potential synergistic interactions between KRAS inhibition and checkpoint inhibition, probably due to enhanced immune infiltration and up-regulation of Class I MHC on tumor cells. And our goal with that kind of combination would of course be very long-lasting durable remissions.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia?","Alethia Young","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One question and maybe one clarification. Just can you talk a little bit about in the Repatha situation with the co-pays like kind of where are the moving pieces there to kind of get the ball rolling? Is it just mostly negotiations? And maybe why is it occurring? And then on KRAS, are you planning on dosing beyond 960 in colorectal? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon","Okay. So Alethia maybe I can start with the Repatha question, and then I'll turn it over to Dave. As you know, the PCSK9 market is a competitive one. And given that competition last year, there were payer negotiations and contracts that occurred, and since then some commercial access improvements have been realized.","I would say that, our reduction of the \u2013 our introduction of the low list price Repatha in October of last year was to try to improve the Medicare Part D reimbursement, and we recognized at the time that we were off-cycle or mid-cycle in the normal process by which PBMs and other payers produce their Part D benefit designs.","And so while we had hoped that some payers and PBMs would move quickly to add low list price Repatha to Medicare Part D formularies at a fixed co-pay that has not transpired. So we are optimistic that we will be able to make a significant improvement in Medicare Part D fixed co-pay listings for Repatha as we enter the 2020 Medicare Part D formulary benefit year, and we will know that in the fourth quarter.","David Reese","Great. And in terms of dosing in colorectal cancer beyond 960 milligrams, as I mentioned we've enrolled right now a fair number of patients at that target dose. I think we'll look for insights from that cohort. It remains early in this development program. And with these drugs of course, there is often tweaking of dosing and scheduling as you go along. But I would say that at this point 960 is our target dose. We will assess emerging data to see if we want to explore some other doses and schedules going forward.","Why don\u2019t we take two last questions, Ian, and then we\u2019ll wrap-up.","Operator","Very well. Our next question is from the line of Do Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Do?","Do Kim","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just on the acquisition of Nuevolution, I was hoping you could provide some context on the decision to acquire and bring the platform in-house versus just licensing additional programs or buying another company with assets in the clinical stage? And what is the plan for their existing collaboration and the potential for new ones?","Bob Bradway","Yeah, sure. I'll be happy to address that. So, the Nuevolution acquisition actually grew out of a partnership that we had with them on programs that was quite successful. And when we looked at the breadth of expansion of that potential partnership, we thought that simply bringing them onboard made sense.","In terms of their existing obligations, obviously those are things that we will fulfill as we move forward. I would point out that we plan on and have established them as Amgen Research Copenhagen, and they will remain a stand-alone Amgen research site going forward. And we're incredibly enthusiastic about what we think is world-leading technology.","Arvind Sood","Okay. Ian, let's take one last question if there is one. After which, Bob will make a few closing comments, and then I'll close the call.","Operator","Very well. Our final question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Salim?","Salim Syed","Hey, guys. Thanks for the taking the question. Hey, Bob, I appreciate the commentary on M&A. I just had a follow-up on it. And I totally understand you're looking at how to grow the top line both internally and externally. But, I guess what would you say to what are the gating factors have been? Why haven't you done more M&A this year? Is it the science that you're not seeing something that you won or is it valuation? Is it FTC, or do you truly believe that the highest ROI you can get right now is just buying back your own stock? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","I think Salim, we look at a range of opportunities. I think valuations have been stretched. It's been hard for us in some of the things that we liked to find transactions at prices that we think can earn a return for our shareholders. It's easy to earn a return for the target shareholders, where we're keen and focused on trying to earn the return for our shareholders. So, that's clearly been a consideration for us more than anything else I think.","But again, we continue to look for opportunities and fully expect that by being disciplined we'll find ones that enable us to win for our shareholders and to invest in programs that can help us grow the company. So, we're optimistic. We're pleased that we have the resources to be able to move forward, and money is not burning a hole in our pocket.","Arvind Sood","Okay. So, with that, Bob, do you want to make some closing comments?","Bob Bradway","Sure. Let me just end where I started, which is to say that we're pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, and excited about our long-term prospects, which we think are driven in large part by what we think will be unit volume gains across a number of our important products, and excited as well about our innovative pipeline and the prospect of branded biosimilars adding to our top line.","And let me just finally thank our Amgen staff around the world, who continue to help us deliver on our mission to serve patients while remaining focused on driving value for our shareholders.","Arvind Sood","Excellent. Thanks Bob, and thanks to all of you for your participation. If you have any follow-on comments, questions, if you would like to continue the discussion, feel free to call us. The IR team will be standing by for several hours. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you greatly for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"2101":["Amgen Inc.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Okay. Thank you, Skinner. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to discuss our business performance for 2017 and our outlook for 2018. Although our results exemplify our focus on volume driven growth, tax reform has created profound changes and opportunities for our industry and our company.","So to begin this dialogue, our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway will provide some perspective, followed by our CFO, David Meline who will review our Q4 and full year 2017 results and provide guidance for 2018. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will review our product and geographic performance in 2017, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update.","As in the past, we will use slides corresponding to our presentation today and a link to these slides was sent earlier. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today\u2019s presentation to provide information, which maybe useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today\u2019s press release, a Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2017 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Thank you for joining our call. We have more ground than usual to cover with you in our prepared remarks this afternoon. We will be addressing not only our results for 2017 and our outlook for this year, but also the impact of tax reform, which we see is a very favorable development for our business. To kick off, I would offer that with another year of strong performance behind us, we are even more excited about the long-term prospects for our business than we were a year ago.","In 2017, we continued to deliver solid operating performance as earnings per share growing 8% and operating margins improving to an industry leading 53.5%. In capital terms, payout to our shareholders grew by 14% as we improved our return on capital to 33%. We delivered these results in a period of increased competition for many of our largest products, several of which have lost patent protection and while continuing to invest heavily in the future of our business. Our steady progress through 2017 places us squarely on track to deliver against the long-term commitments we set several years ago for 2018. We entered 2018 in a strong position and confident about our long-term outlook. Those franchises which have come off patent in nephrology and oncology had held up well and we expect them to remain competitive. The brands that we expect to drive our future growth led of course by Repatha, Prolia, and KYPROLIS, with Aimovig and the biosimilars coming close behind are emerging now and the strong data we have to support them are encouraging.","And finally, we have stable cash flows and the strong balance sheet both of which are improved by tax reform. We intend to use our resources to continue to invest in our people and the attractive long-term growth opportunities we see in our industry, including M&A where it fits our focus while also returning capital to our shareholders. To be successful in the long run in our industry, we think it will be essential to have innovative, differentiated medicines that deliver large beneficial effects for patients suffering from serious illness and to demonstrate that these medicines provide value for all stakeholders in the healthcare system. We have a number of these medicines on the market now and in our pipeline, some of which meet the needs of large patient populations and some of which are for more specialized markets. With pressure on prices globally, we think revenue growth will be more tightly linked to volume growth and was the case historically. In this regard medicines that serve the needs of large numbers of patients will be particularly attractive growth drivers. Repatha is a clear example of this.","On this call last year, we announced the successful conclusion of the Repatha outcomes trial. Now following an expedited review by the FDA, we are able to talk to patients, payers and prescribers about the unique role of Repatha in significantly reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke. Cardiovascular disease is the single greatest problem facing healthcare systems around the world today. And as the population ages globally, this problem will only grow unless we embrace important new innovations. Repatha is exactly the type of innovation needed today by millions of patients to bring down the risk of cardiovascular disease. Our job now is to see the prescribers, patients and payers understand this product and recognize the importance of adopting it for high risk patients. As they do, we expect Repatha to be the important growth driver for us for many years to come. We will continue to work to ensure that patients gain access to this therapy worldwide especially those for whom other therapies have not proven effective.","Like Repatha, Prolia represented a paradigm change in biologic when it was first launched for osteoporosis. Today it is of course the leading osteoporosis therapy. In fact there are 3.5 million patients worldwide taking Prolia. And the demand for it continues to grow by double digit percentages. With only 25% of women in the U.S. who might benefit from osteoporosis therapy receiving it, we continue to see significant growth potential for Prolia in osteoporosis. In our pipeline, I will highlight two products which have similar attractive characteristics, but which address more symptomatic diseases. One of these is Aimovig and a first in class product to prevent migraine. Current therapies don\u2019t work adequately for this debilitating disease and patients and prescribers are anxious to have a better option. We are hopeful that Aimovig which uniquely blocks the CGRP receptor will be the answer that millions of patients have been waiting for.","The other product I will highlight is Tezepelumab, a first in class molecule that has shown very encouraging Phase 2 results in treating asthma there. There are millions of asthma sufferers worldwide in need of better therapy. We are hopeful that Tezepelumab might be just that and we are actively enrolling the Phase 3 trial to establish the answer. We have enjoyed great success in specialty markets historically and with our innovative medicines and we expect that to continue. XGEVA represents a good example of this. And with the addition of multiple myeloma to our label, we would expect to see more growth from this product beginning in 2018. In cancer more generally, overall survival is the gold standard.","We entered 2018 with fresh overall survival data in our labels for KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO. KYPROLIS has established strong share in second and later lines of multiple myeloma therapy. We expect the addition of overall survival data to strengthen its appeal to physicians, payers and patients. With overall survival for relapse refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients BLINCYTO was a game changer in its own right, but importantly it provides confidence for the long-term outlook for our broader BiTE platform. We have 12 BiTE programs progressing in both liquid and solid tumors. And data over the next 2 years will inform the future for many of these molecules. 2018 will be another year of new product launches for Amgen. In addition to our launch plans for Aimovig, we are extending our long-standing leadership in nephrology with the launch of Parsabiv, a specialty product for kidney disease in a number of companies \u2013 countries rather, including the U.S.","Finally, I want to highlight that we have clarity now around AMGEVITA, our adalimumab biosimilar. And we look forward to launching that internationally later in the year. This will be the first of our biosimilars to launch. We have a strong portfolio coming behind it with one other approval already and several Phase 3 programs waiting approval and launch. We think these recommend \u2013 represent compelling growth opportunities for us around the world.","We think tax reform provides a number of important benefits for our company. First, it puts us on a more level playing field strategically with our international competitors who previously were advantaged by lower rates and global access to their cash. Second, in addition to a more level playing field, tax reform clearly provides incentives for us to invest heavily in innovation and advanced technologies here in the U.S. and that is exactly what we will do. The timing of tax reform is particularly relevant for us right now as we are on the cusp of deploying our so-called next-generation bio-manufacturing technologies, which enable us to make biologics with much improved productivity, a smaller footprint and much reduced levels of waste and environmental impact. We developed these technologies in the U.S. and thanks to tax reform. We will now build new manufacturing capacity and add highly skilled jobs here in the U.S. to capitalize on them. It\u2019s worth noting that with tax reform we will make product in the U.S. and export it to cover 85% of our international sales.","With improved clarity on tax reform, we expect to invest on the order of $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in the U.S. over the next 5 years. We see tax reform benefiting us in other areas as well. Amgen Ventures, our vehicle for early-stage investing will also make close to $300 million available for new investments in innovative biotechnology, digital healthcare information companies. We will also grow our already substantial commitment to our communities with plans for the Amgen Foundation\u2019s investments in the proven Amgen scholars and Amgen biotech experienced programs, which we expect to reach $100 million of commitment within 4 years. We have engaged some 600,000 high school and college students in person through these programs consider this our commitment to helping build a pipeline of talented scientists and biologists in the U.S. and beyond.","Through our Foundation\u2019s philanthropic giving, we expect to deploy $100 million over the next 5 years in the communities where we work and live. We have also assessed the tax reform will be generally positive for our staff, especially for our non-executive U.S. staff who number about 12,000. We estimate that lower personal tax rates, combined with investments we are making in enhancing base wages for these staff, will create literally thousands of dollars of improvement in the average take-home pay for our typical U.S. non-executive staff member. When you pair all of this with the fact that some 90% of all Amgen staff members globally have held Amgen stock, you can see that the benefits of tax reform will be quite broad.","Finally, tax reform also provides us with more flexibility for capital deployment. Since 2011, we have invested more than $42 billion in research and development, innovation-based acquisitions and long-term oriented capital expenditures. We expect to continue making such long-term investments now, while also being able to return excess capital to our shareholders in the form of growing dividends and share buybacks. Based on our confidence and the long-term outlook for the business is enhanced by the benefits of tax reform we have increased our share repurchase authorization by $10 billion. We expect to retire shares on an accelerated basis this year as David will describe shortly.","As I highlighted for you, the benefits of tax reform for our shareholders do not come at the expense of others, but come in addition to the investments that we are making for our staff, the patients we are seeking to serve and our communities. So, to reiterate, we are operating the business well. You have seen that in our financials and you saw it in our successful response to the extraordinary challenge of Hurricane Maria too. Our in-market products are strong. We have attractive assets advancing in the pipeline and we have a strong balance sheet. Strategically, we are well-positioned to adapt to the growing pressures in the healthcare environment and to capitalize on consolidation opportunities for our shareholders.","Let me conclude with a word of thanks to our staff around the world for their tireless devotion to our mission. I can assure you they are focused on serving patients and driving growth in 2018 and beyond. Let\u2019s turn to David.","David Meline","Okay. Thanks Bob. Before I review our results and guidance, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our performance over the last several years. As Bob mentioned, we entered 2017 as another year, which presented significant challenges related to the transition of our portfolio as well as the evolving competitive dynamics of the industry as a whole. In the face of these expected and other not so expected challenges including Hurricane Maria, I am pleased to report that we delivered positive performance again in 2017. Additionally, with regard to our 5-year goals, we have already delivered or have clear line of sight to delivering on the commitments we established in 2014. The first goal was to achieve a substantial improvement in our operating efficiency agility and speed with the resulting outcome of the non-GAAP operating margin between 52% and 54%, representing a 15 point increase at the midpoint. We achieved this objective starting in 2016, 2 years ahead of our commitment.","Second, in 2017 we delivered the $1.5 billion transformation savings commitment and will exceed that goal in 2018. Third through our next-generation bio-manufacturing capability as well as other efforts to optimize our fixed capital infrastructure, we are on track to meet our 2018 goal of reducing our facility footprint by 23%. Finally, based on today\u2019s 2018 guidance I am pleased to confirm our expected delivery on the other key objectives of both double digit non-GAAP EPS growth and providing returns to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period 2014 to 2018. These commitments are being achieved before benefiting from tax reform which further enhances Amgen\u2019s performance in 2018 and beyond.","Now let\u2019s turn to the fourth quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck. Revenue at $5.8 billion declined 3% year-over-year. This quarter we saw worldwide product sales at $5.6 billion as unit demand from our growth products largely offset mature product declines. We are particularly encouraged by our 10% year-over-year volume growth in markets outside the U.S. reflecting the value of our innovative products in these international markets, many of which have experienced biosimilar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years. Other revenues at $233 million, decreased $69 million year-over-year as a result of the milestone payment received in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the out-licensing of AMG 139.","Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income at $2.6 billion declined 11% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 45.9% for the quarter. As previously indicated our operating expenses reflected the typical underlying fourth quarter pattern. We also experienced a number of additional expenses in the quarter including $79 million of Hurricane Maria recovery costs, incremental expenses accelerated for tax planning purposes, as well as inventory related costs. Finally, we increased our investments in support of volume driven growth as we expand activities for our products addressing unmet medical needs in large patient populations, including launch preparations in advance of the upcoming Aimovig launch. These increases were partially offset by continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment on October 31, 2016.","Other income and expenses were a net $31 million expense in Q4. This is favorable $171 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year favorability was primarily due to higher interest income, gains in our venture portfolio and gains from investment portfolio rebalancing in the fourth quarter of this year, coupled with favorable compares on both of these items in 2016. A portion of these activities were taken in anticipation of changes in tax and accounting standards effective in 2018. The non-GAAP tax rate was 16.6% for the quarter, a 2.1 point improvement versus Q4 of 2016 reflecting favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings this year. While not impacting our non-GAAP P&L, we incurred a $6.1 billion charge on our fourth quarter GAAP P&L related to U.S. corporate tax reform, including the repatriation tax and revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. The repatriation tax will be paid to the U.S. government over an 8-year period. Non-GAAP net income decreased 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share, was flat year-over-year for the fourth quarter.","Please find a summary of our 2017 full year results on Page 7 of the presentation. Our 2017 full year revenues declined 1% to $22.85 billion, while our non-GAAP earnings per share grew 8% to $12.58 per share. For the full year, we saw flat worldwide product sales growth of $21.8 billion. Changes in foreign exchange had a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales for the full year on a year-over-year basis. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income at $11.7 billion grew 2% from prior year, including $146 million of nonrecurring expenses associated with the recovery from Hurricane Maria. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved by 1.2 points to 53.5% for the year as we realized the benefits from our ongoing transformation initiatives and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 5.2 points to 13.5% driven primarily by expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery efforts. Unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs offset partially by lower royalties and manufacturing cost efficiencies.","Research and development decreased 7% year-over-year driven primarily by lower external business development expenses and lower spending required to support certain later stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses decreased 2% year-over-year due to the expiration of the Enbrel residual royalty partially offset by our increasing investments to drive volume growth in our products, which address unmet needs in large patient populations. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 3% year-over-year to $11.2 billion. Through the end of 2017, overall operating expenses have decreased by approximately $500 million versus 2013 levels. Included within this total is an incremental annual expense of $1.5 billion required to launch and maintain new products, build out new therapeutic areas, advance our biosimilars business and increase our global presence. Other income and expenses were favorable by $255 million on a year-over-year basis due to higher interest income on our higher cash balances as well as venture portfolio gains and milestones we realized across the course of the year. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18% for the full year, down 0.8 points versus 2016. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by changes in the geographic mix of earnings offset partially by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation payments.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 8. For the full year 2017, Amgen continued to demonstrate strong and durable cash flow generation with $10.5 billion in free cash flow versus $9.6 billion last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and favorable changes in working capital. Cash and investments increased to $41.7 billion. This balance included $3.1 billion in the U.S. and $38.6 billion outside the U.S. Total debt outstanding at year end totaled $35.3 billion and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 12 years. In 2017, we deployed $3.1 billion to repurchase 18.5 million shares at an average of $169 per share. At the end of 2017, we had $4.4 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.","Additionally for 2017, we increased our dividend per share by 15% to $1.15 per quarter, with payments totaling $3.4 billion. Based on our confidence in the future outlook for the enterprise and our continued commitment to our capital allocation strategy, we also announced a 15% increase to the dividend to $1.32 per share for the first quarter of 2018.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2018 on Page 9, 2018 will be another important year for Amgen as we continue investing in the pipeline, building out our global business and supporting our new product growth. In anticipation of this opportunity we transform the business over the past several years to enable us to fully invest from a position of strength. This transformation allows us to deliver industry leading financial performance while continuing to invest for long-term growth and success. Our 2018 revenue guidance is $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $12.60 to $13.70 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance reflecting the impact of tax reform is 14% to 15% and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million this year.","There are several key assumptions embedded in our outlook that I would like to take a moment to share. First, our revenue guidance reflects both continued positive momentum from our newer products as well as evolving competitive dynamics related to our legacy products. We have important growth opportunities with the inclusion of outcomes data in Repatha\u2019s label. Our plan to launch new products including Aimovig and AMGEVITA and the added flexibility enabled by tax reform to use our strong cash flow and balance sheet to drive continued growth of the company. We also embrace the potential challenges including the possible generic competition to Sensipar, continuing competitive dynamics for Enbrel and expected new competition against Neulasta and Aranesp. With regard to Sensipar, although the composition of matter patent expires in March, we are involved in litigation over pediatric exclusivity with the FDA and separately over the formulation patent with potential generic competitors. Although we believe in the strength of our position uncertainty as to the timing of competition will remain until the outcome of these litigations becomes clear. Also note that historically the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter for the year. For 2018, we expect this pattern to continue. Tony will provide further details related to this in this remarks.","With respect to other revenue, for the full year 2018 we expect to see 15% year-over-year growth. The quarterly run rate will be impacted by an unfavorable true up of a royalty in Q1, offset by incremental milestones in the second half of the year. From an operating margin perspective since 2016 we have delivered on our commitment of a non-GAAP operating margin between 52% and 54%. And based on today\u2019s guidance we expect to again operate in this range in 2018 as we continue to invest in our products to drive volume growth in large patient populations. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate incremental investments including acquisitions to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. The recently passed tax reform legislation provides significant financial flexibility in the form of a globally competitive tax rate and immediate access to the year end 2017 ex-U.S. cash balance of $39 billion.","With regard to 2018 guidance, our non-GAAP tax rate is forecast between 14% and 15%. This incorporates a 21% tax rate on U.S. earnings and 10.5% tax rate on ex-U.S. earnings. With regard to capital deployment, our principles over the next several years are as follows. First, we will invest in our business as we continue to expand our pipeline and seek to drive long-term volume growth globally across large patient populations. We will also invest in greater manufacturing capacity to support the volume growth we foresee. For the first time in several decades, tax reform enables us to competitively consider investment in the U.S. As a result over the next 5 years we expect to invest approximately $3.5 billion in capital expenditures. Starting in 2018, approximately 75% of that investment will be in the U.S., up from about 50% in recent years. As Bob mentioned a key component of our U.S. capital investment strategy includes a new drug substance manufacturing plant which will be built using our next-generation bio-manufacturing capability. We expect to complete this expansion in about half the time of a conventional plant for approximately one-third of the cost. In addition to investing internally, we continued to pursue external opportunities to accelerate the growth of our business in our chosen therapeutic areas as well as accelerating our global build-out.","Furthermore, we will invest an additional $300 million in our venture fund. Our venture fund is an important tool to ensuring we are appropriately informed, engaged and invested in cutting edge advances in science, technology and innovation. Since 2004, we have invested over $0.5 billion in our venture funds. In addition to their scientific importance, these investments have generated returns well above our cost of capital. Second, we will remain committed to an optimal capital structure in order to minimize or weighted average cost of capital by deploying any excess accumulative \u2013 accumulated capital and fully deploying cash flows going forward. As a first step to accomplishing this objective, we have received Board authorization to purchase up to $10 billion of our common stock. This is an addition to the previously approved share repurchase authorization which remained at $4.4 billion at the end of 2017.","Given the scale of excess capital we have to deploy, our plan is to proceed with the Dutch auction equity tender offer, consistent with the approach we used successfully in 2011. This tender offer would be for up to $10 million and would commence as early as next week. Further, we may repurchase up to our full authority in the first half of 2018. The optimization of a capital structure will result in higher net interest expense in 2018 and beyond as we will have less interest income due to lower cash balances. For 2018 this results in expected other income and expense of $600 million to $700 million net expense. As we deploy our excess capital in the most efficient manner over the next several years, we could find that it is important prudent to pay some upcoming debt maturities in cash rather than refinancing in the market. This would translate directly into additional financial flexibility and debt capacity that we could choose to redeploy in the future.","Third, we will continue to provide meaningful returns to shareholders through both the previously mentioned share repurchases as well as continued dividend growth. Finally, today\u2019s revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges are wider than we typically have provided at the start of the year, which is primarily a reflection of the range of sense of our scenarios in addition to the other ongoing uncertainties outlined earlier. It is important to recognize that our guidance today does not include the impact of potential future M&A activities. In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2017 and we remain confident in the outlook for Amgen success in 2018 and beyond.","This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony.","Tony Hooper","Thank you, David. I would like to begin with a few comments on our overall performance in 2017 followed by a review of our product performance. On the full year basis 2017 sales were in line with 2016 as the growth of our newer products offset the decline in our mature brands. We saw this play out again in quarter four as robust volume growth led by Prolia and our recently launched brands offset volume declines in Enbrel, ESAs and NEUPOGEN. Our international performance in quarter four led by Europe as David said was strong with 70% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by volume growth of 10%. The European portfolio has already transitioned to the majority of sales from newer brands leading to strong volume growth for the overall portfolio.","I am pleased with our execution in 2017 and our team has made excellent progress across a number of strategic fronts in building the foundation for long-term volume driven growth. We drove volume growth across several important brands led by Prolia. We defended Enbrel and several of our material brands against increasing competition. And we executed some patient focused lifecycle management strategies. We continue to advance our recently launched products with impressive new clinical data. The most significant of course being Repatha OUTCOMES data as well as three new sets of overall survival data, two for KYPROLIS and one for BLINCYTO. We also began laying the foundation for our next wave of launches as we prepare for Aimovig, a migraine product in the U.S. and AMGEVITA, our Humira biosimilar in Europe later this year. This will be an exciting milestone as we begin to commercialize our biosimilars in 2018. I am confident that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities within our portfolio of innovative and differentiated medicines.","Turning now to our product performance, Prolia ended 2017 with another impressive quarter of 24% growth year-over-year. On a full year basis, Prolia grew 20% and as Bob said now presold with 3.5 million patients globally. In the U.S. we achieved a record number of new patient starts in 2017. After 7 years in the market this growth of new patient initiation underscores the continuing unmet medical need. Once patients are initiated on Prolia we have a good track record of sustained repeat injections. While this is a great progress, there are 100 million patients worldwide who suffer from osteoporosis. In the U.S. one in every two women above 50 will suffer an osteoporotic fracture. So we continue to work to improve both the diagnosis and the treatment of osteoporosis as we grow Prolia\u2019s market share within the market. With this unique profile and through continued and sustained investment, we expect Prolia will remain a very strong growth driver.","Turning on to our oncology brands, KYPROLIS grew 24% year-over-year with strong performance internationally. Uptake in these markets remains robust. Fourth quarter sales in Europe have doubled from the fourth quarter 2016. In the U.S. KYPROLIS now has two compelling sets of overall survival data in both doublet and triplet regimens that demonstrate a 21% reduction in the risk of death versus standard of care in each setting. The FDA just approved adding the impressive overall survival data from endeavor study to a label. KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone is the only preferred doublet regimen in the NCCN Guidelines. We look forward to the equally impressive overall survival data from ASPIRE being added to our label later this year. These data are, without doubt, differentiators and should reset the treatment paradigm as the new standard of care for relapse multiple myeloma patients.","Our focused message to physicians is pretty clear. Patients will relapse or live longer when treated with regimen that includes KYPROLIS. And early indications are showing that this is presenting well as KYPROLIS share up new relapsed or effective patients continues to improve. XGEVA grew 4% year-over-year driven by a combination of volume growth, changes in the inventory and net selling price. We are pleased to begin the year with the FDA\u2019s approval to expanding XGEVA label to include the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with multiple myeloma. This approval was nearly a month ahead of the producer date and within five days of approval the first multiple myeloma patient received an injection of XGEVA. A large portion over 100,000 multiple myeloma patients in the U.S. are at risk for bone complications. XGEVA can help these patients as many of them cannot be effectively be treated with zoledronic acid due to renal insufficiency. CMS has recognized this issue and has designated XGEVA as a novel therapy for these patients. This is another example of our lifecycle management strategy and investment in volume driven growth.","Neulasta sales were flat year-over-year as we continue to see low single-digit decline in the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens due to growth in new and less toxic therapies. Onpro continues to gain traction and we exited 2017 slightly above 60% of the U.S. Neulasta units sold. Its compelling value proposition for patients and the healthcare system is clear. It delivers better adherence to therapy, lower rates of febrile neutropenia and hospitalization and more convenience for patients and oncology practices. Our patent protected Onpro will be an important point of differentiation in the marketplace against future potential competition.","On the topic of potential new competition during the last year in the U.S., we know there continue to be a serious amount of questions about where the competitors will be announcing their arrival in the market for some years now. We will be able to succeed with regulators and in the courts such as they could finally come to market in the second half of 2018. If they do arrive we will be ready for them. With Neupogen, the impact of short-acting biosimilars in the fourth quarter were consistent with prior trends as we exited 2017 with maybe 40% unit share on the short-acting market. We continue to maintain pricing discipline since the entry of competitors.","Now turning to Enbrel which declined 13% year-over-year, underlying volume demand was in line with prescription trends in the fourth quarter. Second, growth in rheumatology and dermatology as well as changes in Enbrel\u2019s volume share across each segment was in line with prior quarters. As I told you last quarter maintaining Enbrel\u2019s strong forming position and patient access is resulting in a small decline in net selling price. We expect the fourth quarter trends for both unit demand and net selling price to continue into 2018. You will also recall the first quarter last year was the lowest quarter of 2017 as insurance re-verifications and patient deductibles reset for the new calendar year. We expect to experience similar dynamics this year and therefore expect Enbrel\u2019s first quarter to be the lowest sales for 2018, representing approximately 20% of full year 2018 sales.","Critical to our strategy of Enbrel is the ongoing pursuit of innovative ways to enhance patient experience and to differentiate our product. The Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch was recently launched along with a new low-paying formulation. This is a multiuse device, specifically designed to be used with ease by rheumatoid arthritis patients. Patient feedback has been very positive on these new innovations and we are also very proud of the positive environmental benefits of this reusable auto injector.","Switching now out to our ESA portfolio, Slide 21 shows the 2017 composition of our ESA business. Aranesp declined by about 7% on a year-over-year basis with lower unit demand, favorable prior year adjustments and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. With EPOGEN the underlying business remained relatively stable with the primary driver being lower net selling price as a result of our extended supply agreement with DaVita until 2022. Over the last couple of years we have grown our U.S. Aranesp business by converting the medium size and independent dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. As of we are aware that our long-acting competitor has recently extended their product offering to these dialysis customers, so we expect to lose some of this business as early as this quarter. We are also preparing to compete for their potential short-acting biosimilar in all customer segments including hospitals and clinics if and when such a biosimilar is approved by the FDA. Our long track record of safety, efficacy and reliable safety, supplier and reliable supply is a competitive advantage that Amgen has always had.","Turning now to cosmetics, beginning with Parsabiv, we continue to launch Parsabiv in new markets throughout the world. This includes launching in the U.S. last month. As the head-to-head clinical data showed Parsabiv demonstrated a greater level of efficacy when compared to Sensipar. Since the products has administered in the patient\u2019s existing IV line during dialysis it was controlled into the hands of the healthcare provider which could drive an improved level of adherence. Nephrologists continue to be positive and are excited about having the product available. As David mentioned, the 2018 outlook for Sensipar is somewhat uncertain given the ongoing litigations. It is of course conceivable that competitors maybe able to bring generic products to market at some point in 2018 although we believe we have strong litigation positions.","With Repatha we continued to execute competitively maintaining our majority share on a global basis. We are very excited to exit 2017 with the expedited approval by the FDA of Repatha outcomes data. This is very important milestone for Repatha and its potential to help cardiovascular patients at high risk of heart attacks and strokes. Our team can now for the first time speak directly to the benefits of treating patients with the Repatha and its ability to reduce the risk of heart attack by 27% and stroke by 21%, as well as further event reductions after the first year of treatment. Our sales teams were trained are in the field shortly after the approval and are receiving positive feedback from physicians. It\u2019s still early days since the approval, but signs are pointing in the right direction with NBRX guidance.","We do however expect quarter one sales to be relatively flat sequentially as Repatha faces similar dynamics as Enbrel related to insurance reverification and resetting of patient out of pocket costs in the first quarter. We continue to work payers to improve patient access and are making progress. Our priority remains reaching the large population of high risk cardiovascular patients. The cost to society of not treating these presentations is unacceptable. And we are looking at all options to improve access for appropriate high risk patients. We also look forward to having the Repatha labels updated with the outcomes data outside the U.S. soon. So 2018 will be an important year as we continue transition of our portfolio and lay the groundwork for sustainable volume driven long-term growth. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their impressive and competitive execution in 2017. I look forward to facing with them the challenges and more importantly the opportunities. In 2018 we are bringing our innovative medicines to previously healed patients around the world.","And I will pass it to Sean. Sean?","Sean Harper","Thanks Tony. Good afternoon. I will begin with cardiovascular, with the recent inclusion of our cardiovascular outcomes data in U.S. label Repatha is the first and only PCSK9 inhibitor approved to prevent heart attacks, stroke and coronary revascularization in adults with established cardiovascular disease. We now have numerous professional guidelines and treatment pathways along with the FDA all recognizing the ability of Repatha to reduce life changing events from stroke and heart attack. And we expect payers to take an increasingly more thoughtful approach to patient access. In inflammation, we began dosing Tezepelumab in our 52-week Phase 3 study in over 1,000 patients with severe uncontrolled asthma in our collaboration with AstraZeneca. I would note that the primary endpoint in our Phase 3 program is the same as the one we reported for the Phase 2b study where we demonstrated efficacy across a broad spectrum of patient types. We have also reacquired our IL15 antagonist antibody AMG 714 after our cell immune collaboration generated intriguing Phase 2a data in severe celiac disease. We will be discussing the data and potential path forward with regulators are they are not clearly established endpoints for registration in this area.","In neuroscience we and Novartis are looking forward to the FDA PDUFA date for Aimovig in May. I am often asked about our approach with the CGR receptor antibody versus the ligand and how it differentiates. We targeted the receptor because we wanted the most potent antibody we could develop to reduce the amount of antibody required for maximal clinical effect. And our expertise in antibody discovery and development allowed us to succeed at this. With Aimovig we can elicit maximal CGRP inhibition with a relatively low doubts we have submitted 70 milligram and 140 milligram per month to regulators compared with higher doses with the ligand sequestrants. This translates into monthly subcutaneous self-administration with the pen type auto injector that uniquely does not require loading doses which we believe will be much more attractive the patients and providers. Also as we have seen in other diseases having mechanistic choices is an attractive option for physicians and patients. And Aimovig is the first and only CGRP receptor antibody ever introduced to the clinic. We have also executed a differentiated development program with Aimovig with a dedicated cardiovascular treadmill study in patients with stable angina and most recently demonstrated efficacy in a large study of patients with multiple prophylactic treatment failures who are not only considered difficult to treat, but also have virtually no other treatment options.","Turning to oncology and KYPROLIS, the U.S. prescribing information was recently updated with the overall survival data from endeavor which also received a positive opinion in Europe. The ASPIRE overall survival data have also been submitted in both regions. Having survival data from two studies established KYPROLIS as the new standard of care for relapsed multiple myeloma. XGEVA was recently approved for the prevention of skeletal related events in multiple myeloma for patients in the U.S. As Tony mentioned, this is an important advance as myeloma patients often develop renal insufficiency, which hinders treatment with bisphosphonates putting them at increased risk for bone complications. XGEVA is not cleared through the kidneys and provides an important new treatment option. We also received the results of the Phase 3D care study, with XGEVA. D-CARE was initiated in 2010. With the hypothesis, the treatment with denosumab could potentially delay cancer recurrence in bone or other tissues in patients with early-stage breast cancer. D-CARE explored an investigational dosing schedule of denosumab as adjuvant treatment for women in high-risk early breast cancer stages receiving standard of care neoadjuvant or adjuvant cancer therapy.","Unfortunately, the trial was neutral and did not meet its primary endpoint of bone metastasis free survival. Adverse events observed in patients treated with XGEVA were similar to the known safety profile. Detailed results will be submitted to the future medical conference and\/or publication. I\u2019d like to stress this result has no bearing on the approved and well-established indication for the prevention of skeletal-related events in breast cancer patients with bone metastases.","Finally, in other European regulatory news, Nplate received a positive opinion in Europe recommending approval for the treatment of chronic ITP for patients 1 year of age or older were refractory to other treatments and BLINCYTO received a CHMP positive opinion to include overall survival data from the Phase 3 TOWER trial supporting conversion from conditional to full market authorization in the current indication. We had the opportunity to provide a detailed update on our oncology franchise and our excitement around our differentiated approach to immunooncology at the American Society of Hematology Meeting in December. There we announced that we developed a half-life extended BiTE format and had moved three of these into the clinic, with several others in preclinical development. We now have 7 BiTE programs in the clinic and expect data generated in the next 18 to 24 months in both hematologic and solid tumors to provide key insights on the clinical utility of this platform.","We are in the unique position to evaluate both BiTE and CAR-T programs, in some cases, directed against the same antigen and in fact we have an IND in place for our first CAR-T from the Gilead, Kite collaboration. We will begin dosing patients a bit later this year. We also highlighted our commitment to multiple myeloma specifically with our MCL-1 and 2 inhibitor; 2 BCMA targeted BiTEs and a BCMA antibody drug conjugate all moving through Phase 1 and our bi-specific T-cell engaging antibody directed against CD38 licensed from Zencor, which will begin dosing this year as well. In our bone franchise, UCB recently submitted EVENITY in Europe for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture. We continue to systematically reevaluate all registrational clinical trial data to ensure we have the most comprehensive understanding of the cardiovascular safety signal observed in the active-comparator ARCH study. And we will work in close collaboration with the FDA toward our resubmission under the complete response letter timelines in the U.S. later this year. Lastly, we continue to make good progress on our biosimilars with the European approval of our biosimilar, Avastin. We also expect Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis data from ABP 710, our biosimilar REMICADE later in the year.","In closing, I would like to thank all of my colleges at Amgen for another year of successfully advancing programs for the benefit of patients. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Okay, thanks. Skinner, let\u2019s go straight to the questions and could you please remind our callers of the procedure for asking questions and let me just give them a heads up that will go longer than usual because advertising at the beginning of my remarks we were going to be little bit longer in our prepared portion. So, we will stay and take the questions from the analysts. Skinner, let\u2019s jump to it.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, can you really be clear about what percentage of your write-ins was influenced by biosimilars to what looks a real impact? And for Sean, when you think about your pipeline which is really broad and [indiscernible] all the options that are available? And now, when you think about the probably adjusted value in the pipeline, can you help us understand how to value that pipeline to offset the biosimilar impact? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay, Robyn, we are having a little bit difficulty hearing you, but I think your first question was unlike was one that we should ask David to address, I think you were asking how much of the wide range in revenue guidance was attributable to biosimilar. So, I think David try to make it clear that a lot of it was related to Sensipar, but we are going to have David to address that.","David Meline","Yes, right. So, if you look at the guidance that we offered it\u2019s obviously much larger than we would typically have about double what we would have at the beginning of the year. And certainly, a large portion of that is attributable to the uncertainty around the launch, the competitive launches that may occur this year from Sensipar. So, that\u2019s the primary driver of the broader guidance than we typically would offer.","Bob Bradway","And again, Robyn, it wasn\u2019t clear what you are trying to get at with your question was the pipeline, but Sean go ahead.","Sean Harper","Yes. I mean, I think it had to do with the value of the pipeline versus obviously the pressures we are facing on some of our legacy products as they go through the portfolio transition. I would just say that you are right, Robyn, we do have a very broad and deep capability these days. It\u2019s the best it\u2019s ever been at Amgen in my opinion. And I think that what you can observe is that across the key therapeutic areas that we are focusing in, we have a lot of really exciting opportunities. And I think that we can expect to see the same sort of productivity with respect to advancing the pipeline over the next 5 years that we have observed over the last 5 years.","Bob Bradway","Okay, let\u2019s go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Chris Raymond","Thanks for taking the question. So, I have a question that I think it mostly related to Enbrel, there has been some dust kicked up recently with regard to payers in PBMs instituting some so-called co-pay accumulators, which don\u2019t allow co-pay assistance and other patient assistance to count against deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. From what I have read you guys have seemed to taking a really strong stance against this with some specific countermeasures and you are working to ensure that patient support actually benefits the patient. But I am just hoping if you could maybe put some brackets around the ranges of uptake that this phenomenon could have this year. And what other specific countermeasures you could take if your current measures don\u2019t work? Thanks.","Tony Hooper","It\u2019s Tony. So, let me respond to that one. You are correct that Amgen has made it pretty clear that we disagree with the concept of the accumulator. That fundamentally, our systems is, a, to assist patients who can\u2019t afford their co-pays that the agreements and contracts we have with these organizations is around making sure if patients get access. So, we put that in writing and made it clear to people. As I look at quarter one, I see a minimal impact to our Enbrel business because of these programs.","Operator","And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much for your question and for all the color in the presentation. Perhaps, David, could you comment a little bit on your balance sheet, you sort of alluded to the fact that there maybe some moving thoughts in your balance sheet and obviously you are bringing a lot of cash back. You are effectively un-levered despite the fact that you have significant debt given your cash position. As you look at opportunities across the industry, Bob, has been sort of quiet outspoken about the need for consolidation. And just wondering what kind of leverage would you be comfortable with given the visibility you have for the future cash flow. Would you be willing to sort of go up on a net basis to several times your EBITDA?","David Meline","Yes, Geoff. So, I guess the way I would think about the balance sheet going forward is I would look at how we have managed the balance sheet over these last several years. And we did that to optimize and get the lowest weighted average cost of capital and we did that without consideration of the offshore cash balances. So, we set our leverage and it\u2019s varied over the last several years out of peak after Onyx and then it\u2019s come down since that time. And I think it would be fair to assume that on a steady state basis, we would think about those kinds of balance sheet leverage ratios to be similar to what we have had in the past. Now, what I would say is that in the very near-term given the fact that we have such a large amount of capital that we will be deploying, it\u2019s quite possible as I mentioned in my comments, but we would pay some debt in the interim, but that wouldn\u2019t be mistaken to be where we think the ideal capital structure would be. So, I would refer again without reference to the cash we have been carrying, but just look at our leverage over these last several years, I think it\u2019s a good sort of guidepost for how we will manage the business going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a question for David, can you comment whether the guided 14% to 15% tax rate for 2018 is actually also the way we should think about a long-term tax rate? And then in 4Q \u201817 your OpEx went a bit higher than usual, do you expect the margin, the pre-tax operating margin to go back to the level you saw in the first three quarters in 2017 for the 2018 period? Thank you.","David Meline","Yes, sure. So, in terms of the tax rate post-2018, what I would say is that if you look at our guide for this year on a non-GAAP basis at 14% to 15%, our preliminary analysis would suggest to us that, that would be a reasonable outlook for the period post 2018 and I use some words preliminary and that sort of thing, because it\u2019s still evolving, but I think as a starting point, I think it\u2019s reasonable to think about that as a steady state type level of tax rate going forward. And then in terms of you are correct as I tried to articulate if you look at our operating expense performance in Q4, basically we typically have as you know, we typically have the highest level of expense is in Q4 on an annual basis. And to the extent, we had expenses beyond that this past year in Q4 of \u201817 those were basically an entirely one-time type expenses that we wouldn\u2019t expect to be recurring and that was related as I said to the hurricane costs, which are extraordinary and one-time as well as based on the fact that we had last year 35% tax rate versus taxes this year at 21% in the U.S. We looked at choices we might make around the timing of such discretionary expenses and time them into the period where we got to benefit from a tax perspective. So, with all of that, you go to 2018 as I said, our guidance would suggest to you until us that we expect to operate in the 52% to 54% range again this year. And I think you can expect the quarter-by-quarter patterns of margins and expenses to be quite consistent with what you have seen if you look at an average over the last several years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thanks for taking the question. David, I was hoping you could just help us breakout some items for 2018 guidance, particularly since you have got a couple of moving pieces in terms of the bottom line here if you could help us think about the impact that the tax rate had the impact of the buyback versus the underlying performance of the business? Thanks.","David Meline","Yes. So, I guess what I would say is that if you \u2013 well, first of all, I think the tax calculation is pretty straightforward in terms of take the 14% to 15% range and apply it to what would be pre-tax profit. I think I gave you a range in terms of both operating margin and what we expected below the line interest expense and income to be. So, I think that hopefully will get you to a pre-tax income that you can apply the tax rate against. And then in terms of the repurchase activity, we now have authorization in total of little more than $14 billion for repurchases. And as I said, we could see that deployed as soon as you know completion in the first half. Our guidance of course takes into consideration that if there is some range of timing possibilities that our guidance covers in terms of the repurchase effects. So, again I think you can apply some math to get to the share count and how that would impact your EPS. Then it\u2019s included in the guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up to Jeff\u2019s earlier question, Bob during your prepared remarks you mentioned you are well-positioned to capitalize on consolidation opportunities for your shareholders, just wondering if you would consider larger scale mergers or is that primarily built on similar to your prior history is Onyx is a recent example? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Well, I said two things Terence. I said we are well-positioned to address ongoing changes in healthcare environment. And we expect there will continue the ongoing pressure from the healthcare environment and that we were also well-positioned to capitalize on consolidation for the benefit of our shareholders. So we have been consistent for some time in saying that that we have the financial capacity and we are interested in looking for deals that we think we can add value to in our areas of focus, so we are going to continue to do that. And as the other question implied we have felt for some time that there are pockets of excess capacity in the industry and we will look to see whether we can help create some value by being part of the consolidation around those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies.","Michael Yee","Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. When I think about your 2018 guidance, I am sure that people are trying to get the details of that, but I am certainly trying to think that there is more uncertainties about beyond 2018, back in 2014 you gave a long-term strategic outlook and we delivered on that. But I think people are kind of worried about beyond 2018, what are the factors that you need to get through Bob or Dave to think about longer term guidance or maybe there is no need for longer term guidance, what are you thinking about? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","We will both take a shot at your question Mike. I think you are right, we felt there was a big disconnect in 2014. And we were confident about the long-term outlook. And we seem to be at a different place from our shareholders. So we found it\u2019s helpful to try and address that disconnect with longer term guidance. And we are \u2013 as we said, I think each of us said we are confident about the long-term outlook for our business now and excited about what we see as long-term growth potential of the company. But we continue to talk to our shareholders and get, take their counsel about the benefit of thinking about the guidance question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","Good evening and thank you to my questions. Just a quick clarification for Tony and then a question for Sean, Tony you mentioned that you are not seeing impact from the copay accelerator. My understanding of that, you will not expect to see one until late in the second quarter when patient begin to hit the maximum out-of-pocket costs. Do I have this wrong or is there something that we should see earlier in the year? And then for Sean on the BCMA program, obviously you guys are putting some resources against it, how good does those by specifics have to be for you just taking forward in comparison to what we are always seeing from a CAR T program since 50% or 70% or maybe just give us the parameters you are looking forward to see if the products are good enough?","Tony Hooper","So Ronny, to answer your first part of your question, this is Tony, the accumulator programs would of course depend on what the individual patient\u2019s deductible is. And as I said we are seeing and predicting minimal impact in the first quarter. And by definition I would therefore see minimal impact in the second as well by Amgen.","Sean Harper","Yes. With respect to our BCMA BiTE programs, I think our view is that it\u2019s going to be important for us to be able to demonstrate data. And these comparisons can be very complex, you know that the patient populations and the pretreatment of patients and things of this sort in the CAR T studies is often very different than this populations that we generate in our data set. So comparisons can be hard. But the bottom line is everyone that that we talk to in this field believes that if you can take a product like a BiTE off the shelf administers and get a similar degree of efficacy with potentially less of the safety risk and the enormous cost that can be associated with those safety risks in the hospital that BiTE would be a preferred modality. As I have said many times, I think there is a role for both of these modalities in the spectrum of care for even an individual patient in an oncology center.","Operator","And our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask three if I may, one on court decisions on from PCSK9 antibody patents that we thought last year, do you think they have any read across to the upcoming Enbrel district court litigation. Second on Sensipar and it seems like it\u2019s a big swing factor in your 2018 guidance, my question is this, there was an IPR on one of your 2026 patents which was never instituted, so in that context, the question I have is how the generic entry possible or is that another way, are you aware of a non-infringing formulation. And then finally just a quick one, how much CGRP in your 2018 guidance? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","So where is the third question, we are trying to track you there.","David Meline","CGRP in the 2018 guidance.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Umer, obviously we have ongoing litigation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to comment on your sensible question. I wouldn\u2019t try to read across \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t try to do the meta-analysis in intellectual property land across the two trials that you referenced. David do you want\u2026?","David Meline","We are obviously not going to give individual product guidance Umer at this point. We are excited about the product. We are excited about being first, so some dramatic population and the interest in having a new therapy that makes a big difference is high, but we are not going to give you individual product launch guidance at this point.","Umer Raffat","Okay.","Bob Bradway","Yes. Now let\u2019s take the next question and maybe you can just remind our audience as to limit themselves to one question, since we are running over way over today.","Operator","Yes. Please limit yourselves to one question, ladies and gentlemen. And our next question does come from Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. Bob, when you think about deals, how much of a priority is a return to top line growth versus just managing cash flow? And then very related, have you guys have explored \u2013 ever explored a split or some sort of segmentation of the business, just to separate the mature franchises from the early cycle products and pipeline? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay. Geoff, our focus when we look at deals is on we are looking to deploy capital that we think we can only return for our shareholders from, so it\u2019s very easy to find accretive deals, it\u2019s very hard to find deals that are both accretive and add to the long-term return on capital for our shareholders. So we are going to continue to be disciplined. We know the six areas that we are interested in. And with respect your second question, again I think you know our track record in this regard. We have been very active and very focused on looking at all ways to create value for our shareholders and we will continue to do that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt","Okay. Just a question for Tony on Repatha, is I am doing the math right on Slide 23 would be the volume and sales gains that you had, it looks like there was a net 15% quarter-on-quarter decline in Repatha\u2019s price, is that true and maybe you can provide some color what\u2019s going on there? Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Yes. I actually couldn\u2019t give you the details with that one right now. There was going to be a change in net price, but I don\u2019t think that it was that high. We can come back to you guys and give you the details on that. I don\u2019t have them with me.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethea Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethea Young","Great. Thanks for taking my question. One for Sean, are there additional Phase 2 programs would you consider for Tezepelumab, maybe anything in allergies or anything like that things?","Sean Harper","Yes. Right now, I think the things we are kind of excited about in Phase 2 are AMG301 in migraine, which is we are in a strong leading position with that mechanism and hope to see that it will be either synergistic with CGRP or address patients that don\u2019t respond to CGRP innovation. And we have also the aisle to new team program AMG592, I would highlight as a program that is moving into multiple Phase 2 autoimmune disorders. And that\u2019s a mechanism as you may know where we are able to affect the population of Treg cells in a profound way with this engineered form of IL-2. The number of our BiTE programs are while they are in Phase 1 that the next study for them could in fact like it was for BLINCYTO, be registration enabling. So this Phase 1, 2, 3 line gets pretty blurred in the oncology area particularly. So I consider a lot of the molecules that are in the clinic including our MCL1 inhibitor to be potentially in a pre-registration study as the next study type of status.","Operator","And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mine is on Repatha and I recognized it\u2019s really recent, but I missed it a little more color. On the early feedbacks you are getting from the field on the drug post the inclusion of CBOT in the label and really more importantly how much of a difference you expect the label to make given that you guys make it sound like it\u2019s still the payer access issue and payers have been aware of this data for a longer period of time? Thanks.","Tony Hooper","So, Tony here. Let me respond to that one, right. So, as I have said a couple of times, since launch, we have been able to talk to physicians about the product being able to lower LDL from a promotional perspective, which is probably 98% of our physicians who don\u2019t attend large congresses, we have not been able to be in a position to talk about the real benefit of Repatha dramatically lowering LDL and thereby reducing the risk out of heart attack and stroke. Just to give you an idea of how fast this has moved, we got the approval on the Friday at about 11:35 a.m. By Tuesday, we had trained our entire team of managers on actual promotional material. By the Thursday, we trained the entire sales force. By Saturday, we trained 250 cardiologists, speakers and by the next week, they had completed just over 200 speaker programs with an average of about 15 people attending each speaker program. I have never seen such rapid uptake of a speaker program from an exit \u2013 and these are promotional speaker programs, where the cardiologists are talking specifically from the new label. The feedback from sales force to-date has been very positive, people not truly understanding the value of what the drug does. And when I look at the last two weeks average NBRxs, they are about 18%, 20% higher than the average of the 4 weeks for December. So, yes, it\u2019s tough to read this early on, but we are seeing an uptick in new patients getting to getting approved. When I look at our payer or access environment, I see the commercial plans sort of January of 2017, are improving \u2013 have improved by about 8% in terms of the approvals. Our Part D coverage has improved by about 30%. So, we continue to work hard to make sure people understand the value of this drug. I think more and more cardiologists and physicians are putting forward appropriate patients and fighting for them to get on the drug.","Operator","And our next question comes from Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities.","Salim Syed","Yes, hi. Thanks guys for taking my question. I just had one on Repatha. So, Eugene Braunwald spoke recently at The Medicines Company Investor Day and spoke specifically regarding primary prevention with inclisiran. I was curious what your thoughts were on that and if there is any impact to Repatha as it relates to that. And specifically also do you think inclisiran can be inserted between a statin and Repatha? Thank you.","Sean Harper","Yes, hi, this is Sean. I will try to respond. I think obviously the kinds of populations that can be addressed with these agents are identical to the kind of populations that have been treated with statins over the years, we focused on a very high risk secondary prevention type population, although our label in both the U.S. and Europe is broader than that. And I think that it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to study high-risk primary prevention patients. However, when you look at the situation we faced right now where it\u2019s so difficult to get these drugs to patients who have experienced multiple events and have very high levels of LDL. I am not sure that\u2019s the direction strategically that I would go if I were going to do another OUTCOMES trial, but it\u2019s a reasonable thing to do. In terms of sequencing these therapies, if that all depends on the effect size that can be achieved, the safety profile of the novel mechanism of platform technology like siRNA in a very broad population. The bar is extremely high obviously from an efficacy safety perspective with Repatha.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets.","Ian Somaiya","Thank you for taking my question. I had another one on Repatha. You have previously commented on maybe willingness to speak with payers or negotiated with payers on rebates and pricing once CVOT was in the label, I guess we have gotten to that point. And then separately once the guidelines reflected the recommendations, I am just curious where are we from a price rebate negotiation standpoint, how much room is there for us to see changes in sort of the pricing structure of the PCSK9 going forward?","Tony Hooper","So, it\u2019s Tony. So as we have talked last year, we are in constant debate and discussion with payers and providers around the value of this drug, about the value-based pricing we have and the rebates that are being offered in the marketplace to ensure improved levels of access. So, we continue to work with the payers on an ongoing basis to ensure we get a good position on formulary that we have improved on the utilization management criteria with fundamentally just about every plan has improved on that one. Quite dramatically, we have with worked hard to ensure that we can assist patients where appropriate with co-pays that they are not able to afford or deductibles and unable to afford. And I don\u2019t think that work is going to stop for a while as we go forward.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank Equity Research.","Andrew Peters","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess maybe to just switch gears a bit on a slightly different topic on the next-gen manufacturing side, just wanted to see how and if this new technology could potentially impact margins? And then more broadly as you talk about kind of the made by Amgen stamp for the biosimilar franchise, as you think about biosimilar production in general, how do you think Amgen is differentiated and from a margin perspective as you think about biosimilars, is that something that can fit into your pricing strategy on a competitive basis as well? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","We take this in two parts. David and I can respond to your question, Andrew. First, with respect to next-generation manufacturing, we have been talking about this as you know for some time. We are delighted \u2013 and we are excited that global regulators have approved our first of these facilities in Singapore. And when we committed to that first again talking about some years ago we were clear that both as a consequence of lower capital cost and the meaningfully lower operating costs we would expect over time a benefit to be reflected across the sales line and that will happen. And generally we have said and we still believe that manufacturing is a source of competitive advantage at Amgen. We have a track record of supplying every patient every time and we think when it comes in particular to biosimilars, the reliability of the safe supply and reliable supply of biosimilar medicines from Amgen will be a differentiator.","David Meline","Yes, I guess I would add when we set out on the journey to get to our current margin structure we talked about a number of things that were contributing to us achieving that and certainly as Bob just talked about the first module of this next-gen manufacturing is now going to be helping us and this next module will continue to enable us to drive our competitiveness. I would caution against thinking that you should think there is a big step up from where we are operating right now, because I think we are operating in a very nice place in terms of our own competitiveness. And so think about driving continued cost down to enable us to then continue and increase our investments in particular in support of these new products that are going after very large patient population. So, we are thinking about continuously driving our cost base to allow us to invest heavily in support of growth for the business.","Bob Bradway","Skinner, as it\u2019s nearing 6:30 on the East Coast, let\u2019s take two more questions, please.","Operator","Absolutely. Our next question comes from Carter Gould from UBS Equities.","Carter Gould","Good evening, guys. Thanks for the questions and squeezing me in. For Sean, follow-up in the earlier question given all the excitement, recently we have seen agents focused on inflammation go relatively broad in terms of indications that you are proceeding relatively narrowly despite central role in inflammation. Is that more because of the rest of your portfolio of assets, risk mitigation approach or should we expect the list of indications to expand?","Sean Harper","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I mean, what I would say is that we believe that there is a particularly profound level of unmet need in asthma and for a agent that could be given to sort of all comers without having to parse patients by fairly complex criteria that are difficult to assess in the average clinicians office. So, I personally believe that that is an area of particular opportunity for biologic therapy like tezepelumab. I think that COPD, it represents another very substantial opportunity and because of the nature of this mechanism one could believe that it might be more likely to have efficacy in a setting like that. Then some of the other therapies that are directed more at the inflammatory cascades that downstream in asthma and there are other disease areas like atopic dermatitis that we continue to explore. And I am sure as with all of these products in the inflammation space once a product has a kind of an anchor core profitable indication, virtually every good idea and a variety if not so good ideas get explored by either companies or investigator-sponsored studies trying to find every possible nook and cranny where the product might work.","Operator","And our last question for the call comes from Kennen Mackay from RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen Mackay","Hi, thanks for taking the question. One for Bob and David here. David, you mentioned there was now the balance sheet strength to really sort of grow the business and really supports some of that capital and Bob sort of building up what you mentioned surrounding a focus on transformative therapies like a moving micrometer like Aimovig, like Prolia, like Repatha, just wanted to get a perspective on what was out there that you really sort of view it as interesting? We have seen a lot of consolidation in the CAR T space, do you have some exposure there owning a couple of the Kite, now Gilead programs. Is there anything like in-gene therapy or gene editing or does that really not align with the positioning of sales and volume converging in the years ahead?","David Meline","Yes, I guess, this is Meline. What I would comment on in terms of the opportunities out there we have been I think pretty clear that we are focused in particular on the six areas, where we have decided to establish a commercial presence. And so we tend to orient ourselves towards those opportunities and we are quite clear in the market that we want to see everything of any size that might be of interest to us across those areas and that Kennen maybe Sean would want to comment on technologies, but certainly\u2026.","Sean Harper","Yes. No, I would just since you mentioned some of these emerging technology platforms like gene-editing for therapeutic purposes or gene therapy that the earlier these kind of things are, the more likely it is that we will look at them even if they aren\u2019t in one of these six areas, because we felt there is a breakthrough opportunity emerging and we could bring to bear our scientific and manufacturing commercial capabilities and so on. We have shown that will move on those kind of things.","Bob Bradway","Alright. Well, I think Kennen, Sean and David did a good job answering the question, so rather than add to it, let me just again thank you all forbearance and call that went a little longer than usual from us. But just to wrap up, we are heading into 2018 as I think you can tell from our remarks. We are excited we think we are operating the business well. We have strong products. We have an attractive pipeline that\u2019s advancing rapidly. Strategically, we think we are well-positioned and focused on delivering growth and value for our shareholders. So, we look forward to reconvening with all of you in April and see how we do through the first quarter. Thank you.","David Meline","And I would just like to add my gratitude for your patience. We had a lot of topics to cover today of course between myself and my team we\u2019ll be standing by for several hours. So, if you have any other questions, feel free to call us. Thanks again.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation."],"1910":["Amgen, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request you to limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session.","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, DeMarcus. Good afternoon, everybody. So I'd like to welcome you to our conference call to discuss our second quarter financial results. I would like to particularly extend a warm welcome to those who are new in their investment coverage of Amgen, including Ronny Gal and Vincent Chen of Bernstein.","Our second quarter once again is a continuation of great execution of how we are effectively managing the life cycle of legacy products while launching new products. Of course, there's much more to our execution. So to have the broader discussion, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will lead the call with a strategic overview. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments.","So before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to note that we have reviewed the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent guidance regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and our press release incorporates this revised guidance. As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email.","We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release on Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great, thank you, Arvind, and thank you all for joining our call.","Our business continues to perform well, as you can see through the results the first six months of the year, with our revenues up 8% and our adjusted earnings per share up 13%. While delivering strong and consistent quarter-to-quarter performance, we're also investing successfully for the long term, and the elements of our long-term strategy for growth are clearly progressing as well. We launched six new products last year, two in the cardiovascular arena and four in cancer, and these products are still in the early stages of their launch cycle globally.","We remain particularly excited about the long-term prospects of Repatha and look forward to important clinical data, set to emerge later this year and early next year, which we think will help fully illuminate the value of this product.","Kyprolis is also a top priority. Based on the very strong clinical profile of Kyprolis, we expect this product to be a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy for the foreseeable future, and as such, for it to be used in combination with many of the new agents that are emerging in the field. Both of these products are making progress internationally, with additional regulatory approvals and reimbursement negotiations proceeding well.","Behind the recent launches of our six drugs for cardiovascular disease and cancer, we have programs nearing key regulatory milestones in four other therapeutic areas: neurology, where we are excited about erenumab as a potential first-in-class therapy for migraine; bone health, where we recently submitted our bone-building romosozumab to the FDA for regulatory review; nephrology, with the prospect of an imminent launch of Parsabiv; and of course in inflammation, where we were pleased with the recent FDA panel review of our biosimilar to Humira.","With an expected 80 new launches across countries and products this year and the recent reacquisition of rights to many of our existing products outside the United States, we're meaningfully expanding our global footprint. To that end, we recently announced that we have partnered with Daiichi Sankyo in an effort to bring Amgen biosimilars to the Japanese market.","I would also note that we're excited about the scientific progress we're making in our early research labs. For example, we continue to harness the power of our human genetics platform to uncover fundamental links to human disease. As you saw this quarter, we published research pointing to the role of the ASGR1 gene in cardiovascular disease. While this is still early stage, it highlights our unique ability to generate insights like this and to move them forward quickly in the drug development process. We expect insights such as this to be central to our ability to innovate and continue to deliver long-term growth and returns for our shareholders.","While we're focused on the long term, we're committed to delivering in the short and medium term as well. Our consistent strong performance has placed us well on our way towards delivering the long-term commitments we made to shareholders for 2018. The transformation program, which we began some two years ago, continues to deliver savings, enabling us to invest in our business and deliver results for our shareholders. Similarly, the commitment we made to effectively manage the life cycle of our legacy products is bearing fruit, as reflected in the success of our Neulasta Onpro launch and the success that we're having in offering Aranesp and EPOGEN to our dialysis customers.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we're active in looking for ways to build our business across our six therapeutic focus areas. And we expect to be patient and disciplined in looking for opportunities that we think we can add value to for our shareholders.","Before passing to our Chief Financial Officer, David Meline, let me just thank our staff worldwide for their ongoing dedication to our mission of serving patients and for the results they've once more delivered for our shareholders. David?","David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Bob.","Turning to the second quarter financial results on page six of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 6% year over year, with 5% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Other revenues at $214 million increased $69 million versus the second quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited from higher Ibrance royalty income as well as an upfront partner payment. As a reminder, we receive an 8% royalty on Ibrance revenue, which was acquired as part of the Onyx transaction. Changes in foreign exchange had an immaterial impact on total revenue and product sales in the quarter.","Non-GAAP operating income at $2.8 billion grew 10% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 51.4% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. In 2016 we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year, with half of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation occurring in the first half. Delivering on this transformation enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities while also achieving solid profitability.","On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5% improved by 1.6 points, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price. Research and development expenses at $878 million decreased by 4% versus last year, driven primarily by transformation and process improvement efforts and lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses increased 13% on a year-over-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches for the U.S. and global launch activities were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year over year.","Other income and expenses were a net $176 million expense in Q2. This is an increase of $97","million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year net expense increase was primarily due to gains in the second quarter of 2015 from our strategic and venture investment portfolio. We expect our other income and expenses to continue at the current year-to-date trend level.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, a 1.4-point decrease versus Q2 of 2015. This decrease reflects discrete benefits associated with tax incentives and the adoption of accounting standards 2016-09, partially offset by unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings.","Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year over year.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page seven, free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $3.2 billion in the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year decline reflects timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS and cash gains realized last year from foreign exchange contracts, which benefited from the strengthened U.S. dollar.","We deployed a $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $153 per share, and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our second quarter dividend was $1.00 per share, an increase of 27% over last year, which results in a dividend yield of over 2.5% on an annualized basis. At the end of the second quarter, we had $3.6 billion remaining on our board authorized share buyback program.","Cash and investments totaled $35 billion, an increase of $5 billion from last year's second quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which approximately $900 million was used to repay debt maturities during the second quarter. Our debt balance stands at $33.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 12 years.","Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on page eight, we remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing on our strategy and solid first half performance of the business. In particular, our overall revenue guidance reflects our recent product launch activities plus continued progress on our growth brands, which grew 13% year over year in Q2 and accounted for over 50% of overall product sales. All of this is while absorbing the impact of competition on our legacy EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN brands.","With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.10 to $11.40 a share versus prior guidance of $10.85 to $11.20.","Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.","This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Thanks, David. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the second quarter on slide number 10.","We continued our strong performance in the second quarter, with global product sales growing 5% year over year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth, and our international business grew 3%, or 5% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Europe was a strong contributor, with 11% unit growth.","My comments will be in three parts today: first, the performance of our growth products; followed by an update of our life cycle management of the mature brands; and then I'll conclude with highlights on the performance of our newly launched products.","Our six growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, ENBREL, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate, continue to drive our overall performance with 13% year-over-year growth. As David said, they aggregated to $3 billion of sales, or over 50% of second quarter sales. We continue our investments in these brands to achieve their full potential. Both Prolia and XGEVA are now annualizing at over $3 billion per year. Prolia grew 30% year over year with a 24% unit growth and continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe.","Post-menopausal osteoporosis remains a widely untreated disease. In the U.S. alone, 10 million people are affected, and 4.5 million of those are considered at high risk of fracture. Unfortunately, nearly 60% of these patients are not treated. We are investing in Prolia to reach these under-served patients and also to remind current Prolia patients about the importance of returning every six months for their treatment.","XGEVA saw a 15% year-over-year growth, driven by unit share gains of around two percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe. Quarter-over-quarter growth was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing from some larger end customers in the U.S. during the first quarter.","ENBREL grew 10% year over year, driven by changes in net selling price, partially offset by competition. As a reminder, changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes in list price as well as the impact from rebates we provide to payers and formulary decisions.","Turning now to the underlying performance of ENBREL, growth within both the rheumatology and dermatology segments continues. Sequentially, ENBREL lost two points of value share in each segment. Recall that rheumatology comprises about 80% of ENBREL sales. ENBREL has a long track record of safety, efficacy, and a very competitive profile. We are focused on maintaining our position, particularly in the rheumatology segment.","Sensipar grew 13% year over year, driven by net selling price as well as a strong unit growth in U.S. and Europe.","We look forward to expanding our presence in the nephrology market with Parsabiv, which is currently being reviewed by the U.S. and European regulators as a new treatment option for secondary hyperparathyroidism.","Next, Vectibix; we delivered strong unit growth in our core markets. However, this performance was masked by comparing against a quarter two in 2015 that benefited from an additional shipment to our Japanese partner.","Nplate grew 14% year over year, driven by double-digit unit growth.","I'd now like to focus on how we're managing the life cycle around mature brands. Neulasta sales decreased 1% year over year. The second quarter was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing by some large end customers in the U.S. in the first quarter.","I am pleased to report that the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit continued its strong uptake. Adoption is growing due to its ability to ensure maximum benefit of Neulasta while improving the patient experience versus the traditional pre-filled syringe. We exited the second quarter with Onpro representing about 40% of Neulasta units and still growing. We do not expect long-acting filgrastim biosimilar competition this year, so there remains a significant opportunity to further increase the adoption of Onpro.","As regards to NEUPOGEN, we see the short-acting segment playing out as expected. We ended the second quarter with around 6% share. We continue to compete account by account, emphasizing NEUPOGEN's sustained track record of safety, efficacy, and of course reliable supply.","Now to the ESAs; Aranesp sales increased 5% year over year, driven by 13% unit growth. In the U.S., we've been successfully transfusing about 75% of patients from EPOGEN to Aranesp in our medium-sized and independent dialysis centers.","EPOGEN declined 33% year on year. About one-third of this decline is the shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I just mentioned. Most of the remaining decline is due to a shift by Fresenius from Amgen ESAs to their own product. We understand that Fresenius, which has about one-third of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted about 80% of their patients. You'll recall that our contract with DaVita, who represent another one-third of the dialysis business, runs through 2018. We do not expect biosimilar competition against EPOGEN in 2016.","Lastly, I'd like to update you on Repatha and KYPROLIS. Both products represent substantial opportunity in addressing serious diseases with significant unmet needs, first Repatha. Our cardiovascular teams have executed well in the marketplace, but strict utilization management criteria and processes employed by the insurers and PBMs continues to be the biggest hurdle. We're working diligently to address these restrictions so that appropriate patients are able to access the treatment their doctors prescribe for them.","We look forward to the coronary imaging data from the GLAGOV study reading out later this year, and then the FOURIER outcomes data in the first quarter of 2017. We expect that both these studies will further underscore the value of Repatha.","We're also excited to now offer a new monthly dosing treatment option with our recently approved Repatha Pushtronex, the first and only single monthly injection of a PCSK9 inhibitor. Like the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit, this is another example of our ability to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience.","Outside the U.S., we continue to make good progress with Repatha's reimbursement negotiations on a country-by-country basis. In Europe, we are now in early launches in several countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Austria, and Sweden. Repatha is an extremely important medicine for high-risk cardiovascular patients, and we are committed to realizing its significant potential over time.","Now to KYPROLIS, where we've made great progress in the quarter. We continue to grow volume in an intensely competitive environment with three new competitors, all approved in the U.S. late last year. This growth is encouraging as we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of KYPROLIS as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Our focus is on continuing to drive adoption of KYPROLIS in relapsed patients based on the compelling ASPIRE and the ENDEAVOR data.","The early launches from our European organization into second-line are very encouraging. KYPROLIS has been well received and we continue to gain reimbursement approval country by country. The EU label now includes KYPROLIS in both a three-drug regimen based on the ASPIRE data as well as a two-drug regimen based on the ENDEAVOR data.","In summary, the second quarter was another strong quarter for Amgen. Our growth products led the way while we defended our mature products. We've made good progress on bringing new launch products to more patients in both existing and new countries. And we remain convinced about the long-term growth potential of our launch brands and are working intensely to ensure their success.","Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to delivering for patients.","Let me now pass you to Sean.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon.","We continued to make good progress advancing our pipeline of both innovative and biosimilar molecules. Let me begin with cardiovascular. We don't believe there is any compelling evidence that supports treating high-risk atherosclerotic patients with anything but aggressive LDL cholesterol lowering therapy. Our approach with Repatha differs from that taken by the other marketed PCSK9 inhibitor in that we only maximally inhibit PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol. Our clinical program demonstrated that we could achieve this effect with either 140 milligrams of Repatha delivered every other week or 420 milligrams delivered monthly. And, as reflected in our label, these two dosing schedules were clinically equivalent.","Now that we've received approval in the United States for the innovative Pushtronex delivery system, we can offer patients the choice of an auto-injector pen for every other week or single monthly dose administration with Pushtronex.","As we announced last month, we expect the results from our Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study to be available in 1Q of 2017, in time for submission to the American College of Cardiology meeting in March. I would remind you that this is an event-driven study. And at the time we had accrued in excess of 85% of the requisite events, which allowed us to more accurately predict the timing for the study completion. This is a large study at 27,500 patients, and we remain focused on generating the most robust data set possible in this field from an analysis of the completed study.","Ahead of this, we also expect the coronary imaging study results later this year, which we expect to complement the cardiovascular outcomes data.","In heart failure, after discussions with regulators on omecamtiv mecarbil, our novel cardiac myosin activator from Cytokinetics, we have submitted our heart failure outcomes study protocol for Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to the FDA and continue to work with our partners toward advancing in this novel area.","Turning to oncology, we were pleased to receive European approval for Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone in the relaxed refractory multiple myeloma setting based on the ENDEAVOR data. In the first-line setting, we're conducting CLARION, an approximately 900-patient head-to-head superiority study for Kyprolis versus Velcade, both administered concomitantly with melphalan and prednisone in transplant ineligible subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This has a primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Based on the current event rates, we now expect the primary analysis and top line results of the completed study in the second half of this year.","Before I leave multiple myeloma, I'd like to remind you we remain on track to complete our Phase 3 study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal-related events.","In the quarter, we announced that FDA had granted Priority Review status to BLINCYTO for the treatment of pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed refractory ALL, with a PDUFA action date of September. In the adult population, we had the opportunity last month at ASCO to present the results of our confirmatory Phase 3 study of BLINCYTO. In this study, BLINCYTO demonstrated an almost twofold increase in median overall survival compared to the standard of care. We will be discussing these data with regulators as we seek conversion to full approval in our current indication.","As we announced last week along with our partners at UCB, we have submitted our romosozumab BLA to the FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at increased risk for fracture. We'll be presenting the data from the pivotal Phase 3 FRAME study at the annual meeting of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research in September, and we look forward to sharing the results with the medical community. Recall we're also running a Phase 3 fracture study of romosozumab compared to alendronate, which will contribute to our submission in Europe, and we expect these data in 2017.","For Prolia, later this year we will be reviewing the data from our Phase 3 study in the setting of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, a relatively small but medically important indication.","Our neuroscience programs continue to advance. In our migraine collaboration with Novartis, we were pleased to receive positive results for erenumab, or AMG 334, our CGRP receptor antibody, in our Phase 2b chronic migraine study. These data will be presented at the European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress in September. This was a large robust study, and we believe that these data together with our two Phase 3 studies in episodic migraine reading out later this year could support registration in some jurisdictions. So we intend to seek both indications in our initial submission.","Our other clinical migraine program is our PAC-1 antibody, AMG 301, which is currently proceeding nicely through Phase 1 development. PAC-1 is a receptor for PACAP, a neuropeptide implicated in migraine. We believe that AMG 301 has the potential to be additive or synergistic to erenumab given that PAC-1 is mechanistically differentiated from CGRP, and we're therefore pursuing the concept of a bi-specific PAC-1 and CGRP receptor antibody as well.","In our nephrology franchise, we continue to work with regulators on our Parsabiv application and look forward to our PDUFA date in the U.S. next month. Parsabiv provides an opportunity to offer a novel intravenous calcimimetic option that's administered by healthcare providers three times a week, coincident with the patient's dialysis session. Parsabiv will be the first therapy approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in over a decade.","Finally, within our biosimilars program, last week we announced results from our Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 980 compared to trastuzumab, or Herceptin, in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Based on the overall bioanalytics, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity, we believe there are no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 980 and trastuzumab. And we look forward to discussing these data with regulators.","As always, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued advancement of important new medicines for patients around the world.","Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Sean.","As you can see, it's another active quarter here at the company, but I hope you'll agree another quarter of solid execution as we make progress towards our short, medium, and long-term goals of delivering growth for shareholders.","So with that, why don't we turn it over to the question-and-answer session? And perhaps we can ask our operator to remind you of the procedure for asking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the questions, maybe two for me. Just first on the COGS, pretty impressive versus a year ago, just wondering if that level is sustainable longer term. And then on Repatha, Sean, can you remind us what you want to see out of the IVUS trial and if there's any potential read-through to the outcomes data coming next year? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Terence, we'll try and take those in two parts. I'll ask David to speak first about the question about COGS, and then Sean can talk about Repatha. But big picture, as you know, we've been working towards improving the efficiency and productivity of our manufacturing organization for some time. You've heard us say before, Terence, we think manufacturing is a source of competitive advantage for Amgen, and we're excited about what we've achieved to-date and where we're going next with the introduction of our next-generation bio-manufacturing. So generally the trend is positive. You see that reflected in the quarter. And, David, do you want to provide any more specific guidance on that?","David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, very much the same, Bob. So what we're seeing is, as you would know, we consolidated our manufacturing activity to try to improve the efficiency, and you're now seeing that coming through into the results. So I would say through time, we'll seek to maintain our cost of sales at that very competitive level, recognizing there will be some pressure on us in terms of the cost of sales as we introduce the new portfolio. But we think it's a reasonable trajectory overall.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","And, Terence, I think with regard to the IVUS study and the outcomes, the way to think about this is that what we're pursuing here in both studies is the hypothesis that, as we continue to lower LDL, the relationship between LDL and outcomes will be maintained that we've observed with statin therapy over the last 20 years. And within the IVUS dimension, there has been a clear relationship between the lowering of LDL and the volume of plaque. And that linear relationship looks remarkably similar to the one that you see when you look at outcomes versus LDL. And there is a known relationship between that IVUS type effect and outcomes.","So it all does tie together, and I think that we would be expecting to see conceptually what we believe that the benefits that are observed both with respect to impact on slowing the progression of plaque volume or causing regression of plaque volume as well as in the outcomes dimension, that these are all mediated in the case of statins by the lowering of LDL cholesterol. So we expect that pound for pound, if you will, with the LDL cholesterol lowering, we will see very similar results. So I think those are the hypotheses we're testing with the two studies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Congrats on a really solid quarter, maybe a couple quick ones for Tony. Can you talk about the impact that Darzalex is having on Kyprolis? It does look like from the monthly IMS data that we get that there's been a little competitive impact there.","And then second, I was surprised to see that Amgen is branching out into the ultra-orphan space, at least with an eculizumab biosimilar. Can you talk about how that program might fit commercially with your current capabilities?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Okay, thanks, Eric. As you know, the data inside the multiple myeloma market is a bit more complicated to try and segment between first, second and third-line plus, and we often have to use chart orders for that. Based on the data we've seen, Darzalex is clearly a good product, but we truly see the combination potentially of this product and Kyprolis as a future regimen in treating multiple myeloma. Most of the usage we've seen with Darzalex at the moment is fourth-line plus, however.","To your question on our new biosimilar opportunity, I think Amgen has specialized for many years in specialty drugs with a focus target population, with low resources required to get to prescribers and to identify patients. So I think that one fits quite well with our model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question. If I could ask, just maybe if you could, comment broadly on biosimilars. You've got three that are at regulatory submission or in regulatory submission. Could you just walk through what your thoughts are around when you might be able to launch those products, some of the remaining legal hurdles that you're going to have to get through, and how you see that revenue stream developing over the next year or two? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Matthew, a couple things. First, as you know, we have some nine programs that are under development. Over time, we think those could be an important source of growth and revenue opportunity for us at Amgen. We think that our commitment to developing these biosimilars reflects our belief. The capabilities we have established for our innovative business will lend themselves well to developing a branded biosimilar portfolio as well.","The next step for us on the three that are in advanced regulatory stages is the same path for each of the three. It starts with needing to get regulatory approval. So we hope and expect that we'll have an opportunity to get regulatory approval for our first, which is the biosimilar Humira, later this year. And with the benefit of that then, with that approval in hand, we'll turn to the questions of commercialization, as we will for the other two. So first thing we need to do is get approvals, and that's what we're working on securing right now.","As to your question about revenue profile and what we're going do when the approvals are in hand, we'll wait and comment on those issues at the appropriate time, Matthew.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys, thanks for taking the question. Sean, I have a couple for you on erenumab. The first one, for the chronic migraine data last month, how would you view the baseline migraine data relative to \u2013 just put that in context with the real world? Second point, as we look forward to the episodic data, obviously a more variable population. Maybe help us with how you'd characterize a result as being clinically meaningful in this population. Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Sure. I think when we look at the data from the chronic migraine study, it appears to us as though we have enrolled there a very representative population of this type of afflicted group. And as you know, these people are suffering with just an unimaginable number of these headaches per month. As we talk to the experts in the field, it seems that the population that we enrolled there in terms of the baseline level of headache and the kind of response that we saw in comparison to other product candidates in this axis are all as we might have expected.","In the episodic migraine setting, of course, the baseline number of headache days are by definition less, but the treatment effect is still quite robust and reproducible, and I think that's been the case. It's within the world of neuroscience products, quite remarkable when you look at the data across the small molecules that have been entered in this space, the ligand-sequestering antibodies and erenumab that you see a remarkably consistent treatment effect.","One comment I'd make is that it's the case that this treatment effect is robust, it's reproducible, but there also is quite a large placebo effect that patients get that comes along with the treatment effect, and it's durable over a long period of time. This is actually what the patient experiences, which is not unique to neuroscience but it's particularly potent in this setting. It's a little hard to get your mind around that sometimes, but this is what people who actually care for these patients emphasize to us to when we look at the data.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. One, can you give us a little bit more color on the timing around biosimilar eculizumab data that's the study in New Zealand?","And then also on a second point, can you just frame for us how you think about some of the competitors in the migraine space and how your drug may stack up? Is it a matter of differentiation or is it just a commercial battle in your mind?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, a couple different questions here. We'll start with the migraine question, Sean, then we'll talk about the field.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","What I would say again, and I just made this comment that when you look at what's gone on where mainly companies that have been driving for proof-of-concept and\/or dose-ranging their products, they've used doses of either small molecules, ligand-sequestering antibody or receptor antibodies in our case that are saturating the system. And when that happens, that's how across all these different studies across different companies and so on, you're seeing a very consistent result because you're maxing out the impact that inhibiting CGRP can have in migraine. So that's nice to see.","And then really it comes down to the question of what is the minimal dose that's effective in achieving that effect. And I think then the devil gets into the details really around the issue of how easily administrable is that particular amount of antibody. So there's going to be a certain milligram amount of antibody that has to be administered. Let's say we believe a monthly subcutaneous disposable auto-injector would be a very nice solution to this otherwise healthy active type of population.","And I think that others of course are pursuing strategies that are different than that, and I think it will be interesting, obviously, to see how that all plays out. Tony, you could comment. But I think scientifically, I've not seen any data to suggest that these products are different from one another with respect to what they can achieve when they are dosed and saturating quantity.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Sure. So we've seen the good clinical data, and I think there will be clearly a need for a good marketing plan, a good strategy, a good share of voice, and understanding what makes patients move to request this type of medication. The market is hugely unmet at the moment. There's a large amount of patients who are clamoring consistently and looking for help to try and treat this terrible disease. So it's a combination of both clinical science and a good strategy.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","With respect to your biosimilar question, Alethia, we've disclosed that we've begun the program, and that's all we're disclosing at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good afternoon, a question on Parsabiv, which has a PDUFA date. The Sensipar franchise is over $1 billion. Can you just remind us how to think about the new product versus the loss of exclusivity period for Sensipar? If there's a swapping, how do we think about that line item as that product comes on?","And then to follow up on Repatha, can you remind us how much usage is once-monthly now? I assume it's small. But what do you expect that to be over time, once monthly? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Michael, we're having a little trouble hearing you, but I think you had two questions that Tony can address, the first about Parsabiv, which, as you know, is the subject of a PDUFA date later this summer. And then with respect to the once-monthly Repatha, I think that's the question Michael was asking.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So let's start with the Parsabiv question. As you know, Sensipar has been extremely successful in treating patients both in the U.S. and around the world. But in spite of the efficacy of Sensipar, we probably only have about a 26% penetration. Compliance or patient persistency in this particular market is always an issue to ensure patients who are on dialysis three times a week actually take their tablets every day as well.","Parsabiv brings a combination of potentially a better level of persistency because you'll be infused while you're having your dialysis. But the second thing is, as you've seen from the clinical data, in fact, there appear to be a much more robust level of efficacy of Parsabiv. CMS have granted us a two-year period that this product will exist outside the bundle while they determine the medical value, to determine the value of putting it back in the bundle. So we continue to be excited about the product. There are patients who will take oral. There are patients who will take an injectable, and we'll see how many patients we can assist with both products.","As regards Repatha, there's very little usage at the moment on the monthly dose. We have not had a patient-friendly dose up until now. There appear to be a fair amount of patients who would prefer to have a convenient once-a-month dose. And we're spending quite a bit of time talking to cardiologists about this, and we'll be coming to market in the next couple of weeks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I have a question for David. On M&A, a lot of questions we're getting across the board in biotech on M&A. How are you thinking about how competitive this space is right now for M&A given that many players are thinking about \u2013 talking about actually buying things? Do you find the space competitive? And how do you think about timelines? Are people being more realistic about valuations? Thanks.","David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, so I think what I would say about M&A right now is indeed, first of all, we've been consistent in indicating that we have a broad set of interests, in particular around the six therapeutic areas where we're particularly focused. And so we've said that we're open to look at transactions that could range from early to late-stage. And I think the point is we want to make sure we see everything that might be of interest to us, and I think we're seeing that, first of all.","Certainly, we're in a financial position to be able to be competitive. And then secondly, it's true. We're not the only people out there who are in the market looking for opportunities. So I think the point for us is we need to make sure that we first of all look at things as to the scientific insight that we can bring to bear, including with our insight from a human genetic perspective. And then secondly, we are very clear that we're going to be disciplined in terms of the financial returns that we can expect. And we're interested in doing deals that will create returns for Amgen, not just the seller. So we continue to be active and we've got a number of pretty interesting prospects that we think could come to closure, including still this year.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question, just a two-part question on biosimilars and then government effects. So could you talk a little bit about how the proposed Part B changes might play out and potentially affect your business? And secondly, how might that alter the landscape for some of the biosimilars that you're developing or influence that? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So let me take that one, if I can. This is Tony. Clearly, Amgen has raised some strong objections and questions to the proposed pilot together with about at least 300 other organizations. The concern is always when you do something based on acquisition cost around an ASP adjustment, are you ensuring that patient safety and patient concerns are included? So it's difficult to make a comment at the moment, Geoff, about something that's not been put into place yet. It's a proposal. It's up there for comment, and we're working with other people to make sure that if there is a change, patients are protected all the way through.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, Arvind. Do you actually like Ronny Gal? Because I've known him for years and we should chat. Hey, I had a question for \u2013 I love Ronny, by the way. It's a total joke. This was touched on here and there, but your margin guidance, David, goes through 2018. We're now dangerously close to 2017. I understand you can't give us any guidance. But can you just talk to us about your latest thoughts qualitatively about where margins could go after the plan that you've announced? Should we expect further modest margin expansion? Should we be modeling something right along the lines of what you're doing now? Just anything like that, I'd love to hear you riff on that.","And then, Bob, what's your appetite for an at-risk Humira biosimilar launch? And, Sean, I'd just be curious real fast to get your opinion. You guys have a CETP. I'd love to know what your opinion on that class is now, just like 30 seconds. Thank you.","David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the first one on the margin, the margin walk for the company, I would say, as we've been seeing, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made towards the goals we've set out for ourselves in 2018. So you look at the combination of continued growth of the business, you look at the progress we're making, which by the end of this year we expect to be delivering a $1.1 billion improvement on our cost base versus 2013, and we see us certainly achieving the $1.5 billion goal that we set out. Likewise, if you look at the progress on the margins where we started at a 38% margin in 2013, you've now seen us this quarter again deliver over 50% on the way to 52% to 54%. So first of all, I'd say we're pleased with the progress. We're running the company in an agile and efficient manner while still investing significantly for the long-term health of the business.","The second point I'd make is, we're exactly as of midyear 2016, now we're halfway through the period through 2018. And quite frankly, while we're making very good progress, I think it would be a mistake for us to take our eye off the ball, to continue to focus on delivering against those goals that we've set out for the company. So first and foremost, we're looking at delivering on those goals. And in due course we'll be looking then in terms of the financial performance beyond that. But I think the important point is we think we've got a business that's sustainably delivering very good performance financially and investing in the innovation and long-term pipeline for the company.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sean, do you want to briefly comment on CETP?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Sure. I think at this point in the game, most folks are really just waiting now to see the Merck CETP study read out. I assume midyear next year is what we've most recently heard. Before making any final judgments, I would say that the Lilly data did cause folks who were believers in the mechanism to take significant pause. And certainly, what we've done is to suspend any investment in this area until we see the Merck data.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Mark, it won't surprise you to know that we're not going to comment on your question about our launch plans for Humira, as I said earlier on the call. The next step is for us to get regulatory approval for our molecule, and that's what we're focused on securing.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Just to make sure that we don't exceed the one hour of our allocated time here, may I request that you limit yourself to just one question so we can get through everybody's questions? DeMarcus, let's go ahead with next one please.","Operator","Yes, your next question is from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for sneaking me in there, just a question for Tony. How should we think about the launch of yet another oral in the RA market? Are there any parallels to your experiences with an oral in psoriasis and the impact it's had on Enbrel sales there?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So the first launch of an oral was obviously not that successful. The launch into psoriasis was interesting because it expanded the marketplace and brought into the market a number of patients who perhaps were earlier in their disease, who weren't quite ready yet to move on to any injectable biologic. It's quite possible that there are a bunch of patients between methotrexate and a biologic that could become eligible for this opportunity. But if you look even in psoriasis, the overall market for the TNFs have remained, just the overall market has grown.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Ying, are you there? Maybe you have us on mute. Okay, let's go on to the next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great, thanks very much for taking the question. I was wondering if there is any difference in the dynamics for share loss to a NEUPOGEN biosimilar in the 340B hospital setting versus \u2013 the 340B (55:20) setting. Or if you can, discuss a little bit how the dynamics there might differ between those two. Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Again, sorry, Josh, it was...","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","I think you were talking about the difference between PHS [Public Health Service] and non-PHS, right?","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Correct.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Clearly I think anyone who's come new into the market has gone off to non-PHS hospitals first.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","What share is PHS?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","I couldn't give you that offhand. It's tough to pull that type of data just offhand here. If we need to, we'll come back to you on that one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Looks like Ying is still absent. Okay, let's go on to the next one.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert W. Baird.","Neena Bitritto-Garg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, this is Neena on for Brian. So I had a question about omecamtiv. I know you said that the Phase 3 protocol has been submitted, but we were just wondering what the gating factors are to starting a Phase 3 trial, just because we know the Phase 2 data has been out for a while now. So are there regulatory issues or something like that that's holding it up, or something else?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","What I would say is that we have been moving aggressively with this program. We had to of course go through some meaningful discussions with regulators around things like the dosing algorithms that would be used, safety of the product, and so on because of the fact that just based on the mechanism and there is a narrow therapeutic window for the product, and when we're assessing drug levels and how the titration scheme. So that's moved along. I think we've been able to design a very robust study and have decided that we should put it through the Special Protocol Assessment at FDA. So things are actually moving along as fast as I would have expected to on a complex program like this.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","As it's getting close to 6 PM on the East Coast markets, let's take two more questions.","Operator","Okay, your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. My question is about indication-based pricing in anti-TNF and the broader anti-inflammatory market. How do you guys think about this? Is this good, is this bad? Will it impact Enbrel in a positive way, maybe willing participants or less so, to see if you could give some color.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","It's Tony. Let me respond to that one as best I can. First of all, Amgen has been really at the forefront of innovative solutions to improve patient access, including innovative contracting such as outcomes-based and risk-based contracting. We are partnering with payers on patient-centered approaches to ensure that patients get access to the best available medications, and that physicians make the right choice for the right patient, and at the same time the patient share of cost is manageable.","As regards indication-specific contracts, I think it's too early at this stage to actually give any comment about what the impact could be.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about pricing as well. I'm really curious on how we should be thinking about the sustainability of price increases in this environment. More specifically, when thinking about Enbrel and the four meaningful increases you've had in the last couple years, I assume you're not getting much pushback at the payer level to be able to push these through. But are you comfortable with us modeling this pace of increases to continue, as I think many were assuming this would tail off across the space given the rhetoric that's out there? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So, Cory, again, a question that a lot of people are asking I'm sure. But as you know, we price our products based on the value in the marketplace, taking into account the value they bring to payers, to providers, to patients, the competitive landscape itself. Enbrel in particular of course competes in a highly competitive marketplace with several large players who are competing for formulary placements to enable patient access. The health plans and the PBMs negotiate price concessions and large rebates to gain formulary placement. Because of the magnitude of these rebates, price increases have become part of the competitive dynamic. That's about all I can tell you at the moment.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Tony. I'd like to also thank everybody for your participation in our call. As you go through our results, if you have added questions, observations, feel free to reach out to me. Myself and my team will be around for several hours.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit to asking one question during the Q&A session.","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jade. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to actually begin by extending my gratitude to all of you for having to deal with the deluge of earnings reports from multiple companies reporting today. I appreciate you being on our conference call to review our operating performance for the first quarter of 2016.","We are off to a great start for the year. And to review our progress, Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, will lead the call with a strategic overview. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Tony Hooper, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, is here to discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update.","We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me also thank our listeners for joining the call.","As Arvind said, we're off to a strong start in 2016 with 10% revenue growth and 17% adjusted earnings per share growth in the first quarter. Our sales were strong in the U.S. and internationally, and that was true broadly across our products. As you can see from these results, we've put the company in a strong position to manage competition for our legacy products while investing for growth with our newly-launched and late-stage pipeline products.","Last year, as you know, we had six launches in the U.S. We expect these products, and especially Kyprolis and REPATHA to pave the way for our long term growth. We'll talk more about these launches and our priorities for them on this call.","If last year was a year of launches in the U.S., this will be a year of launches for us internationally, as we take REPATHA, Kyprolis and our other new products into countries around the world. In total this year, we're expecting on the order of 80 new launches across our countries and products. For example, REPATHA is launching now in Japan, Brazil and multiple countries in Europe, and the early signs are good. Similarly, Kyprolis is off to a strong early start in its first markets in Europe.","Our Oncology and Cardiovascular franchises received a lot of visibility last year owing to the flow of data and our product launches in these areas. This year, we expect attention to focus on our other franchises as well, as our pipeline advances with important new opportunities. In bone health, for example, our romosozumab opportunity is coming into focus with positive Phase 3 data.","In nephrology, we expect approval later this year for Parsabiv, a therapeutic for dialysis patients. And we expect pivotal data in neuroscience for our migraine anti-body, AMG 334.","In inflammation, we look forward later this year to establishing with the FDA that our adalimumab molecule is indeed bio-similar to Humira. And while I'm speaking about our biosimilars programs, I'd also remind you that we expect to submit our bevacizumab or Avastin biosimilar file to regulators this year and to have Phase 3 data for our trastuzumab or hercepton bio-similar as well.","Our transformation efforts are well underway and delivering results. This includes cost savings, which David will discuss, but also improved speed to market and speed in the market. And these attributes are every bit as important as cost savings as we grow our company with new products in new territories and adapt to the changing environment for our industry.","Finally, we've designed our capital allocation strategy to deliver value for shareholders through both an attractive return of capital and dividends and buybacks, and vigorous investment for long-term growth.","This is an exciting time in the field of biology, with promising clinical opportunities and breakthroughs arising in many of our areas of interest. So with a strong balance sheet and a long-term investment outlook, we will continue to look for the most promising internal and external opportunities to advance. To underscore our prior comments on this topic, our emphasis will be on focus and capital discipline as we do this.","Before turning to David, let me just congratulate my colleagues around the world for the quality of their execution and a very strong start to the year. David?","David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Bob.","Turning to the first quarter financial results on page six of the slide deck, we are pleased with our strong performance, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Total revenues at $5.5 billion grew 10% year over year. Overall product sales increased 7%, reflecting continued strong performance from our growth products, which more than offset the impact of competition on our legacy products, EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN.","Other revenues at $288 million increased $129 million versus the first quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited both from an upfront partner payment for a licensing transaction, representing almost 40% of total other revenue for the quarter, as well as higher Ibrance royalty income. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 1% unfavorably due to foreign exchange changes.","Adjusted operating income at $2.9 billion grew 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 54.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. As in prior years, our operating margin will likely be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses.","In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year. This enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities, while delivering solid profitability.","On an adjusted basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5%, improved by 1.6 points, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, higher net selling price and lower royalties. Research and development expenses at $858 million were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2016 versus last year.","SG&A expenses increased 11% on a year-over-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year over year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately one percentage point.","Other income and expenses were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis at $144 million in the quarter, as higher interest income was offset by higher interest expense.","The adjusted tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 1.9-point increase versus Q1 of 2015. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and a state audit settlement in the same quarter of last year.","These increases were partially offset by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, a new accounting standard that impacts how certain share-based compensation tax expense is recognized. These impacts were previously reported on the balance sheet as a change in shareholders' equity. The new rule requires these impacts to be recognized in the income statement and thus have a tax rate impact. Future tax rate impacts will depend on the movement in our stock price between when we grant share-based compensation and when it vests. The Q1 benefit of this change adds approximately $0.09 to our adjusted earnings per share.","Adjusted net income increased 15% and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% year over year.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page seven, free cash flow was $1.8 billion, an increase of $400 million over last year. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.6 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $147 per share, and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion.","Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1.00 per share, an increase of 27% over last year. At the end of the first quarter, we had $4.2 billion remaining on our board authorized share buyback program and are on track to deliver on our capital allocation commitments to shareholders.","Cash and investments totaled $34.7 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion from last year's first quarter level. This increase reflects strong net cash flow and our first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which approximately $2 billion will be used to repay debt maturities over the balance of this year.","Our debt balance stands at $34.3 billion as of March 31 of this year. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 11 years.","Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on page eight, we remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects solid Q1 performance from revenue and expense as well as a revised tax outlook.","With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion versus prior guidance of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. And our adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $10.85 to $11.20 a share versus prior guidance of $10.60 to $11.00.","In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 19% to 20%, including the impact of the previously mentioned Accounting Standards Update, versus prior guidance of 19.5% to 20.5%.","Finally, we expect to invest capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.","This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Thank you, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the first quarter on slide number 10.","As Bob said, we had a great start, with global product sales in the first quarter growing by 7% year over year. Our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth, and sales growth in our international business was negatively impacted by five percentage points due to foreign exchange. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, our international business was up 7% year over year.","I will structure my comments in three categories today: performance in our growth products; how we are managing the life cycle of our mature brands; and conclude with an update on the performance of our newly launched products.","First, our six growth products \u2013 Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate, Sensipar, and Enbrel \u2013 aggregated nearly $3 billion in sales or over 50% of the first quarter sales, growing 20% year over year. Sustaining their growth continues to be a priority for us.","Let me start with Prolia and XGEVA, which are now annualizing at approximately $3 billion per year. Prolia grew significantly at 29% year over year. Continued share gains drove growth in both the U.S. and Europe, although with 25% year-over-year unit demand growth in both regions.","We saw the typical seasonality in the first quarter. In the U.S., our direct-to-consumer promotional efforts continued to drive increasing levels of new patient adoption, and we are sustaining repeat injection rates of over 65%. We expect continued growth from Prolia to come for years.","XGEVA grew 11% year over year. Unit share increased about three percentage points over last year in both the U.S. and Europe. The first quarter was positively impacted by increased levels of purchasing by some large end customers in the U.S., which we expect to burn off in the next quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition, and look forward to potential new indications, which will drive sustained long-term growth.","Turning to Vectibix and Nplate, unit demand growth drove double-digit gains year over year across both products. For Vectibix, we continue to make solid inroads into earlier lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Europe.","Sensipar grew 10% year over year, driven by net selling price as well as unit growth in the U.S. and Europe. With sales annualizing around $1.5 billion, Sensipar remains a growth driver. We look forward to adding Parsabiv as another treatment option for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Our regulatory filing for Parsabiv are currently under review in both the U.S. and Europe.","Let me now turn to Enbrel. Enbrel grew 24% year on year, due to changes on net selling price and inventory, which was partially offset by competition. As a reminder, net selling price change comprises several components, including list price increases, as well as the rebates we provide to payers and the impact of formulary decisions.","In the first quarter of 2016, inventory was at a normal level. The year-over-year inventory growth is as a result of prior year dynamics. Declines in inventory levels in the first quarter last year make for an approximately $100 million favorable comparison this quarter. As we think about the second quarter this year, we expect to see a reverse effect of a similar magnitude. In other words, the significant inventory build in the second quarter of 2015 will create an unfavorable comparison, assuming inventory levels remain normal next quarter.","Turning to underlying performance for Enbrel, we saw 14% year-on-year growth in the rheumatology segment for the first quarter and Enbrel held quarter-over-quarter value share at 28%.","In dermatology, competition from new entrants, primarily non-biologics, helped drive year-on-year segment growth of 29%. Enbrel's share in dermatology declined one percentage point quarter over quarter to 21%. If you'll recall, rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Given Enbrel's exclusivity through 2029, it remains a critical growth driver that we are continuing to invest behind.","Let me now turn to how we're managing the life cycle of our mature brands, starting with our ESA products. Aranesp sales increased 11% year over year, driven by 15% unit growth. In the U.S., we are successfully transitioning our medium sized and independent provider centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. Aranesp now represents over 70% of ESA's share of these providers. International sales were negatively impacted by pricing pressures and foreign exchange rates.","EPOGEN declined 44% year over year. About a third of this decline is a shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I mentioned above. Most of the decline comes from the shift from Amgen ESA to Mircera at Fresenius. We understand that Fresenius, which represents about a third of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted over 70% of their patients to Mircera. If you remember, we have a contract with DaVita, which represents another third of the dialysis business, to 2018, to purchase at least 90% of the ESA's from Amgen. I'd also like to point out, we also do not expect biosimilar competition to EPOGEN in 2016.","NEUPOGEN declined 13% year over year and 19% quarter over quarter, with a competitive landscape playing out as we generally expected. NEUPOGEN exited the quarter with a 64% share of the short-acting set segment, which now consists of ZARXIO, Granix, and Leukine. As we've said before, we continue to compete account by account as competition intensifies. We continue to emphasize the value of NEUPOGEN, all from its track record of safety, efficacy and reliable supply.","Neulasta grew 4% during the quarter. Unit growth of 3% included purchases by some large U.S. end customers, which we expect to burn off next quarter.","Let me now turn to our launches, beginning with the Neulasta Onpro Kit. The Neulasta Onpro Kit has been an extremely successful launch, achieving about one-third share of Neulasta units in the first quarter and approaching $1 billion in cumulative sales in the 12 months since launch.","Patients undergoing minor sequence chemotherapy regimens are at high risk of serious infections. One of the biggest challenges physicians face in preventing these infections is patient compliance. Most insuring patients get the Neulasta injection after each course of chemo and at the right time, 24 hours after chemo. These are critical steps in order to insure maximum benefit from Neulasta.","With the Neulasta Onpro Kit, we are able to address this important unmet need. This innovation also provides meaningful differentiation versus the traditional pre-filled syringe and potential future competitors. We also see the compliance rates improving with the use of Neulasta Onpro based on patient level data.","This is a great example of our strategy to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience. By all measures, this is a highly successful launch, and the value it brings to patients and the healthcare system is translating to strong performance. We remain focused on increasing adoption to benefit more patients.","Kyprolis grew 43% year over year. On a sequential basis. U.S. unit growth was offset by unfavorable changes to inventory and to net selling price. The addition of ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated its superiority versus Velcade to the U.S. label in January further solidifies Kyprolis' profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. We expect sales to continue to grow as we treat more second line patients, and they stay on therapy longer to achieve deeper and more durable responses. In markets outside the U.S., we are making good progress with our launches. Initial results have been very positive, as we bring this important therapy to these patients.","BLINCYTO continues to increase patient penetration in the U.S. and launches are underway across Europe, as reimbursement is secured. Sean will discuss developments about the Vectibix antibody platform in a moment.","IMLYGIC, our oncolytic immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma is currently indicated as monotherapy in the U.S. and Europe and is playing an important role in addressing the need for the small patient population. We believe that true potential for IMLYGIC lies in combination with other immunotherapies across different tumor types.","Turning now to REPATHA, which I continue to believe is one of our largest opportunities. I'm pleased with our competitiveness to date. Our robust clinical development program clearly demonstrated REPATHA's ability to deliver intensive and predictable LDL-C reduction. This message continues to resonate well with physicians, and coupled with strong execution in the marketplace, we continue to lead prescribing in the U.S., as seen in the IMS data.","In Europe, reimbursement negotiations are on track, and we're an early launch in several countries, including, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. In Japan, we have now received pricing approval and launch activities with our partner sellers are well underway.","Before handing over to Sean, I thought I would provide some color on the REPATHA launch. In my personal experience, I've seen a number of examples of successful but high value, slower ramping products that share a few common traits with REPATHA. First, these products often contribute to changes in treatment paradigms such as new meclizine vaccine and new (23:05). In the case of REPATHA, inhibition of PCSK9 is a novel mechanism and it is the first injectable biologic addressing chronic cardiovascular disease. I'm excited about the prospect of launching the REPATHA monthly dosing option later this year, reducing the number of required injections and creating another potential point of difference from the competition.","Second, these products often have significant development programs that improve the product profile, expand their patient pools, or extend duration of therapy over time. With REPATHA, how much we study with staffing and helping patients was well received by physicians, at the recent American College of Cardiology meeting.","Our coronary imaging study, we'll read out later this year, and was designed to demonstrate that REPATHA reduces patients' blood burden. And most significantly, of course, we expect the read out of a large 27,500-patient outcomes trial later this year, which we expect will establish a clear benefit in cardiovascular outcomes based on REPATHA's profound effect on lowering LDL cholesterol.","Lastly, access and reimbursement hurdles, while intense, should be overcome with a demonstration of superior clinical benefits versus the current standard of care. We expect to establish this with REPATHA through the outcomes study I just mentioned.","You might have seen this dynamic successfully play out with the fact that tenase has displaced Warfarin. I am unwavering in my commitment and in the belief of REPATHA. We will continue to work with payers to improve access to REPATHA for appropriate patients and expect its strong value proposition to benefit patients with ASCVD who are at risk of heart attack or stroke.","In closing, I'm pleased with our execution this quarter, and our strong start to the year. We've maintained focus on our growth brands while defending our mature portfolio and launching new products. We recognize that our launch products are an important long-term value driver and are working relentlessly to make them a success.","Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for the commitment to delivery to patients.","Let me now pass it to Sean.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. We've made a lot of exciting progress in Q1 as we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative programs. I'll begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise starting with REPATHA.","Statin-associated muscle symptoms represent a major unresolved challenge for treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and often result in the use of therapies that provide less LDL cholesterol reduction than desired. In our recently completed Phase 3 study, GAUSS-3, we evaluated REPATHA and ezetimibe in a group of patients whose statin intolerance was verified by rigorous blinded statin rechallenge, where only those patients that experienced muscle related side effects on statin but not on placebo were studied.","As presented at the ATC meeting and simultaneously published in the Journal of American Medical Association, the study demonstrated that REPATHA resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol after 24 weeks as compared to Ezetimibe with low levels of muscle related adverse events. We believe this is an important result for those high-risk patients that are unable to effectively manage their LDL cholesterol due to muscle symptoms from statins.","Looking ahead, as Tony mentioned, we continue to look forward to the results of our coronary imaging study and cardiovascular outcome studies in the second half of this year. We also continue to work closely with regulators on their reviews of our REPATHA monthly dosing option.","Feedback from cardiologists on our innovative myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, has been consistent that we have a very compelling mechanism of action in Phase 2 data set. We're currently working with our partners at Cytokinetics and Servier, as well as global regulators to define a potential path to Phase 3 outcomes studies.","Turning to oncology, our Phase 3 open label study evaluating BLINCYTO versus standard of care in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory ALL was stopped at a pre-specified interim analysis after successfully achieving the primary endpoint of improved overall survival. This is a first for immunotherapy in this population, and we look forward to discussions with regulators as we seek conversions to full approval.","In Q1 we also filed an SBLA for BLINCYTO in the U.S. to include new data supporting the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL. We feel BLINCYTO could be an important treatment option for younger patients, potentially avoiding the complications later in life, such as secondary malignancies that can arise with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies.","We are advancing our bi-specific T-cell engager or BiTE platform, including AMG 330, which continues to enroll patients in its Phase 1 dose-escalation study. Recall that AMG 330 is our CD33 4ARM BiTE for acute myelitis leukemia, or AML. AML remains an area of profound unmet medical need. Despite adult AML being about four times as prevalent as adult ALL and with a very poor prognosis, there have been no significant advances approved in the last 20 years.","Staying with our immuno-oncology platforms, we recently initiated enrollment in the Phase 3 portion of our melanoma study of Enlogic in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, and we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase 1b portion of this study at the upcoming ASCO meeting.","We also recently presented some encouraging first-in-human data at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting from one of our early stage immuno-oncology programs, AMG 820. This is our antibody against colony-stimulating Factor 1 receptor, also known as CFAMs, which stimulates the activation of tumor-associated macrophages. There's great interest in the role that tumor-associated macrophages play in tumor immunosuppression. And we're helping to lead this field with AMG 820, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase 1\/2 study in combination with KEYTRUDA in advanced solid tumors.","Before I leave oncology, I would note we continue to have productive interactions with regulators in Europe on the Kyprolis ENDEAVOR submission, and I'm also pleased to announce that our Phase 3 study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma has completed its enrollment. This is an event-driven study. And based on the current event rate, we estimate the data will be available in the second half of this year.","In bone health, we were pleased to report, along with our partners at UCB, the positive results from two Phase 3 romosozumab studies in Q1. Most importantly, our placebo-controlled pivotal fracture study met both of its primary vertebral fracture endpoints as well as the important secondary endpoint of clinical fracture reduction. This latter end point consists of symptomatic vertebral fractures plus non-vertebral fractures, an endpoint increasingly recognized by physicians, payers, and regulators, as these are the symptomatic fractures that can be life-altering.","Our Phase 3 study of romosozumab in men with osteoporosis also successfully completed in Q1 with romosozumab treatment resulting in significant gains in bone marrow density versus placebo. We look forward to our pre-VLA meeting with FDA as we pull together our initial filing package in the U.S. We also await the results from the event-driven fracture study, evaluating romosozumab in comparison to alendronate treatment, which we expect to see in 2017 and will be part of our European filing.","Switching to neuroscience, we had the opportunity to present the 52-week data from our Phase 2 episodic migraine study with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, at the American Academy of Neurology meeting earlier this month. After one year of treatment with a 70-milligram monthly dosing regimen, more than 60% of patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days, and about 20% of patients had no migraine days in month 12. These are patients that were having on the order of eight migraine days per month, so this is quite a clinically meaningful result.","We believe the efficacy, tolerability, and administration profile of AMG 334 could be an attractive option for migraine patients, considering the lack of well-tolerated prophylactic options currently available. We are rapidly advancing this program through the clinic with our partners at Novartis.","We now expect to have the results from our Phase 2b chronic migraine study midyear and we intend to use this study to potentially gain an indication in chronic migraines in our initial BLA filing.","We've also completed now enrollment in both of our Phase 3 episodic migraine studies and expect the results from both of these in the second half of this year.","Also in migraine, we believe that AMG 301, our PAC-1 receptor antibody, could complement AMG 334, and we continue to progress this asset through Phase 1.","In other regulatory activities, we continue to work with global regulators on their review of Parsabiv, our novel intravenous calcimimetic for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis. FDA has also accepted our SBLA for the expanded use of Enbrel to treat pediatric patients with chronic, severe plaque psoriasis.","Finally, with several pivotal data sets and regulatory decisions ahead of us, we have a lot to look forward to this year, and I'd like to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for their unwavering focus on delivering innovative new medicines for patients in need.","Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Sean. Let's turn it over now to questions. And, Arvind, why don't you remind our callers of the procedure.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes, Jade, if you can, go ahead and open it up for Q&A and just review the procedure for asking questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question, just a couple clarifications for Tony. You mentioned two end customer purchases for Neulasta and XGEVA. Can you tell how large they were? And then second, maybe if you could, just expand around your comments for REPATHA. I think it's our understanding that 70% to 80% of scripts are abandoned at the pharmacy. What's your view on what needs to change to lower that rate? And how should we think about the change that outcomes data, if positive, could have there? And is there a rate, a hazard ratio, for example, in the outcomes data, that you think would cause a significant shift in some of those utilization management criteria? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Okay, so let me try and go through those. So on the large customer end user purchases for XGEVA and Neulasta, so in the range of $30 million to $50 million, so not a large amount, but they will clearly burn off during the second quarter. When I look at REPATHA, it is about a 77% rejection rate, not abandonment, that's happening at the pharmacy. So a lot of the prescriptions being denied because they don't quite fit the prior auth process which has been required.","Talking to cardiologists, it's clear that they are extremely frustrated at the moment because the patients they're sending in are appropriate patients who are not being properly managed on their maximum tolerated statin at the moment. We are spending quite a bit of time with payers at the moment, and helping them see the \u2013 what I would imagine that the unintended consequences of a rather onerous paper-based prior auth system, which is resulting in so many patients not getting access to drug when they should.","So, I think with a bit more discussion, people will understand the importance of getting appropriate patients on drug. I think of some of the question in terms of narrowing the population is around what will the outcomes show. And there's no doubt in my mind that once we have limited proof that this drug actually results not only in lowering LDL, but in actually reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke, that more patients will gain access to the drug.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Jade, let's go with the next question, please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to talk a little bit about romo, just looking at the non-vertebral fracture data, do you think that this could be a big variance competitively? And then, what's the outlook for the European filing based on the PMO data? Do you think that the \u2013 there's a risk that secondary end points that may have to be hit on that? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff. Sean, why don't you take those questions?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","In terms of the results, the second part of the question relates, I think, to the ability to file the data set in Europe, and we do believe the data will support registration as is in Europe, but we also have always planned to file both outcomes \u2013 fracture studies. So we have the alendronate controlled study in which the primary end point is clinical fracture that will be part of that \u2013 part of that file.","I think that when you step back there are a couple things. One is that we need to present these data at the appropriate scientific congresses and publish them so that the experts in the field can look at the data, because the paradigm for the study design is so different than what people are used to with a three-year placebo-controlled portion rather than a one-year placebo-controlled portion.","And in the end, the most important endpoint to look at with these therapeutics we've hit which, again, is the symptomatic vertebral fractures plus non-vertebral. And we had quite a significant effect size there as well as the transition from treatment with romosozumab on to Prolia where we continue to see benefit of romosozumab into the second year on Prolia. So overall, I think the data will be well-received when people are able to look at it in some detail.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first, just was wondering if you guys could comment on the Treasury notice and intercompany debt and any potential impact to your longer term tax rate. And then any potential for an FDA panel on etelcalcetide? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Okay, David, why don't you take the first?","David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so on the first one, so first of all Amgen, of course, is not a company that's inverted, so we're a U.S.-based company. And all of our debt is issued and received from third parties, so we don't see any impact on our business in terms of our ability to finance and the ability to deduct the interest expense from our earnings. So, right now we don't see any impact. But it's a pretty detailed and lengthy ruling so we continue to look at it, but we don't foresee any right now.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","And, Terence, it's Sean. We don't anticipate the need for an FDA advisory committee for Parsabiv.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. Jade, let's take the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit about Kyprolis and if you were seeing any competition with DARZALEX or any of the other of the new regimens on the market. If you could give me color there, that would be great.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Okay. So let me answer that question. This is Tony. Clearly, as I said, the addition of the ENDEAVOR data to our label, giving us both a doublet and a triplet regimen in second line, both with clinical data showing great efficacy versus the prior regimens, has put us in a good position to give patients in second line plus a better opportunity. The data in the market is quite shallow because we haven't looked at the patient chart orders. But as I look at the orders for the first quarter, I see Kyprolis continue to hold market share in third line. I see continued growth in the second line. And I see the newer entrants with very slow single digit market shares and predominantly being used in fourth line plus.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So with regard to REPATHA access, assuming you get positive CVOT data later this year, what's your understanding of the process you'll need to follow in order to ease kind of current utilization management? I guess I'm wondering how fast things could open up, or if you're going to need to get the data and the label and renegotiate with payers first before you're able to tag a noticeable difference on that front? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So, as Sean said, we're expecting the data in the latter end of this year. Once the data becomes clear it'll become public. And I think people will have to make up their minds what that actually means. It will be presented then in a peer-reviewed publication and presented at one of the large congresses where the data will become clear to all the prescribing cardiologists. We, of course, from a commercial perspective are not in a position to negotiate or talk to payers about the data until the FDA has approved it in our label. In the interim, however, our medical affairs organization can respond to questions that we receive from the payers in a balanced and medical way. But I'm assuming once this becomes clear, the details will just clarify the unique value of this particular product. Sean?","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","This is Sean. I think the other comment I would make is that you may have seen that the \u2013 that some of the U.S.-based guidelines for treatment of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular risks were recently updated and included the concept of using the PCSK9 inhibitors after stepping through some other therapeutic options that have the cardiovascular outcomes data.","It's my understanding from talking with many of the key opinion leaders who are either involved in the guidelines or just thought leaders in the field, there's \u2013 there's a clear desire to update these guidelines as fast as possible when the cardiovascular outcomes data are available. So that's an independent process from anything to do with getting good data into the label and can be a very important thing that payers look at when they make access decision.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Jade, let's take the next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Maybe a question for Bob. In this environment, biotech prices have obviously come down. So I'm wondering what your current feelings, Bob, are around hostile acquisitions? Thank you very much.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mark, I don't know that I'd make any comments about hostile acquisitions but, as you've heard us say before, evaluations in some areas are more attractive this year than they were last and we have a strong balance sheet and we continue to look carefully both internally and externally for the most attractive programs that we can advance. But we look at all range of transactions, licensing, as well as M&A, and we consider them each individually. So I wouldn't speculate, Mark, about anything more than that at this point.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks, a question for Sean. The pivotal CGRP data is certainly coming and there's a wealth of data coming. You've talked in the past about your hypothesis, about your mechanism and some differentiation. Can you maybe update us on your thoughts about how you still see that playing out as some more data has come out and just where data has played out? Can you maybe list one or two things where you specifically see some differentiation or how that plays in the future? Thanks, Sean.","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Michael.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","So, Michael, I don't think much has really changed in terms of the fact that there's sort of fundamental scientific principles here around the difference between a receptor antagonist and the ligand. We've always felt that the receptor antagonist would be more potent, and we're seeing that play out. We've always thought that might result in a situation in which the administration profile of the product was better than it would be if larger amounts of protein were necessary for delivery, for example, on a monthly basis in a subcutaneous delivery device. So, I continue to think that it's a relative advantage to have a more potent agent when you're trying to administer infrequent dosing subcutaneously. But whether that will be really play into being an important clinical differentiator when these products are out in the marketplace is, I think, too soon to know.","Otherwise, we continue to push very hard on the product to get it to patients as fast as we can because there are about 26 million people with migraine in the United States, and among them there's somewhere in the order of 8 million to 10 million who have had attempts or are currently on and off of therapy for prophylaxis. So there's clearly a very large unmet medical need, and some proportion of that population would be an appropriate population, potentially, for this sort of therapeutic.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer from Piper Jaffray.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for taking the questions, and maybe one for Sean. Amgen has had such a strong track record advancing the Phase 3 programs through to commercialization. Curious as to what there is in the Phase 2 or earlier pipeline that you're most enthusiastic to move into Phase 3; you mentioned omecamtiv, curious as to what else.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Sure, I like to talk about that sort of thing. The certainly omecamtiv is very exciting. We also, as I mentioned, have another migraine prophylaxis antibody and of course, the potential to actually develop a bi-specific antibody that would address both of those pathways as a product behind that. Heart failure does remain a real focus for us, and we actually are introducing a novel, completely novel heart failure medicine into the clinic in a matter of days from now, which is exciting and have quite a few early discovery-level programs in that area.","Cardiovascular more broadly, we have some very interesting things we're working on in the early and midstage pipeline. And of course, the BiTE platform has a very large number of products in pre-clinical phases that are moving toward the clinic. And we're seeing a situation in which we're going to be introducing into the clinic multiple different therapies in some cases, with different targets directed at the same hematological malignancy, for example, and are having to envision some interesting multi-armed clinical trials to try to get some efficiency in the testing when we have so many things coming forward simultaneously.","So there's a lot going on. Because of everything that happens, that's happening at the commercialization interface, we don't get a lot of time to talk about that, and perhaps we'll have an opportunity in an upcoming business review setting to go through some of this in some more detail.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just thinking a little bit big picture on the REPATHA launch, I think you called it like a slow launch. And you were talking about working with payers. How much are you willing to participate and deal with price versus, say, mortality outcomes? So what's the balance of lowering price and mortality outcomes as far as opening up access? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Robyn, it's Tony. Clearly as we've said, we bring our products to market with a clear debate and discussion around the pharmoeconomic value of the products. There was an extrapolated value that these drugs would actually result in reduction of both stroke, heart attack, and early untimely death, and I think we will continue to bring the value to market. There are rebates in the marketplace at the moment, and that dynamic will continue over time as we jostle for formulary positions. But I think what we bring to market at the moment is a pretty decent and acceptable value proposition to treat patients at high risk.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang from Jefferies.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC","Thank you for taking the question, a question on Parsabiv. With the bundled payment in dialysis, what do you think could the pricing power be for the product like this, particularly since Parsabiv is expected to go generic in a couple of years? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","All right, so it's Tony. Let me answer that one. So as you know, CMS have gone with a two-year period, that this product will operate outside of the bundle under the ASP pricing method, which will give CMS two years to evaluate the product value and then to make a decision how much value is put into the bundle when the product moves from ASP into the bundle.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from B-of-A Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first one for maybe Sean to talk about a few outcome trials here. I know you guys never disclose the powering assumption or the assumption for event rate. But should we assume that it's probably similar to what your competitor has talked about?","And then secondly, I have a question on the EPO market. So Fresenius is switching to Mircera from Roche. You have a long-term contract with DaVita. What is your thought of the other one-third of the market with EPO and also (52:15) going forward?","Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll take this in two parts. Sean will take your first question and then Tony can address your EPO question.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","Actually both we and Regeneron and Sanofi have published papers on the design of these studies, where there's a quite a bit of detail in the way that they were constructed. And in the end, these types of studies differ largely on the issue of how long it takes to enroll the population and what the event rate is once you get patients enrolled.","There are not, we don't believe \u2013 we would not anticipate large differences in the event rates between the two populations, but there will be some difference in event rate. And I think both companies have set their studies up so that they would be able to detect what was considered to be a clinically meaningful minimum effect size, so typically one would set these kind of trials up so that you wouldn't miss a 20% reduction in risk. Obviously, you may be looking for more, but that would be the way you power the trial. So there are more similarities than there are differences.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Okay, so let me answer your question on the dialysis market. You're right, the market is broken into three. DaVita is responsible for about one-third of the market. We have a contract with them that is exclusive that runs to 2018. Fresenius, who is responsible for another one-third of the market are in the process of converting a lot of their patients. The last time they made any numbers public, they were talking about just over 70% conversion to Mircera. The other one-third of the market is the independent medium and small dialysis units. In that setting, we have converted about 70% of the EPOGEN usage to Aranesp.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you, I appreciate the question. Tony, a couple for you. Could you talk a little bit about price on Enbrel, the contribution of price? Should we just infer that it's the difference between the growth, the units, and the inventory? It looks about 20%. And could you just talk about whether that looks to be sustainable given the market environment?","And then on a related note, could you talk about the value proposition for AMG 334? Certainly, millions of patients out there with migraine, but you can imagine payers preparing to do some of the things that they did for REPATHA. So how do you think that you're going to approach the value proposition of that indication to avoid the sort of really tight restrictions that you've encountered?","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","Okay. So let's go back to the front end. Just to reconfirm again, what we report and what we talk about in terms of net price, and really that's a combination of the list price minus the rebates and\/or formulary positions you have in the marketplace. I think as a company we're acutely aware of the issues facing the industry in the U.S. at the moment. But Amgen's all about innovation, right? So we price our drugs around the pharmacoeconomic value of the products as we bring them to market.","Enbrel itself, of course, is competing in a highly competitive marketplace where several large players are competing for formulary position to enable patient access. At the same time, the health plans and the PBNs are negotiating price concessions on large rebates to set up formulary placements themselves and it's because of the magnitude of these rebates that price increases have become part of this overall dynamic. So, it's an integrative process flow as we go forward.","Talking about 334, as Sean has said again and again, this is a huge unmet medical need in the marketplace where existing therapies have side effects that are sometimes as bad as the disease itself. Unlike most other diseases, patients with chronic migraine really know about it. It's debilitating. It's devastating. And some of the initial research we've done have shown a much higher inclination or preparedness to pay a co-pay because patients really want to get rid of the disease as quick as they can.","I think most of the patients who are available to us have been on therapy for some time and were able to show they've been on therapy. So step edits I'm sure will be there. But there's a large bolus of patients who have failed consistently on existing treatment in the marketplace.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","So, Jade, I'm noticing that it's fast approaching 6:30 on the East Coast. Why don't we take two last questions?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities.","Yanan Zhu - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for squeezing us in. This is actually Yanan Zhu in for Jim. I wanted to ask a question on the CGRP program, specifically on the regulatory path. As you know, it's a competitive space with four players. You have the clear lead, the first Phase 3 data readout for that frequent episodic migraine indication. However, in a chronic migraine indication, it's a little less clear, because others have Phase 3 programs ongoing. Interestingly, you just mentioned, you commented that you might use the Phase 2 data that is going to read out \u2013 the Phase 2b data in chronic migraine \u2013 to support a BLA. Our question is, do you think you will seek a chronic migraine indication based on the Phase 2b data? Have there been any discussion with regulators on that? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development","This is Sean. I think that the things have you to take into account is that the chronic migraine Phase 2b study is quite a large study and it explores doses that are used in the two large Phase 3 episodic migraine studies. And these are obviously \u2013 there's a spectrum of disease here \u2013 and while there is a separate regulatory entity of chronic migraine and episodic migraine, the path of physiology is probably quite shared across these as evidenced by the fact that all the CGRP antagonists are having similar efficacy in the different patient populations. So it's our feeling that taken together, the aggregate data could potentially support both indications being granted at least by some of the global regulators.","And I would not typically go into the discussions about the specific conversations we've had with regulators, but I'd just say that we feel that it's a very reasonable approach to attempt to get both indications based on the aggregate data package.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great, let's take one last question.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Jeff Chen from Cowen & Company.","Jeff Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. For Tony, could you just discuss a little bit more about REPATHA in EU and Japan in terms of your experience of access and reimbursement? And if you think that the CVOT outcomes data will change the negotiation, or would that be a new round of negotiations? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations","So I think if you've heard people talk about the (1:00:36) performance in Europe where once the price has been set and reimbursement is agreed, there's no longer an economic decision around every prescription, so uptake happens quite fast. So I believe that as we get into growing into this marketplace, pricing is just about set. When you come in with larger expanded patient population groups, there's a chance in Europe, you have to go back in it in a country-by-country negotiation. In Japan, historically, that hasn't happened as much, and the pricing we receive in Japan seems to be a longer play-through from pricing.","Arvind K. Sood - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great.

In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter conference call. Unlike past quarters, our format today will be a bit different. As we are conducting a comprehensive business review tomorrow morning, we\u2019ll limit our comments to reviewing our solid performance during the third quarter and keep this call brief to about 30 minutes, including taking some of your questions.","Joining me today are Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO; and our CFO, David Meline, who will both make some prepared comments, outlining our operating performance during the quarter.","Tony Hooper, who as you know is our Head of Global Commercial Operations; and Sean Harper, our Head of R&D are also here with us to address any questions you might have for them. To further help with the understanding of product sales drivers, we have posted some slides on our website.","Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially.","So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?","Bob Bradway","Thanks, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today to discuss our strong third quarter results. As Arvind indicated, David Meline and I will offer some brief commentary in context of the quarter and then we will take some questions together with Tony and Sean. Again, just to reiterate, since we are meeting tomorrow morning for a comprehensive business review, we\u2019ll really try to keep the focus for this call on our quarterly results.","Our third results just announced reflect strong sales performance across the portfolio, which when combined with our ongoing expense discipline generated 22% growth in operating income and 19% growth in earnings per share.","Given the strategic emphasis we placed on growing our international presence, we were particularly pleased with the 14% growth in international sales during the quarter. Consistent with the strong underlying prescription trends that we\u2019ve seen through the first three quarters of the year, our product sales performance for the third quarter was up 4% year-over-year.","And to recall, however, last year we recognized $155 million government order for NEUPOGEN that was reflected in our Q3 2013 results. Sales grew 8% year-over-year, excluding that one-time order from last year.","Overall then, the Q3 performance was strong across the board and on a year-to-date basis revenues have increased 8%, with operating income increasing 24%, reflecting our improving margin structure.","In a moment, David, will review the drivers of our key products and the financials in more detail, but as you know R&D is the engine that will drive future growth at Amgen and we continue to make good progress in advancing our registrational program, so I\u2019ll say a few words about those.","We reported positive Phase 3 results from three innovative programs in the quarter, the second positive study for AMG 416, which is our intravenous calcimimetic, which performed well in the study versus placebo, Kyprolis Aspire study, which generated exceptional progression free survival data in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting, as well as evolocumab data in Japan, which is also an important opportunity for us.","We submitted marketing authorizations for four programs in the quarter, with ivabradine in the U.S., evolocumab, blinatumomab and TVEC in the U.S. and EU, with both ivabradine and blinatumomab currently under priority review by the FDA.","We also announced the first positive Phase 3 results for one of our biosimilar programs that being ABP 501 in psoriasis as we prepare to became launching our biosimilar portfolio beginning in 2017.","We\u2019ll talk about strategy tomorrow and we look forward to providing more granularity on our progressing pipeline, our commercial plans for launching new products, our capital allocation plans, our business transformation initiative and progress, as well as an update on our biosimilar and manufacturing activities.","Now, let me turn to David, who will walk you through the financials and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","David Meline","Okay. Thanks, Bob. I want to take a moment first briefly discuss the key drivers of product sales performance during the quarter. Enbrel units grew 3% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting strong underline demand, as this reflected in the prescription data.","I would also like to point out that Enbrel continues to see strong segment growth in both rheumatology and dermatology at 21% and 24%, respectively. Recall last quarter that we called out $60 million of Enbrel inventory build in Q2 that we expected to burn-off in Q3, masking the strength in demand.","Prolia's sales increased 43% in the quarter due to strong unit demand. As you\u2019re aware, we normally see some seasonality in Prolia in Q3 and we saw the expected sales ramp up as we exited the quarter.","We continue to capture share in the growing market with XGEVA and despite generic competition over the past year, XGEVA sales increased 22%. Our newest products Kyprolis realized sequential sales growth of 21% to $94 million, much of which was driven by strong unit demand. We remained confident that Kyprolis will become the proteasome inhibitor of choice and you\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear from Pablo Cagnoni, who leads our Onyx business tomorrow.","Finally, I would also like to highlight Vectibix, which grew 29% year-over-year on the strength of our new first line label in the U.S., as well as growth in the EU. Let me now make a few brief comments on our operating performances.","Our operating expenses declined 5% due to Enbrel\u2019s improved profitability from the expired profit share agreement, as well as due to efforts to manage cost. This led to a 47% operating margin, a 7 point increase compared to the third quarter of 2013.","Based on our progress through the first nine months of the year and our confidence in the underlines trends of the business, we\u2019re again raising our 2014 revenue guidance to $19.8 billion to $20 billion, and our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance to $8.45 to $8.55 per share.","I would also like to provide a brief update on our transformation actions. At the time of our announcement in July, we estimated a headcount reduction of 12% to 15% of our global workforce or 2,400 and 2,900 staff. We have now completed and largely implemented the adjustment with the confirmed total in excess of 2,900 reductions.","On the U.S. GAAP basis, restructuring charges totaled $376 million in the third quarter. We now expect the total cost of this action to be $835 million to $885 million through 2015, including an estimated $150 million charge in Q4 of 2014.","We are also updating our guidance for the 2014 tax rate today. Based on uncertainty concerning the timing for the extension of the R&D tax credit within the 2014 calendar year, we\u2019ve chosen to remove the benefit from our projected 2014 adjusted tax rate, resulting in guidance of 16% to 17% for this year versus our previous guidance of 15% to 16%.","We also saw in the quarter $1 billion increase in free cash flow to $2.6 billion reflecting the benefit of higher product sales and ongoing improvements in working capital. Our cash balance increased $1.6 billion over the previous year, now totaling $28.1 billion.","Our debt balance of $33 billion is $5.8 billion higher versus Q3 of 2013 due to debt related to the Onyx acquisition. That completes our review of the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Arvind for Q&A.","Arvind Sood","Excellent. Thank you, David. Marvin, let\u2019s go and open it up for Q&A and let\u2019s do that for about next 15 to 20 minutes if you want to start out by reviewing the procedure again for asking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Thanks a lot for taking my question and congrats on our really strong performance in Q3. I guess the questions for David on the guidance. Even with the pumped up tax rate in 2014, if you hit your revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, it implies a pretty big decrease in operating margins. Just kind of wondering what might be behind that?","David Meline","Yeah, Eric. So generally what we see in the fourth quarter is a pickup of the expenses. It\u2019s a seasonal trend that occurs until each year. And so what we\u2019re expecting is a similar pickup here in Q4. So I think nothing unusual but there's certainly some additional cost in Q4.","Bob Bradway","Eric, as you know, we\u2019re gearing up for some potential launches next year, including launches that could take place early in the year. So that will be reflected as well when we get into the fourth quarter OpEx.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matt Roden - UBS","Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions as well and congrats on the nice results. So you pointed out the expanding margin here in the second quarter and third quarter, certainly better than it\u2019s been in recent years. We understand that Enbrel profitability is part of that. But these numbers are also ahead future year estimates as a consensus estimates. So I just want to get a sense for with the caveat of an uptick of expenses in the 4Q and realizing, you can\u2019t really give guidance for 2015 at least today. Just wanted to get a sense for how sustainable you can keep this operating margin level and to what significant you think you grow from that new level? Thank you.","Bob Bradway","Thanks for the question, Matt. It\u2019s Bob. That\u2019s and important question for us to address tomorrow and we look forward to addressing head on. As you point out, we benefited from an improve profitability at Enbrel but also from ongoing expenses supporting across the rest the business. I have a lot more say about that when we get together tomorrow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask two-partner on Enbrel. So first, in the slides, you gave the price and inventory. Now if you look at inventory, you called out $16 million headwind as the case it looks like it was about higher slight about $110 million. So do you expect some inventory to reverse in the fourth quarter?","And then the second is, you\u2019ve taken two 7% price increase this year yet you reassured about 1% year-over-year price pump. Is that because you gave most of the price back in terms of the contract and could you just talk a little bit about that too? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Sure. Matt, why don\u2019t we ask Tony to address those two questions. Right, Tony.","Tony Hooper","Matt, the two questions, first one, you are correct, we actually entered the quarter accounting about $60 million. Inventory is fairly normal during the week but months and quarters tend to land in different places in that week which of course is shifting up and down. In addition to the $60 million we carried into the quarter that we had a burn-off, we actually closed the quarter at unusually low level of inventory with about $40 million reduced inventories.","So that $100 million will directly flow into the fourth quarter. I think the price number that you\u2019d seen for the third quarter, there is a lot of ins and outs on those calculations. And I don\u2019t think you can take this as a true reflection as the net impacted price that we\u2019re applying in the market place.","Marvin, let\u2019s take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank","","Great congratulations. This is Mohit Bansal for Robyn Karnauskas. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a good quarter. My question is regarding Enbrel. So given that the decent launch of TESLA in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, are you seeing any impact on Enbrel sales there in derm space. And then you talked about geographical mix bringing up the tax rate. So just wanted to get some sense of how should we think about it in the future? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","Okay. I think you have two separate questions. I will ask David obviously to address the second, Tony if you want to tackle first.","Tony Hooper","","Okay so -- talking about those launched into psoriasis in late September. So the actual data that we have available is fairly light at the moment. I would assume that the fourth quarter show a bit more robust data around prescriptions. Net, net in the third quarter, we don\u2019t see any reduction in the number of new naive patients going on to injectable biologics for psoriasis. And we also don\u2019t see any dramatic changes in the trend of our market share. David?","David Meline","","Yeah. In terms of tax rates, so as I mentioned I think you understood why we took the rate up here in the quarter. And what\u2019s going to happen now is we\u2019ll look out and I think best address tomorrow I\u2019ve got a piece where I\u2019ll talk about how to think about taxes going forward and what are the key drivers of that. So, if you don\u2019t mind I m going to take it up with you in the morning.","Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank","","Great. Thanks.","David Meline","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Looking forward to (indiscernible) tomorrow. I had a question for Tony, on NEUPOGEN, would it be possible to in the U.S. for you to please give us the unit share that NEUPOGEN still enjoys of the short-acting TCS market. And I noticed on that slide, the impact of price on a year-on-year basis is not in the slide. What happened to price on the year-on-year basis? Thank you.","Tony Hooper","","Mark, price on NEUPOGEN year-on-year is negligible that why it got actually listed and as regard to market share from a total Filgrastim portfolio, we still hold just over 98% of the market.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","And short acting?","Tony Hooper","I\u2019ll have to get to that number, but the actual market share hasn\u2019t changed dramatically versus the third -- the second quarter.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","All right. See you tomorrow. Thank you.","Tony Hooper","Okay. Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","I had a follow-up question on NEUPOGEN as it relates to you last. I guess, as you are seeing some competitors impact, you noted that in your slides on the short-acting. How would that be different if at all for our Neulasta and what actually happens in terms of NEUPOGEN shares, is there are price issue, does that just continue some share. What exactly is going on there and how does relate to any risk from Neulasta in the future? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","So I am not quite sure of the detail of your question but obviously we have seen Neulasta to continue the trend it had for last couple of quarters. We see little-to-no impact from the recently launched short-acting Granix. As you know, we do have a long-acting competitor in Europe and we\u2019ve seen a slow impact from them over the last year or so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple. First one is you guys had a decent quality sales for EPOGEN and so growth was primarily driven by price. So, I was wondering if you can talk about the pricing trend in that market and then do you expect any competition to come in 2015, U.S. or not? Then I have a second question for maybe Sean. Have you guys looked to add any post-talk analysis of cardiovascular events in the like heart trial?","Bob Bradway","Okay. So let me then respond to your questions. As regard price, obviously we don\u2019t give any forward guidance on price. We did take a 4.9% price increase on EPOGEN in May this year and based on the contracts we have some of that flow through. As regards competition, as you know, MIRCERA have the right to enter the market effective July, 2014 and we do lose patent in May of 2015.","Sean Harper","And regarding the analysis of the cardiovascular events in the Phase 3 studies, this analysis are performed in some of the longer-term exposure studies and those are actually published in the literature. There is a paper circulation where you see about half of the rate of cardiovascular events in the Evolocumab versus the placebo controller. I just cautioned interpretation around these various small numbers of events. It\u2019s extremely difficult to know whether these are play of chance or a real drug effect. I will just remind you that the numbers of events that are necessary generally to evaluate this thing is in the thousand of events versus double-digit numbers of events.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citi","Great. Nice quarter and also thanks for taking my question. So, Sean, it\u2019s a question for you or I don\u2019t know if Tony wants to pick it up. Relating to Evolocumab, so your Phase 3 actually hit the endpoint using the EMA definition of statin intolerance. Regeneron\u2019s compound missed using the U.S. definition but at this point you guys haven\u2019t completed your Phase 3 using the FDA definition of statin intolerance. And so my question really has to do with, do you think that you can approve in the U.S. before that data is generated? Thank you.","Sean Harper","I think, first of all, there has been discussion by companies in this space by European and the U.S. regulators. But I would not want you to think that there are clear guidances or definitions around this coming from the regulatory agencies. In fact, they are expressing to us the clear sense that they don\u2019t know exactly how to define this population, how to study it, what the study designs that would be necessary to actually get specific language around statin intolerance and is unclear whether such language is necessary.","For example, one could define high-risk individuals who have not reached out the treatment goals despite the use of available therapy that would cover statin intolerant patients and non-statin intolerant patients. So it\u2019s a very difficult area. We actually are exploring a different ways of studying this problem so that we can eventually describe those data hopefully in our labeling. But it\u2019s not as clear set of guidelines from the regulators as they might appear on first blush.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terrence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So we know Sanofi filed for approval of a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN this summer. Our team has done some work that suggests that additional patents beyond the composition of matter patent could be fairly significant impediments here in the U.S. to the first biosimilars, just given potential delays for litigation and appeals. So just remind, I just want to know if you can remind us if you guys have any additional patents beyond composition for NEUPOGEN and Neulasta and if we should place any weight on those patents to potentially delay biosimilar and trends? Thanks.","Bob Bradway","I noticed a lot of discussion of that recently in the investment community. And again, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll talk about tomorrow. But I think, as you are aware, we and Sandoz are litigating one intellectual property issue now that relates to your question. And so we\u2019ll have an answer from the courts at some point on important piece of the question that you\u2019re asking.","And generally, we expect that we will face competition for NEUPOGEN through time on the biosimilar pathway in the U.S. We also expect that we\u2019ll start to see some challenges for the long-acting Neulasta product as well in the U.S. probably at some point in 2016.","Arvind Sood","","Marvin, before you move on to the next question, I just wanted to respond to Michael Yee\u2019s question about the market share or about the segment share for Neulasta. So on a sequential basis, we actually gained about a percentage point and also on a year-over-year basis, we gained about a percentage point in terms of unit share on Neulasta. Just take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.","Eun Yang - Jefferies","Thank you. Question on Kyprolis. So based on our discussions here with the physicians, Kyprolis has been used to off-label beyond Neulasta for multiple myeloma. So with the positively internal ASPIRE data, do you expect to see increases in sales in the next couple of quarters, or do you think medical community is waiting for over the survival data? Thank you.","Tony Hooper","This is Tony. As you know the data is quite sparse, so what we do is we do about a thousand chart orders and then we do an extrapolation each quarter to determine the market shares. As I look at quarter three, we sold a distinctive increase in our market share in third line. We also saw an increase in our market share in fourth line plus. We have not seen a dramatic change in any second line uses of this particular stage.","We will be presenting the data in ASH. The publication would be -- these ASH data will be public on about 6th of November and at that stage we\u2019ll see what happens. But we haven\u2019t seen any dramatic change in the marketplace to date now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.","Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Hopefully, you can help, I guess, elucidate the extent of which in relevant territories your own internal projections have been able to accurately project biosimilar impact? And then how confident are you that your internal projections, whatever they maybe going forward for biosimilar erosion of your mature franchisees really do capture the likely effect?","Bob Bradway","So let me try and respond. Obviously, there never been a historical situation in the U.S. that we can actually model anything on. The competition we have at the moment against NEUPOGEN is of course not a biosimilar competition. We have, however, in Europe looked over the last five, seven years, a large amount of biosimlar competition. And we have modeled Europe and it worked successfully to defend our business in Europe over the last five, seven years.","So we\u2019ve done a combination of modeling Europe as a totality. We\u2019re taking countries inside Europe that as best as possible would potentially emulate practices of all behaviors in the U.S. And we use those models to create our long-range plans. Obviously, these are our best assumptions at present and only time will tell in terms of where the market will actually go.","Tony Hooper","","I think as well, Josh, what I would add is if you look at a big picture, we have said that reliably, safety supplying biosimilars is not something that can be taken for granted. And if you look at the experience in Europe, you see several suppliers have struggled to fulfill the different tenders that they\u2019ve won through time. So the barriers to entry are the challenges of safely supplying the marketplace with biosimilars has proven the challenge and that\u2019s reflected in how we see marketplace competition evolving.","I suspect that as we get into more biologics, patent and more complex modules, we will continue to see that being an issue. But generally now with the benefit of more than handful competitors, over more than a handful of years, and a number of markets in Europe the competition has been fairly predictable both from a pricing and share standpoint.","Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink.","Howard Liang - Leerink","Thanks very much. So Neulasta, you had a very strong quarter but also managing the slight impact by competition. Does that mean that there is some inventory buildup? Can you talk about in general whether there is some meaningful or significant inventory changes quarter-over-quarter for all the products?","David Meline","For Neulasta, there was a slight decline in inventory inside -- in the quarter. As you know, the Neulasta is clearly a line to a number of monosuppressant chemo regimen that takes place in the quarter. We have not seen a dramatic increase or decrease of those regimens that takes place, Howard, at the moment. So I don\u2019t think there is much inventory flow, maybe $20 million to $30 million that will flow into next quarter, but the usage has not been impacted by Granix and we continue to get long-acting usage in all the accounts we haven\u2019t mount.","Bob Bradway","So Marvin what I am thinking of so we can get back to preparing for our business review and have a more full time discussion tomorrow. Why don\u2019t we just take two last questions?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","Thanks very much. So let me jump in with question. I just want to follow up with Tony and perhaps with David. Tony could you break out price by U.S. and ex-U.S. You gave us the net which was very helpful, but just give us the trends there? And then David, could you just talk about currency effects during the quarter and what we should be expecting for the next couple of quarters presuming that things stay where they are? Thanks.","Tony Hooper","Geoff, sorry is this price in total, price specific on the product.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","Just in aggregate for Europe versus -- or ex-U.S. versus the U.S. would be helpful?","Tony Hooper","Okay. So we deal only with price decreases outside the United States, right. So there are continuous challenges around pricing in Europe and in Japan even though we don\u2019t have any visibility yet, but the price increases are predominately in the U.S. and not outside the U.S.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","Got it. Thank you. And then currency David?","David Meline","Yes. On currency, first of all, as you would know, we have a fairly limited exposure right now as a company to currency movements given the profile of the business. Secondly, the company has a rolling hedge program so we have quite an extensive portfolio against any of the traded currencies where there is a forward market. I mean, as a consequence, you don\u2019t see any impact this quarter in our results due to foreign exchange movements, because they are offset by the hedge portfolio. And then if you look into next quarter, it\u2019s around $0.02 of a share negative, which is incorporated in the updated guidance.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Operator","","Our last question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Chris Raymond - Robert Baird","Thanks a lot. Let me side in here. Just the question back on Kyprolis. So just noticing even you back out inventory and the other effects. The unit growth, it looks like you had really the strongest sequential growth since around the beginning of the launch. And I know ASPIRE which is top line, but just kind of what you ascribe that reacceleration do generally, if you can maybe give a little bit more color on that would be great?","Bob Bradway","Let me spend a few minutes to say now the 'the growth' was about $16 million, $10 million of that is U.S. and $6 million in outside the U.S. As you know outside the U.S. we are getting some free approval sales in Europe and in Turkey. And we have the product approved in both Israel and Argentina. So $10 million growth in U.S. and $6 million outside the U.S. The $10 million in U.S. is about 13% growth, now that\u2019s say predominantly growing in third line and fourth line plus.","Chris Raymond - Robert Baird","Thanks a lot.","Bob Bradway","Thanks for that, Tony.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you, Frederick. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. So before we start, I would like to welcome back Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Evercore, who has returned from his leave. I would also like to acknowledge those who are relatively new in their coverage of Amgen, including Salim Syed of Mizuho Securities and Leah Cann of Oppenheimer. Welcome. Each of us look forward to working with you. So let's go ahead and get started as we have a lot of ground to cover today.","I'm sure you have seen our press release by now and we are particularly pleased to report that our Repatha four-year outcome study has met its primary composite endpoint and the key secondary composite endpoint with no new safety findings. In order to ensure presentation of this important data at the American College of Cardiology meeting in March, unfortunately we will not be able to provide additional details at this time above and beyond what's in the press release. We will host an investor event on March 17 and look forward to seeing you in Washington, DC.","So leading the call today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic report on our performance in 2016 and outlook for 2017. Following Bob, our CFO, David Meline, will review our Q4 and full year results and provide details on assumptions imbedded in our guidance for 2017. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update.","As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.","So just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for joining our call. I want to start with the exciting news that we have positive results from our Repatha cardiovascular outcomes trial. In terms of efficacy, the trial met its primary composite and secondary composite endpoints, and importantly in terms of safety, there are were no new findings in the trial. This is obviously an important result for us and for the field as it clearly validates the outcomes benefit of PCSK9 inhibition in cardiovascular disease.","Cardiovascular disease is the most costly disease for society today, and in the absence of new therapies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events for the millions of patients at high risk in the US and around the world, the burden of this disease is set to rapidly rise. This is why we've been so determined to advance Repatha as an innovative treatment option for those people whose LDL levels and cardiovascular risks aren't well managed by other available therapies.","Today's announcement is the culmination of many years of hard work and investment by Amgen, our scientists and collaborators around the world, and I'd like to thank all of those, including the patients in the trial, for making this possible. We look forward to sharing the data from this rigorous 27,500 patient outcome study at the American College of Cardiology Meeting in mid March and to using the data from our entire comprehensive clinical development program for this molecule to prove the value of this innovative therapy to the health care system.","As our investors know, investment in innovation and a strong conviction to use information available from human genetics to guide that investment are at the core of our strategy. Today's results for Repatha are encouraging on both dimensions of our strategy and also underscore our confidence in our ability to drive our long-term growth.","Now let me turn to update you on the substantial progress we made in our priorities for 2016 with continued solid execution across the business. Our results for the year were strong, with earnings per share growing at twice the rate of revenues as reflected in our 12% growth of EPS on a non-GAAP basis and revenue growth of 6%.","Our commitment to reshape the expense base of the business delivered results once more in 2016, with a decrease in operating expenses on a growing business and a 4% improvement in our operating margin on a non-GAAP basis to 52%.","Through our transformation efforts, we've been able to reshape the business while continuing to invest for long-term growth. International expansion is an important element of our long-term growth plan. Consistent with that aspiration, we continued to roll out our launches of new medicines internationally, with some 94 new product stroke country launches in 2016.","Our pipeline is core to our long-term growth aspiration as well, and here too, we made real progress in 2016 as three new late-stage products rapidly approached the market, including Parsabiv in kidney disease, which is already approved in Europe and we expect soon to be approved in the US; EVENITY, our romosozumab antibody in bone health; and Erenumab, our CGRP antibody for migraine.","We believe our biosimilars portfolio will also be a long-term growth driver, and here too, we continue to invest in our portfolio of molecules and achieved an approval of AMJEVITA, a regulatory filing for our biosimilar to Avastin, and a successful pivotal study for our biosimilar to Herceptin.","We've said for some time that one of the characteristics of our business is its strong cash flows. This year, we generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow or an 8% cash flow yield. This enables us to return significant capital to our shareholders and to invest externally in innovation, which we did once again this year. Consistent with our confidence in our outlook for long-term growth, we once more raised our dividend, this time by 15%.","As I mentioned before, we are focused on long-term growth. In 2014, we provided five-year financial commitments through 2018. We've just passed the three-year mark, and I'm pleased with our tangible progress against those commitments and we're on-track to meet or exceed them. We will likely face headwinds in 2017 as declines in our mature brands will begin to offset volume growth from our more recently launched products. This is reflected in our 2017 guidance, which David will discuss further.","It's important to note that we began our transformation efforts here several years ago in anticipation of the competitive headwinds we expect to face. Operating leverage from the changes we've made enable us to drive earnings growth in the near term, while our longer-term investments have laid the foundation for growth beyond this period. The elements necessary to drive that long-term growth are clearly coming into focus with our recent launch of six new therapies including Repatha and KYPROLIS and the three we expect to launch in the near feature, as well as the emergence of our biosimilar portfolio.","Shifting focus to Washington, I thought perhaps I should say a few words following our meeting with President Trump and his administration earlier this week. First, I would reiterate my appreciation for the president and his administration's interest in our industry. He was very clear about his desire to promote innovation on behalf of patients, economic growth and job creation.","Second, the president and his team recognized the leading role the United States has played in the field of biotechnology, and we share their desire to strengthen the environment for employees and employers in this sector. Biotech jobs are highly skilled desirable jobs, and there's a global competition for them.","We've long supported corporate tax reform as a way to level the playing field with our ex US competitors, and we look forward to being part of the policy discussions with the new administration around this area as well as regulatory reform, intellectual property protection and trade policy. I think this administration expects to deliver real progress in each of those areas for our industry.","And now on the topic of drug pricing, the President was also clear, as he was throughout his campaign, about the need for us to find ways to bring down the cost of drugs for citizens in the US. We want and expect to work with the President and the administration to be part of the solution in that effort. In participation with the administration and Congress, we will seek to advance changes that enable more Americans to have affordable access to life saving and cost effective medicines.","Now let's turn to David, who will review our financial performance. David?","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the fourth quarter financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, revenue at $6 billion grew 8% year over year. This quarter, we saw steady product sales performance driven by net selling price and unit demand growth versus last year.","Other revenues at $302 million increased $95 million versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited primarily from milestone payments, notably a milestone received related to the out-licensing of AMG 139, consistent with our focus on optimizing our portfolio of pipeline assets. Changes in foreign exchange had less than a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year over year basis.","Non-GAAP operating income at $2.9 billion grew 21% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 6 points to 50.5% for the quarter, reflecting continued revenue performance, favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories, and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment on October 31.","On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 1 point to 13.3%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies. Research and development expenses at $1.06 billion were flat year over year. SG&A expenses decreased 4% on a year over year basis, primarily due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 2% year over year.","Other income and expenses were a net $202 million expense in Q4. This is unfavorable by $82 million on a year over year basis. This year over year unfavorability was primarily due to higher interest expense due to higher net debt levels, sorry, higher debt levels as well as losses from investment portfolio rebalancing in the fourth quarter of this year.","The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.7% for the quarter, a 7.1 point increase versus Q4 of 2015. This increase reflects unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings this year as well as the realization of the full year benefit of the 2015 federal R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year over year for the fourth quarter.","Please find a summary of our 2016 full year results on page 7 of the presentation. Our 2016 full year revenues grew 6% to $23 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 12% to $11.65 per share. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income at $11.4 billion grew 14% from prior year based on the combination of solid revenue growth and a year over year decline in operating expenses.","Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 4 points to 52.3% for the year, demonstrating our commitment to improve the profitability of the business as we continue to realize the benefits from our ongoing transformation initiatives. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 1.2 points to 13.3%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies. This decrease is a direct result of our continuing efforts to streamline our manufacturing processes, increase utilization of our factories, and maintain our position as a leader in the field of biologic drug manufacturing.","Research and development decreased 4% as increased new business development activities were more than offset by lower spending required to support certain later stage clinical programs, as well as transformation and process improvement efforts. SG&A expenses were up 5%, primarily due to launch product expense increases, partially offset by the benefits of our transformation efforts as well as the expiration of the Enbrel residual royalty.","In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% year over year to $11.5 billion, reflecting continued benefits from our transformation and process improvement efforts. Through 2016, operating expenses have decreased by approximately $200 million versus the 2013 levels, while absorbing significant investments in new product launches, advancing our new biosimilar business and building out our global presence.","We remain on track to our 2018 commitments. To date we have realized approximately $1.2 billion of transformation savings, well on our way to achieving our 2018 commitment of $1.5 billion.","Other income and expenses were unfavorable by $139 million on a year over year basis due to lower investment gains realized in 2016, and higher interest expense due to higher debt balances, offset partially by higher interest income due to higher cash balances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.8%, up 2 points versus 2015. The year over year increase was primarily due to unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, offset partially by the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09 earlier this year.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 8. For the full year 2016 Amgen continued to demonstrate strong and durable cash flow generation with $9.6 billion in free cash flow versus $9.1 billion last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher profitability. Cash and investments increased to $38.1 billion. This balance included $2 billion in the US and $36.1 billion outside the US. Total debt outstanding increased to $34.6 billion, and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and an average maturity of 13 years.","In 2016, we deployed $3 billion to repurchase 19.7 million shares at an average of $154 per share. At the end of 2016 we had $4.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","Additionally for 2016, we increased our dividend per share by 27% to $1 per quarter with payments totaling $3 billion. Based on our confidence in the future outlook for the enterprise and our continued commitment to our capital allocation strategy, we also announced a 15% increase to the dividend to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2017.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2017 on page 9. 2017 will be an important year for Amgen as we continue to progress towards achievement of our long-term commitments. We've reshaped the business to deliver top-tier margin performance while continuing to invest for the long-term growth of the business.","As we enter 2017, there are several key assumptions embedded in our outlook that I would like to take a moment to share. First, our revenue guidance range for 2017 includes continued positive momentum from our growth brands and recent product launches. Our guidance also reflects the continued impact of competition against NEUPOGEN and EPOGEN as well as biosimilar competition against Neulasta commencing in the fourth quarter. We also expect competitive dynamics to result in limited net selling price yield through 2017, in particular for Enbrel as well as our contract extension with DaVita related to ESAs as previously disclosed.","Next, we expect an unfavorable impact due to foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 1 percentage point to revenue growth and an approximate $0.20 unfavorable impact to non-GAAP EPS on a year over year basis, assuming current exchange rates prevail through 2017. With respect to other revenue, in 2016 we benefited from rising royalty income as well as several out-licensing transactions, which we do not expect will repeat in 2017. Therefore, we expect 2017 other revenue to be about $200 million less than in 2016.","Finally, today's revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges are wider than we typically have provided in the past, which is primarily a reflection of the Repatha legal case potential results as well as how quickly payers provide access to appropriate patients as a result of the positive Repatha cardiovascular outcomes data.","With this background, our 2017 revenue guidance is $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $11.80 to $12.60 per share. In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 18.5% to 19.5%. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year. As part of our commitment to capital allocation to shareholders, we plan to repurchase shares in a range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in 2017.","As a result of our strong progress through 2016 as well as our 2017 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period, including double digit non-GAAP EPS growth, non-GAAP operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%, $1.5 billion of transformation savings and return to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period.","Our 2017 guidance ranges are based on application of existing laws, including the Affordable Care Act and the current US tax code as well as current interpretation of the required 180-day notice period prior to commercial marketing of a biosimilar under the BPCIA. If any of these change in ways that are significant to our outlook, we'll provide an updated view on guidance at that time.","In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2016. And we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2017 and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you, David. You'll find a summary of our performance for the fourth quarter on slide number 11. We had a strong finish to 2016, delivering fourth quarter sales growth of 6% year over year. Fiscal year 2016 sales grew by 5% to a total of $21.9 billion. Our team has delivered this growth whilst absorbing significant loss of EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN sales to competition.","Growth in the fourth quarter was principally driven by Enbrel, Prolia, and our newer products, Repatha and KYPROLIS. Growth was also relatively balanced across geographies, with US growth of 7% and international growth of 5% year over year. International growth was 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange and was fueled by an 11% volume growth.","Our performance in 2016 was successful across several dimensions. We continue to drive strong volume growth of many of our brands, particularly Prolia, XGEVA, Nplate, Vectibix, KYPROLIS and Sensipar. Our international business delivered double digit volume growth. We laid the groundwork for future growth with numerous product launches outside the United States led by Repatha and KYPROLIS, which are off to strong starts in these markets.","Our lifecycle management efforts in the US continue to be effective, evidenced by the uptick of Neulasta Onpro and Aranesp in the dialysis setting. We've also begun our launch preparations for the next wave of product launches, including Parsabiv, EVENITY, and Erenumab.","Let's now turn to our product specific performance beginning with our bone health franchise. Prolia delivered 25% year over year growth for the full year and a 22% year over year growth for the fourth quarter, as we continue to increase share in our core markets. Prolia represents a unique opportunity. It has a strong clinical profile with the proven ability to reduce the risk of fractures, combined with strong long-term safety data. Prolia is the market leader and continues to grow in this significantly unserved disease.","For context, it's estimated that nearly 200 million people worldwide suffer from osteoporosis. In the US, Europe and Japan, less than 50% of these people are diagnosed and only half of those are treated. In addition, between 2000 and 2011, there were 4.9 million hospitalizations from osteoporotic fractures in the US alone. We believe there's an opportunity to improve PMO diagnosis and treatment rates and are focusing efforts in this area. Overall, we expect Prolia to remain a significant growth driver for us into the foreseeable future.","We're also excited about expanding our bone health franchise with EVENITY, our innovative bone building molecule, which is under review at the FDA. We look forward to commercializing EVENITY globally with our partner UCB.","Turning now to ESAs. As we previously announced, we recently renegotiated our ESA supply agreement with DaVita. DaVita represents approximately one third of the US dialysis market and will continue to predominantly purchase EPOGEN. Our new contract replaces the previous one, extending our relationship to the end of 2022. In order to continue this strong partnership for a longer duration, as well as helping to increase certainty, we made some concessions to net selling price beginning in 2017. I'd point out that we don't expect a biosimilar entrant in the US until late 2017 at the earliest. As David said, this assumes that the current interpretation of the required 180-day notice period prior to commercial marketing of a biosimilar under BPCIA is upheld.","Aranesp grew 5% year over year, primarily from gains in the mid-size and the independent dialysis organizations as they've transitioned from EPOGEN. As we noted in our third quarter call, we believe the majority of this transition is now complete. EPOGEN's rate of decline slowed to 8% year over year in the fourth quarter. Recall that Fresenius' transition to an alternative product began in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Sensipar increased 7% year over year in the fourth quarter due to net selling price and unit growth with underlying TRx growth in the US of over 5% year over year.","We recently launched Parsabiv in a few of the smaller markets in Europe with about 10 more expected by the end of 2017. We look forward to launching in the US following FDA approval. Once approved by the FDA, we'll work with CMS to secure reimbursement, which we expect will take between three to four months after approval.","Moving now to Enbrel, where the market growth continued in the fourth quarter with over 20% year over year growth in value for both the rheumatology and the dermatology segments. Sequentially, market share of Enbrel in both segments remained relatively steady in the quarter. Enbrel fourth quarter sales benefited from an increase in end customer inventory levels. We expect about $150 million of this traversed in the first quarter this year.","As we previously stated, we expect to realize minimal net selling price growth throughout 2017 based on contracts that went into effect on January 1. We also expect volume trends in 2017 to be similar to 2016. We continue to invest strategically in Enbrel including pursuit of new indications and novel delivery systems to enhance the value it brings to patients and providers. Given its long period of patent protection, Enbrel will continue to generate significant cash flows for many years to come.","Let's now turn to our oncology brands, beginning with Neulasta. Neulasta declined 3% year over year due to lower unit volume partially offset by net selling price. Sequential unit volume in the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by heavier purchasing by some customers in the US during the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales of Neulasta also benefited from a single $38 million purchase by the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, otherwise known as BARDA.","Based on the best available data, there appears to be a small decline in the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. Our Neulasta lifecycle management has helped to compensate for this reduction however. The strategy includes investing in our DDC campaign focused on raising awareness of febrile neutropenia risk as well as the benefits of Onpro delivery kit.","As expected, we've seen an increase in the average number of Neulasta cycles for patients being treated with the Onpro. Onpro continues to gain traction and exited 2016 with approximately 50% share in the US for all Neulasta sales. We are focused on continued growth given the value Onpro brings to patients and providers and expect Onpro will be a key differentiator for future competition. Finally as David mentioned, we do not expect any long-acting biosimilar competition until fourth quarter 2017, assuming the current interpretation of the 180 days is upheld.","NEUPOGEN exited 2016 holding over 50% of the short-acting market in the US. We expect competitive trends to continue into 2017 from existing and potentially new biosimilar competition. We also now face biosimilar competition in Canada. Overall, we expect the impact from competition in 2017 to be similar in relative magnitude as was in 2016.","XGEVA grew 6% year over year as we continue to emphasize its clinical benefits. We look forward to having the positive multiple myeloma study data added to our label to provide these patients with a new treatment alternative. For Vectibix and Nplate, we see good year on year unit growth.","Moving now to KYPROLIS. Multiple myeloma is a growing but competitive market, given the number of new treatment options. In the fourth quarter, KYPROLIS unit volume grew in both the US and the international markets. We are focused on growing our business in the second-line setting on the compelling ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data. In the US, the focused messages of our recent campaigns are resonating with oncologists in this crowded and dynamic market. Outside the US, we continue to enter into new markets and secure reimbursement. KYPROLIS has strong uptake internationally in the fourth quarter, with a sequential unit growth of over 10%. In Europe, new patient share exceeded 20% in the second-line setting and exceeded 30% in the third-line setting.","Turning now to our cardiovascular franchise. In two years, we have firmly established ourselves in the cardiovascular space. Our first product, Corlanor, helped us develop relationships and learn the market. Corlanor will continue to play a unique and essential role for certain patients. Nonetheless, we expect Corlanor will remain a niche product with modest sales of under $50 million in 2017 due to its limited label.","Repatha, our second cardiovascular brand, represents one of our largest opportunities. I'm very pleased with the strong competitive execution by our team since launch. We continue to increase our share of new-to-brand prescriptions in the US, and in fact have captured just over 60% to date in January 2017. Our focus here remains on enabling access for appropriate patients. In Europe, we've made very good progress since approval in July 2015. We've now secured reimbursement in 14 markets, with more expected in 2017. We are the market leader in Europe with a 57% market share.","In closing, I'm proud of the team's execution. We delivered results in 2016 in the face of intensifying competition. As we enter 2017, I'm confident that we will continue to increase our level of competitiveness, enabling us to exercise our strategy of delivering innovative therapies to patients suffering from grievous illnesses.","Let me now pass you to Sean.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. There's been a lot of progress in R&D since our last call and I'll begin my comments with our cardiovascular therapeutic area. Cardiologists have been looking for many years for an agent that could be used to treat patients already on statins who are nonetheless at high risk for cardiovascular events. At the American Heart Association meetings in November, the cardiology community was excited to see in our intracoronary ultrasound study, GLAGOV. Not only plaque regression when Repatha was added on top of optimized statin therapy in patients with established atherosclerotic heart disease, but also continued plaque reduction down to LDL cholesterol levels in the 20 milligram per deciliter range.","Our hypothesis from inception of the Repatha program has been that one should strive maximally to inhibit PCSK9 and thereby maximally reduce LDL to the greatest benefit in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, and that it makes no sense to treat to an arbitrary LDL goal in such patients.","Now in our FOURIER outcomes trial, we have met the primary composite endpoint comprised of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina as well as the key secondary composite endpoint around which the study was statistically powered. This is the more objective MACE or major adverse cardiac event endpoints being non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. Furthermore, we did not observe any new safety findings in this large placebo controlled study.","We've also seen the results of an approximately 1,900 patient study of patients in FOURIER that evaluated changes in cognitive function over time, which met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to placebo. From a scientific and medical standpoint, the FOURIER and GLAGOV studies provide a set of landmark results clearly validating the PCSK9 mechanism.","And remember, this is in treatment context of the high hurdle of Repatha being given on top of optimized statin therapy. These are patients with no other meaningful therapeutic options for further LDL lowering. Bear in mind, the population studied in FOURIER has an approximately 50% 10-year residual risk of experiencing a CV event despite optimized statin therapy. And these patients are quite representative of the large number of patients like this out there in day-to-day medical practice. We look forward to presenting the data at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Session in in March.","Since statins were introduced 30 years ago, our industry has been seeking a safe and effective agent to extend beyond the benefits of statin therapy. From the seminal initial association in academia of PCSK9 gene variance in humans to abnormal LDL levels and cardiovascular risk, to Amgen's elucidation of the complex biology involved, and our resulting intellectual property around Repatha, and through our extensive set of clinical trials culminating in GLAGOV and FOURIER, this program's been a remarkable example of the power of human validation of a drug target from the very beginning, based on human genetic insights. I'm proud of the role Amgen has played here and our efforts to drive this paradigm forward in many other programs, with our leading human genetics platform at deCODE and our broad suite of modalities to interdict such targets.","I'm also pleased to report that the Omecamtiv mecarbil program in collaboration with Cytokinetics and Servier is advancing nicely and our 8,000 patient Phase III outcome study in chronic heart failure is now actively enrolling patients. We have also completed enrollment in the Phase II study of chronic heart failure patients in Japan, and expect to see the results later this year. Finally in cardiovascular, we've recently submitted an sBLA for a pediatric indication for Corlanor.","In oncology, we announced a collaboration with Janssen to evaluate the combination of KYPROLIS and DARZALEX, two very powerful agents for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The first study to initiate will be a Phase III registrational study of KYPROLIS plus DARZALEX plus dexamethasone versus KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone in the relapsed setting with enrollment expected to begin in the second quarter of this year.","We also remain committed to the frontline setting, and are in the design phase of the Phase III study of KYPROLIS plus Revlimid and dexamethasone or KRd versus Velcade plus RD in newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients. And we'll provide more details on this study as we finalize our plans.","As is common in drug development, especially in oncology, registration requirements evolve with the science as treatment landscapes change. After initial consultation with regulators, our KYPROLIS weekly administration study, ARROW, had been designed with an overall response rate as the primary endpoint. Based on recent feedback from regulators, response rate is no longer deemed an acceptable endpoint in this clinical context. Therefore, we amended the protocol, making progression-free survival the primary endpoint. As this is an event driven endpoint, we now expect the results from the final analysis in 2019.","We're committed to increasing our footprint in multiple myeloma, and we have several early stage innovative programs ongoing including an MCL-1 inhibitor in Phase I and CD38 and BCMA by specific T cell engaging programs. We also intend to make regulatory submissions this year for XGEVA for the prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma patients. This remains an important area of unmet need as many of these patients cannot effectively be treated with currently available therapies due to impaired renal function.","In immuno-oncology, our bispecific programs continue to advance. We'll be working with regulators to update the BLINCYTO label with the overall survival data from our confirmatory study in Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed refractory ALL. We're also pursuing new indications for BLINCYTO including a submission this year for a small but clinically important population of Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed refractory ALL patients.","We're also advancing BLINCYTO into late-stage clinical studies in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a much larger indication. While these initial studies will be conducted with our current BLINCYTO construct, we will also be pursuing an extended half-life version in this setting. In fact, we'll be advancing several extended half-life BiTE molecules into the clinic this year directed at various targets.","We're also making good progress with AMG 330, our CD33 BiTE for acute myelogenous leukemia, which is progressing through dose escalation in Phase I. Within our growing multiple myeloma portfolio, we have several immuno-oncology programs we're excited about, including our biospecific CD38 molecule from Xencor and our BCMA BiTE, AMG 420, that's currently in Phase I.","The potency of the BiTE platform also makes target selection critical, and we've developed a world-class proprietary target investigation platform. To augment this platform, earlier this month we announced a research collaboration and exclusive licensing agreement with Immatics, who has a unique target discovery capability in order for us to develop next-generation T cell engaging biospecific immunotherapies.","Switching to bone health, along with our partners at UCB, we continue to make progress with romosozumab, now called EVENITY. We've been having productive interactions with FDA on our BLA filing for the treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at increased risk of fracture. We're working toward a July 19 PDUFA date. And at this time, it does not appear that we will have an FDA advisory committee meeting for this program.","We also recently submitted an application for marketing approval in Japan for the treatment of osteoporosis for men and women at high risk in fracture. We look forward to the primary analysis of the active controlled fracture study, ARCH, in the second quarter. In this randomized double-blind study, patients receive either alendronate or romosozumab in year one followed by alendronate in year two. The primary endpoints of the study that will be assessed at the primary analysis are the incidence of vertebral fracture at 24 months and the incidence of clinical fractures, which is event-driven.","In addition, at the time of the primary analysis, an interim analysis of the secondary endpoint of non-vertebral fracture will be performed. In order to assure adequate powering in non-vertebral fracture, we will include an event-driven non-vertebral fracture final analysis. If we do not achieve significance at the time of the primary analysis in Q2, we expect the final analysis of non-vertebral fracture some months after the primary analysis.","Turning to our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, I'll begin with our CGRP receptor antibody for migraine prophylaxis, Erenumab. We have successfully completed our registrational studies and are preparing our global regulatory submissions, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. I'd like to commend our team on their execution of this program, in which we're clearly positioned to be first to market. And we'll be seeking registration in both episodic and chronic migraine.","Migraine is a devastating condition that affects millions of patients, often in their most productive years of life. And we believe that for an otherwise active population, a monthly subcutaneous self-administered presentation with a patient-friendly auto-injector pen would be well received.","In our Alzheimer's program, CNP520, a small-molecule BACE inhibitor, recently received Fast Track designation from the FDA, and patient screening is underway in the Phase III study we and Novartis are conducting in collaboration with the Banner Institute. Recall this study will enroll patients genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's disease who are cognitively normal, an approach that differs from many of the ongoing studies in symptomatic patients.","Quickly on Enbrel, we received an expanded indication in the US, making Enbrel the first and only systemic therapy to treat pediatric patients ages 4 to 17 with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This is particularly noteworthy, as safety is always a particular concern when it comes to treating children.","In nephrology we are working toward a February 9 PDUFA action date for Parsabiv for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. Parsabiv would be the only calcimimetic agent that can be administered intravenously by a healthcare provider three times a week, coincidence with hemodialysis sessions. And we believe this would allow physicians to have confidence that their patients are receiving the full benefit of the therapy.","We also recently submitted an application to FDA for pediatric indication for our oral calcimimetic, Sensipar.","Finally, our biosimilar programs continue to advance. In Europe we recently received a CHMP positive opinion for ABP 501 our biosimilar Humira. FDA has also accepted our BLA submission for ABP 215, our biosimilar Avastin, with an action date of September of this year.","2016 was a very positive and rewarding year with many significant accomplishments. And I'd like to thank all of our staff for their hard work and commitment to deliver important advances in medicine for the many patients still in need.","2017 is going be another exciting year. And I look forward to seeing many of you at ACC. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Sean. Let me just quickly wrap up on the year, and then we'll open up for questions. As I hope you can tell from our remarks, we have a clear strategy for long-term growth and we're executing it effectively. That's reflected in our financials with 6% revenue growth, 12% EPS and 4 percentage points of margin improvement. The Repatha outcome study we believe will enable us to show once more how innovation benefits patients and society.","Now the court's recent ruling in our patent litigation is a win for the patent system and patients as it reinforces incentives for the large and risky investments we have to make in innovation to bring forward new medicines to treat serious diseases.","With respect to innovation, we advanced our next set of late-stage innovative pipeline opportunities and our biosimilars program as well. We generated $10 billion of free cash flow as reflected in our free cash flow yield of 8%.","We look forward to working with the administration to advance market-based reforms and solutions that further promote innovation. And as we work to address the headwinds that we've identified for 2017, I'd remind you we've made excellent progress on our long-term commitments for 2018, and we're on track to meet or exceed them.","So with that, Frederick, why don't we open the line for questions, and if you wouldn't mind, let's remind our callers once more what the process is for asking questions of us. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Geez, Arvind, I need to disappear for three months to get the first question. Thank you so much for your kind words and thanks to your whole team for all the help while I was out. And thanks, Bob, for the nice note while I was gone. And congratulations to Sean on Repatha.","I just had, if I may, I don't know if I'm going get an answer to this, but I thought I might try. Sean, can you give us any information at all around what the predefined non-inferiority margin might have been on the primary endpoint in the neuro cognitive trial? And if you're unwilling to answer that, maybe you can just give me your updated thoughts on the A beta hypothesis in light of the solanezumab failures? Thanks again to everybody.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Hey first, Mark, on behalf of the team, great to hear your voice. Welcome back. Sean, go ahead. There's two questions there, why don't you...","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","You only have to answer one.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah. The first one I can't answer. The second one I would say that we really don't see any read through on the decision Lilly has made with their antibody to the approach of small molecule BACE inhibition. And I think that I still am a very strong believer in BACE as a drug target and don't believe that really any of the data that's emerging with these antibodies changes the point of view we have on the amyloid hypothesis.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Sean, you might also just remind Mark and other listeners that we could also see some setbacks for other small molecule programs directed against BACE before we know that there's only CNP520..","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Right. Right. We do have the point of view and it's one that exists in the field as a whole, that it may be too late to intervene in patients who have frank Alzheimer's disease already at the time that we begin to administer these products in relatively short-term clinical trials. And this is why we and a few others are focusing on patients who are predisposed to developing cognitive impairment but are cognitively normal when they enter the treatment phase of the trials. And that's the approach we're taking. So I think we could actually see even some failures of BACE inhibitors before we see success of BACE inhibitors and certainly the antibodies are a much tougher proposition in my mind.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Sean. Congratulations to you on your trial execution.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks and my congrats also on the FOURIER data. Sean, I know the press release is silent on the other two secondary endpoints, CV mortality and all cause mortality. Should we take that silence to mean that they were missed or just that there's no ability to give us information on that right now? And when do you think you'll be able to submit the data in sPBA form to an FDA label? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, so it's the latter. You should probably not make conclusions (49:53) about the data based on absence of statements in the press release. And we are working. As you might imagine, this is a reasonably high priority for us at the company at the moment, so we have people working right now really hard on putting together a filing. So we'll be doing that as fast as we possibly can.","Operator","Our next question.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, go on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On the Repatha trial, quick one for Sean. You put on your press release that there's a unequivocally connection between LDL lowering and CV risk reduction. Should we infer that again the data kind of like fits where we saw from the meta-analysis before? And secondly, quick question for Bob. When you met with the President earlier this week, you committed to hiring another 1,500 workers in the States. Can we get some color on that? Is that going be from manufacturing operations or is that going be for promotion of Repatha based on this data? Thank you.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. So what I would say about my comment in the press release about the inequivocal is that just if you think about it, we've done this very large trial which is testing the question of whether Repatha versus placebo has an impact on cardiovascular disease and the trial is statistically significant at these key primary and secondary endpoints. So I think just by definition, that is a validation of the connection between the LDL lowering and the cardiovascular and that's all it's meant to provide, not any magnitude of effect kind of a statement.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","So, Ying, thanks for your question about the job creation. Couple things, first, these were jobs that were expected, contemplated in our plans for 2017. So this is a reflection both of our ongoing confidence and the attractiveness of the environment here in the US, and of the outlook we have for long-term growth. And we were happy to be able to share that publicly because as I said, that reflects what's our current planning assumptions.","So in terms of where the jobs are, really across the business. If you want to look at some specific new areas for us, obviously we look forward to standing up a neurology franchise with our partners at Novartis and we have exciting incremental opportunity coming in bone health that we expect to be investing in. And we have some staff that we'll be hiring here to support our ongoing international expansion as well.","So as you know, we launched 94 product\/country opportunities last year. And so we're continuing to support those with incremental hiring. But generally, in our transformation efforts of the last few years we've been reallocating resources to where we see the most attractive growth opportunities and we'll continue to do that in 2017.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. I'm going to try a Repatha question as well, and if you don't answer that, I have a second one. But you've obviously had a bunch of conversations with payers over the last year and so I know you can't talk about the hazard ratio. But maybe you could just comment if the hazard ratio and the data as a whole gives you a high degree of confidence that you've met the demands of payers with this data set to get broader access.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","You want to offer your second question now, Matthew, so we have them both?","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, sure. Bob, I just wanted to ask you. I mean, you talked about meeting with the President, some of the goals there. I mean, do you have a view on timelines for when we might see some movement around tax reform or some of these other issues?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","I think the tax reform guidance that's out now in public is probably appropriate. So I don't think tax reform is going to be in the first wave of things to see coming out of the new administration and out of Congress, but I think we will see it this year. And we talked at some length about this, including comprehensive tax reform and repatriation and whether they'll be linked or separate. So we appreciated the administration and the President's updated guidance on that.","But what I'd say, Matthew, is we expect that we'll see it. And generally, I think we're going to find that this is an administration with an action bias and I think they're going to expect to see ideas from us and others in pretty short order here to start addressing some of the concerns that they want to address for the American people. So the good news is we as a company and we as an industry have some ideas and we look forward to being able to sit down with the administration and Congress and talk about them and see what we can do to work together and make some progress.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one on your 2017 guidance. David, I think you mentioned that there was some wider range than is typical and that really reflects two things with respect to Repatha, one is the legal case and then number two is how quickly payers provide access given the data you saw. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more context for both of those? Is the commentary around the quickness of access driven by the data itself or is it driven by having these additional discussions? What's driving that? And maybe just any more detail you could share on both of those. Thank you.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, so what I would say is as it regards to the litigation, obviously there's a range of possible outcomes and positions that we have in the market, so we've tried to capture all of those in the wider range. And in terms of the uptake, what I would say is maybe Tony would like to comment, but we think again there's a range of outcomes that you would see with the uptake in the increased access.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. So I mean, our focus remains on helping all payers improve access to Repatha. The utilization management criteria that they have at the moment is beyond the label and we work every day to improve upon that. We look forward to seeing the payer response now that we have the outcomes data. But of course, we won't be able to promote that until it's in the label.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, Frederick, let's take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. So the product that you increased the prices last year, we estimate that on average, increase was about 7.45%. I mean please correct me if I'm wrong. And what was the net realized gain in the price last year?","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","So we haven't provided specific disclosure on that, although if you were to go through each of our quarterly calls, we do provide a summary of list price changes, volume and other factors, right. So I think unless you'd like to comment, Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","No.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","I think you can see it's a number obviously less than 7.5%.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So, I mean we report every quarter, Eun, the makeup of product changes in terms of units, inventory and of course, at that times net selling price, which is a combination of list price changes and then contractual changes which the impact rebates over time.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, maybe just adding to that, Eun, what I think important for us as we look into 2017, as I said in the guidance, we have a limited price uptake net in 2017, which is primarily driven by the fact that as we've said previously, we expect very limited net price on Enbrel, and as Tony mentioned again today, we've given some additional discounts as it relates to EPOGEN with DaVita. So what you can expect is that for Amgen in 2017, you'll see a reduced net price including the US pricing, which will be around inflation specs (58:41).","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you. So Bob, one last question around the Trump meeting. What can you say that might make us more comfortable that we won't see, because you said he's action-based, or it's an action-based administration, drug pricing pressure ahead of some reform, like more aggressive either tweeting or shaving or something that might be implemented ahead of some sort of reform? Anything that came out of that. And then on the volumes, maybe you could comment a little bit about, is there something nuanced in fourth quarter that makes you feel comfortable that the volumes will not continue to decline, they'll be less use of these types of drugs over time. What gives you that comfort that you can stabilize that? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Sorry, Robyn. Just to be clear on the second part, are you talk about a particular product or in general?","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sorry, I just talking about the Neulasta. You commented that there's less per cycle chemo use of these agents. I was just wondering if you could comment on that. Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, I mean I appreciate that there's a lot of interest in the discussions we had in Washington, and that's why I wanted to try to address it proactively. Again, genuinely I think that those of us that were there were encouraged by the level of interest that the President has in our businesses and in our industry, I think encouraged by the respect he has for the importance of innovation. He spoke about the need to eradicate disease in his inaugural address, and I think recognizes the power of innovation to do that. So all that, Robyn, gives us great encouragement.","He talked, I think, publicly when we were with him about the need to look at areas of reform, tax reform, regulatory reform, intellectual property protection, trade policy. So all of those, I think, are encouraging for us. He's also been very clear that drug pricing is something that's important to him, and that I'm sure he's going to want to be able to deliver real benefits to the American public on that score. So obviously, I'm not in a position to comment on what he's going say, when.","But I was trying to convey that genuinely we came away pleased that the administration led by the President was interested in engaging with us on the business, and we look forward to working with them and Congress to try to identify things that we all can do differently to help provide access to medicines for the people who need them. So again, I know that there's an interest on the call and by investors to better understand this, but I don't think I could add any other perspective beyond what I've already said Robyn.","And with respect to Neulasta, Tony, maybe you can address her question.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. So, Robyn, I mean we always try to be as transparent as possible around the data we see coming and give you guys some heads up as to what we're seeing. The calculation of the number of myelosuppressive regimens in the US, of course, is a complicated process to go through using a number of databases, and then from that we extract from it the number myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and then within that, we look at what actually falls within the label of Neulasta itself.","Looking back over the last five, eight years, it continues to fluctuate slightly all the time. And when I talk about a decline, I'm talking about a very low single digit number that I've seen the last quarter. And we're just watching that carefully, but it's been offset by the incremental cycles we're seeing with Onpro as we use Neulasta.","As Bob has said in the past, the number of patients being admitted to hospital with febrile neutropenia continues to increase, and the number of people that die because of that is also on the increase. So the need continues to be there, and we continue to work hard to make sure that physicians and patients are aware of the availability of Neulasta.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you. All right. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Question, I had a question as it relates to expenses in operating margin. Obviously there's a big benefit windfall from the royalty you won't pay this year. So wanted to understand how much of that do you think could drop to the bottom. And just overall when you think about SG&A and R&D, can you continue to expand operating margins? Because I would think with the CVOT finishing up that there would be some benefit there. So if you look at the two of those, how much operating margin do you have and how much can you drop from the Pfizer benefit? Thank you so much.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. So, I would say on the overall operating margin question and then going to the expense. So we finished last year, as we mentioned, at 52%. And what we were able to convey again today is that we expect to meet or exceed all of our commitments and that would include operating at 52% to 54%. So we continue to feel very good about our performance from a margin perspective.","Secondly, if you look at the components of cost, and I think about it in 2017, correct. We have quite a significant improvement in our cost base due to the reduction in the royalty that's effective in 2017 as well as the fact that we'll continue to see additional benefits from transformation initiatives incrementally in 2017 as we continue to march towards the $1.5 billion goal. And partially offsetting that, and Bob touched on it earlier, we do have new expenses that we're building in the business, in particular as we launch more products internationally, that adds cost to the base as well as","standing up a new neuro franchise for the company and expanding on bone, will add some cost.","So I think net-net when you net those out, we'll see most of that reduction of the royalty go to the bottom line but not all this year. But again, we feel very good about the performance of the company in that we're now operating amongst the top tier in terms of not only efficiency and margin, but we're continuing to invest, I think, very appropriately in the long-term future of the business.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and again, offer my congrats on the outcomes data. So, Tony, trying to determine the commercial path for Repatha with the new data. Are there opportunities to have formulary discussions post ACC or do you think you'll have to wait for the formal PBM negotiation season this fall after legal chips in. (65:25)","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Geoff, from the revised guidance on section 114 here, we can clearly go out and talk about the top line data and talk conceptually with payers about the value this data brings to them. We can't however, at this particular stage, promote it from a sales perspective because it's not into the label yet, but we can talk to payers, yes.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aaron Gal, Ph.D. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking my questions. I'll touch on biosimilars here, a couple of them. With interchangeability guidance, are you guys considering starting any interchangeability trials for your mAb programs? And does that differ between the anti-TNFs and the oncology program?","And then regarding Neulasta, you kind of mentioned the SCOTUS risk for canceling the six months warning. But there's also a chance that they'll reintroduce the patent then. And if they do, does that essentially mean the Neulasta biosimilar will be delayed deep into 2018? Or is that still outstanding?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, I think, Ronny, I'm not sure we want to comment about matters that relate to the ongoing litigation. And with respect to interchangeability, what I would say generally, is that we think that the pathway that looks like going be pursued here in US for","interchangeability is consistent with what we've been advocating for and doesn't represent a change from what we've expected. So I think that's probably, from a competitive standpoint, all I want to say at this point. Again, consistent with what our expectations have been and consistent with what we've been advocating for.","Aaron Gal, Ph.D. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. So I'm wondering, on the capital allocation front, given that you now have a cash balance of nearly $40 billion to go along with significant ongoing free cash flow generation and potential favorable tax policy from the new administration, does this change the types or the size of organizations that you would potentially being be willing to look at relative to the historic strategy you guys have communicated? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Maybe David and I can double team this, Cory. Again, we have felt for some time that we have a lot flexibility in our balance sheet to do acquisitions. And I think anything that provides clarity on the tax rate and clarity on the global tax structure would be helpful. It would probably increase our flexibility, but again, I think we have felt for some time that we have considerable flexibility to do transactions. And when we've talked in the past about the kinds of things we're looking at, we've often talked about it in the context of the big plate of things that we have internally that we're working through.","But we feel like we're in a place now where we can look externally for large and small opportunities to help grow the business. So I think the message is, we're confident in the outlook for our company. We're confident in the importance of innovation. And we've got a balance sheet that supports our ability to look at transactions large and small. David, do you want to add anything to that?","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","No, that's right. I mean I would say flexibility. We remain disciplined always in making sure what we're looking at can generate a return for our shareholders, not just the sellers. And I guess from my perspective, I don't really view us even today pre-tax reform as having some arbitrary cap in terms of what we can look at. We think we need to look at all opportunities of all sizes.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks. Congratulations. That's a real milestone. Unfortunately, just a patent-related question. Could you give us a sense of the timing for your expectations for resolution of the PCSK9 litigation? And then related to that, is there any chance of an equivalent patent to the '165 patent in Europe? Do you believe that that might be infringed?","And then lastly, there's some suggestions on Erenumab that some of your competitors have broad IP around the CGRP pathway. Are you confident that you'll be able to launch that product unencumbered and not at risk? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, Geoff, I think there were three questions there. But with respect to your first question. I think that we expect that the court will rule on the request for a stay of the injunction on or before February 21. With respect to the overall resolution of the case after that, I think it'll probably be something in the four to 10 month timeframe but we'll know more when we've heard from the courts and that will, of course, be public.","And then with respect to your question about the patent outlook in Europe, obviously we don't like to comment about ongoing litigation. So I think I'll hold off on saying anything more than that. And again with respect to Erenumab, we feel confident in both the clinical profile that's emerged for that molecule, as well as our intellectual property portfolio around it.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho Securities.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. First of all, thanks, Arvind, for the kind comments and congrats to everybody on the FOURIER data. Just two questions. One's a backup because the first one's on Repatha. So, Sean, this is not about the results that you guys now have, but this is more about the design. Can you just remind us what you were assuming in terms of bare minimum benefit in order to hit stats, say, based on how you designed the trial?","And if you can't answer that, my question's around Enbrel 2018 pricing, for Tony. Is the 2017 net pricing, minimal net pricing benefit, is that a 2017 thing? Or should we assume that for 2018 and going forward as well? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Salim, I think we can answer your first question because that's in public, the answer's public there.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, the design of the trial is published. And I guess what I would say is that, just always remember that the trial was actually designed around this harder MACE endpoint of the cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. And there we wanted to be able to detect with 90% power a 15% decrease in risk. So that was the design of the study perspective.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, let's go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","The FOURIER results like reshaped the cholesterol management guidelines. How important do you think that is for defining the addressable market and enabling Repatha reimbursement? And then when might those guidelines be revised to reflect the results? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So maybe I can talk a bit about that. Obviously we look forward to hearing what the ACC and the AHA have to say when they see the full data. Everyone we've talked to has talked about revising the guidelines once they see the outcomes. And I can't give you guidance on the timing, but obviously if the data is robust enough, we would certainly hope that the guidelines would come forward pretty soon.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Just maybe following up on the operating margin question. Tony, can you just give a sense for what the plan is for supporting the drugs that are now or will be facing biosimilar competition? And just your own biosimilar portfolio, how should we think about the impact of the launches of those on gross and operating margins?","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","The plan for supporting existing products base income.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Sorry, we were having a little trouble hearing you, Ian. But I think we got it.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So I think your question was what is our plan for supporting existing products that are facing biosimilar competition. Clearly, in places where we believe that the market is evolving to a branded-specific market, we continued to put activity behind the brands. Where they're becoming more commodity like we will reduce activities quite dramatically.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","And with respect, Tony, do you want to comment with respect to, either the gross or the operating margin context for our own biosimilar portfolio, or leave that for another day?","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","I think we've always believed that our own biosimilar will be in a branded type market in therapeutic areas where we have a strength, and therefore we'll be using existing teams to bring these to the market as effectively as we can.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. I think we got a couple more questions queued up. So let's try to get to those, and then Arvind will be here and his team can take any follow-up questions that you all may have.

But on Repatha, maybe you can talk about some of the trends you're seeing with doctors. And are they particularly concerned around the potential for an injunction? I'm just am wondering if you're starting to see people who are Praluent patients move to Repatha. Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Alethia, it's Tony. So let me give you a response. I mean, we don't track anything other than usage by physicians and, yeah, the FDA has approved Repatha for all patients, including those presently taking alirocumab and our expectation is all these patients would in fact become Repatha patients of the future. So we do see, as I said, month to date in January, 60% of new to brand patients are on Repatha. And I'd also add that a vast majority of the physicians that prescribe alirocumab have experience using Repatha, so they know the product and the benefits it provides to their patients","Arvind K.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert Baird.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess in your comments around the Trump administration meeting, you'd said that you're looking forward to working on market-based reform around drug pricing. I just wonder, in the discussion was the idea of allowing CMS to negotiate directly with manufacturers mentioned at all? Is that something still that might be on the table for the administration? And on the regulatory reform front, he had mentioned that he may be naming a new commissioner of FDA soon. I just wonder if you guys had any insight into how seriously he's taking his Silicon Valley advisors in terms of what seems to be a recommendation for complete reduction of regulatory oversight for new drugs?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Brian, I don't think I could comment on that specifically yet. I think you're right that we expect there will be an announcement about an FDA leader here soon. I think this President takes seriously what he's said about regulatory reform. And I suspect that will be reflected in his choice of a leader for FDA. But again, I think we'll all just have to wait and see. And we didn't talk any specifics about the role of HHS. We talked about the need for all of us to work together to address making medicines affordable and accessible to people who benefit from them, and who need them. But again, it was a constructive discussion, Brian.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Okay, Frederick, let's take one last question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo Securities.","Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in and congrats on the FOURIER data. Just wondering if there's anything to learn from the statin experience when we first saw outcomes benefits there as to whether the key is the data, the data presentation, the publication of the data, or the guideline revision in terms of what really drives the inflection of following these kind of outcomes data. Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Maybe I can respond to that because I'm probably old enough to remember, right. I mean so (78:01) happened in the mid 1990s. The market was dramatically different. It was the first time we'd ever seen real impact of lowering LDL. And clearly, there weren't as many sort of utilization management criteria as exists today. So uptake started quite fast as people saw the value. But it was a brand new concept, so it took a good 10 years to get to the peak of the market.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","All right. I think at this time, we'll wrap up. As I said earlier, Arvind and his team are around for those of you who have follow-on questions or didn't get a chance to ask your questions in the hour and a bit that we've been together.

Good afternoon and thank you to all of you for joining our fourth quarter call.  Our performance in 2012 was consistent and strong throughout the year.  We ended 2012 with momentum really across our products and geographies, delivering 11% revenue growth for the year. For the full year, growth in revenues and our ongoing commitment to operational efficiencies provided operating leverage, which is reflected in our 15% growth in operating income.Enbrel was particularly strong, and we had solid contributions from a number of our other products, including Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Nplate, and Vectibix. Our European business continued to grow despite the tough fiscal environment on that continent.We also made significant advances with our pipeline in 2012, with four programs advancing into Phase III development. The most recent advance is the initiation of Phase III studies earlier this month for AMG-145, our PCSK9 antibody that is being developed with patients with high levels of LDL cholesterol. In addition, romosuzamab, for osteoporosis; brodalumab, for psoriasis; and rilotumamab for gastric cancer also advanced in Phase III trials.In December, we further advanced our strategic agenda, with the acquisition of Decode Genetics. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity that this brings to identify and validate new targets based on human genetics.We also delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders in 2012. In December, we raised our dividend for 2013 by 31% and our $10 billion share repurchase plan begun in 2011 is now completed. For 2013, we expect revenue gains in the range of 3-5% and EPS growth of 5-10%. John will provide additional details on that shortly and will comment as well on the progress we\u2019ve made against our previously communicated 2015 objectives.We look forward to providing an update on our strategy, business outlook, and pipeline as Arvind mentioned earlier at our business review on February 7 in New York. Before I turn it over to John, I\u2019d like to thank our staff members around the world for their hard work, dedication, and execution and delivering for patients and shareholders in 2012.John?Jonathan PeacockThanks, Bob. So turning to the first quarter, on page 4 of the slide deck, you can see that revenues in product sales grew by 11% in the quarter, and Enbrel, Prolia, and XGEVA were the biggest contributors to that growth, but Sensipar, Nplate, and Vectibix all continued to deliver strong growth.And our businesses outside of the U.S. grew by 14%, helped by good performance in Europe and from recent acquisitions in Turkey and in Brazil.Operating income also grew by 11%, with growth in operating costs again largely held in line with product sales growth.Cost of sales grew at 13%, primarily driven by the sales increases, but also by our changing product mix, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies.Overall in 2012, our operations group again delivered reliably for every patient and to a high quality. Research and development costs increased by 9%, driven by the ramp up of the Phase III trials, particularly for romosuzamab, our sclerostin antibody for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis, and for AMG-145, our innovative cholesterol-lowering therapy.SG&A expenses increased by 13%, largely driven by the increase in the Enbrel profit share payments during the quarter and to a lesser extent international expansion costs. The increase in expenses in the other income and expense line is a result of the higher interest costs from our debt-financed share repurchase program over the last 18 months.And then income taxes, at 16.1% of pretax income, are higher relative to last year, due to some variability in the geographic mix of our earnings, primarily Enbrel, in the quarter, and the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit that was recognized in 2011. This was partially offset by the resolution of certain state tax matters related to prior years that we settled in the quarter.As I\u2019m sure most of you have noted, the federal R&D tax credit was renewed for 2012, but it was renewed at the beginning of January, and it will be recognized for the full year in the first quarter in addition to the credit for the first quarter of 2013.And finally, adjusted earnings per share were 16% higher, helped by an average share count that was 10% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.In summary, for the full year, on page 5, revenues grew 11%, operating income grew 15%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 22%, to $6.51 per share.We exit 2012 with strong momentum, both in the fourth quarter and over the year as a whole. So turning next to cash flow.  We generated $5.2 billion in free cash flow in 2012.  This was after payment of the previously disclosed settlement with the US government of approximately $800 million, which was paid during the fourth quarter and higher interest expense payments from our debt finance share repurchases.","Our strong cash flow performance was driven not only by the strong underlying performance of the business but also by significant improvement in collection of trade receivables moist notably in Southern Europe and by cash received from unwinding some historic fixed to floating interest rate swaps.","Uses of cash during the year (were) acquisitions which totaled $2.4 billion, dividends totaling $1.1 billion and share repurchases which totaled $4.7 billion.  By year-end we had largely completed our $10 billion share repurchase program at an average cost of $66.30 per share.","Over the next few years, our share repurchase activity will moderate and our focus will be more on continuing to deliver meaningful increases to the dividend.  As you know, we\u2019ve increased the dividend for 2013 by 31% to $0.47 a share.","The board of Amgen has authorized a further $2 billion share repurchase program which we expect will carry us well into 2014.","At the end of the year, we held $24.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and $26.5 billion in debt.  The debt has an average maturity of 13 years and a fixed average pre-tax coupon of 3.8%.","The balance includes a $2.5 billion convertible which matures in February and which we intend to settle in cash.","We\u2019re not planning to raise any additional debt in 2013 and I expect us back in a net cash position during this year.","So just stepping back for a second, compared to the beginning of 2011, each Amgen shareholder now owns 23% more of the company and receives a dividend that we\u2019ve increased by an average of 30% in each of the last two years.","Let me turn now to guidance for 2013 on Page 7.  We expect total revenues to be between $17.8 billion and $18.2 billion, a growth rate of between 3% and 5%.  We expect adjusted earnings per share to fall between $6.85 and $7.15, a growth rate of between 5% and 10%.","Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 14% and 15%.  And if you include the Puerto Rico excise taxes that are carried in cost of sales and that you\u2019ll see in the press release, the total tax burden is expected to be between 17% and 18%.  And capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $700 million.","Finally, in 2011, we issued 2015 guidance and we projected 2015 revenues in the range of $16 billion to $18 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.25 to $8.60.","Since then, the performance of the business has accelerated.  We\u2019re on track to hit the upper end of our 2015 revenue guidance two years early and we expect to be comfortably within our 2015 guidance on adjusted earnings per share at least one year early.","As for 2015, we\u2019re on track to deliver at least the upper end of our guidance on revenues and at least $8 in adjusted earnings per share.","Going forward, our focus will be on initiatives and strategies to drive longer term growth beyond 2015 and you\u2019ll hear more about that at our business review on February 7th.","Let me turn now to Tony.","Tony Hooper","Thanks, Jon.  So we delivered strong performance in 2012 despite increased competition, intensified macroeconomic pressures and access and reimbursement challenges.  Our product sales grew 9% for the full year and 11% for the fourth quarter.","Our commercial team remains focused to navigate the changing environment, build the right strategies and execute them as we embark on 2013.","I look forward to discussing these challenges and opportunities with you in greater detail at our upcoming business review on February 7th.  Let me now review our product performance for the fourth quarter, which is shown on Slide number 8.","Starting with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN, I\u2019d ask you to remember that Neulasta represents about 80% of the full graphic in sales.  Sales declined 1% globally on a year-over-year basis but let me speak to the sequential trends for a moment.","NEUPOGEN sales were flat as compared to the third quarter and Neulasta sales were down 5% driven by a 3% decline in unit demand.","While Neulasta sales were down slightly, we saw little change in the underlying market dynamics. In particular, we saw little change in the overall size of the segment, patient demographics, or access. We will continue to stay close to, and monitor, these metrics.Remember this is still a market in which not every appropriate patient receives treatment at first and every cycle. In fact, approximately 60,000 patients are hospitalized in the U.S. each year due to febrile neutropenia.Our research has shown that in the U.S., when appropriate patients ask about treatment with Neulasta, or NEUPOGEN, they typically receive the therapy. Hence, we are focusing on increasing investment in direct-to-patient and caregiver communications in the U.S. to raise awareness of the risk of febrile neutropenia and to encourage them to engage their healthcare provider in conversations regarding the risks.Now let\u2019s turn to Enbrel, which grew 23% in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m very pleased with these results, based on our investment strategy, which includes three core components: Firstly, optimizing our sales force, secondly, increasing direct-to-consumer advertising, and third, focusing on appropriate access.We saw year over year unit demand growth of 6% for the second straight quarter. We\u2019ve also seen a trend of stable share in the rheumatology segment for several quarters. These results reinforce our conviction in our strategy. Enbrel remains, in value terms, the leading biologic in the fast-growing rheumatology and dermatology segments. Enbrel also has an extensive track record and is trusted in the marketplace by both physicians and patients.Moving now to Aranesp, Aranesp sales globally were down 9% year on year due to practice patent changes, particularly in the first half of the year. However, sales were down just 2% sequentially quarter-on-quarter.EPOGEN sales quarter-over-quarter were down 2%, due to competition. However, the impact of competition continues to be modest, and primarily in the form of pilot programs. Dialysis providers continue to recognize the value of EPOGEN based on their long term experience.Sensipar had a strong fourth quarter, with sales in excess of $250 million globally. On a year over year basis, Sensipar grew 19%, driven primarily by unit growth. In the U.S., as part of the fiscal cliff legislation that was recently enacted, [all orals], including Sensipar, would be excluded from the end-stage renal disease bundle through 2016.Vectibix and Nplate sales in the aggregate grew by 15% year over year globally, driven by continued unit demand growth.Global XGEVA sales grew sequentially by 7%. Unit demand grew sequentially by 9% in the fourth quarter, as compared to 7% in the third quarter. In the U.S., XGEVA\u2019s unit share grew from 35% to 37% in the fourth quarter as compared to the third, and the SRE segment continued to grow at about 14% year over year.Our primary area of focus remains on communicating XGEVA\u2019s superior clinical profile, and in the U.S., investment in direct-to-patient programs. Outside the U.S., XGEVA grew by 23% sequentially. Over the past two months, we\u2019ve also achieved market access and reimbursement for XGEVA in Spain, Italy, and France. XGEVA is now reimbursed in all major E.U. markets.Now I\u2019d like to turn to Prolia. As I discussed last quarter, we expected a rebound from a seasonally slower quarter three. In fact, Prolia had an excellent fourth quarter, with 40% growth sequentially in both the U.S. and the rest of the world. In the U.S., unit share increased a third, from 6% to 8% during the quarter, and we continue to make good progress improving both access and seeing patients return for their injections on schedule. In Europe, unit share increased sequentially from 4% to 6%. \u00a0Let me touch quickly on our markets outside the U.S., primarily Europe, Canada, Australia, and Latin America. We had a very strong 2012 in these regions, where sales grew from $3.6 billion to over $3.8 billion. Our presence grew in the fourth quarter by 14%, or 7% excluding the acquisition of MN in Turkey. In an environment with significant macroeconomic pressure, we are very pleased with these results.So, in summary, strong execution, [unintelligible] strong 2012, and we carried excellent momentum into 2013. Let me hand you over now to Sean.Sean Harper","Thanks, Tony.  Good afternoon.  As most of you know, I\u2019ll be reviewing our R&D strategy and giving an update on the pipeline at our February business review, so my comments today will be relatively brief.","Our clinical programs are progressing well.  We\u2019ve initiated our Phase III program with the AMG 145, our PCS (K9) inhibitor for hypocholesterolemia.  We recently reinitiated our study of Trebananib or AMG 386, our (inaudible) in recurrent ovarian cancer in the context of DOXIL now that supply issues for this chemotherapy litigation have eased.  This study will complement our ongoing registrational program in ovarian cancer.","If you will recall, earlier this month we announced the results of the Aranesp, RED-HF cardiovascular outcome study in patients with heart failure.  This study was initiated back in 2006 and pursued (technical difficulty) target hemoglobin of 13, much higher than today\u2019s therapeutic practices in establish indications such as renal disease or oncology.","The topline results demonstrated no benefit on the primary endpoint of the study and no new safety findings were identified.","It is important to recognize that anemic heart failure patients are not currently treated with DSAs as standard care.","We completed our acquisition of deCODE Genetics at the end of December and we continue to be very excited about taking an industry-leading position in the use of human genetics to discover and validate our drug targets.  I\u2019ll discuss how this fits into our broader R&D strategy at the business review.","Finally, we had a very productive 2012 in R&D and I\u2019d like to thank all of the Amgen staff who made this possible.  Bob?","Bob Bradway","Let me turn now to questions and answers.  Why don\u2019t we review the procedures for the Q&A?","Arvind Sood","(Marvin), would you go ahead and open it up for Q&A please?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I guess my first question just comes along the \u2013 there\u2019s been some talk around the bundle and maybe how the bundle rate might change given the new fiscal cliff law.  Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you factored into your guidance and how you\u2019re thinking about that.","Bob Bradway","I think there are a couple of things in there, one related to ESAs and then it sounds like you\u2019re asking also about Sensipar.  Tony, why don\u2019t you address Robyn\u2019s questions?","Tony Hooper","So while the (SBO) estimates that provisions to the SRD bundle payment system could save about $4.9 billion over 10 years but legislation of course does not explicitly direct (NYSE:CMS) to remove the $4.9 billion from the payment system.","Importantly, (CMS) is allowed the opportunity to conduct their own analysis and the legislation then directs (CMS) to use the most recently available data on average sales prices and changes in prices for drugs and biologics when the agency refaces the ESR (DPPS).","I\u2019d remind you that (NYSE:AP) levels have been reduced to about ($10.7) and we\u2019ve seen it stabilize at this level for the past few quarters and we do believe that further reductions would increase the number of transfusions.","As regards to Sensipar, we do not believe that the current treatment patterns with Sensipar will be impacted by the delays of (inaudible).  We will have and continue to encourage the appropriate use of Sensipar.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robby Winarta \u2013 Credit Suisse.","Robby Winarta \u2013 Credit Suisse","If I triangulate some of the numbers you\u2019ve given on the buyback and the div and your at least 60% return, it looks like you\u2019re implying a further increase in dividend this year that\u2019ll get you to roughly 50% dividend, 50% buyback.","Can you give us some more color on where you see that proportion of dividend versus buyback going beyond 2013 and where you see at least 60% of return going?","Jon Peacock","Yes, I think, Robby, I\u2019ll talk in more detail about that when we come to the February 7th review.  I think the focus \u2013 two things I\u2019d remind you of, one is we\u2019ve said that we would return on average at least 60% of net income to shareholders and we\u2019re certainly well on track to doing that.","And what I\u2019ve said as going forward now we\u2019ve completed the $10 billion share repurchase program, the focus will shift more to continuing to deliver meaningful increases in the dividend and I\u2019ll elaborate more on that when we get to February 7th.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden \u2013 UBS.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","First, for Jon or Tony, on the above consensus 2013 revenue guidance, can you comment on where your forecasts differ from Street models? And then secondly, for Sean, on AMG-145, on lipid lowering, one interesting aspect is the entry criteria for the outcome study. It describes patients with a history of clinically evident cardiovascular disease at high risk for a recurrent event. Can you talk about how you define that population, and clarify whether or not this represents a secondary prevention label?Robert BradwayAll right, Matt, thanks. We\u2019ll try and take that in two pieces, first with Jon and then Sean can give you some thoughts.Jonathan PeacockI think generally, on a $17-18 billion revenue base, we\u2019re $200 million to $300 million apart on consensus, so I think it\u2019s just generally a sense of the momentum of the portfolio on some of our key growth products that\u2019s driving the difference. The other thing I\u2019d just pay attention to is the international business where we have the businesses like MN and Bergamo that are making an increasing contribution as well. So I think it\u2019s just a sense of the general momentum of the business, plus the increase in contribution of those businesses.Robert BradwayObviously we\u2019ll have a lot to say about 145 in New York when we\u2019re there in February, Matt. But Sean, do you want to address any of the specifics of Matt\u2019s question now?Sean HarperWell, I would just say that this kind of population that is status post having some kind of coronary event, and therefore is at high risk of another type of cardiovascular event, is a fairly standard approach for cardiovascular outcome studies in lipid lowering settings. So there\u2019s really, I don\u2019t think, anything particularly special going on here.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets.Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital MarketsA question on the 2013 guidance. It\u2019s a fairly wide range on EPS. Can you talk about how we should be thinking about expenses? I know in the past you\u2019ve sort of given some range of percent of revenue, etc. Maybe talk a little bit more specifically about that? And then also, on the share count, which would be another additional factor, I know you have some share buyback guidance, but are you thinking about, in your guidance, a fairly spread out sort of buyback, over two years?Robert BradwaySome good questions there. Obviously we\u2019ll have a chance, when we\u2019re together, as Jon said earlier, in New York, on February 7, to talk more about our plans for returning capital. With respect to your general question about expenses, bear in mind that it has been our objective - and again, we delivered on it again this year - to let revenues lead expenses, which is to say to have revenues grow more quickly than expenses, and that continues to be a focus for us.But we\u2019re investing where we see opportunities to grow the business. Our focus is on growing the business in the long term, and we think we\u2019re able to do that now while constraining expenses grow a little more rapidly than revenues. But again, that\u2019s a rich topic for when we get together in February. \u00a0OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.Geoffrey Porges - BernsteinJust quick question on the two antibodies, the big antibody programs, sclerostin and 145. Sean, can you give us an update on exactly the formulation that you\u2019re taking forward for the subcu administration? Have you managed to get to a single shot for the q.2 or q.4 week dosing, or are you still using multiple subcu shots?Jonathan PeacockWe\u2019re really not wanting to talk about that level of specificity, about the way that we\u2019re going to be delivering the product commercially. I just remind you that oftentimes the product is developed through different phases of development, with formulations and formats that are different than what is actually launched commercially.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.Chris Raymond - Robert W. BairdJust kind of curious on your commentary regarding the dynamics in the ESA market. I think I heard you guys talk about competition perhaps as a source of the sequential quarter on quarter decrease for EPOGEN. But even further than that, we\u2019ve seen, I think, a longer term, still downward trajectory for EPO, even though at the beginning of the year you kind of talked about stabilization of that franchise as a result of bundling.The long and short of it is, when you talk about the guidance and what your expectations are for EPO, how much of your expectations on EPO are driven by competition, and how much on maybe further degradation of the overall market from bundling?Robert BradwayOkay, there\u2019s a lot there, Chris. I know Tony will probably want to talk about both EPO and Aranesp, so Tony, why don\u2019t you share your thoughts?","Tony Hooper","So as I said earlier, in the EPO market, we\u2019ve really seen a stabilization of dose with hemoglobins stabilizing around ($10.7).  So we haven\u2019t seen any dramatic changes in either dose or size of the market for some time now.","The 2% sequential decline in the fourth quarter was fundamentally all around competition but, as I said, we exited the year still in excess of 96% market share, so we continue to believe that the (inaudible) see the true value and benefit of EPOGEN based on this long history in the marketplace around both efficacy and safety.","Aranesp as well, as you know, probably 65% of our business is outside the US.  But, again, that continues to be fairly stable in terms of quarter-by-quarter performance with some competition coming from the side.  But the actual market in terms of usage or dosage appears to be fairly stable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So my question is just specifically on the 2013 revenue guidance.  Could you guys just comment specifically on what your assumption is in the 2013 guidance about competition in the \u2013 for EPOGEN in the US dialysis market and how that\u2019s reflected in your estimates?","And then similar question on XGEVA, how you guys think a generic (Zomeda) is going to impact the market, if at all, and if there\u2019s any conservatism around that that\u2019s built into the 2013 outlook.","Bob Bradway","We\u2019re not going to talk about specific product revenue guidance but why don\u2019t we address your questions, again, about EPO and we can talk a little bit about XGEVA as well and the competitive dynamics that we see there.  So Tony?","Tony Hooper","So the market going forward fundamentally has a (inaudible) as a competitor and we have not predicted any dramatic changes in the makeup of the market.  Obviously we take every competitor seriously.","We have long-term conflict with (Aveda).  We have non-exclusive conflict with (Frasinius) in the marketplace and we have a highly experienced team out there every day talking about the benefit and the longer-term experience of EPOGEN.","Let\u2019s move into XGEVA and as we approach the patent expiry for the (subchronic) acid, we expect there will be some temporary disruption in the marketplace both as a result of competitive activities and some reimbursement considerations.","But we continue to be very confident on XGEVA\u2019s superior clinical profile and the benefit that it actually delivers to patients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","It\u2019s for Jonathan on the Enbrel co-promote profits.  It looks like you\u2019ve paid out just under $1.5 billion in 2012 but I think your guidance is only to see about an $800 million benefit in 2014.","I know you have (inaudible) declining royalty to Phizer but there must be something else that I\u2019m missing in that equation.","Jon Peacock","No, it\u2019s essentially the profit share falls away.  We pay the royalty stream which declines over a three-year period and we would expect the net benefit to be about $800 million in terms of operating profits.","Next year, we\u2019re happy after the call to take you through the specifics of that if there is some gap in how you\u2019re looking at it but those are the two components.","Arvind Sood","Eric, I can give you a call after this conference call and run through additional details if you would like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang \u2013 Jefferies.","Eun Yang \u2013 Jefferies","I want to ask you one earlier (program) in Amgen\u2019s pipeline 319.  There is a fair amount of excitement in the (inaudible) class, so I want to get Amgen\u2019s view on the target and also it seems to me that it\u2019s a competitive field with a number of (PA3) (inaudible) perhaps in development.  So how does Amgen see the advantage with the 319 and development plan?","Sean Harper","We do find the target quite interesting and think it has potential application in both oncological and (inaudible) settings.  But as you point out, it is a target that\u2019s being pursued by a number of companies and its settings. But as you point out, it is a target that\u2019s being pursued by a number of companies, and they\u2019re all in pretty early stages of development. So it\u2019s rather difficult to get a real sense of head-to-head comparison. So we\u2019re pursuing, with significant interest, but very early, the activity of this type of molecule in both of those therapeutic areas.Robert BradwayThanks, Sean. Next question?OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.Geoffrey Meacham - JPMorgan ChaseBob, you guys have talked about growing your OUS presence to about a billion in sales by 2015, and I see that you have Bergamo and MN revenues broken out for 2012. What\u2019s the updated outlook here at this point, and what inning would you say you\u2019re in with respect to plugging in Amgen products to more OUS channels?Robert BradwayWe\u2019re still in the early innings, Geoff. The two markets that we\u2019re very focused on now are Japan and China. Obviously Japan is the world\u2019s second largest pharmaceutical market, and while we have three very successful partnerships there, and the products that are associated with Amgen generate some $2 billion in sales, we know we have molecules in our pipeline that are well-suited to that market, and we\u2019d like to have an operating platform there from which we can reach patients directly. So we feel we\u2019re making progress there, but it\u2019s premature to give you more detail.China is the third-largest, and a rapidly growing market, including for biologics. There\u2019s a lot of interest in that market in biologics like those that are in our pipeline. Molecules like rilotumamab for gastric cancer, molecules like 145 in cardiovascular disease, and of course 785, our sclerostin antibody. So there\u2019s strong interest in China in our pipeline molecules, and we\u2019re looking at ways, again, of gaining direct access in that market to be able to reach patients and caregivers directly.But we\u2019re optimistic that we have a plan that will get us there over the next few years in time to benefit from the launch of these products as the data become available over the next several years. So those are the two most important markets.We had said previously that Russia, Brazil, and Turkey were three priority markets for us. I think we\u2019ve positioned ourselves very well in each of those now by, in the case of Brazil and Turkey, acquiring businesses from which we\u2019re able to launch our own proprietary molecules quite effectively. And in Russia, we have a joint venture that I think has also given us a stronger position in that market than we had on our own.So we feel good about where we are there, and there are a couple of other small, emerging markets that we continue to look in. But overall early innings, business performing well, and we remain encouraged.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.Yaron Werber - CitiAlso John, just a follow up a little bit, just to understand, potentially, I don\u2019t want to drill into specific product lines, or operating expense lines, but one of the things that strikes me, and it\u2019s sort of a follow on to what Eric\u2019s question was, is it looks like in the last two years, Amgen\u2019s own SG&A expenses have been pretty flattish. And most of the growth has really been driven by the royalty payment to Pfizer. Is that sort of the way we should look on 2013 as well? And then just a follow up is the $800 million in savings is certainly very reasonable for next year, when [we\u2019ll run] for over three years, but after that, you should have another $800 million or so minus whatever SG&A you would have for Enbrel starting in 2017.Anthony HooperStarting firstly with the Enbrel question, the royalty stream, as I think we\u2019ve disclosed, starts at 12%, declines to 10% over three years. So once that three-year period expires, that 10% royalty, on whatever the sales are of Enbrel at that time, falls away. So there\u2019s significant step-up again, three years beyond the end of this year.And then on SG&A, you\u2019re right. The SG&A cost over the last couple of years have been largely flat, except for the Enbrel profit share payments. I\u2019ll talk about this more in February, but certainly you should expect that we deliver that Enbrel profit share to shareholders as it falls to the bottom line. We\u2019re also investing significantly in growing the business for the longer term, and we are driving a lot of operational efficiency across the business and the primary focus of that operational efficiency is to fund the investment in growing the business for the longer term.So yes, I think the intent is to drive significant operational efficiency, and you should see at least the kind of trajectory you\u2019ve seen over the last two years. But there will be a lot of reinvestment as well. But certainly expect that Enbrel profit share to create operating leverage on the business over the next few years.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","I was wondering if you guys could tell us whether or not you\u2019re planning on giving a new five-year financial target at your analyst meeting the way you did at the 2010 analyst meeting.  And then also related to the guidance, if I \u2013 do I understand your comments about 2013 through 2015?","It sounds like, the skinny, we shouldn\u2019t be expecting much revenue growth based on those comments, 2013 to 2015, or should we really just be thinking about those as floors?","Bob Bradway","With respect to the meeting in February, I think it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019re going to give a new set of five-year revenue and earnings targets the way we did when we were together with you in April of 2011.  I think in April of 2011, we and the street consensus were in very different places with respect to the outlook for our business.","So when we get together in February, we\u2019re really going to concentrate on what we see as the long-term growth opportunities for the company, so we\u2019ll focus on our strategy and how we think that will enable us to grow, so the international expansion plans, of course, our plans with biosimilars will have an opportunity for the first time to describe for you more fully the molecules that we\u2019re planning to advance and the timeline against which we think we can advance them.","We\u2019ll talk, of course, about the pipeline in great detail and the molecules that are emerging from the pipeline that we think can drive growth.  And so we\u2019ll talk about the competitive profile as well that\u2019s emerging for in line commercial products and go through that and what we hope will be useful depth so you can have a sense for why we remain excited about the long-term growth potential for the company.","But with respect to the specific guidance for this year, Jon, why don\u2019t you go ahead and add any other comments.","Jon Peacock","I think to be clear, what I said was that for 2015 we expect revenues to be at least at the upper end of that $16 billion to $18 billion range and to be at least $8 a share.  So I think we have positioned those as floors and business will progress and we\u2019ll work against those floors over the next couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Just curious as to the rationale for letting the net cash position improve.  Do you not feel like you\u2019ve got sufficient flexibility on the balance sheet the way it stand now?  You can talk about that strategy.","Jon Peacock","I think we laid out clearly our plans to return at least 60% of net income to shareholders and retain the strategic flexibility to continue to make the kinds of acquisitions that you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years.","So for the first time, this \u2013 the second half of this year we were in a small net debt position and over the course of 2013 we\u2019ll be in a small net cash position, so it\u2019s not a significant shift in the capital structure and our focus is to try to keep it on the sheet relatively efficient but keep sufficient strategic flexibility and we\u2019ll continue to keep that under review.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Is deCODE a type of deal that we should expect more of?","Bob Bradway","We\u2019re obviously excited about the deCODE deal, Josh.  That wasn\u2019t the only transaction we did last year, as you know.  We\u2019re also excited about the acquisition of Micromet, which brought a very malleable piece of biology to treat grievous disease, in particular, leukemia and we hope lymphoma and perhaps all tumors as well.","So we\u2019re very excited about what that transaction did for us earlier in the year.  We think the KAI transaction, as well, enables us to bring forward an innovative molecule that we can add value to in our pipeline, so another opportunity for us to grow.","And of course, international expansion was part of our acquisition game in 2012.  And I think each of those are the kinds of transactions that we\u2019ll continue to look to do in 2013.","So in addition, to the extent that we have an opportunity to acquire molecules that are either on the market or soon to be on the market where we think we can add value, we\u2019ll look at those as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on the $18 billion floor guidance for 2015; does that assume impact from any pipeline products or is that just straight organic growth from currently marketed products?","And then just to follow up on the share repo question, I guess I just wanted to clarify whether your EPS guidance actually assumes share repurchase in there because some companies like Celgene, for example, give us EPS guidance assuming no share repurchases.","Tony Hooper","Yes, our EPS guidance assumes the capital allocation strategy that we\u2019ve had in place for the last couple of years. And I talked a little bit about that, and I\u2019ll talk more about it in the future. So there is an assumption of a certain level of share repurchase activity in there, but as I\u2019ve said, we expect that to moderate over the next couple of years relative to what you\u2019ve seen recently.Robert BradwayWith respect to the outlook for growth, Rachel, when we get together in New York we\u2019ll detail our thinking about some of the late-stage molecules. Obviously the nearer term opportunities arise from molecules like TVEC and malignant melanoma, of course our ovarian cancer program, which Sean talked about, potentially our antibody to PCSK9. So we\u2019ll step through those and give you a sense for where we think we are in the clinical development programs, and where we think the opportunities are for those when we get together in New York.Anthony HooperAnd just to clarify, Rachel, I said that at least the upper end of our guidance range of 16-18.Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill LynchRight, so is that 18 including those products, Bob, that you just highlighted? Or no?Robert BradwayI\u2019m not going to get into individual product guidance, Rachel, but the pipeline molecules would not be material to the 2015 number. But more important, I think, is the context that we\u2019ll give you for where we think we are with those when we\u2019re together in February.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.Terence Flynn - Goldman SachsFirst, just wondering if you can give us any more color on the Enbrel dynamics in the fourth quarter. Just wondering how much was driven by unit growth versus price. And then any early thoughts on as the entry of the new oral competition. And then one on the pipeline front, on AMG 785. Just wondering if there\u2019s any update on the Phase II fracture healing trial.Anthony HooperLet me take the Enbrel question. We do continue to be delighted with the performance of the team, and the execution in the marketplace. The quarter-over-quarter growth for the fourth quarter was 23% growth. Eleven points of that was price, six points was units, three was inventory, and three was accounting adjustments.But I think the important thing is the sequential 6% unit growth showing ongoing evolution of the brand. We see ongoing growth in our bio-na\u00efve market share for rheumatology. We see clear stabilization of market share in rheumatology and a definitive slowdown in any decay in the dermatology market. \u00a0Robert BradwayWith respect to 785, Sean, do you want to add any thoughts for Terence?Sean HarperNothing\u2019s really changed. We\u2019re going to be waiting to see the one-year data from those studies that comes later in the year, before we make any decisions about whether we would move that forward into Phase III.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel Nicolaus.Joel Sendek \u2013 Stifel NicolausI had a question about Neulasta. You went through some of the details. I\u2019m wondering whether the decline was due at all to payer pressure, or was it more detail-related? Can you give us some detail on iAnthony HooperAs I said in my prepared remarks, Neulasta was slightly down, about 5%. We looked at every single marker in the industry, and fundamentally saw very little change in anything. Not the size of the segment, the patient demographics, or access. No changes in actual access. So we continue to focus on the unmet medical need, a lot of patients who potentially have access to the drug. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be going in the future.OperatorOur last question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.Tony Butler - Barclays CapitalAt a very high level, I wanted to ask about Decode. And I wanted to ask Sean, how does the communication occur in research? How does it change? Or how do you think it will change, given I assume that entity will still be abroad? And moreover, why does that asset actually have increasing value underneath the Amgen umbrella, as opposed to maybe something like a strategic alliance? \u00a0Sean HarperThose are great questions. I\u2019d prefer to go into it in real detail around this in the context of the overall R&D strategy in February. But I certainly would say that I think from our perspective, and from Decode\u2019s perspective, there was going to be a real synergy by bringing the two organizations together.","We were seeking really an industrial platform to become the industry leader in using human genetics for target identification and validation, and they were really seeking a way to see the enormous way of discoveries that they are engaged in right now translate into impact on patients and through the development of new medicines and I think the sum of the parts is much greater than the individual pieces.","Arvind Sood","Thanks very much, Sean.  I think that\u2019s a great place to end this call and continue the discussion when we see everybody at the business review on February 7th.  I want to thank all of you for your participation this afternoon.","If you have any follow-on questions, of course, myself and the rest of the investor relations team will be around for several hours.  Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us for today\u2019s Amgen\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2012 financial results and conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session.","I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Jake. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to welcome you to our Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. I would like to begin today by wishing Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Evercore, who, as many of you might know is on medical leave, I'd like to wish him a speedy recovery. And also welcome John Scotti, who's covering the large cap biotech companies in Mark's absence. Also in acknowledging those who are new in the coverage, I'd like to welcome Carter Gould of UBS, who will be initiating coverage of the sector and our company.","So our performance during the quarter is best characterized by considerable operating leverage, as earnings growth well exceeded revenue growth. We successfully executed on our lifecycle management strategies for older products while continuing to make efforts to make our new product launches a success.","To discuss our performance in greater detail, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will make some introductory comments. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments.","As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance.","However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, the Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. So just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Our businesses performed well through the first nine months of the year and we continue to make progress in delivering our strategy for long-term growth. At the heart of our strategy is innovation. And as you can see, once again in the third quarter, we enjoyed strong unit volume growth for a number of our newer innovative products, including Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate.","As international expansion is an important objective for us, it's worth noting as well that our unit volumes grew 12% outside of the U.S. And with respect to that 12%, recognize that the competition for our legacy products began much earlier outside of the U.S. than inside, so what you see in this number is the strong demand for our new innovative medicines emerging internationally.","Our transformation program, which we announced over two years ago, is foundational for our long-term objectives. And we've achieved momentum in that effort as evidenced in this quarter's results, with operating leverage across all of our business enabling us to grow earnings well ahead of revenues and deliver a nearly 53% operating margin.","And just as importantly, the transformation is improving our agility, which shows up in our ability to move a program like erenumab to market ahead of the competition and in our ability to rapidly adapt to changing demands in the marketplace as we've done in the dialysis market with our long-acting Aranesp.","I've said for some time that the strength of our legacy franchises is reflected in our durable cash flows. This quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Stable cash flow like this enables us to invest for the long-term, both internally and externally, while at the same time returning significant cash to our shareholders. We continue to invest globally in the long-term success of our newly launched products, which we expect will generate meaningful revenues over time.","In cardiovascular, the Phase III results from our recent Repatha coronary imaging study constitute one more success in our clinical development program for this molecule. This study demonstrates the powerful effect of Repatha on atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, the major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease and the leading cause of death worldwide. This is especially impressive considering that these results were generated on top of maximized statin therapy. Cardiovascular outcomes data, which are expected in the first quarter next year, will obviously be important for Repatha and should definitively establish the importance of this therapy for those at risk of cardiovascular disease.","In oncology, the Neulasta Onpro Kit continues to impress the doctors in the marketplace, and this has proven to be a very successful launch. Multiple myeloma is a rapidly changing field where we've proven KYPROLIS to be the superior proteasome inhibitor for relapsed multiple myeloma patients. We're focused on growing KYPROLIS in this important segment around the world, and early launch results in Europe are encouraging, especially in Germany.","With respect to our innovative pipeline, our focus remains on addressing unmet medical needs with innovative medicines that make a big difference for patients. Our next wave of new medicines is set to do just that. In neuroscience, we've already reported successful pivotal studies with our migraine medicine, erenumab, in both chronic and episodic migraine. This is a potentially life-changing medicine for migraine sufferers, and we're pleased to be in the lead position in the CGRP class.","Rounding out our franchise in bone health, we recently shared more clinical data on novel bone-building agent, romosozumab. Experts in the field are excited about the potential of romosozumab, and we look forward to our PDUFA date in July.","In biosimilars, AMJEVITA, which is of course our biosimilar to adalimumab, is our first approval among the many biosimilar programs that we expect will help generate long-term growth at Amgen. As you know, we're in litigation with AbbVie over AMJEVITA, and it's safe to say that there will be more litigation before there's a launch. Given the pace of that litigation, it's unlikely that this matter will be clarified in time for us to launch in 2017. We've also successfully completed Phase III studies in two more biosimilars and look forward to their regulatory process.","While talking about R&D, I want to say also a few words about the healthcare debate in the United States. I think it's obvious that this debate is not going to dissipate any time soon and that all of us in the community must work together to find more affordable healthcare solutions. But as we seek to do that, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that it's the economic and societal burden of disease that is the enemy. Innovative biopharmaceutical drugs offer the promise of addressing that burden.","We're at the dawn of a very exciting era for innovation. We see that today in cancer, we see it in cardiovascular medicine, and I think we'll see it in Alzheimer's and other devastating illnesses as well. But if we're to advance promising new medicines, we'll have to do that with an eye to both the price and the value of these therapies. And we must do it in a way that maintains the role of physicians in making the best decisions for patients.","We price our products to offer a strong value proposition for patients, payers and providers. We believe the differentiated efficacy of our products enables us to take a leading role in our industry in structuring value-based partnerships for our medicines. We accept that our products need to deliver clear benefit for our customers and accept that we shouldn't be rewarded when they do not. We have value-based contracts in place with a number of payers already and expect to do more.","While the regulatory environment is complex in this area today, making each individual contract challenging and time consuming to put in place, we would expect to see more and more value-based contracts arise as one of the ways of enabling more patients to gain access to the right innovative medicines for their ailments at the right time. We don't have all the solutions obviously at Amgen, but we're committed to working with others to address challenges and improve the short- and long-term health of our society as a whole.","Shifting gears. We have a strong balance sheet and the flexibility and willingness to invest in external innovation. We're active in our review of opportunities, principally in our core therapeutic categories, and we're disciplined as to the price that we'll pay for assets. Of late, we've seen better opportunities to create value with earlier-stage assets. For example, in immuno-oncology, which is of course a focus area for us, we expanded our arsenal during the quarter with a collaboration with Advaxis as well as through the re-acquisition of a BiTE molecule to the BCMA target for multiple myeloma from Boehringer Ingelheim. We also expanded our cardiovascular franchise with an early-stage collaboration with Arrowhead.","Wrapping up, I'd offer that the long-term prospects of our business are bright. And I want to thank our teams around the world for their continuing focus on serving patients. David?","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the third quarter financial results on page six of the slide deck, revenues at $5.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter we saw steady product sales performance anniversarying against the strong third quarter comparison last year. Other revenues at $295 million increased $88 million versus the third quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited primarily from milestone payments, notably, a milestone received related to the approval of KYPROLIS in Japan.","Changes in foreign exchange had less than a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating income at $2.9 billion grew 9% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 4 points to 52.9% for the quarter, reflecting continued revenue performance and favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.5 points to 13%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price, partially offset by product mix.","Research and development expenses at $963 million decreased by 11% versus last year, driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain late-stage clinical programs and transformation and process improvement efforts, partially offset by increases in upfront payments for several in-licensing transactions.","SG&A expenses increased 1% on a year-over-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches, primarily in international markets, were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year.","Other income and expenses were a net $109 million expense in Q3. This is favorable by $38 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year favorability was primarily due to gains in the third quarter from rebalancing our investment portfolio. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 0.9 point increase versus Q3 of 2015. This increase reflects unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, offset by the benefit of the federal R&D credit in 2016. Non-GAAP net income increased 9% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page seven. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2015. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.4 million shares in the quarter. Our year-to-date repurchases now total $2 billion at an average of $157 per share. We continue to plan on repurchases of up to $3 billion in total this year.","Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year. In October 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. Cash and investments totaled $38 billion, an increase of approximately $7 billion from last year's third quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the net effect of the third quarter debt issuance. Our debt balance stands at $35.3 billion as of September 30. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 12 years.","Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on page eight. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing our strategy and business performance through the first three quarters of this year. As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in operating expenses in Q4 versus Q3, reflecting the typical pattern for the business.","With respect to our updated guidance, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.6 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.40 to $11.55 per share, versus prior guidance of $11.10 to $11.40. Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year.","In summary, our performance in 2016 remains on track. In this regard, we will be providing 2017 guidance in our January call. We continued to be on track to meet our commitments through 2018 based on our balanced portfolio of launch, growth and legacy products, along with steady progress in expenses due to our transformation efforts. This concludes the financial update.","I'd like to turn the call over now to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you, David. And you'll find the summary of our performance for the third quarter on slide number 10. Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands, including Prolia, Sensipar, XGEVA, Nplate, and Vectibix. And we're bringing in our new products, notably KYPROLIS and REPATHA, to more patients in more markets. These gains were offset by declines in our legacy products, primarily due to competition, along with the negative impact in changes in inventory levels. In the U.S., our product sales declined 1% year-over-year and internationally product sales grew 4%, or 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This performance was fueled by 12% of volume growth.","Let me start with an update on how we're executing the lifecycle management strategies across our mature brands, beginning with Neulasta. Neulasta treats cancer patients who are at risk of febrile neutropenia. Each year around 100,000 patients in the U.S. are hospitalized due to potentially fatal febrile neutropenia. Not only are these hospitalizations costly to our healthcare system and potentially devastating to patients, but they also result in potential excessive use of broad spectrum antibiotics, which can contribute to hospital-based antibiotic resistance. This is a prime example of how innovative medicines can deliver value to the healthcare system. Year-over-year Neulasta declined 5% due to a small segment contraction in the U.S., along with increased competition in our international business.","We continue to see strong performance from our Onpro delivery kit in the U.S. and are on track to exit 2016 at close to 50% market share. The Onpro delivery kit is a clear example of our commitment to innovation to improve the quality of patient care throughout the product lifecycle. Onpro improves the patient experience by eliminating the need to return to a doctor's office the day after chemotherapy for a Neulasta injection. This translates to increased value for providers, patients and payers. We expect adoption of this device to continue.","The short-acting filgrastim market in the U.S. continued to behave as expected, with the entrance of a short-acting biosimilar in September last year. NEUPOGEN declined 36% year-over-year, mainly due to this competition. We continue to compete account-by-account and hold 35% (19:26) of the short-acting market as we exit the third quarter.","Turning to our ESA business. Aranesp increased 8% year-over-year, mainly due to growth in the U.S. dialysis segment. We have successfully transitioned over 80% of the ESA use in independent and mid-sized dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. We don't expect much further transition to Aranesp moving forward.","EPOGEN declined 31% year-over-year. The largest driver was conversion to Mircera by Fresenius, which began in earnest in the fourth quarter of 2015. We don't expect a short-acting biosimilar entrant until late next year at the earliest.","Now to ENBREL, where segment growth remains strong at both rheumatology and dermatology. Our primary focus is in rheumatology, which represents in excess of 80% of our business, where ENBREL offers a very competitive efficacy and safety profile as well as a strong economic value. ENBREL sales were unchanged year-over-year, driven by several factors. Firstly, volume decline due to increased competition. Sequentially on a value basis, we maintained share in rheumatology and lost 1 percentage point to dermatology. Competition in these segments continues to intensify.","Secondly, we experienced a negative impact from changes in inventory levels. Both of these dynamics were offset by positive changes in net selling price. You'll recall that changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes to list price as well as impacts from rebates we provide to payers, including those related to their formulary decisions.","ENBREL is another example of our focus on innovation, where we continue to pursue additional indications, including one for children suffering from chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We're also investing in novel delivery systems to help patients with chronic inflammatory diseases to more effectively and efficiently inject themselves and ensure optimal therapy over the treatment period.","We will continue to compete on a payer contracting basis to maximize patient access to ENBREL. In highly competitive markets, PBMs can require incremental rebates from us in order for us to maintain our formulary positioning. Maintaining our formulary positioning is essential to ensure patients have access to a drug like ENBREL, which has the longest in-market history of efficacy and safety. Given this dynamic and present contract negotiations, we expect relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017.","Sensipar grew 18% year-over-year, driven by net selling price and strong unit growth globally. We look forward to passage of the European approval and are working with the FDA to obtain our approval in the U.S. Prolia delivered strong growth of 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw the typical seasonality in quarter three, with a decline of 14%. Prolia remains an important growth driver and we continue to invest to realize its full potential. Volume growth continued at nearly 20% in both the U.S. and the E.U., as we continue to capture share across these markets.","XGEVA showed continued volume growth of about 7% year on year, and we were pleased to see the recent result of the successful Phase III trial with XGEVA in multiple myeloma. About half the patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma will develop renal impairment, limiting the options for skeletal-related events. We look forward to bringing XGEVA to these patients who, until recently, had no other option.","Vectibix and Nplate continue to deliver double-digit growth, driven mainly by volume gains. Vectibix also benefited this quarter from shipments to our Japanese partner, which can fluctuate throughout the year.","Let me now turn to our launch products, and those would be REPATHA and KYPROLIS. Both products represent substantial opportunities, as they address serious diseases with significant unmet needs. Starting with our cardiovascular franchise, Corlanor helped us to establish our presence in the cardiovascular space and better understand the cardiology community. Corlanor was approved to prevent re-hospitalization, one of the single largest costs in the healthcare system, and thus offers a strong value proposition for chronic heart failure patients. It has also now been included in the Heart Failure Guidelines. Nonetheless, Corlanor sales have been modest to-date, as it faces steep payer hurdles. We do not expect a dramatic change in this trend in the near future.","As for REPATHA, we are working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled patient access. We've seen minor improvements in the utilization and management criteria but high hurdles remain for both physicians and patients to gain access. We are very pleased with the REPATHA GLAGOV results, which Sean will discuss in a moment. We believe that GLAGOV along with the expected positive outcomes data from the FOURIER study in the first quarter 2017 will certainly strengthen REPATHA's value proposition. We look forward to having these data included in our label.","Now to KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS grew 34% year-over-year as we see strong early uptake from key markets in Europe combined with continued growth in the U.S. In Europe, KYPROLIS grew 30% year-over-year. Multiple myeloma is a dynamic market, with the entrance of new competitors. In the U.S., we lost some share in the third-line plus as a result of these new entrants. However, we expect proteasome inhibition to remain foundational therapy and we continue to grow and generate volume growth in second line as this segment grows and patients are treated longer.","We are focused on growing a second line based on the strong ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data. Both regimens, the triplet and the doublet, have been recognized as preferred regimens for second-line treatment in the recently updated NCCN guidelines. Let me close by thanking our customer-facing teams around the world. Their focus and agility to continue delivering for patients in this highly dynamic environment is inspirational.","Let me now pass it to Sean.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We've continued to make very good progress in the third quarter, with numerous regulatory and pipeline milestones. I'll begin my review with cardiovascular. In September, we received results from our intravascular ultrasound study in patients with coronary artery disease on intensive statin therapy with primary and secondary end points for men.","From a scientific standpoint, the clear demonstration of a link between the PCSK9 mechanism of action in lowering LDL cholesterol and a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque burden in patients already treated with intensive statin therapy is truly groundbreaking.","We look forward to the presentation of these results at the American Heart Association Meetings in New Orleans on November 15, where we will also be hosting an investor event. We're on track to review the results from our cardiovascular outcomes study in the first quarter of next year and anticipate having the data in time for presentation at the American College of Cardiology Annual Meeting in March.","In heart failure, we've reached agreement with the FDA on the key elements of our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase III cardiovascular outcome study through a special protocol assessment. The study will enroll approximately 8,000 chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction with a primary end point of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event. We're finalizing some of the details of the protocol with global regulators and anticipate enrolling patients early next year. Omecamtiv is being developed in collaboration with Cytokinetics and Servier.","In earlier stage cardiovascular programs, we recently announced the licensing and collaboration agreements with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize R&A interference therapies for Lp(a) and another undisclosed target. Lp(a) is a target we have gained great confidence in through advanced genetic analysis performed at deCODE. We have also recently entered the clinic with exciting new molecule for heart failure. And our ASGR1 program in atherosclerosis continues to move forward in the pre-clinical phase.","Turning to oncology, I'll begin with KYPROLIS. In Q3, we received the results of the CLARION study, which we had the opportunity to discuss at length in our conference call. I would stress that we are committed to advancing KYPROLIS into first-line therapy and we're close to finalizing a study design focused on the combination of KYPROLIS, Revlimid and dexamethasone in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, where we have seen very","encouraging data from large investigator sponsored studies. In fact, today many of the thought leaders in the field consider KRd the standard of care for first-line patients.","We're also exploring other combination studies, including with some of the newer therapies. And we're currently in discussions with Janssen to co-fund the study of carfilzomib in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We're also currently supplying drug to Janssen for their Phase Ib dose finding combination study.","Before leaving KYPROLIS, I'm pleased to report we completed enrollment in the Phase III study of weekly administration in the third-line setting and expect those results next year. We're also advancing the reformulated oprozomib molecule into the clinic in order to rapidly and definitively assess the potential to develop an oral proteasome inhibitor with a benefit\/risk profile that would be superior to existing oral proteasome therapy.","We recently had the opportunity to review the results of the study of XGEVA in the prevention of bone complications in the multiple myeloma population. And we're pleased to report the study met its primary end point of non-inferiority to zoledronic acid in the time to first skeletal-related events. This was expected. The efficacy was similar between the agents. But in addition, the renal safety profile, particularly important in the multiple myeloma population, favored the XGEVA arm. Recall that XGEVA is not currently indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in the multiple myeloma population, and we look forward to discussing label updates with global regulators.","In our immuno-oncology program, BLINCYTO, our CD19 BiTE, continues to make a meaningful impact on the lives of certain ALL patients. And in 3Q, the FDA expanded the indication to include the pediatric setting. The addition of a novel immunotherapy, like BLINCYTO, is an important advance for these patients, where the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies can lead to long-term consequences, such as secondary malignancies. We're also initiating several Phase III studies of BLINCYTO in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including our previously announced combination study with Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, KEYTRUDA.","As we investigate the potential for IMLYGIC in combination with other immunotherapies, we've recently had the opportunity to present encouraging data from an interim analysis of our Phase II study of IMLYGIC in combination with Yervoy at the European Cancer meetings, ESMO. In summary, the data suggests that the combination of IMLYGIC and Yervoy has greater efficacy than either agent alone in stage IIIB, IV melanoma patients without any additional safety burden. This study is expected to complete later this year and will be submitted for presentation at the Medical Meeting in 2017.","Our combinations of studies of IMLYGIC with the anti-PD-1 antibody, KEYTRUDA. continue to enroll. We also re-acquired the rights to AMG 420, a Phase I BiTE construct directed against B cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, a multiple myeloma target that had been licensed to Boehringer Ingelheim prior to our acquisition of Micromet. And finally, we announced a pre-clinical collaboration with Advaxis on a unique, innovative and bespoke approach to generating immune responses against patient-specific tumor neo antigens.","In our bone health programs, a Phase III study of Prolia compared with Risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment met all primary and secondary end points. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a small and medically important indication for men and women, often under the care of rheumatologists, and we will discuss a label update with regulators soon.","Last month, data from the romosozumab Phase III placebo control fracture study, FRAME, was presented at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Feedback from the bone community was very positive and there's a clear desire for new innovative anabolic therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis. FDA has accepted our romosozumab file and, along with our partners at UCB, we look forward to continued interactions as we work toward our July 2017 PDUFA date. We also expect to conduct the primary analysis of the Phase III active control fracture study, ARCH, in the first half of next year.","In neuroscience, we continue to advance our CGRP receptor antibody, erenumab, for migraine prophylaxis in collaboration with Novartis. We successfully completed the first of two Phase III studies in the episodic migraine setting. 70 milligrams of subcutaneous erenumab administered monthly resulted in a statistically and clinically significant reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days, with a safety profile similar to placebo. We'll see the results of the second Phase III study in episodic migraine by the end of this year.","We also presented the positive results from our Phase IIB chronic migraine study at the European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress. This was a robust study of more than 650 patients experiencing 18 migraine days per month at baseline. And we believe the results of this study combined with our two Phase III studies in episodic migraine could support registration for both chronic and episodic migraine indications.","In nephrology, Parsabiv received a positive opinion in Europe for the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, and we look forward to receiving market authorization in the EU. In the U.S., we are working with FDA toward an approval.","Finally, we received our first biosimilar approval in Q3 for AMJEVITA, our biosimilar HUMIRA, which was approved in all eligible indications of the referenced product. We also began enrolling Phase III studies for our biosimilar rituximab, ABP 798, in both rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and our biosimilar infliximab, ABP 710, in rheumatoid arthritis. As we move toward the end of the year, we still have some important work ahead of us. And as always, I'd like to thank our staff for their efforts to combat serious disease.","Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Sean. We'd like to open the call up now to questions, and I'd ask our operator just to remind everybody what the procedure is for asking questions.","And with that, let's turn it over to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two for me. First, Bob, I was just wondering, if there is a repatriation agreement under a new administration, just wondering if you could help frame for us maybe some potential uses of your cash. And then, Sean, was wondering on the IVUS data that we'll see, can you just help us think about potential implications for the ongoing CV outcomes trial with respect to potential effect size? Is there any correlation there? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for your question. Why don't actually I ask David to address your question on repatriation? Obviously, you know we're supportive of corporate tax reform and, in particular, reform that would enable us to think about that cash. But, David, why don't you address the question? And we'll have Sean talk about IVUS.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, certainly. So, yeah, I think the first point of course is that we continue to generate very solid and stable cash flow for the business. And what we've seen thus far is that we're able to fund all of the requirements of the business without having to repatriate the cash and pay a current (37:17) very unfavorable tax rate.","So I think the point is, should we see tax reform in the U.S., would we consider to repatriate the cash? I would say yes. And what we'd look at would be, first, to maintain the lowest weighted average cost of capital for the company. And that could involve repaying some of the debt that we have on the balance sheet, but maintaining a pretty healthy net debt position for the company.","And then we'd look at certainly deploying cash, as Bob was saying, towards external opportunities. But in that instance, we would certainly lead with, are there strategic opportunities that make sense where we could get a return to our own shareholders from such investments? And then finally, we'd look at potentially buying back shares to, again, get to the right and balanced weighted average cost of capital.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, with regard to the IVUS results and reading them through to see the outcomes, there's obviously no formula for that. What I would say is that the scientific hypothesis behind the program is that we would see a similar impact on atherosclerotic disease and hence outcome measures from lowering LDL by a given amount with this mechanism, as we would if we did it with a statin.","And obviously here, patients are already maxed-out on statin therapy and you're doing something you otherwise couldn't do, which is to lower LDL substantially beyond that. But the hypothesis would be that you would see a reduction in the impact of atherosclerotic disease that would be generally similar because the mechanisms are very similar. And I think that the positive IVUS study increases one's confidence about that hypothesis substantially.","As you know, the human genetics, which we tend to focus on a lot here at Amgen, were very strongly indicative of that already, but the IVUS data give us much more confidence. So I generally expect to see something that's generally similar to what you might expect to see if you were reducing LDL in the PCSK9 outcomes trial, were it possible to do so on top of existing maxed-out statin therapy with the statin. So that's kind of how I think about that.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Jake, let's take the next question. And just a gentle reminder that if you can please limit yourself to just one question. That way, we can be sure that we get to everybody's questions. Let's go on with the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. If I can ask two related questions on ENBREL. Hopefully that doesn't get in Arvind's way. So first, Tony, you talked about expected little benefit from net selling prices in 2017. I'm wondering if you can just expand on that and tell if there's a certain amount of price increase that you're expecting when you make that comment or if the contracts you've written has certain price protections where no matter how much list price you take, you won't see much net price.","And then just related to that, can you tell us exactly what the dollar amount of the inventory headwind was in the third quarter? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So let me start with the first one first. The inventory was about $108 million worth of differential. From the net selling price, obviously, we've never given product-specific price guidance and\/or the contracts themselves are confidential. But clearly, my statement around there will be little impact on net selling price changes is indicative of we'll be driving the business on volume, not on net selling price, next year.","Jake, let's go on to the next one.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC","To follow up on that same topic for Tony, are you suggesting that you've been able to contract in I guess a better way in terms of volumes and that we won't continue to see the mid to high-single digit volume erosions for ENBREL that we've seen over the course of this year?","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","No. Volume is always driven by demand in the marketplace. What I'm saying is the contract does say it will result in little impact on net selling price.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Jefferies.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Question on AMG 820. You had this product in development for a while, but it was quiet until you did the deal with the collaboration with Merck. So I want to ask you, wanted to see your view on anti CSF-1R (42:34) potentially an IO combination and what tumor types you think would benefit the most from this combination.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Well, so this is, of course, for people who aren't \u2013 not the cognoscenti in this area, it's an antibody that would address the role of tumor macrophages in maintaining a micro environment for tumors. There's a lot of very non-causal indirect evidence to suggest that those macrophages do play an important role into regenesis and maintaining surveillance, abating surveillance in the immune system. So it's I think a very interesting target and something that one could imagine being synergistic with checkpoint inhibition.","There are, of course, tumor types that tend to have much more infiltration of these macrophages and where you can demonstrate, in fact, that prognosis is related to an individual patient by the numbers or density of these infiltrating macrophages. So we tended to focus on some of those tumor types. I wouldn't necessarily get into on this call exactly what tumor types we're exploring because we're in early stages so we're looking at lots of different tumor types in mixed population studies. It's a very interesting program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for the question. For Sean, I wanted to ask on romo, now that you've presented more data and it seems to be well on progress, the importance of the upcoming active controlled study. What's your expectation for what happens there and the importance of it in the regulatory filing, presuming the FDA would want to see it? And do you think the regulatory decision is an efficacy question or a safety question? And how do you think about what's going on there? Thanks so much.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Right. So from a regulatory perspective, there's absolutely no requirement for such a study. A placebo controlled fracture trial, large placebo controlled fracture trial that meets the guidances that exist in this field is sufficient for registration all over the world. So we've made a strategic decision to file in some parts of the world with both studies. And that has to do with payer access determinations and so on.","But I think that you are right that, of course, any time we do studies on our products, regulators are interested to see them, mainly to be \u2013 and we often are interested in getting those changes into the label or their interested in them from the safety perspective and so on. I think that one thing we have to recognize is that this study is designed to be analyzed first based on a time-driven basis. And that's what we're talking about when we talk about the primary analysis that comes in the first half of next year.","And then because we never are sure about the event rate that we're going to experience in these kind of trials, there's an event-driven analysis, for example for non-vertebral fracture, which would come later if we don't hit it based on the time-based analysis. So that's important to understand. And then finally, I would say that this is a very high hurdle. No one's done an active controlled fracture trial like this before that's actually powered and designed to actually show fracture results from the get-go. And it produces a high hurdle.","It was our feeling that we needed to be able to demonstrate that the product could be superior to a strategy of using alendronate. And so that's the idea behind having this second study, largely again to work with payers.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much. And I'm sorry I keep persisting on this ENBREL question, but this quarter revenue was obviously flat. You did have the one-time effect, but units were down 7%. And you commented that if you look at year-over-year, list price was up 26% or so, or certainly above 20%.","So are we to assume then that your list price increase is more or less completely given up in the contract that you're now engaged in? And then just related to that, could you give us an example of some of the value-based contracts and how much of your business is involved in such contracts now? I'm just trying to understand what that will mean.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. So, yeah, the details of the contract we're putting out are confidential. But as we think about list prices, next year we will be circumspect, clearly based on the environment. There's a lot of pressure in the highly competitive environment, specifically with anti-TNS, where we have to put large rebates on the table to maintain our formulary position. The large rebates are clearly impacting net selling price.","So let me just go back and say that, as we think about 2017, we will see little impact on net selling price for ENBREL. Demand will be driven by what happens in the marketplace and the trends are as they are in terms of the market share at the moment and in terms of the PRXs.","As regards some of the value based contracts we have, there is a contract in the Northeast where we've talked about a value-based contract with REPATHA around a guaranteed level of lipid lowering specifically linked to REPATHA and our ability to lower lipids. We have some work ongoing with Corlanor in terms of re-hospitalization. We have some work that's happening both inside the U.S. and outside the U.S. on Prolia in terms of fractures. So those are three examples.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","It total, Geoff, for example, on REPATHA, we're getting up to two handfuls of these contracts. And is said in my remarks, each one of these takes some time to put in place, but I think we're addressing a need in the marketplace and we would expect to continue to see more of these, not just from Amgen but others in the industry, and frankly in other sectors of the healthcare economy as well.","So I think we're at a point where consumers, payers, want to pay for what works and not for what doesn't. And so this is one way to address that need in the marketplace. And, again, I think the products that we have, products like Prolia, products like REPATHA, a number of our products give us an opportunity to offer such value-based arrangements in the market.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Schimmer from Piper Jaffray.","Joshua E. Schimmer, M.D. - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks for taking my question. I was a little surprised to hear that Corlanor was facing significant reimbursement headwinds. And hoping you can draw a fence around that and help us understand why that's not a harbinger of difficulties and headwinds for REPATHA once you have the cardiovascular (50:28) data in hand for that product? Thank you.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So let me try and answer the question. So the label we eventually got from the FDA for Corlanor was a fairly limited label that pointed to re-hospitalization only. A number of restrictions are in place by the payers. And, of course, Corlanor has been added to the standard of care at the moment. Most of the payers are really trying to work out, do they displace the ACE inhibitor with Entresto at the moment.","And then there's a second add on for patients who have heart rates higher than 70 who would then be eligible for Corlanor. So the business to-date has been limited. Access is limited and a fair amount of paperwork is required by physicians and cardiologists to get patients on Corlanor.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","And the other thing just to remember, of course, Josh, is that this product wasn't developed at all the way we've developed REPATHA. And we continue to be very excited about the prospects for REPATHA and the importance of the outcomes data to demonstrate to everybody why lowering LDL cholesterol with this mechanism is important. So we're enthusiastic. We have a set of data for REPATHA that are spectacularly consistent from start to finish and we look forward to adding the outcomes data to that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Scotti from Evercore ISI.","John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks for take my question. And, Arvind, thank you so much for the kind words earlier. I really appreciate it. Thank you. So I want to ask on omecamtiv, actually. Now that you've decided to move to Phase III, Sean, maybe your thoughts on, I guess for everyone, the size of the opportunity, how much would this program cost? And then specifically on the Phase III design, how long do you think it'll take to enroll the trial? Your thoughts.","And then as well, your thoughts on the practical feasibility of, my understanding is you need to thread the needle from a PK perspective with regard to any risk of increasing systole duration at high exposure. So how practically do you intend to address that in the Phase III trial? And then just generally, is this an opportunity that you see as the same magnitude as REPATHA or what's your thoughts on the overall size? Thank you.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","So what I would say, if you step back and look at chronic heart failure, it's right up there on the top of global epidemic disease burden things. So it's a huge unmet need. And if you compare it to an area like oncology, the amount of work that's going on in terms of innovative mechanisms that are directed at heart failure is night and day. There's very little. For example, there's absolutely no competition in the space of something that would be an ionic tropic palliative contractile mechanism like omecamtiv.","So I think there's a huge opportunity. And in particular, just from a purely medical perspective, this has been the holy grail in heart failure is to try and get something that actually can increase the efficiency of the squeeze that the living cardiac tissue can provide without increasing myocardial oxygen demand and resulting in arrhythmic death.","So we believe, at this point, that we have a very compelling Phase II experience and a lot of very sophisticated human physiologic experiments that we've done to understand how the product is working. We understand it deeply at a molecular level. And I think that the PK is an important feature.","And one of the reasons that it's taken us the time it has to get the product into Phase III is that this is kind of classic, really tough, relatively narrow window of small molecule drug development. And we had to come up with a formulation that was well behaved and also a drug testing strategy that can be implemented in the clinic to assess. So we have a titrated regimen where patients get started on a dose, then they get the blood tests to see what level they're at once they're at steady state. And some proportion of patients get increased to a higher dose to ensure that everybody's in a therapeutic range. And I think we've demonstrated very convincingly that we can keep all the patients out of a range where you're getting too much of the mechanism, too much pharmacodynamic effect and not enough relaxation time.","So bottom line is, I think it's an extremely important program. And I think that these programs are inherently long term because you can't, unlike REPATHA where we could get at least onto the market with a surrogate, you have to have a mortality, morbidity outcomes trial just to gain market. But I'm very pleased that we are advancing this mechanism and we have a lot of interest in heart failure throughout our whole pipeline.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thank you. So just looking big picture of the company, it looks like product sales been stable for a few quarters, or about four or five quarters. And given the slow uptake of the new products, it looks like a lot of the growth here is being driven by price. How are you thinking about the importance of bringing in some inorganic growth and the magnitude of that inorganic growth, given that the new products are more slow launchers? Thank you.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Robyn, as I said in my remarks, we have a strong balance sheet. I think we have a world-class business development effort. We're looking, and we have been for some time, looking at opportunities. I think it's important particularly in an environment like this to be disciplined about price so that we can earn a return for our shareholders, not just for the target's shareholders. So we'll continue to look.","Of late, we have found some very interesting opportunities at the early stages and so we've done a few deals. We've got a few others we're looking at now, but we will continue to look at larger opportunities. And for the most part, Robyn, those will be in our six areas of focus, therapeutic focus. And as we've said now for more than a year, we're looking at a wider range of opportunities than we were previously.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just can you give us more color on the Onpro kit, maybe what market share you have right now? And also, is the IP different than Neulasta IP? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So this is Tony. Let me answer that one. One, we do have IP on the Onpro kit, so it is actually different to the composition of matter patent, yes. Number two, the average market share for the Onpro in second quarter was about 34%. And we've exited the third quarter at around 44%, 45% as an average. So good growth. And we believe we're on track for close to 30% by the end of the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Sanford Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking my question. So a little bit on KYPROLIS. The concern out there has been that KYPROLIS was going to get squeezed between the IMiD on one side and dara on the other. So the combination with dara is interesting. I guess the question is, are you thinking about this as a trial that will look at dara plus KYPROLIS against dara plus an IMiD? Or is this just against a single agent? How do you guys make the case that KYPROLIS should be used instead of any one of those two agents?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, I think that what we're thinking about is really if you imagine that a lot of patients will see drugs like an IMiD and potentially VELCADE in earlier lines of therapy, when you get to the relapsed refractory, which is where we're talking about the study with Janssen, at that point you're really looking at, for example, the ENDEAVOR type regimen which is KYPROLIS at a particular dose with dexamethasone. That's where we were able to demonstrate a doubling of PFS versus VELCADE.","So that base regimen plus daratumumab versus the regimen alone is what we're thinking about looking at. And you can imagine that this could be an extremely attractive regimen to have KYPROLIS, dex and daratumumab as a relapsed refractory agent available to patients who've been treated with oftentimes drugs like REVLIMID and steroids and VELCADE in the first-line therapy. So I think that's an obvious place for us to look at that kind of combination therapy and that's what we're focused on.","In the big picture, I would say that we will be looking \u2013 remember how rapidly moving this field has been in multiple myeloma and how many new entrants have come in place. There's also a potential role for immunotherapy here with the checkpoint inhibitor, so we're doing studies with that. So it's going continue to be a rapidly evolving field.","And we remain confident that proteasome inhibition is going be a backbone component of regimens and that because of the limitations that are inherent in trying to treat with a drug that causes the kind of peripheral neuropathy that occurs with pertuzumab will end up playing an important role in treatment regimens for sure.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of questions so far on REPATHA from a cost benefit from a payer perspective. Sean or Tony, I want to get your perspective on erenumab and what you've seen with ARISE and how you view that within the context of cost benefit? And then, Sean, just looking forward for the STRIVE study, could you maybe help us with how that patient population may be different from a placebo response perspective? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So let me answer the first question around cost benefit. We haven't set a price for the product yet. But from what we've seen, it's a huge unmet medical need. A large number of patients who suffer from this disease. It's a debilitating disease that takes away independence and the ability to be productive, to be productive either as a worker or as a mother or a father. The available treatment on the market at the moment does not help patients as much as they'd like. It causes side effects that are sometimes worse than the disease itself. And it's a disease that patients really know about when they have it. It's not a non-observable symptom like some other diseases. Obviously, I think our ability to take away some of these migraines, to allow people to take back their lives will allow us to build pharmaco-economic models that show real value when we come to market.","Sean?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, well, in terms of the second Phase III EM study, it's very similar in design. And the inclusion, exclusion criteria are extremely similar to the study that we just saw recently. So I don't think there's any reason to expect big differences in things like the placebo response rate, for example, between the trials. No two trials are going to be identical, but there shouldn't be big differences.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess this is for Bob, and maybe Tony as well. Just curious as to your views on Prop 61 in California and maybe how concerned you are about this type of movement gaining steam and further shaping the overall pricing landscape. Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Cory. It'd come as no surprise to you to learn that we're opposed to Proposition 61. We think the proposition itself is flawed. And so we are joined in our view by most of the major newspapers in California, a very large number of the veterans groups as well, I think even, frankly, many of the major California public entities have also come out against Proposition 61.","So we're working hard to try to make sure that people understand the reasons why we don't think this is in the interest of the citizens of the State of California. Obviously, this is a populist topic at the moment, Cory, so we think it's important to shed light on it here in California and wherever else there might be a similar ballot initiative risk. Because I think fundamentally, what we support, as I described earlier, is the role of innovative biopharmaceuticals to try and address what is the real villain here, which is the economic and social burden of serious disease.","And we think innovative therapies are the way to help address that problem. And any initiative that might have the unintended consequences of Proposition 61 could have to the funding of innovative R&D is something we're going to look at very carefully and share our concerns about.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from BofA Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the question. Two quick ones from me. On a high level, do you guys have any strategic interest in another product like ENBREL in rheumatology and dermatology, given that there is some evolving change of the approach in treating both of these in oral drugs?","And then there's another quick one on biosimilar Solaris. Given that it's targeting a very rare disease, is it possible you could actually go through the approval process without testing the drug in patients, just in healthy volunteers? Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Let me take the first one, Ying. Again, it's no surprise that we've looked through the years at a broad number of potential products to treat rheumatologic and dermatologic inflammatory diseases. And we continue to do that. We have a very high bar, obviously, with ENBREL, given the years of safety and efficacy data that we have for that product, but we have and will continue to look at other agents. As you know, we were developing a couple on our own as well. And when those no longer had the opportunity to be first or best in class, we moved out of them. But we'll continue to look for ways to add value in inflammation. That's one of our core research focuses.","With respect to your question about our biosimilar program, I don't know -","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, I think that I would be surprised, as this program you're referring to is quite early in its development process in Phase I. But I think there likely would need to be experience in the patient population.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Clearly, the plan we have at the moment will bring us to market at the earliest time possible within the concept of patent laws.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get your sensory level of commitment for developing biosimilar Eculizumab, just given the amount of visibility we've had on newer branded approaches in the complement space.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Sorry. Say it again, Ian. We couldn't hear at this end which molecule you were talking about.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Eculizumab. Solaris.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","And I didn't hear the question.","Unknown Speaker","He's asking...","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, sorry. Let me...","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","We have a program that we're advancing. You're aware of it, Ian, because of a regulatory filing we made at the time that the trial began, but we haven't said much about our intention for that molecule other than that we intend to take it through development and, as Tony said, have it available as soon as the intellectual property patents have lapsed and enable us to launch it. So if your question is, are we serious about it, do we intend to develop a molecule? Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo.","Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hello. Good afternoon. This is Nick in for Jim this afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Really, it's about the BiTE strategy. Obviously, you've been investing in ALL. You have a Phase II\/III study listed in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for continuous infusion. Now you've got the BI product, which is continuous infusion and also subcutaneous administration, I believe.","So from one perspective, this could look like this is sub-optimal delivery, but maybe you disagree with that. So can you discuss the BiTE strategy, particularly against targets where they're are fully human BiTE-specific antibodies and cell therapies also being directed at those targets? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, I think, first of all, we currently have the ability to develop the very short half-life molecules or much longer half-life versions of these constructs. And we've had that in place for some time now. And so we make choices between those depending on the particular circumstances.","Now obviously with the molecule like BLINCYTO that's already approved, the thing that we're doing there is looking at induction regimens where an intensive treatment with an intravenous administration for a limited period of time would be acceptable if we were going to drive people into very low minimal residual disease positive state. But it is true that for many solid tumor settings, for example, the development that we would pursue would be with the half-life extended versions of the BiTE.","So in the big picture, it turns out, interestingly, that for some of these molecules when they're being used in hematologic malignancy settings and there's a real potential for these kind of Cytokine Storm Syndromes, the ability to actually turn the drug's infusion off and have it dissipate out of the system in a matter of minutes is a huge advantage. And so that's something that you need to take into account.","But we do as we develop these against targets in solid tumors, we ultimately \u2013 and even in settings like lymphoma, you may see us do something with it a short-acting BiTE and then follow in as a sort of next generation with a half-life extended version.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","One thing I might also just add because it relates to a comment I made in my opening remarks about our transformation. But the BiTE area is one where we're moving very rapidly internally in our ability to examine targets and incorporate them into our BiTE platform. And the other thing I would note is we see some significant opportunities from a manufacturing cost standpoint in this area that we're excited about as well, consistent with the look we're doing in our transformation. We think this is an area that has real legs at Amgen.","Lets go to the next question.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, Jake, as we're about 15 minutes past the hour, let's take one last question, please.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for the last question. Just a quick one for Sean on Parsabiv. Is it reasonable to expect U.S. approval this year? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","We're very engaged right now in working toward approval. It's difficult for me to anticipate it. It's obviously the FDA's decision when they're going to grant an approval. So I don't want to set an expectation that that would be this year versus early next year. But I'm hoping that it's going to happen in the reasonably near future.","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","As you know, Eric, obviously we're thrilled with the progress we're making with that in Europe as well. Okay, sorry. Arvind, why don't you go ahead and wrap up?","Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, everybody. Thanks for your participation in our call.

I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you, Skinner. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking the time to participate in our conference call today to review our results for the second quarter. So before we begin, I would like to acknowledge those who are new in their coverage or have changed jobs recently, including Michael Yee, who is now at Jefferies; Andrew Peters at Deutsche Bank; and Matt Phipps at William Blair. Each of us look forward to look working with you.","Okay. So let's go ahead and get started with the business at hand. Consistent with the theme that we discussed at the beginning of the year, we delivered a quarter with strong volume growth, volume driven growth of our newer products, which of course will be key for a long-term growth strategy.","So leading our call today is our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a brief strategic update followed by our CFO, David Meline, who will review our financial results for the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017. Our head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We will be using slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email.","We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website.","So just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2017 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. Halfway through the year, we remain on track to achieve our objectives for 2017 as well as our longer-term objectives. Our second quarter financial performance was enabled by strong volume-driven growth for our newer products including Prolia, KYPROLIS and Repatha, as well as our other more recently launched drugs. This is encouraging as we continue to believe that such volume-driven growth is a key ingredient for long-term success in this industry.","Our transformation efforts are enabling us to make significant investments in our pipeline and new product launches while still delivering near-term operating leverage. And you see that reflected in our 9% operating income growth and our 15% earnings per share growth this quarter. Our margin trends also reflect the success of our ongoing transformation.","We continue to generate strong cash flows, enabling us to return significant cash to shareholders including almost $2 billion in the second quarter alone in share repurchases and dividends. Strong cash flows, combined with a strong balance sheet, give us the strategic flexibility we want to invest in external innovation. We're continually looking at opportunities in our chosen therapeutic categories, yet we remain disciplined in our approach to looking for investments that will enable our shareholders to prosper.","Turning to our product highlights, I want to start with our cardiovascular business and Repatha, which we expect to be a significant contributor to our long-term volume-driven growth. Our focus right now is on improving Repatha patient access in the U.S. and around the world, and with our outcomes data in hand, we're making progress. I was pleased to see the swift updates to cholesterol treatment guidelines and recommendations from four leading professional societies interested in atherosclerosis and expect more to come. This change in professional opinion is an important precursor for growth in the market.","Additionally, our recent discussions with U.S. payers about Repatha and the need to improve the utilization management process have been constructive, again reflecting the strength of our data. Finally, we submitted our outcomes data to regulators this quarter and look forward to being able to incorporate them into our label following regulatory review.","Within oncology, I want to highlight a few recent notable milestones. First in multiple myeloma, we completed two pivotal studies showing an overall survival benefit for KYPROLIS patients with relapsed disease, underscoring our confidence in this molecule as the new standard of care for these patients. And similarly, in relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, BLINCYTO demonstrated an overall survival benefit versus standard of care chemotherapy. I would remind you that BLINCYTO is the first and only bispecific T-cell engager to have done that. Overall survival is the gold standard when it comes to oncology drug development and we were encouraged to be able to show that patients live longer when treated with KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO.","In neuroscience, we're getting closer to being able to make a meaningful impact in the lives of migraine patients. We submitted erenumab for which we have the brand name Aimovig to U.S. regulators in the second quarter. We have the lead position in this exciting new class of medicines, combining our commercial strengths in specialty biologics, with Novartis' established infrastructure in neuroscience, we think positions us to win in this segment.","Our biosimilars programs continue to advance nicely and the quality of our work here was on display once again in the recent FDA panel review of our biosimilar to Avastin.","The outlook for the company remains strong. With growth from newer products and effective lifecycle management of our legacy products, we're confident in our position and looking forward to the second half of the year.","Let me now turn to David to review the financial performance of the business.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Bob. We were very pleased with our consistent revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter as our transformation efforts continue to enable investment in our core business, while also delivering operating leverage in a period of portfolio transition and in a competitive environment.","Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, worldwide revenues at $5.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter we also saw product sales at $5.6 billion, growing 2% on a year-over-year as well, as strong unit growth demand for our newer products outweighed declines in the mature brands. We were particularly encouraged by our 11% year-over-year volume growth in Europe, reflecting the value of our innovative products in a market where we have experienced biosimilar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years.","Other revenues at $236 million grew 10% versus the second quarter of 2016, driven by higher IBRANCE royalty revenue offset partially by decreased Nexavar royalty revenue.","Changes in foreign exchange had a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating income at $3.1 billion grew 9% from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved 3.8 points to 55.2% for the quarter, reflecting positive revenue performance, continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment in Q4 of 2016.","On a full-year basis, we expect another year of strong operating margins driven by tight operational expense management. We expect to see our typical trend of higher operating expenses during the second half of the year.","On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.8 points to 12.7% driven by reduced royalties. Research and development expenses at $851 million were down 3% year-over-year, driven by lower spending required to support certain later stage clinical programs and continued benefits from our transformation initiatives and process improvement efforts. R&D as a percent of sales was 15.3% in the second quarter. We expect research and development as a percent of product sales to approach 2016 levels in the second half of the year.","SG&A expenses decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment, partially offset by increased investments in product launches. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year and remain on track to meet or exceed our 2018 commitment of $1.5 billion in transformation savings, while investing to build the business globally, support new product launches and investing in the long-term pipeline for the business.","Other income and expenses were a net $156 million expense in Q2. This is favorable by $20 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher cash balances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 17.4% for the quarter, a 1.2 point decrease versus the second quarter of 2016. This decrease reflects discrete benefits associated with the settlement of certain state and federal tax matters and favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, offset partially by a prior-year benefit associated with tax incentives. Non-GAAP net income increased 12% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 15% year-over-year for the second quarter to $3.27 per share.","Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7, free cash flow was $2.1 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2016, driven by timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments as we deployed $1 billion to repurchase 6.2 million shares at an average of $162 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion as previously communicated.","Additionally, our second quarter dividend of $1.15 per share is an increase of 15% over last year. This reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation, with significant investment in innovation in support of long-term growth of the business, as well as return of cash to shareholders.","We continue to maintain financial and strategic flexibility as a result of our strengthening balance sheet position. Cash and investments total $39.2 billion, an increase of $4.2 billion from the second quarter of last year. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow generation. Our debt balance stands at $35.1 billion as of June 30, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 13 years.","Turning to the outlook for the business for 2017 on page 8. Overall, our revised 2017 revenue guidance is $22.5 billion to $23 billion. Our first 2017 volume and price performance was in line with our plans, as we experienced a solid contribution from our newer products while managing the impact of competition against the balance of the portfolio.","This range also reflects the potential impact during the remainder of 2017 from the outcome of Repatha litigation and potential for improved access for appropriate patients as a result of the positive Repatha outcomes data and professional society guidelines and recommendation updates. Our guidance assumes no new U.S. biosimilar competition in 2017.","With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are raising and narrowing the outlook to $12.15 to $12.65 per share, reflecting our overall solid first half 2017 performance and continued operational expense management. Further, we are confirming our non-GAAP tax guidance at 18.5% to 19.5%. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year.","Finally, consistent with our 2017 outlook, we remain confident that we will meet or exceed the commitments we provided for the 2014 to 2018 period including double digit non-GAAP EPS growth, non-GAAP operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%, $1.5 billion of transformation savings and return to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period.","This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Thank you, David, and you'll find the sales details starting on slide number 10. We delivered a strong solid quarter with sales increasing 2% year-over-year. Prolia and our more recently launched brands including Repatha and KYPROLIS continue to deliver strong volume growth. We are focused on their near-term growth and realizing their long-term potential as the product portfolio continues to transom.","For the quarter, sales in the U.S. increased 2% year-over-year while sales outside the U.S. increased 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange or 3% including. Internationally we had double-digit volume growth led by our European business.","Let me begin first with Prolia. Prolia sales increased 15% with an 18% volume growth year-over-year, with share gains in both the U.S. and our international markets. Prolia continues to offer a unique opportunity to both post-menopausal osteoporosis patients as well as Amgen. There are currently about 3.5 million patients on Prolia globally relatively equally distributed across the regions, about 1 million in the U.S., about 1.6 million in Europe and the rest of the world about 1 million.","Elderly patients who suffer bone fractures often become bedridden and face potential loss of their independence. This places an enormous economic burden on society and less than half the diagnosed patients are treated, raising the need for improved education and treatment guidelines. This is what we as a company are focusing on next.","Prolia's average share of treated patients is around 20%, both in the U.S. and globally. However, there are some countries such as Australia, Switzerland and Ireland, where better diagnosis and treatment rates for osteoporosis have led to Prolia having 50% share or better. These are countries that truly understand the societal cost of non-intervention. Prolia has a strong clinical profile with a proven ability to reduce risk of fractures. Combined with solid long-term safety data spanning over 10 years and a convenient twice per year administration schedule, Prolia will remain an important growth driver and we will continue to target our commercial efforts on improving diagnosis, treatment rates and duration in order to drive access to a greater number of these patients.","KYPROLIS grew 23% year-over-year, led by our successful launch efforts across existing and new markets outside the United States. Uptake continues to be robust across the launch markets with a 20% sequential volume growth. As Bob mentioned, KYPROLIS has developed two sets of exciting overall survival data in relapsed multiple myeloma patients this year. Earlier in the year in the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study against VELCADE, we demonstrated that the KRYPOLIS arm reduced the risk of death by 21% and improved overall survival by about eight months compared to the VELCADE arm. Just recently, the ASPIRE study demonstrated that adding KYPROLIS to REVLIMID and dexamethasone also reduced the risk of death by 21% and improves survival by about eight months. It is clear. Multiple myeloma patients live longer when treated with KYPROLIS.","With these two new sets of overall survival data, our message to physicians is simple and powerful. When multiple myeloma relapses, don't put your patient's survival at risk. KYPROLIS-based regimens KRd and Kd reduce the risk of death by 21% versus Rd and Vd and extended overall survival by 7.9 and 7.6 months respectively. This data will also help community oncologists better understand the risk\/benefit ratio of profile of KYPROLIS versus other options.","XGEVA grew 4% year-over-year, mostly due to volume. We look forward to having the positive multiple myeloma study data added to our label in 2018, which will expand the eligible patient population and provide a new growth opportunity for XGEVA.","For Nplate and Vectibix, we continue to see strong volume growth in both brands. Vectibix has now over 50% share of the U.S. EGFR segment. Our recent label update, which includes expanded RAS testing, demonstrates Amgen's ongoing commitment to using cutting edge science and technology to target treatments to patients most likely to benefit.","Turning now to Neulasta. We continue to drive adoption of Neulasta Onpro, exiting the second quarter with about 55% share of Neulasta sales. The treatment and convenience benefits to patients and providers is clear, as penetration continues to improve in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens.","I'd point out, however, as we look at the cancer therapy in total, PD1s and other new novel therapies are causing a low single digit decline in the usage of myelosuppressive agents. We've also seen a small share loss internationally and we believe these factors contributed to the year-over-year decline of about 5%. The quarter-over-quarter decline of 10% was primarily due to heavier purchasing by certain end customers and favorable accounting adjustments in the first quarter. We expect the trend in myelosuppressive regimens to continue for the remainder of the year.","I'd point out, however, that in spite of decreased use of myelosuppressive regimens, there has been an increase in the number of hospital admissions for febrile neutropenia and we continue to focus on improving penetration for the benefit of patients and for the reduction of unnecessary hospitalization costs. Looking forward, I'd remind you that the fourth quarter of 2016 also included a single $38 million purchase from the U.S. government.","NEUPOGEN declined 30% year-over-year. The impact of short-acting biosimilar competition on NEUPOGEN in the U.S. was in line with prior trends. We exited the second quarter holding 44% share for the short-acting segment and importantly have maintained pricing discipline over the three-plus years since NEUPOGEN first faced competition in the U.S. We expect the competitive dynamic to continue through the rest of 2017.","Enbrel sales declined 1% year-over-year but increased 24% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. In the first quarter, you'll recall that market volume growth rates in both rheumatology and dermatology segments had contracted from recent levels. As we expected, in the second quarter, market volume growth improved in both segments. We expect year-over-year segment growth trends to approximate these recent levels for the balance of the year. Sequentially, our unit share was relatively stable in both rheumatology and dermatology, declining less than 1 percentage point to 31% in rheumatology and 15% in dermatology.","Changes in net selling price had a positive impact on Enbrel's sequential growth. Recall that quarter one was negatively impacted by increased commercial co-pay assistance. As calculated on a full year basis, we continue to expect year-over-year impact of changes in net selling price to be negligible. We estimate that we exited the second quarter with a balance of about $140 million of excess end-user inventory. We expect a portion of this excess inventory to deplete through the remaining of the year.","In summary, we saw improvement in the underlying segment performance this quarter versus the prior quarter and our share trajectory continues as previously projected. Enbrel has a strong track record of safety and efficacy in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. We continue to believe the long-term dynamics are intact and continue to invest in Enbrel to remain competitive in these growing segments.","Aranesp grew 6% year-over-year, primarily from volume growth, which includes a benefit from some timing of tenders in certain markets outside the U.S. versus the prior year. With EPOGEN, we've been executing our lifecycle management strategy by successfully transitioning much of the dialysis business to Aranesp and extending our supply contract with DaVita through 2022. The transition to Aranesp is largely complete and the second quarter year-over-year decline in EPOGEN is primarily due to lower net prices as a result of the DaVita agreement. We believe that for now our EPOGEN volumes have stabilized.","Sensipar year-over-year growth of 10% was mainly due to net selling price and to a lesser extent unit growth. We continue to await CMS guidance on the reimbursement mechanism for Parsabiv. Parsabiv launch is underway in Europe with seven markets so far and three more expected by year-end.","In conclusion, let me turn to Repatha. We continue to extend our market leadership across the U.S. and Europe. We now hold 58% share of the PCSK9 segment in both markets, with sequential growth points of 4% in the U.S. and 2 points in Europe. More importantly in the U.S., new-to-brand patient share averaged 70% in the second quarter. Since March, and the presentation of the positive Repatha outcomes data, we have been engaging with payers to improve their utilization of management criteria and processes to improve access for appropriate patients. Payers and PBMs acknowledge the benefit to patients demonstrated by the outcomes data and are evaluating changes to their processes.","We continue to believe that Repatha will grow steadily as guidelines and clinical pathways are revised and the outcome data are in our label. We look forward to the publication of the final update of the ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway, an important reference for physicians. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number one cause of death and disability in the world. Repatha has the potential to help millions of patients around the world dealing with this grievous illness.","Let me close by thanking all the Amgen staff who worked so hard and tirelessly to get important products to patients around the world.","I'll now provide you (26:00) to Dr. Sean Harper. Sean?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. I'll begin my comments today with an update on our cardiovascular efforts. In Q2 we submitted our Repatha outcomes data to global regulators and we look forward to working with them to include this important update to the prescribing information. I have also been very encouraged to see multiple professional societies updating their expert consensus documents and guidelines on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors including the U.S. National Lipid Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society, clearly reflecting the importance of our Repatha outcomes data.","In addition, a draft version of the 2017 update of the ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on non-statin therapies for LDL cholesterol lowering has recently been made available for public comment. These decision pathways are intended, among other things, to provide guidance to clinicians in areas where clinical evidence is new and evolving. While the document is still in draft form, we find the concepts within to well reflect the excellent safety profile and efficacy of Repatha and to suggest evidence-based utilization in appropriate patient populations. We expect the final publication of this document in Q3 of this year.","Beyond Repatha, we've advanced our ASGR1 inhibitor into the clinic in the form of an antibody. As it is just over a year since we first published the strong genetic association of ASGR1 variance with cardiovascular disease in The New England Journal of Medicine, a rapid movement into the clinic demonstrates the speed at which we're able to move programs forward when we have human validation of the sort that deCODE Genetics can provide to ultimately improve R&D productivity.","We also have additional modalities directed against this target under pre-clinical investigation. Our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase 3 outcome study in heart failure continues to enroll briskly, demonstrating the interest in an innovative new add-on therapy in an area in which significant unmet need still exists. And finally, we're looking forward to the presentation of the anacetrapib REVEAL study by Merck to help to inform our plans for our own CETP inhibitor, AMG 899.","Turning to oncology, we recently received our second positive overall survival result with KYPROLIS, this time from the ASPIRE study. We clearly demonstrated KYPROLIS' superiority to VELCADE with improved overall survival in the ENDEAVOR study of KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone versus VELCADE plus dexamethasone and now we've demonstrated positive survival benefit from KYPROLIS plus REVLIMID plus dexamethasone versus REVLIMID plus dexamethasone in the ASPIRE study. In each case, KYPROLIS reduced the risk of death by 21% and improved survival by approximately eight months, a very meaningful clinical result that reinforces the role for KYPROLIS in driving deep and durable responses. We have already submitted the ENDEAVOR overall survival data to regulators for inclusion in the labels and we are preparing the ASPIRE data for submission as well. And lastly on KYPROLIS, our Phase 3 study in combination with DARZALEX in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma began enrolling patients in the second quarter.","At ASCO, we had the opportunity to present Phase 2 data from our combination study of IMLYGIC and YERVOY in metastatic melanoma, where we saw an approximate doubling of the response rate compared to YERVOY alone with no unexpected toxicities. This was an important proof of concept for combining the complementary mechanisms of an oncolytic viral immunotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor to enhance antitumor effects. There is significant interest in exploring IMLYGIC with other checkpoint inhibitors in a variety of tumor types.","In regulatory news, we received a February 2018 PDUFA date for our XGEVA submission for the prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma patients. We also received full approval for BLINCYTO in the U.S. The approval expands the indication of BLINCYTO for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL in adults and now children and included overall survival data and an indication for Philadelphia chromosome-positive forms of the disease. Also within our BiTE platform, we are advancing AMG 673, our half-life extended anti-CD33 BiTE into the clinic with first in human testing in AML patients to begin soon.","And lastly, we received a label update for Vectibix to more precisely molecularly define a population with wild-type RAS for treatment in colorectal cancer.","In our bone health therapeutic area, as expected, we have received a complete response letter for EVENITY from the FDA and will be responding with data from the ARCH study and the BRIDGE study in men with osteoporosis. Along with our colleagues at UCB, we're currently in the process of reviewing the detailed ARCH data with experts. This will be a Class II resubmission in the U.S., which carries a six-month review timeline. We believe there are patients for whom the benefit\/risk of EVENITY would be favorable and we will work with regulators on a path forward.","In our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, we've submitted erenumab, now known as Aimovig, to global regulators for the prevention of migraine and have received a PDUFA date of May 17, 2018. We recently presented data from our Aimovig program at U.S. and EU medical conferences, and the feedback on the efficacy and safety profile continues to be very positive.","In our beta secretase program for Alzheimer's disease, we're expanding the development of CNP520 to individuals who carry one copy of the ApoE4 allele and also have evidence of brain amyloid accumulation. This will be assessed in an approximately 2,000 subject trial that will be starting soon, and combined with the ongoing Phase 3 study evaluating CNP520 and ApoE4 homozygotes, will constitute a robust data set in an at-risk population. Given how early beta amyloid starts to accumulate in the course of the disease, we feel that a therapy like a BACE1 inhibitor should be administered as early as is feasible. This, combined with the strong genetic validation for specifically targeting BACE via deCODE's work, gives us great confidence in our approach.","And finally, in our biosimilars program, we received a unanimous vote from an FDA advisory committee in favor of approval of ABP 215, our biosimilar Avastin, which has a user fee action date in September of this year.","As always, I want to thank our staff for continuing to deliver on these important milestones for the benefit of patients. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Sean. And Skinner, let's open the line up for questions, and please remind our callers about the process for asking this afternoon.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Our first question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, everybody, and good afternoon. If I could just ask a clarifying question here on Enbrel, that would be helpful. So I believe you said in the fourth quarter you had a $150 million inventory build and then, I can't remember, I think you either said you had a $20 million or $30 million burn-off in the first quarter. Now you've said you're back at $140 million. So can you just review for us the sequential pattern here? And did you have an inventory build quarter over quarter? And I guess should we expect all of this $140 million to burn off in the second half of the year or how do you expect that to play out? Thanks very much.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Matthew. Ask Tony to respond.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Matt, it's Tony. So let me get back to discussing the inventory. So inventory, as we said, we report at a point in time. So it's either on March 31 or it is June 30. So it's an endpoint. What we have in hand is we know exactly what the revenue numbers are in terms of ex-factory sales. We also understand what our in-market demand is based on the IMS retail prescriptions, which are about 90% accurate and 10% predicted. We also understand exactly what is held by the wholesalers because of our contracts with them and the triangulation between how much has been sold from wholesalers to end users minus the demand leaves us with a number which we then extrapolate as being the end-user inventory.","So clearly what happens is, at the beginning of the quarter, there's a drawdown of that inventory, which we did see in April-May this year, and then there appeared to be a build towards the end of June. So what I'm saying is we ended the quarter with an excess of about $140 million of inventory, which I would expect to burn off the majority of that during the rest of the year.","Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Skinner, let's take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for the question, and congrats on a solid quarter. Maybe for Sean on these ACC Decision Pathway document that's going to be coming out here shortly. Can you just talk about what the impact of the decision pathway is relative to, I don't know, the actual treatment guidelines, which I think the ACC expects to put out in 2018? And also, if you think there's going to be an immediate or relatively near-term impact for the decision pathways document, what payers have to maybe do to comply? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yes. It's a great question. I mean I think that, in my experience with these documents, the guideline process is one which is quite complex, involves a systematic review of the world's literature by a very large group of international experts and has to kind of occur on a cadence of every two to three years. And also, the result is, if you've ever looked at one of these guidelines, it's a long complex technical document designed for people who are really expert in the field. Because of that cadence, and because of the need to produce something that is more usable to the practicing clinician, these pathway documents emerged, and they are important reference documents for physicians to think about how to deal with patients who come in and present themselves.","And this is the first time, to my knowledge, that one of these pathway documents has been updated outside of its normal schedule and that's because the pathway documents, in part, are designed to deal with just this situation where new important clinical information, particularly the quality of information that's come from both our outcomes trial as well as the Pfizer outcomes trial with PCSK9 have come on the scene and publications have become available. So it's an important step. This is a document that is used quite a bit in clinical decision making, and generally speaking but not always, these kind of changes that you see in these documents then roll in and become incorporated in the formal guidelines which will come out, as you say, probably 2018, late 2018 is our best knowledge.","In terms of immediate impact, I'd say it's a little bit hard to judge. I think there's an accumulating weight of evidence that the professional societies around the world, including very important ones in the U.S. like the Lipid Society and the endocrine societies and now ACC are beginning to converge in their opinions around the importance of LDL lowering and the impact that one sees, both the safety profile as well as the efficacy of using Repatha in particular. And so I do expect that payers will responsibly look at these guidelines and recommendations and begin to try to make it possible for the doctors who practice in their plans to practice in a way that's consistent with these professional recommendations.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","And Eric, why don't we ask Tony to share a few thoughts as well on the payer perspective in your question.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So I mean, it's clear to us, Eric, that in our discussion with the payers, they do pay very careful attention to position papers and the guidelines coming from these bodies. And the National Lipid Association is a subdivision of the AHA. So it's clear that they're making those decisions on that regard. The ACC, of course, has always been the grand-daddy of guidelines and people will pay definitive attention and look at how they will be actually servicing patients aligned with these position papers or pathways that the ACC are put into place. So we're working extensively with them at the moment. As Sean says, as the weight of evidence continues to build around the importance of delivering Repatha to patients who do have this particular disease.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one has to do with the balance sheet. You have a $39 billion cash on balance sheet. If you guys don't have any plans to consummate M&A transactions or repay the debt, many investors are just wondering whether you have any plans to repurchase a significant portion of the float for the shares. And then maybe for Sean, when might you know whether FDA would require a cardiovascular safety study for romosozumab? And if so, would you continue the development or not for romosozumab? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Ying, why don't I take the first question, invite David to add any color if he'd like and then, Sean, you can briefly answer the romo question. On, with respect to the balance sheet, I think again you're aware that our business is generating significant cash flows. We have a track record of wanting to use that cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, a rapidly growing dividend as well as to buy back stock and to invest in the business. So we're optimistic about the outlook for the business. As I say, continue to generate strong cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet and we'll look at ways of deploying that capital as appropriate through time. And, David, maybe you'd like to update where we are with respect to the capital commitments that we've made to our shareholders.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Yes. So I would just add to that two things. One is that we continue with the plan as I said to return 60% of net income through 2018 to shareholders and I think that is certainly something we'll execute on going forward. And I think the second point, as many know, the vast majority of the cash that we're holding does sit offshore and we don't see right now that it would be appropriate to repatriate it under the current U.S. tax system. So obviously as and when they make progress on tax reform and make it more reasonable to consider repatriation, would we then take a look and start providing some commentary on how we might deploy that.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, and with respect to romosozumab, I think it's just too early in the process to comment meaningfully on whether additional studies would be appropriate and whether they would be a good investment for our shareholders and UCB's shareholders. We have to go through a process that's going to take some time to discuss these results formally with regulators.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-part for me. Just wondering following the romo safety signal, if your BD priorities have changed at all either with respect to size, stage or disease areas of interest. And then on the guidance, just wondering if you can talk about the changes on the revenue side, particularly lowering at the top end, what the driver or drivers of that was. Thanks.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","We'll do this in two parts as well then. With respect to romo and the impact on our BD thinking, I don't think it has any direct impact, Terence, on how we're looking at the opportunities of business development. David, do you want to talk a little bit more about guidance?","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. In terms of guidance, if you might recall when we entered the year, we provided revenue guidance that was broader than traditionally we would have, because of in particular the uncertainties around the evolution of the sales of Repatha, which related to this question of the outcomes trial being published as well as the ongoing litigation that's taking place. And so now as we sit at midyear and look at the trajectory of the business, the good news for us is the revenue is evolving as we'd set out for the company through the year and indeed the earnings performance is quite good and we've raised again our EPS for the year.","So really, what we're doing now is we're narrowing the guidance to reflect the fact that as we look to the balance of the year, we don't have the most positive upside that might have occurred if there had been an early decision on the litigation. We're awaiting the outcome of that and then we're also reflecting the trajectory which we're encouraged by the uptake of Repatha which we think will continue to accelerate. And so the guidance simply reflects the best estimate we have right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks so much for the question. My question is in relation to your longer-term guidance and your margin guidance for 52% to 54%. You're at the higher end of that and next year you're not necessarily going to face so much biosimilar competition. So can you talk about where and when you could think about reassessing that? And importantly, if you think that these margins can be sustained or managed even in the face of potential future biosimilar risk? Thanks so much.","David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, so I would say first of all on \u2013 you're correct on our margin performance. We've been pleased with how it's evolved for the company given that we set that goal out at a time we were delivering 38% operating margin. So it was quite a big task for the company, but you've seen it evolve very nicely. And I think importantly for us during that time, we've also stood up a very significant cardiovascular franchise. We're in the process today of investing in preparation of our first launch in the neurology sector. We've been building out and are on track with our portfolio of biosimilars and we've added several hundred million dollars a year of structural cost to a international network as we built out globally. So not only are we seeing margin improvement, but also we'd been building a base for the company which is going to be very important for our sustainability going forward.","In terms of as and when we would then look forward and what do we think about margins for the company, I would say we're approaching now the end of the period that we gave guidance through 2018. So obviously, within this next year, year-and-a-half, we'll have a look and start providing some additional views of the future for the company. But at least as we sit here today, we feel very good about not only the performance of the company and the prospects but also the sustainability of that profitability.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners LLC.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much, and congratulations everybody on a solid quarter. I just wanted to have a little discussion on Aimovig or hear your thoughts on it. You've said that you're likely to be first, and I know you can't really comment on pricing, but certainly the PCSK9 experience was sobering for all of us in terms of the payer response. And I'm just wondering how your discussions with payers are going. What sort of step edits you would expect for people to get access to Aimovig and should we be expecting pricing that's more at the Prolia end of the spectrum or more at the Repatha end of the spectrum? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So, Geoff, it's Tony. I mean, one, we've never given pricing guidance prior to a launch. Aimovig is going into a patient population that are uniquely different from a symptomatic perspective, right. So we estimate about 3.4 million patients presently on prophylactic treatment for migraine, both episodic and chronic, which is a crippling disease resulting in mothers not being able to be mothers, or employees not being able to do their work. And our discussions have been with payers from a clinical perspective at this particular stage as we move things forward. And there's a huge unmet need, and we're busy developing our pharmaco-economic value-based pricing models for this particular disease. It's going to be a competitive market. That we understand. But our pricing will be made as we get closer to the launch time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on the solid quarter. I was just trying to better understand the drivers of Repatha until we get to the publication of the ACC treatment guidelines at the end of next year. Specifically, just two different, two sub groups that the payers and physicians have a lot of interest in, seeing results for diabetic, smokers. And then just separately at the time of the ACC presentation, the follow-up was roughly 2.2 years. Was wondering when we could see follow-up or data following up patients for greater than three years.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Why don't we do this in two parts. Tony, why don't you talk a little bit about what we expect to see between now and when we have the outcomes data in the label, what the drivers are. And then, Sean, you can address the follow-up question.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So when we look at the actual usage in the marketplace, right, there are sort of three patient segments that are pathing to us that are clearly indicated inside the label, and aware physicians are starting to understand they're important to treat, right. These are patients who have ASCVD, who've had two events in the last 24 months, clearly high-risk patients or what we call higher high-risk patients. They are those who have ACS who have had an event in the last year or so with ASCVD. And then there's the FH population. And that's a fairly large population, and we've seen the majority of our patients coming from that group at the moment. If you look at the NRx data, which is really looking at the new-to-brand prescriptions in terms of new patient capture, you are seeing that we are gaining market share there and gaining traction consistency in terms of getting patients.","When you look inside the data and you see that our abandonment rate by commercial patients has gone down to about 24%, it is clear that we are assisting patients who can't afford their co-pay or their deductible. So we're getting a higher access to patients there. So we see a continued usage and expansion by existing physicians. We are capturing about between 300 and 400 new prescribers per month, so the prescriber base is growing as we go forward. The new guidelines are starting to take a little bit of traction. Physicians understand. We look forward to the ACC presentations. So that's where we see the growth of our business right now.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","And with respect to the insights into the data on diabetics and smokers, there were a very substantial portion of Type 2 diabetics in FOURIER, and about 30% of the population were smokers. And essentially when you looked at those subgroups in comparison to the whole study, the data were virtually identical. So there we did see, as you might expect, with LDL lowering, as has been seen with statins, that it has the sort of uniform effect across these type of clinical populations.","Obviously, the controlled portion of the FOURIER study is complete, but there is \u2013 I think you are referring to long-term extension kind of data that is available. As you might recall, we had over four years of long-term extension data, treatment data, at the time of presentation of FOURIER published at that time in one of the major journals. And we have a long-term extension of approximately 5,000 patients from FOURIER as well who will run out for an additional number of years, perhaps up to 10. We'll figure that out as we go along. But that is designed to be a leading indicator of any safety issues that might not have presented themselves in the window of the FOURIER study, which was, as you point out, just 2.2 years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have one on Repatha for either Sean or Tony. And I guess the question is more in demand trends post-ACC in this year. I'm just trying to get a sense for when payer policy and guidelines become more favorable? If you guys would expect any hurdles at the actual prescriber level at the cardiovascular \u2013 at the treating physician level or if patient persistence rates over time have really changed materially? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So, Geoff, let me take that one as best I can in the moment. So just to remind you, that the outcomes data was presented at the ACC in March. We are not promoting that data at the moment. We are clearly awaiting the FDA decision to include the data in our label, at which stage we will start being able to promote that data into the marketplace itself.","We are working consistently with the payers at the moment in terms of reevaluating and challenging some of the utilization management criteria, challenging some of the onerous processes that are in place and actually working with the professional bodies themselves so they become involved in ensuring they can get access to their patients. We have seen a high level of willingness from the payers and the PBMs to relook at their utilization management criteria to ensure that the processes are reasonable.","The cohorts are probably a bit too small to be able to really understand patient persistency at the moment, so what we are tracking is new patient capture early on, and as you know, you can see that quite easily from the IMS data. And that continues to grow as well as the growth trial as (55:06) we go forward. We do believe that once the FDA ratifies the data and puts it in the label, we'll be in a much better position to see an opening of access through the payers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on erenumab. And on their call this morning, Lilly mentioned that they that haven't seen any competitive CGRP data that they view as better than what they've generated. So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you see this market and how you maybe plan to potentially differentiate erenumab or Aimovig in the study as you begin to get a better feel for the various profiles of other agents in the class? Or is this something that really just comes down to first to market and potentially price, as you were asked about before? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. So let me start doing a little bit of an answer there if I can, and perhaps Sean can add around the clinical data. Right, so just to go back, my comment to Geoff earlier on, around the unmet need, the more we dig into this market, the more you realize that not only patients but specialist physicians themselves have been absolutely frustrated for decades because of the inability to actually prescribe a migraine drug for a migraine. They've used substitutes. They've used drugs that have caused huge side effects, and patients are unhappy with them. So as we've talked to patients, patient bloggers, patient groups about their needs, it's clear the unmet need continues to be large.","Every specialist I've spoken to who looked at the Aimovig data has been impressed by the data, has seen a dramatic potential for change in what this will do for patients on their day-to-day lives. We do believe that we will be first to market. We have submitted first. We intend coming to market first. We have a partnership with Novartis who have an existing strong relationship with the neurologists, a lot of them who treat migraine. And we expect to be using their skills, competencies and relationships to set us up and to move fast and quickly into the marketplace.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","And my only additional comment would be that because the other agents are not receptor antagonists and are ligand directed, they're less potent, and the amount of antibody required to achieve the clinical effect is considerably higher. This results in things like loading doses or IV administration or multiple large volume sub-Q administrations required at the same time, and none of those are positives for patients. So we know we can get erenumab to a monthly single small-volume well-tolerated auto injection. I don't know that that's possible with these other agents. The data as it appears to me at this point doesn't suggest that.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Skinner, let's move on. We've got I know quite a few questions still lined up to go, and we're pressing up against the top of the hour. But we'll do our best to get to the remaining questions. Let's go ahead.","Operator","Absolutely. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. So given the pushback so far with the payers in the cardiovascular space that you've seen with Repatha, like how are you thinking about the bar for developing your CETP inhibitor? And what threshold do you want to see with the Merck data that will make you feel more positive about the prospect of the class?","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","I think we're focused, Robyn, on that medical need and trying to figure out whether that aid class of agents has a role to play. But Sean, I'll let you talk about the specifics. And obviously we need to believe that we can earn a return on any further investment there for our shareholders. Do you want to talk about the clinical piece?","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yes. No, I mean, I think that it's the case that if we were to see as we did with the PCSK9s that have been assessed in outcomes trials, a linear relationship as has occurred with statins between LDL lowering and event-rate risk, and the agents are lowering LDL in the range of 30% to 35%, 40%, that an oral agent that could do that as an add-on to statins would be a meaningful drug to have in the armamentarium.","It's obviously not going to deliver the kind of LDL reductions you can achieve with the PCSK9 antibody, but because the drugs are oral and so on, we feel they play a role. What remains to be seen is whether these agents, based on their LDL lowering capacity, and the Merck drug will be the first that I think will answer this question more definitively. Whether we see that relationship or whether we're seeing some fractional effect of that relationship, and that the effect on cardiovascular risk is marginal, in which case obviously we'd be much less excited about pursuing this. So I think it much depends on the details of the reveal data.","Operator","Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. Just to focus on the PCSK9 a bit. In a scenario where there's no meaningful inflection for Repatha post-guideline updates, would you potentially consider the idea of a pricing reset? And then also, do you think Novartis CANTOS data impacts PCSK9 opportunity at all? Was very curious to have your take on it.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Umer, this is Tony. I think a lack of inflection would be a terrible tragedy for those patients who suffer from this disease and who will either be suffering an early untimely heart attack or stroke. The price we came to market with was clearly aligned with an understanding about the rebate that would be required in the marketplace to gain a competitive position. When you look at the data we presented at the ACC in March this year, we clearly talked about the pharmaco-economic value of this product, how PCSK9 within the class, and reconfirmed that our net price to payers is presently very much in the range of a pharmaco-economic price. We continue to believe that this drug brings value. When you look at the second year data, that you're reducing heart attacks by 35%, reducing stroke by 24%, 27%. It's an enormous crack in this disease that takes lives on a untimely basis. So we will continue to drive it forward, and to ensure that the value we bring is distinct and beneficial in the marketplace.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","And with the IL-1 beta data from the Novartis trial, I think we just have to wait to see the data to understand, but I don't expect that to have a direct impact on lipid-lowering approaches.","Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Skinner?","Operator","And our next question comes from Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have one on biosimilars. So you guys have 10 now in development I believe and you've seen success with the first three, HUMIRA, Herceptin and Avastin. Can you just remind us what is your situation with manufacturing capacity? Do you have capacity for all of these? Or will you need to expand and what's the path that if you'd have to go outside and use a CMO or would you build it yourself? Thank you.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Salim, we're in good shape with respect to our biosimilars. And one of the reasons we committed to this as a growth opportunity for the company was our belief that we do large-scale manufacturing of proteins very well. So we're deploying our process, development and manufacturing skills and we're in good shape for our programs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for Sean. Maybe if you can talk about some of the earlier things in your oncology pipeline, and how you are developing IO and do you think you need some of the more traditional assets like PD-1 or any of the other ones, OX40, that people are going after? Thanks.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yes. I mean I think right now we're very interested in our BiTE platform. We've made a strategic decision to focus primarily in biospecific T cell engaging, not ADCs, and we do have a limited but important effort, of course, in collaboration with Kite on CAR T cells. The BiTE platform is moving along quite significantly and because of the timing, if you think back to when we acquired the technology and how long it takes, we have a big wave of these molecules directed at hematologic and solid tumors moving into the clinic over the next 18 months or so.","We have, of course, the half-life extension technology that we've added to the majority of these at this point. So that is very important. As you point out, there'll be the opportunity to combine them in many cases with checkpoint inhibition. From a R&D perspective, we've had no trouble at all getting partners to do these experiments with us, providing the PD-1 and often sharing the actual cost of the trials with us. So that's not been an issue.","And then the other area we're still very excited about is T-Vec, particularly now as we begin to explore hepatic injection, different tumor types in combination with checkpoint inhibition. It opens up a range of tumor types to explore, including those that don't respond well to checkpoint inhibitors without a immunization strategy.","And then last one I'd mention is our CSF-1 antibody is in combination right now with Merck's PD-1 and we're very excited about that program as well. So in terms of pure immuno-oncology, those would be the ones that I'd highlight.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","I think the big picture, Alethia, is that we see a lot of excess capacity, as I think it's two dozen, maybe even 25 different PD-1, PD-L1s that are competing now for space in oncology. So we're unlikely to jump in. We're watching the space carefully, but it looks to me like there's a lot of excess capacity right now in that area. Let's go to the next question","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening, and thank you for squeezing me in. Just a question on the 340B program. When talking to folks at onco channel (1:05:58), they're talking about expanding their outpatient services out of disproportional share (1:06:02) hospitals. Could you just comment about how big this is for your business? What do you see the trend line? And what do you expect the impact would be of the CMS proposal to reduce the reimbursement rate?","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","Ronny, it's Tony. I don't have those exact numbers with me. We can get back to you, but obviously a lot of our oncology business is in the institution which falls under 340B and we watch that versus carefully. It has grown quite dramatically in the last three, four years or so, but I think it's sort of under 20% of our total business would be 340B.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Closer to 10% of the business, Ronny, and the trade associations, as you know, bio and pharma have been very focused on this, and I think it's a program that got launched with noble intentions, but it's one that's subject to some abuse. And so there's, as you know, some oversight focus in this area right now in Capitol Hill, including looking at whether the discounts are being appropriately applied to the patients that are most in need of them, et cetera. So I'd say stay tuned. This is an area that's likely to be evolving here over the coming legislative calendar.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities LLC.","Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. You've mentioned value-based pricing a few times with regards to the CGRP category and Repatha. Could you maybe talk about what you're hearing from payers in terms of how set up they are for that kind of model? And in migraine specifically, could you see some sort of contracts that are based on a certain level of migraine reduction? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","So, Jim, the value-based process is defining the value of a product based on the threshold you set for a quality of life you saved. It's a process used by most health technology assessment companies around the world, such as the UK, Canada and Australia. It's an evolution of a process in the U.S. at the moment and we feel quite robust and confident in our ability to establish that type of range of value for a product. We discuss that with the payers on an ongoing basis.","I think what you might be referring to is a bit of our risk-share contract we've actually put into place. And those are interesting ones too, where we have product deliver a distinctive value and we're prepared to put our money where our mouth is with those particular products. Some payers have taken us up, such as Harvard Pilgrim. Others are trying to work at how do they track that, monitor that as they go forward. But I would imagine going forward, it has to be something that becomes more and more popular.","Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Yeah, Skinner, let's take two last questions after which Bob will make some concluding comments.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our next-to-last question comes from Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank.","Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Quick one for me, just wanted to see if you've seen an inflection in the rate of Repatha rejections or approvals since FOURIER. And do you think that's really the biggest driver of kind of the share increases that you've seen against alirocumab or is it something else that you see in the market? Thanks.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","If you turn to page 23 of your slide deck, that's of course a chart that I look at often, which shows a distinctive movement of our market share since the outcomes data was delivered at the ACC in March. Clearly people understanding the value of this drug in terms of long-term treatment. So we have in the interim also worked hard as I said earlier to try and reduce the impact on patients who have large commercial co-pays or large commercial deductions. And we're working consistently with payers to try and make the utilization management criteria as well as the process to get access to drug more reasonable to ensure appropriate patients get access.","Operator","And our final question comes from Carter Gould from UBS Equities.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. For Tony, maybe just taking a different direction, can you help frame for us the magnitude of the incremental commercial opportunity for moving XGEVA into myeloma? And any nuances we should keep in mind in looking at peak penetration in the U.S. first year? Thank you.","Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.","You guys can see the size of the multiple myeloma market based on the patient numbers themselves. So there's a distinctive population that exists over there. It's a population that presently isn't in our label and therefore we have not been able to promote on that particular patient group. And we look forward to doing it early in or whenever we get in a label in 2018.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","February PDUFA date and, Sean, you might just want to remind Andrew and others of the benefits we believe that XGEVA will provide those patients with multiple myeloma.","Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.","Yes. I mean, as you probably are aware, virtually all myeloma patients, because of the secreted protein that characterizes the disease filters into the kidney, have varying degrees of renal insufficiency and have to have dose reductions or simply can't tolerate drugs like zoledronic acids. So there is an obvious need for a product that doesn't have renal clearance such as denosumab. However, in our original applications with denosumab, we had a subgroup of patients in one of the trials of multiple myeloma where it appeared as though there could be a harm signal on overall survival. It was a subgroup analysis that was unlikely to be real. We've of course demonstrated it wasn't real by doing this large trial that we've filed. And once we have the indication and can promote it and so on, I think the utilization that's been hampered by that concern about impact on the actual disease process will be alleviated and it should be a great advance for patients with multiple myeloma to have more access to denosumab.","Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.","Okay. Carter, thanks for that question. Thank you all for joining the call. I also want to thank our worldwide staff who are busy successfully executing on our strategy and operating the business right now really effectively while both delivering for patients and shareholders. So I hope you can see from our results that we're positioned for the changing competitive environment with the benefit of a new product cycle set to drive volume growth and a strong balance sheet that we intend to deploy to create value for our shareholders. We see both of these as key to sustaining long-term growth with Amgen.","So thanks very much for joining us. We look forward to talking to you after the third quarter.","Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.","Thanks, everybody.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our Q4 and full year 2011 results conference call. The objective of this call is to review our solid performance in 2011, focus on our outlook for 2012 and provide some additional details on the transaction that we announced this morning with Micromet. ","I'm joined today by Kevin Sharer, our Chairman and CEO, and several members of our management team, including some who are participating in such call for the first time. Kevin will provide the introductions today, although we'll still keep our prepared comments brief and focus only on those that provide added color beyond what's in our press release. We'll use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. ","I would like to remind you that our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in a summarized form means that through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially. I will also note that in connection with the U.S. securities laws and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, we will not be discussing the terms of the Micromet transaction on this call. For more information on the terms of the merger, please review our Form 8-K that was filed earlier today to which the merger agreement with Micromet is attached. Shortly, we'll also follow the tender offer statement on Schedule TO, including the offer to purchase. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin W. Sharer","Thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Well, we began 2012 as a year of transition, transition in leadership and transition to more growth across a variety of fronts including financial, strategic and organizational areas. You'll hear about all of that today in our more detailed remarks and in the question and answers. ","First, I would like to thank the many Amgen staff who are listening on this call and who will hear it later for a very strong 2011. I really, really appreciate what we accomplished. It positions the company well for the future, and we fulfilled our mission again. It's a job really well done, thank you. Although 2012 is only 26 days old, we're off to a good start. We're very pleased with our acquisition of Micromet. We'll talk more about that today, but it advances our pipeline and our fundamental R&D capability. We should guidance today that puts us well on the path to our 2015 goals and beyond. I feel good about that. And I also have to note the recent increase in stock price. It's about time. I would like to publicly thank Roger for his service these 11 years. Roger is with us today. You know him well. He has transformed R&D at Amgen. He's delivered for millions of patients and has been a superb leader of the business in his function and industry. We'll miss him, but we'll benefit long after his transition from his many, many contributions. Thank you, Roger. ","Sean Harper has big shoes to fill. However, I have total confidence he can do just that, and Sean is with us today. We're also joined today for the first time by a new executive team member, Tony Hooper, who joined us a short while ago, but it seems like a long time. He's fully integrated on to the team, and we're very, very happy to have him with us. Tony, welcome. And Bob and I are working very closely to have a seamless transition, and we're pleased with our progress. The company continues to move ahead and get stronger. I'd like to celebrate and acknowledge and say that Bob earned this new job in every way. And I look forward to passing the reins to him soon. So Bob, let me turn the floor over to you to talk in more detail about your views of how we did in 2011 and what's on tap for 2012. So Bob?","Robert A. Bradway","Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. As you've seen from our results for the fourth quarter, we ended the year with momentum, and we expect 2012 to be even stronger. I'll touch on some of the highlights. We entered 2012 with our Neulasta franchise growing, with Enbrel maintaining its market leadership and more stable outlook for EPOGEN, particularly now that we have long-term contracts in place. Prolia and XGEVA are obviously the important part of our outlook for 2012 and beyond. And we will build on the solid foundations that we have established for these brands with launches expected in new countries throughout 2012. We are obviously looking forward to the upcoming ODAC review of XGEVA for bone mets prevention, but I think it's important to emphasize the early progress that we've made and the biggest opportunity for XGEVA, which is with patients whose cancers have already spread to bone. In this setting, XGEVA is both driving the growth of the market and taking share, a trend which we expect to continue. ","Our other products in the growth phase, including Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, contributed nearly $1.5 billion in revenues last year with healthy double-digit growth rates, and the outlook for them in 2012 is strong. A number of important events this year will help inform our longer-term outlook, in particular, the Sensipar EVOLVE outcomes data will be available later this year, as will the interim Phase III data for T-Vec in melanoma, as well as important Phase II data for AMG 785 and AMG 145. We're making progress on executing against the strategy we laid out for you in our business review in April. Our partnership with Watson, announced in December to develop and commercialize a portfolio of oncology biosimilars strengthens our position to capitalize in the growth potential of this new market opportunity. ","And of course, today we've announced an important strategic move with Micromet. Advancing innovative medicines for grievously ill patients is central to our strategy and that is what Micromet represents. We're impressed with their lead molecule and the broader potential applicability of their technology, and we believe we can add value to what they've created with our clinical capabilities in hematology and oncology, our expertise in developing and manufacturing complex, novel biologics and our marketing expertise in this field. ","I'll now turn it over to Jon who'll walk you through in detail our financial results for 2011 and provide clear guidance for 2012. Jon?","Jonathan M. Peacock","Thanks, Bob. I'll focus on providing highlights of our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and recent capital allocation activities and then provide our financial guidance for 2012. ","You can see our fourth quarter results on Page 6. Product revenues grew by 4%. Prolia's growth accelerated in the quarter to 60% compared to Q3 and XGEVA continued its strong trajectory growing 30% over the same period. EPOGEN sales grew 2% compared to the third quarter, starting to demonstrate stability following the dosing adjustment on reimbursement and label changes during the year. Our Filgrastim franchise led by Neulasta continued its momentum, growing 7% relative to the fourth quarter of 2010. And growth-phase products Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate delivered 15% growth versus 2010. Operating expenses increased 6% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the Puerto Rico excise tax and cost of sales for which we received a corresponding foreign tax credit against the U.S. federal income taxes and the U.S. health care reform excise fee. Excluding Puerto Rico excise taxes, cost of sales improved to 14.4% from 15.1% a year ago due to continued productivity efforts. And adjusted earnings per share on the quarter grew by 3% to $1.21. This benefited from a 9% year-on-year reduction and average shares outstanding and the lower tax rate due to the foreign tax credits received on Puerto Rico excise taxes. ","A few highlights on the full year, turning to Page 7. Product sales grew 4%. This was delivered by good growth across our portfolio, partially offset by 19% decline in EPOGEN sales in the U.S. Tony is going to give you more color on the momentum that we're carrying into 2012. Operating expenses on the year grew by 11%, just over half of this was driven by the Puerto Rico excise taxes, the new health care reform excise fee, foreign exchange movements and higher Embrel profit share payments in line with the higher sales.","The increase in operating expenses was in development costs to support our growing late-stage pipeline, launch cost for XGEVA and Prolia and expansion of our international operations. Adjusted earnings per share on the year grew 2% benefiting from a lower tax rate and lower average share count. ","Key balance sheet and cash flow data is summarized on Page 8. Cash balances grew to $20.6 billion at the end of December and total debt amounted to $21.6 billion. During the year, we raised $10.5 billion in additional debt through public bond offerings with an average fixed rate coupon of 4.1% and an average maturity of 15.3 years. We also repaid $2.5 billion of convertible notes that matured in February. ","Free cash flow for the year was $4.5 billion compared to $5.2 billion in 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of increased working capital to support the launch of Prolia and XGEVA, higher interest expense and the prepayments of Sensipar royalties that I highlighted on our last call. And then during the year, we repurchased 144 million shares or 15% of our outstanding share capital at an average price of $57.55 and at a total cost of $8.3 billion. We currently have $5 billion remaining under our board-authorized share buyback program, and we plan to continue to repurchase shares in the open market. Return on equity for 2011 was 23% compared to 22% in 2010. The full benefit of our recent share repurchases will be reflected in further improvements in return on equity in 2012. Finally, we introduced the quarterly dividend in the third quarter of 2011, and in December, we announced a 29% increase in the first quarter of 2012 dividend payment to $0.36 a share. As we communicated in April, our plan is to increase the dividend meaningfully over time. ","Let me now turn to our financial guidance for 2012 on Page 8 (sic) [9]. First, we expect to deliver revenues of between $16.1 billion and $16.5 billion. And this guidance reflects our confidence in the growth prospects across our portfolio. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.90 to $6.15. This reflects our plan to hold growth and operating cost at or below revenue growth, and this includes the consolidated cost of Micromet and the effect of further share repurchases. Capital expenditures for 2012 will be approximately $700 million. Our guidance on the adjusted tax rate is 14% to 15%. And excluding the foreign tax credit to offset the Puerto Rico excise tax and cost of sales, this would amount to 19% to 20%. ","And so in summary, we're making good progress towards the 2015 financial guidance that we provided to you in April. So with that, I'm delighted now to introduce my colleague, Tony Hooper, who's joining our earnings call, as Kevin mentioned, for the first time. Tony?","Anthony C. Hooper","Thank you, Jon. Let me start by saying I'm delighted to be part of this new management team, and I really look forward to taking Amgen into the next decade. So on Slides 11 and 12, you'll find a summary of our global sales performance. Revenue has been characterized by demand trends, delivering record sales for both the quarter and the full year. We expect these trends to continue for 2012. ","Looking now at some of the products in specifics. In the U.S., we continue to see unit growth for Neulasta; however, overall Filgrastim growth was fueled primarily by price. The decrease in international Filgrastim sales was due to a unit decline for NEUPOGEN attributable to biosimilar competition. On the other hand, Neulasta has maintained unit and value share on a year-over-year basis. As we move into 2012, we will continue to focus on first and every cycle treatment as the best way to reduce risk of febrile neutropenia. Enbrel remains the market leader in both rheumatology and dermatology segments despite share losses that are consistent with recent quarters. We are confident in our strong Enbrel patent, and we are revealing both our strategy and our refill allocation for this exciting asset. ","The EPOGEN sales decline continually driven by the implementation of bundling, product label changes and proposed CMS actions, which were announced at the end of the second quarter. Fourth quarter EPOGEN sales, however, grew 2% on a sequential basis. As you know, we signed a 7-year exclusive supply agreement with Avidia and a multiyear nonexclusive agreement with FMC. We believe that these agreements reinforce the value that EPOGEN delivers for patients and practitioners. Importantly, we saw signs of dose stabilization in quarter 4. As we enter 2012, we expect EPOGEN performance to return principally by price as we expect only minor residual dose declines. While the large dialysis centers change the usage of EPOGEN rapidly in 2012 in response to label and reimbursement dynamics, decreases in the prescribing of Aranesp for renal insufficiency have occurred more slowly. We expect these changes in Aranesp prescribing practice to continue early into 2012 but to stabilize by the middle of the year. ","As Bob said, our growth-phase products, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, showed solid growth with combined 2011 sales exceeding $1.4 billion. Each of these products received potential growth, the EVOLVE with Sensipar, an expanded European label for first and second-line COC for Vectibix and the FDA amendment of the Nplate REMS which will make it easier for physicians to prescribe Nplate for appropriate patients.","Turning to our global launches of denosumab, both Prolia and XGEVA delivered a strong fourth quarter. XGEVA grew 30% versus the third quarter. This growth continues to be driven by share gains and overall SRE segment growth. In the U.S., XGEVA ended the quarter with unit share of 28%. The SRE segment grew 12% on a year-over-year basis in units. On the international front, XGEVA was launched in Germany and a few smaller countries and is off to a solid start. In 2012, we expect to launch in most European markets and to continue our growth in the U.S. Prolia grew 60% globally versus the third quarter reflecting strong performance in Germany and a strong quarter in the U.S. In the U.S., U.S. Prolia sales were up 68% versus the third quarter. We are seeing new patient growth, as well as repeat patient growth. As expected, we've been granted a permanent J-code, which allows easy access to bindable [ph] customers, and we plan to launch our DTC TV campaigns later this year. ","As we enter 2012, and patients' deductibles reset, we expect we could see some softness in quarter 1 with a strong resurgence in quarter 2. Internationally, Prolia sales grew 45% versus the third quarter. During the quarter, we launched in Italy and Spain. We've now launched in markets representing in excess of 75% of the sales opportunity. ","Let me focus on international for a moment. We continue to maintain share against biosimilar competitions for Aranesp and Neulasta and have maintained our price premium for both. As you know, the macroeconomic challenges in Europe have impacted our marketplace, and we continue to keep a close eye on the dynamics. However, in 2011, the price degradation we saw in these markets was consistent with what we've experienced in recent years, and we expect basically the same trend in 2012. The strength of our recent launches, as well as our expansion into new markets, puts us in a good position to experience growth in our international business. ","For the U.S., I'd note that our product portfolio ended the quarter with wholesale inventory in the normal range. So in some, we are pleased that the execution against our commercial strategy in 2011 resulted in underlying trends that have allowed us to continue to grow sales as we absorb the changes in our ESA business. In particular, we believe our ability to deliver solid performances for Enbrel and Neulasta, as well as continued to successfully launch and grow XGEVA, Prolia, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate will deliver strong growth in 2012. Now let me hand it to Roger.","Roger M. Perlmutter","Thanks, Tony. This afternoon, I will provide an update on regulatory and development activities in the fourth quarter, comment on some of the important events that we expect will occur in 2012. I'll also provide a brief overview of Micromet, a pioneering biotechnology company with a novel therapeutic platform exemplified by a promising development candidate for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematologic malignancies. As you are aware, and as Kevin mentioned, this morning we announced that Amgen has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Micromet in an all-cash transaction. ","Turning then to Slide 14 with respect to XGEVA, as Tony mentioned, we've been making good progress in gaining approval for XGEVA and all major jurisdictions. In the fourth quarter, working with our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, we completed discussions with the Japanese regulatory authorities leading to the approval of denosumab as landmark for the reduction of skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic bone disease, which was announced last week. ","We have also been engaged in constructive conversations with the FDA regarding XGEVA in advance of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee or ODAC meeting, which is scheduled for February 8. XGEVA is the first agent to show an improvement in bone metastasis-free survival in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. As such, there is no precedent for regulatory approval in this indication. The data that support our submission were published in significant part in The Lancet in November of last year. An editorial that accompanied this publication posed questions about the clinical significance of the observed 4-month delay in the appearance of bony metastasis, and this general topic, that is, what constitutes a clinically meaningful effect in patients with castrate-resistant nonmetastatic prostate cancer was discussed at a prior ODAC meeting in September of last year. Hence, we certainly expect that the FDA will seek advice regarding the clinical significance of an improvement in bone metastases-free survival. We look forward to these ODAC discussions as we continue to explore the best way to employ XGEVA, which is, of course, already approved in the United States to reduce skeletal-related events in men with metastatic prostate cancer and relieving the burden of bony involvement by prostatic malignancies. ","As noted on our slide, in the fourth quarter, the European Commission authorized the use of Vectibix as first-and second-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Vectibix is our fully human antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, which has been previously approved in major markets for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in patients who have failed other therapeutic regimens. In the fourth quarter, our regulatory affairs group filed an sBLA with the FDA for the use of Prolia to treat osteoporosis in men. The PDUFA date for this indication is September 20, 2012. We have previously announced top line data indicating that Prolia treatment increases bone mineral density in such patients. In addition, we received approval in the third quarter for the use of Prolia in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. In this population, Prolia treatment was shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. ","During our third quarter earnings call, I noted that severe shortages in the availability of DOXIL, a chemotherapeutic agent from Johnson & Johnson, were affecting enrollment in one of our 2 studies of AMG 386 in ovarian cancer patients. Because of this, we were forced to suspend enrollment in this Phase III study in the fourth quarter. However, our pivotal study of AMG 386 in this indication, which employs combination therapy with paclitaxel, continues to enroll ahead of schedule. This study and our study of AMG 479 in pancreatic cancer should complete enrollment by the end of 2012. ","Turning then to key events that we expect during 2012, Slide 15 shows that we expect to see data from our Phase III outcome study, the EVOLVE trial, by mid-year. This is an event-driven study in which we asked whether the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism with Cinacalcet reduces all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity as determined using a composite endpoint. Later in 2012, we expect that interim data will become available from our study of talimogene laherparepvec, the oncolytic virus therapy known as T-Vec. We used data related to durable responses as defined in our Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA. You will recall that enrollment in this Phase III study was increased to provide more power for observing an overall survival signal. However, we do not expect to be able to examine survival data until sometime in 2013. Two important Phase II programs will also provide data in 2012. We previously announced top line data for our large Phase II study of AMG 785, the sclerostin-binding antibody that increases bone formation in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. These data will be presented in scientific meetings later in the year. And we will also have the opportunity to review primary data from our fracture healing studies where we asked whether administration of AMG 785 assists in resolution of tibial or hip fractures. We also expect to see data by the end of the year from 4 studies of AMG 145, our fully human antibody directed against PCSK9 that has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Our studies explore the efficacy of AMG 145 as monotherapy or in combination with statins in statin-intolerant patients and in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. ","Finally, I wish to say a few words about our announced agreement with Micromet. Under the leadership of Patrick Baeuerle, their Scientific -- Chief Scientific Officer. Micromet has pioneered the development of Bispecific T-Cell Engaging antibodies called BiTEs. As shown on Slide 16, a typical BiTE antibody combines an antibody that activates cytotoxic T-lymphocytes shown at the top in red, with an antibody that binds an appropriate target on the surface of tumor cells. The resultant chimera, in this case exemplified by Micromet's lead molecule blinatumomab, binds the tumor cells in the patient and recruits cytotoxic T-cells, a critical part of normal immune defense to eliminate these tumor cells. This approach is powerful because cytotoxic T-cells are remarkably active, but as well because simulation of these cells yields a memory cell population that remains active over time. In the case of blinatumomab, these cytotoxic T-cells kill B lymphocytes including those cells that expand illegitimately in cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. ","As shown on Slide 17, Phase II data presented by Micromet scientists late last year at the American Society of Hematology meetings, show that nearly 70% of patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia achieved a complete response or a complete response with partial hematologic recovery. This level of activity in such grievously ill patients is quite remarkable. Indeed, in these responding patients, tumor cells became undetectable after treatment. Median survival in this study had not yet been achieved with a median follow-up of 9.7 months. This is far longer than what has typically been achieved with contemporary combination chemotherapy. As with all highly active cytotoxic therapies, there are adverse effects associated with blinatumomab treatment. However, at this early stage and given the impressive efficacy observed to date, these adverse effects appear manageable. In short, we believe that blinatumomab is a rare asset, a therapy that offers enormous promise for patients suffering from an aggressive, grievous malignancy where alternative therapies do not now exist. ","And not surprisingly, as shown on Slide 18, the BiTE platform has attracted great interest from numerous biopharmaceutical partners, including, of course, Amgen itself. We feel confident that the ability of BiTE antibodies to activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes and to trigger a memory response in these cells will prove valuable in a variety of disease settings. Hence, I'm delighted that our colleagues from Micromet will be joining Amgen and that we, at Amgen, by virtue of our special expertise in the development and manufacture of complex protein therapeutics will be able to provide the resources necessary to develop the BiTE platform for the broader benefit of patients around the world. ","I cannot complete my discussion without noting that the fourth quarter of 2011 will be my last full quarter at Amgen. After 11 years, I'm proud to be able to hand over the reins to my Chief Medical Officer, Sean Harper, who is with me here today. Through the work of thousands of very talented Amgen scientists, I have had the privilege of introducing new therapies that improve the lives of patients suffering from rheumatologic disease, osteoporosis, autoimmunity and the depredations of malignancy. These 11 years have passed in an instant. And in many ways, I'm tempted to continue  for another 11 years, but I recognize that there is an appropriate time to let a new generation address these new challenges. I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity that I have had to serve the cause of biomedical research from this outpost, and I look forward to cheering the accomplishments of Sean and the entire Amgen team as they endeavor to bring our deep pipeline of promising new medicines to patients who desperately need better therapies. I close by thanking all of those who have helped bring us to this point. I have been inspired everyday by your efforts, and I will deeply miss working with Amgen employees around the world. Kevin?","Kevin W. Sharer","Thank you, Roger. That was from the heart, I can guarantee. But now I'd like to open the floor to our normal question-and-answer session. And Arvind, you might state the rules of engagement here and we'll take it from there.","Arvind Sood","Yes, that's fine. Marvin, let's go ahead and open it up for the Q&A session. Before you do, a special shout-out to Ravi Mehrotra from Credit Suisse who's celebrating his 40th birthday today, and he told me that he could think of no better way than to be in a conference call.","Kevin W. Sharer","Get a life.","Arvind Sood","So Marvin, with that, would you review the procedure for asking questions on the call?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Question is on EPOGEN. So I understand this may still be a fluid situation. I was struck by your words and the stabilization of the business. And some of our checks have indicated that throughout last year, a lot of docs started to see an increase of blood transfusion actually by a significant amount and they directly blame the label and the QIP for this dynamic. So I guess, number one, are you getting that kind of feedback? And number two, is it possible this might be a driver of that stabilization? How do you think things play out with that?","Anthony C. Hooper","So this is Tony. Let me start with my short knowledge and some of my team members can help me. There have been discussions around this being an issue and physicians questioning it. We have not seen any real data yet. I understand there's been some trials that have been run or there's a collection of some external data taking place, which could be presented in the next couple of months or so. Net-net, however, I think just the overall practice based on the changes in the label and the reimbursement, physicians have now got to a level where they are comfortable with prescribing but there could be a challenge when we start to see some of the outcomes of the data.","Robert A. Bradway","What I would add to what Tony has said, Chris, this is Bob, is that we expected the large dialysis clinics would quickly change their protocols followed the changes to the label and reimbursement, and we saw that. We think the bulk of the changes were implemented very quickly. And we expect that there will be some residual carryover early in 2012. We think the bulk of the changes in the way patients are being treated has already been made. And the feedback that we're getting from customers in the clinics is that they will expect to have a rather more stable utilization of EPO this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question actually for Roger and maybe even Sean, if he's there. When you think about your business development strategy and then, obviously, you did Micromet today, where do you think the most interest lies as you go forward? Is it early-stage, mid-stage, late-stage stuff? How are you thinking about that?","Roger M. Perlmutter","Well, Michael, we're quite opportunistic. We're interested in valuable programs that we think can make a real difference to patients suffering from grievous illness. In some cases, that will be because of a new discovery that really isn't quite an early stage. It is unusual, of course, to find very late-stage opportunities available because there are so few of them, that just is a fact. But we look at the totality of programs from extremely early programs, which sometimes we approach through investment or venture activity, to later stage programs that already have demonstrated as blinatumomab has clinical efficacy in a Phase II or even later program. So we look at the totality of them. There's no special formula.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to ask your view on operating profit. I think what you were saying is that you don't expect your expenses to grow more than revenue. So is it fair to assume flat operating profit this year? And as a corollary to that, when we think about your R&D budget, is Micromet something that you can really just absorb into your current R&D budget?","Jonathan M. Peacock","Rachel, let me take that one. I think what I said was we expect to hold operating expense growth in line with or below revenue growth. So you usually expect operating expense growth from the year to be no more than the revenue growth that you see for the business, and that's indicated by our guidance. And then on R&D, the guidance fully reflects, as I mentioned, the cost that we foresee for Micromet within R&D, and in fact, for Micromet as a whole. In the context of the 18% to 20% guidance that we've given previously, I would expect that this year would be towards the top end of that guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But more importantly, just a question on assumptions for Sensipar in the face of EVOLVE data. Assuming it showed an outcomes benefit, how should we think about the incremental opportunity as we head into oral drugs being bundled in 2014? Is this something that would offset the bundling impact? Do you think you could grow in the context of bundling? Just trying to get a sense of what the opportunity could be there.","Robert A. Bradway","I don't think we can actually speculate at this stage what it will be until we see the data, I'm afraid.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Leerink Swann.","Joshua Schimmer - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","This question of mine is actually for Roger or Sean on AMG 785 and fracture healing. I'm wondering what gives you confidence in this indication after Forteo, I think, has failed some trials here. Maybe you can discuss the profile you're looking for? Is this accelerated healing in all fractures or improved healing for refractory fractures? And what's the commercial opportunity you're looking at?","Roger M. Perlmutter","Well, Josh, what gives us confidence, the extent one ever has confidence when you're embarking upon a Phase II study is that the preclinical data are so strong. And these, of course, have been described in various research publications and at ASBMR meetings. So the data for sclerostin inhibition, in terms of reducing the frequency of nonunion, are very impressive. And in fact, what we've shown preclinically is that by inhibiting sclerostin, you can fill in a very substantial gap in bone that's introduced via an osteotomy. So it's really quite an impressive result. Now will that translate into clinical improvement with respect to the frequency of nonunion, the ability of patients to bear weight early, reduction in pain, et cetera? We don't know. We're testing that both in tibial fracture and also in hip fracture, and time will tell. But those are the kinds of things that we would like to see as a result of our clinical trials.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the question has to be with EPO and help us understand maybe just a little bit. The DOPS [ph] database, which is obviously not perfect, did indicate that volume was down maybe as much as 11% in Q4 over Q3. So how much of the -- so are you seeing sort of the same volume hit? And the question really is how much is price playing a factor, given the recent new contract with Avidia? Based on our work, we do think that the price is going to go up with Avidia this year. So just trying to really put it together. How much of it is volume versus price?","Anthony C. Hooper","So the data we have for the fourth quarter shows a 2% unit growth in the quarter itself. The actual details of a market demand, I have not yet seen it. We'll probably see those in the next couple of weeks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I had a question on Micromet. I would agree with Roger. I think that the data on their lead product is as exciting as the platform. And I was hoping if you could speak to the platform just in terms of what are their indications we'd be able to pursue, and maybe just give us some sense of timelines.","Roger M. Perlmutter","Yes, okay. The platform as you indicated is extremely interesting because redirected lysis has been something that molecular immunologists have wanted to achieve for a long time to target cytotoxic T cells to direct the elimination of cell populations in people, but it's not been easy to make work. And Patrick Baeuerle and his team have done a great job with that. That opens up a whole set of solid tumor indications and potentially other indications that could be approached using that platform. And that's the basis of our partnership with them, which we announced last July and also the basis of many other partnerships' arrangements. Essentially, it comes down to picking the right targets. What's been shown is that you can harness the power of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. So you have to find the right targets and then demonstrate in the clinic that those targets actually can be destroyed without undue adverse effects. Most of those programs are at a preclinical stage. There are some early clinical data that are coming in with respect to another program, the MT110 program. It's an early Phase I situation and a few other things. But I think the opportunity that exists there with respect to that platform is simple. It's a better way to kill tumor cells, and now we have to go about showing that we can kill the right cells in patients suffering from malignancy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering on AMG 145, Roger, can you help us understand the differences between that particular antibody and other PCSK9 antibodies in development, if you think there is a notable difference? And what might be the schedule to actually start Phase III? And if I can slip one in, on the tax rate, is that tax rate sustainable in the out years?","Roger M. Perlmutter","So I'll have Jon answer the 145 questions and I'll answer -- with respect to 145, and I'll hand it over to Jon, since he slipped it in, of course, there are no head-to-head comparisons amongst the different PCSK9 antagonists, and hence, we can't really comment on how one compares to another. We are deep in the midst of very large Phase II studies. You've seen them on clinicaltrials.gov. They will deliver a very large amount of data in 2012, which will provide the basis for end of Phase II discussions with FDA that can lead to a Phase III program. We're excited about what we've seen to this point. We believe that this can be a very important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for cholesterol reduction in patients at risk as a result of hypercholesterolemia for adverse cardiovascular events. But we need to wait and see the Phase II data. Jon?","Jonathan M. Peacock","Yes. And now to the tax question, I guess we are carrying part of our tax burden within cost of sales now as a result of the Puerto Rico excise taxes. And I've mentioned, we get an offset against that in our income tax line. So the total tax burden that we're carrying on our P&L is 19% to 20%, and you see 14% to 15% of that on the income taxes line. So I think the answer to the question is 19% to 20% is broadly a sustainable tax rate, at least, for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The question is on XGEVA and the prevention indication. Can you just walk us through what you see as the major commercial hurdles and opportunities? And specifically on the hurdles, how do you maximize the leverage into that new physician group? And on the opportunities, where do you see the real world patient population size-wise?","Robert A. Bradway","I mean, first, obviously, we don't have a label yet. And so obviously, we look forward to having the opportunity to discuss this with the ODAC, and we will see where we come out. We have a PDUFA date, as you know, in April. But faraway biggest opportunity for us, of course, is in treating patients whose cancers are already spread to the bone. We're very pleased with the progress we're making there. As I said in my remarks earlier, we're pleased with the growth in the market, which means that we were reaching more patients and patients who weren't previously being treated now have access to medicine, in particular XGEVA. And we're pleased with the share that we're taking. But that is far and away the larger opportunity. And so why don't we wait and see what the FDA review of XGEVA in the setting of metastasis prevention provides by way of the label and then we'll address it at that time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","My understanding is that Amgen currently has few biosimilar products in the early stage of clinical development. Can you tell us what the targets over those products are?","Kevin W. Sharer","That's correct, Eun. We do have molecules in development. We're not going to share details about the specific programs at this point. As you know, in December, we announced a partnership with Watson to develop and commercialize several oncology antibodies. And I hope you'll respect that, for competitive reasons, we're not going to share details any earlier than we need to about the programs that we're advancing. But we're excited about the potential for growth from biosimilars. And I would point out that the opportunity for us is not just in the U.S. but obviously globally, and we see an opportunity to leverage the biosimilars as we seek to expand internationally into new markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Question, I guess, for Jon. Looking for a bit more guidance on 2012, specifically what the share count assumption is, whether you think you can further improve gross margins and whether XGEVA bone met prevention label is incorporated in the guidance.","Jonathan M. Peacock","Yes, so in terms of share count, I think as we have consistently said, we don't preannounce the amounts and timing of share repurchases. As I mentioned, we do have $5 billion of authorized programs still in place. And we do intend to continue buying in the open market, and I have reflected our expectations for that in the guidance. But what I can't do for you is give you the specifics on preannouncing our activities. But we have got a $5 billion program to complete sales. On gross margins, I think the guidance we gave for 2015 was that we expect cost of sales to be 13% by 2015 or in the order of 13% by 2015. You saw progress over this last year. If I could strip out the Puerto Rico tax effect in there, we've improved from 15% from 14% just over the last year, and I would expect -- and I'm confident we're on the road to that 13% by 2015. I'm sorry, what was your first question?","Robert A. Bradway","On XGEVA, where the guidance included the bone mets prevention. Obviously, we're not giving product-specific guidance on this call and there are puts and take across the product range. And the guidance we've given you, we think, reflects our best view of where we are heading into 2012. So as we said at the outset, we're pleased with the momentum that we bring to the start of the year, and we're excited about the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The question is on the revenue guidance, and Bob, I think you may have just answered the question, but I was hoping that you could maybe talk a little bit about what's in areas we need to play out to achieve the higher end of guidance. I think with stream numbers being basically at the bottom end of the guidance, I think we have sense of what the scenarios look like but I was hoping that you might be able to give more color as to what your thinking is on the top end?","Robert A. Bradway","Yes, I think we tried to give you a sense of why we feel pretty optimistic at this stage in the year and the optimism is borne by our -- is underpinned by the strength we see in the core franchises. We're pleased with the progress that we're making and growing Neulasta globally. We're pleased with the position we have with Enbrel. And again, we think the ESA franchise will be more stable that it has been in past years, that the products that we have recently launched, which are growing. Obviously, XGEVA, Prolia, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate are all performing well. We have high expectations for the growth in most products in 2012 in established and emerging markets. So really across-the-board, while there are puts and takes, we think the guidance we provided reflects our best view of what the likely outcome for the year is.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sapna Srivastava with Goldman Sachs.","Sapna Srivastava - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is just following upon the acquisition strategy question, which was asked earlier. Could you just give us more color on the your thought process, whether you're focused more on U.S. assets or ex-U.S. assets given your cash balance? And if you were able to use the U.S -- ex-U.S. cash for the Micromet deal?","Robert A. Bradway","Sure. Again, I think your -- our acquisition philosophy remains to try to find innovative medicines that can make a difference for patients who are grievously ill. So what you should expect from our licensing and our business development activity more generally is that those are the kinds of molecules and opportunities we're going to be looking for. Specifically, with respect to the ex-U.S. cash, Micromet is a U.S-listed company, so we're using onshore cash to fund that acquisition. But as an ongoing investment, ongoing R&D expenses for Micromet and its team in Munich, obviously, we'll be able to use offshore cash for that. Last year, early in the year, we made an acquisition of a business in Brazil. We're pleased with the early results from that, and that was the other focus in some of our acquisition activity to the extent we're able to find small opportunities in markets where we're trying to expand and to the extent we believe we can leverage those transactions to launch our own innovative products. We'll continue to look at transactions like that. But they would -- I think you should expect that they'll be on the smaller side of things just like the Bergamo transaction that we did last year in Brazil.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'll ask you the question that you've always refused to answer, which is to name your favorite child in the portfolio. But also could you give us a little bit more color about 785 and 145? What sort of dosing schedules, particularly for sort of chronic administration, we should be expecting for those 2 antibodies?","Roger M. Perlmutter","Yes, sure, Geoff. We are still in the midst of studies that will help to define dose and schedule for both of those programs. And there are -- there are aspects for the programs, particularly for 785, that relate not only to dose and schedule the way you defined it, but also for how long one should treat patients with 785 in order to gain the maximum effect. So those things are all being addressed, but we're optimistic that one can have monthly scheduling with AMG 785. It is possible it could be even less frequent, and time will tell as far as that's concerned. Over time, one would expect also, with AMG 145, that we should be able to get to that kind of schedule although it may be that, early on, when we'll be working with something closer to every-2-week dosing. Again, time will tell as we see the results from our Phase II studies. And no, I won't name my favorite. We want all our children to go to college and...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Looking at Aranesp, the trends exiting 2011 don't look that stable. So I just wanted to get your general sense as to the assumptions for Aranesp in 2012. What the drivers are there? And then maybe at a higher level, do your assumptions for this year imply any different rate for biosimilar penetration than we've seen in the past.","Anthony C. Hooper","So as I said earlier, it was clear that the large dialysis centers moved quite rapidly in adjusting the EPOGEN label. But at the same time, the decreases in prescribing Aranesp for renal insufficiency continued a bit more slowly. We see that now evolving between now and the middle of next year and then stabilizing as we go forward. As regards to biosimilars in Europe, we've continued to project the same type of interaction we have to date. We've managed to maintain our price premium, and we are holding pretty well in terms of the market share.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Sonnier with William Blair.","John S. Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'll ask the beady question slightly differently, maybe for Roger. Over the past year, you guys have made significant I would argue [ph] accelerating investment in the area of next generation antibodies. You know, the solid tumor transaction, the ImmunoGen TAP transaction, now the acquisitions. So the question is, I'm trying to get into your strategic thinking behind the investment. Is the target driven? Is it IP driven? Is it capability driven? There just appears to be a broader overarching strategic intent to build critical mass in this broad area.","Roger M. Perlmutter","Yes. The fact of the matter is that this is a strategy that has evolved over a very long period of time. When I joined the company, Amgen had already had a very strong reputation in supportive care and part of the push was to add to that a therapeutics capability, which we did by developing drugs that block signal transduction or growth factor signaling in tumors. And what we're doing now, is we've said, \"All right, that is one way of trying to eliminate tumors, to kill them by depriving them of things that they need to grow.\" But another way of doing this is to actually kill the tumor cells themselves. And if we could harness an immunological reaction, that would be a good thing to do. Part of that strategy, we revealed by the BioVex acquisition last year around this time in which an modified Herpes Simplex virus triggers an immune response that eliminates malignant melanoma. We're in Phase III in that. We'll be interested in looking at those data, which -- some of which should become available this year. And in addition, we look for opportunities to harness immune killing of tumors in other ways. Of course, I've been interested in Micromet and their BiTE platform for a very long time. We did sign the collaboration agreement with them in July of last year, and that in turn led to this most recent transaction. So it's been a very systematic and, I think, quite thoughtful look at opportunities to eliminate tumor cells in patients suffering from malignant disease.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess -- my questions, I guess, are for the team. And congrats given on your transformative seniority at Amgen, Roger. I'm sure you're going to mean this as well. That was getting me thinking about transitions. A lot of times in biotech there's a lot -- there's a change in management that's led to a big shift in company strategy. So I'm just wondering if you could give us some color on your view on how the teams are going to transition internally over the year, and how you're going to contribute communicate that with rhe Street?","Kevin W. Sharer","I think that companies have different outcomes from transition. Some transitions come about because of dissatisfaction with company performance or some external shock. And in those cases, large changes in strategy and direction are perhaps completely appropriate. Second, the reason that you transition leadership is to get new ideas and new energy. And so you'd expect over time to have changes happen. Otherwise, you wouldn't make the transition. But I think in our case, Bob and I have worked together very, very closely. Amgen's mission will remain the same. Our dedication to innovation will remain the same. Our multi-modality platforms will remain the same. But there are lots of rooms in that. And our dedication to being a global company will remain the same. So I think that, that foundation you can count on. Bob, when he takes the job, will have a chance to explain sort of how he wants to take the company and time will tell there. In terms of the transition here, I said in the press release that announced the transition that we sought a seamless transition. And in effect, this is a generational change of leadership. And that's exactly what's happening. I think that this is the smoothest transition I have ever seen, and I have been through board service, as well as Amgen involved in quite a number of them. So I feel really good about that and the company is in a good place. And it feels good all around having Tony join us from outside brings energy and perspective from another company. Sean has long been in the on-deck circle for Roger and Bob sure as heck has earned his spurs here and having Jon come from Novartis and his background some time ago gives us the kind of outside perspective and expertise we need. So I think Amgen's in a good spot, and I think you'll be pleased with what you see going forward. And let me turn it over to Bob. If you got anything you'd like to add, Bob?","Robert A. Bradway","Robyn, obviously, I understand the interest in the question and we look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to present the new team and for the new team to have a chance to talk to you about the things that we want to do strategically and the things that we're excited about at the company. But I think Kevin summarized very well our expectations for the transition.","Kevin W. Sharer","I think that's a good question to close out today on. We appreciate your questions, and I look forward to talking to you again here in 3 months. Thank you very much.","Arvind Sood","Thanks for taking the time.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.","Arvind Sood","Thank you, Marvin, and good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our first quarter conference call. We are off to a strong start in 2012, and we are looking forward to the many opportunities ahead. I'm joined today by several members of our leadership team, including Bob Bradway, our current President and CEO-elect; our Chief Financial Officer, John Peacock; Tony Hooper, our Head of Global Commercial Operations; and Sean Harper, our Head of R&D. This quarter represents milestones in many ways, with record performance for both revenues and adjusted earnings per share, and notably after 2 full decades, first as President and then as Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer will preside over his last call as our Chief Executive Officer. Kevin is with us this afternoon, but before I turn the call over to him, I will just provide our customary reminders. ","We will use slides for our presentation today. The slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation today we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially. ","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin W. Sharer","Thanks, Arvind, and good afternoon, everyone. As Arvind mentioned, this is hard to believe, my 77th and last Amgen quarterly conference call. I will make today a few comments, then step out of the room to leave Bob and his team to discuss the quarter and answer your questions. ","You may have noticed in the newspaper that our first CEO, George Rathmann, passed away over the weekend. I want to make a few comments about George. I can't say that I knew him well, but I did know him. He was certainly the most intense interviewer when I came here 20 years ago. And from that very first interview, his passion about biotechnology, his focus on the future and his love of Amgen all came through. We can't overstate his contribution to Amgen. What you read in the newspaper was accurate, but incomplete. His contribution centrality and enduring influence on us are everywhere. And his science base, his desire to make big bets on big products that can move the needle, his team leadership, his energy will always be part of us. In fact, today, Bob and I went out in front of the George Rathmann Laboratory where his statue stands and took some pictures. We'll miss George, but he'll always be here. ","Now I'd like to talk to my Amgen colleagues. As I do on each one of these calls, I want to thank you for delivering yet another excellent quarter. The results in revenue, net income, pipeline progress, business development and operations are all strong, thanks to your efforts. And I'd also like to say it's been a privilege to be your colleague and, for a while, to have a leadership role in this great enterprise. I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity and the experience. And to our colleagues who write about us, thank you for your interest, your effort, your perspective and your objectivity. While I did not always agree with all you said, I always respected you and you collectively have made us better. Thank you. And finally to our shareholders, we've always known who owned the company and who we worked for and who we're ultimately responsible to. We always try to listen, be transparent and fully trustworthy while delivering on our promises. Especially for those of you who have been with us for the long haul, we deeply appreciate your guidance, support and encouragement and sometimes patience. I've always felt we were partners. The company today is strong, capable and well positioned with a new team and leader who will lead us forward with the same sense of purpose, shared values, aspiration and effectiveness that have since George Rathmann's day characterized us and distinguished us. ","In Bob, you'll have a superb human being and dedicated leader. I leave Amgen in a good place and good hands. Thank you, and my best to you all. Bob, it's all yours. Well, in 29 days it will be, but you can take the call.","Robert A. Bradway","All right. Thank you, Kevin. And as you've seen from our first quarter, the company is in a very strong position. And as this is Kevin's last full quarter as CEO, I want to take a moment to thank and congratulate him on his success here at Amgen. We've grown significantly under Kevin's leadership, and I look forward to building on this as Amgen's next CEO. ","Our transition is proceeding smoothly with the new team in place. And in that context, I'm delighted to welcome Sean Harper to this call as the Head of Research and Development. You'll hear from him after Jon and Tony have delivered their remarks on the quarter. The 4 of us and the other members of the senior leadership team are squarely focused on delivering growth, and we look forward to engaging with you as we progress on this path. ","In terms of our results, the first quarter is an indication that 2012 is off to a strong start with record performance for both revenues and adjusted earnings per share. Product sales growth was driven by broad momentum in our portfolio. Our Neulasta, NEUPOGEN and Enbrel franchises showed solid gains in Q1. Prolia and XGEVA continued their strong growth, and our other growth phase products grew more than 20% year-over-year. ","Declines in our ESA business, which is now a much smaller proportion of our overall sales compared to 5 years ago, were more than offset by revenue gains of newer products. With respect to our pipeline, we're making good progress. I'm sure many of you saw the data that were presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting last month for our PCSK9 inhibitor, AMG 145, as well as the results of our Phase II psoriasis study that were published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine for AMG 827, our IL-17 receptor antibody. We also announced, along with our partners at UCB, the Phase III enrollment has begun for AMG 785, an anabolic agent for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. We're excited about the potential of these programs, and Sean will have more to say on them and other developments in R&D in a few minutes. ","With respect to transaction activity, following on our earlier acquisition of Micromet, we have remained busy. Our multiproduct partnership with AstraZeneca leverages their strong experience in inflammation and enables us to focus decisively on other attractive opportunities in our pipeline. Our planned acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals will enable us to expand our expertise in therapies for chronic kidney disease and particularly patients suffering from secondary hyperparathyroidism. ","Before I turn over to Jon to review our Q1 results, I'd like to conclude with 2 closing thoughts. First, I recognize that many of our staff are listening in, and I'd like to express my appreciation to them for their commitment to delivering for patients and for our shareholders. And second for the investment community, as I embark on my new role, I want to underscore my commitment to maintaining an open dialogue with all of you. ","And with that, let me turn over to Jon to review the first quarter results.","Jonathan M. Peacock","Thanks, Bob. So as you will have seen, the headline on the quarter is that we grew revenues by 9% and adjusted EPS by 20%. Product sales grew by 8% compared to 2011, reflecting broad strength across the portfolio. Neulasta, Enbrel, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate continued the momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. And XGEVA and Prolia also delivered combined sales of $241 million compared to $69 million a year ago. The overall growth of 8% was despite the 14% decline in our ESA franchise, and Tony will give more color on our product sales in a few minutes. Other revenues increased by $59 million versus a year ago. This was primarily due to a $50 million payment received from AstraZeneca on signing our inflammation partnership, as well as the $22 million milestone from Astellas on the approval in Japan of AMG 223, a phosphate binder for patients on dialysis with chronic kidney disease. ","Turning to operating expenses, these were 9% higher compared to 2011, in line with revenue growth. Now within this, cost of sales were up 23% and that reflected higher Puerto Rico excise taxes, and to a lesser extent, an inventory write-off taken on product held for a third party. Since the Puerto Rico tax initially passes through inventory and it was introduced in January of last year, the charge was much lower in the first quarter of 2011. And if we exclude Puerto Rico taxes, cost of sales were 15% of product sales in the quarter. ","On the other expense lines, one point that I should note is that our R&D expenses in the second half of this year will be affected by the Phase III trial that we expect to start and that Sean will talk about later. ","Adjusted earnings per share grew by 20%, building on the operating income growth of 10%. This reflects a 15% lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expense. Our tax rate was also one point lower than a year ago. ","Turning to the balance sheet on Page 2. We held cash of $19.4 billion and debt of $21.5 billion at the end of March. Uses of cash in the quarter were primarily for our acquisition of Micromet, share repurchases and our quarterly dividend. Our debt portfolio has a weighted average maturity of 13.5 years and a weighted-average coupon pretax of 3.7%. Our shareholders' equity was 24% lower at $18.8 billion, reflecting the capital that we return to shareholders, which is also improving our return on equity. Free cash flow was down by $100 million versus 2011. This was driven by U.S. tax payment in the quarter and an increase in capital expenditures consistent with our guidance for the year. ","We continue to buy back shares in the quarter, and by the end of March, we purchased 21 million shares with an average price of $67.92. At the end of the quarter, we have $3.6 billion remaining on our $10 billion share repurchase authorization, and we plan to continue buying shares in the open market in the balance of the year. Finally, we paid a dividend of $0.36 a share on the quarter, a 29% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in 2011. So overall, we're well on track towards the guidance that we provided in January. In summary, we expect to deliver revenues of $16.1 billion to $16.5 billion, adjusted EPS of $5.90 to $6.15 and an adjusted tax rate of between 14% and 15%. So let me hand over now to Tony for a more detailed look at our commercial performance. Tony?","Anthony C. Hooper","Thank you, Jon. On Slide 8, you'll find a summary of our global sales performance. We are indeed off to a solid start for 2012. We continue to drive strong performance in our largest core franchises and we made an excellent progress on some of our newer franchises. Let me walk you through our product portfolio beginning with Neulasta NEUPOGEN. ","The 9% growth in our worldwide franchise was driven by both price and unit growth. I'd note that Neulasta represents about 80% of the franchise. Although price contributed about half of the 15% growth in Neulasta in the U.S., we also had very good unit growth as we maintain our emphasis on first and every cycle treatment as the best way to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia in appropriate patients. We saw good unit growth in Neulasta in Europe and experienced a slight increase in our market share compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. NEUPOGEN, on the other hand, lost some share to biosimilars as well as conversion to Neulasta. ","Turning to Enbrel. We are focusing on both the short-term and the long-term opportunity of this important product. We continue to hold market leadership positions in both rheumatology and dermatology, and we are committed to investing the product over the long term. During the first quarter, we ensure that insurance reverifications were executed more efficiently. This is reflected in our results. ","We've also been very pleased with the results we've seen from our TV campaign featuring Phil Mickelson. In particular, over the course of the last year, we are increasing bio-naive share, especially in the rheumatology segment. Bio-naive share is the share of patients that are new to biologics. And in the case of rheumatology, our bio-na\u00efve share during 2011 has been well above our overall share. We believe this is a strong leading indicator for the product and bodes well for long-term performance of Enbrel. Given the upcoming expiration of the Enbrel co-promotion relationship in late 2013, both Amgen and Pfizer have agreed to consolidate all U.S. field sales activities under Amgen effective July 23, 2012. The unified Amgen sales force will cover both rheumatology and dermatology. The consolidation of all field sales activities under Amgen, as well as the small expansion of the sales force do not change the terms of the co-promotion agreement, and both Amgen and Pfizer will continue to share the agreed upon sales and marketing expenses. ","Aranesp sales declined by 4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, driven by a drop in unit demand. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect stabilization in practice patterns by the middle of this year. During the latter part of the quarter, we have already seen unit demand steadying in the U.S. Internationally, Aranesp sales were flat quarter-over-quarter as price decreases were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. ","With regards to EPOGEN, this is a business in transition and predicting usage over the past 18 months has proved difficult. Volatility in this business had been attributable to bundling, revisions to the label, reinvestment changes and dose reductions from new treatment protocols in reaction to these changes. We also saw volatility in buying patterns driven by our new contracts with DaVita and Fresenius. In quarter 4, these factors contributed in a drop in average hemoglobin level from 11.2 to 10.9. As there's a lag of several months in the availability of our hemoglobin data, we don't have data for Q1 yet. But we believe that the hemoglobin levels might have dropped slightly again. We do believe, however, that any further significant declines in hemoglobin levels would meaningfully increase the need for patient transfusion. ","We now also have new competition with the launch of peginesatide. We take all competitive launches very seriously, but we are confident in our ability to compete in the marketplace. I would note that we have a 7-year exclusive contract with DaVita and a multiyear nonexclusive contract with Fresenius. These 2 providers represent nearly 70% of our EPOGEN business. Taking all these factors into account, we've come up with a range of EPOGEN outcomes that are reflected within our guidance, and we are confident that we will deliver results in line with those guidance. ","Our growth rate products, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate each had record quarters, and our solid strategy and execution delivered 22% year-over-year growth, driven by double-digit demand increases for each of these 3 products. ","Turning to our global launches of dmab, both Prolia and XGEVA continuing to grow. XGEVA growth continues to be driven by share gains and overall SRE segment growth. Unit demand growth in the U.S. was 20% for the fourth quarter. ","On the international front, XGEVA is progressing very well in countries in which we have launched, Germany, Australia and a few smaller markets. In these countries, our uptake has been stronger than the initial uptake of Zometa. And in both Germany and Australia, we have already achieved double-digit percentage unit share. We expect launches in key Southern European market later in 2012 to contribute significant growth. Payers and physicians continue to recognize the unambiguous benefits that XGEVA delivers. Prolia growth continued in the first quarter as the team worked to ensure appropriate patient access in the U.S. as insurance plans reset. We're encouraged with the demand trends exiting the quarter. We're also seeing an expansion in the breadth of prescribing with more than 1,100 new prescribers during the month of March. During the first quarter, we also launched our new TV campaign featuring Blythe Danner. This campaign is designed to educate PMO patients about Prolia and initiate the dialogue between them and their physicians. Reports from our field service team indicate it's making an impact, and we know the number of patients visiting our Prolia website has increased sixfold. Internationally, Prolia is now reimbursed in 28 countries in Europe and Australia. In Germany, for example, Prolia's value share is nearly 10%. Our uptake is strong in the markets where we have reimbursement, and we hope to launch in additional markets including France later this year. ","Turning now to international business. We continue to make progress in expanding our geographic footprint and despite economic pressures in biosimilar competition, we continue to see unit growth and pricing in line with recent experience and our expectations. For the U.S., I note that our product portfolio ended the quarter with wholesale inventory in the normal range. In sum, I'm very pleased with the strong start to this year as we both maintain and build momentum. I'm confident about our abilities to succeed in an increasingly competitive marketplace. ","I'd now like to turn the call to my colleague, Dr. Sean Harper, welcome him to the call, and I look forward to partnering with him as we build Amgen to even greater heights. Sean?","Sean E. Harper","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. I'm obviously extremely pleased to be here to represent Amgen R&D, and I'm looking forward to spending more time with all of you talking about our many opportunities to enhance and extend the lives of patients with serious unmet medical needs.","Our late stage clinical programs are all advancing very well, and we're looking forward to seeing results with several key data sets this year. These include results from our large Phase II program with AMG 145, our monoclonal antibody inhibitor or PCSK9, in patients with hypercholesterolemia. We recently presented our Phase I data at the American College of Cardiology meetings where there was great interest in this access due to the large number of patients in clinical practice that cannot reach their LDL cholesterol goals despite currently available therapies. We have completed enrollment of approximately 1,300 patients in our studies exploring the efficacy of AMG 145 as monotherapy or in combination with statin in statin-intolerant patients and in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. These studies will provide the richness of data necessary to optimally determine dose, schedule and other factors for Phase III. ","We've initiated Phase III enrollment with AMG 785, our monoclonal antibody directed against sclerotin in our program designed to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis with our partners at UCB. And this year, we'll see Phase II results of studies with AMG 785 in patients with fractures that tend to be difficult to heal. We also expect to see midyear the results of the EVOLVE study, our Phase III cardiovascular outcome study of Cinacalcet in the treatment of dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. So I'd like to provide a little background. ","As Slide 12 illustrates, Sensipar\/Mimpara has been adopted in this setting based on the ability to manage key biochemical parameters, including calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels. However, it is widely hypothesized the control of this biochemical abnormality should reduce inappropriate calcification of soft tissues, and perhaps by reducing arterial stiffness, reduce the high rate of cardiovascular events seen in this population. ","Slide 13 is a high-level schematic of the study. Approximately 3,800 patients were randomized with a standard of care versus standard of care plus Cinacalcet. There's a composite cardiovascular primary endpoint. This important study will test the hypothesis that the value of Cinacalcet may extend beyond currently established benefits to reduce cardiovascular events in these high-risk patients. By the way, this kind of study designed to demonstrate the value of our medicines at the level of critical patient outcome is absolutely the right thing to do. Even in the absence of benefits regarding cardiovascular risk, we anticipate that the established benefits of Cinacalcet will be reaffirmed. We expect to have the complete analysis of the primary endpoint, as well as overall survival from our Phase III study of T-Vec in patients with metastatic melanoma in 2013. ","I'd like to clarify here that we will perform an internal prespecified interim analysis of the primary endpoint of durable response by this year's end, however, we do not plan to share these data externally in the context of an ongoing Phase III study, but rather at study completion in 2013. Our Phase II data from AMG 827, our monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the IL-17 receptor, now known as brodalumab, in moderate to severe psoriasis was recently published in New England Journal and has created a lot of excitement in the field due to the level of clearing of affected skin. We expect to initiate Phase III enrollment in this program with our colleagues at AstraZeneca, MedImmune in the near future. We're working together as well on the entire set of inflammation assets included in our recently announced partnership. This arrangement allows us to redirect significant resources into some of our other innovative development program. Given our wealth of pipeline opportunities, you can expect to continue to see us be decisive about pipeline management and to seek to optimize a return of our R&D investment. ","As you know, we recently announced our plans to acquire KAI Pharmaceuticals, a privately held biotechnology company. KAI's lead program is in calcium medication, KAI-4169, for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism that can be intravenously administered during standard 3x a week hemodialysis regimen. While there are currently several approved therapies for the treatment of SHPT, significant unmet medical need remains. Our takeaway from ongoing discussions with nephrologists is that an IV therapy administered coincident with dialysis would provide an opportunity for health care providers to be assured that the patient receive the drug as intended. Phase II data for KAI-4169 have been very promising and KAI are planning an efficient Phase III program based on biochemical endpoints. ","Our integration of Micromet is proceeding very smoothly, and the more we learn about the science and technology the more excited we are about the potential of this acquisition. We're currently engaged in moving the lead molecule, blinatumomab, ahead as rapidly as possible in relapsed\/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as in populations of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Bob?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay. Thank you, Sean. Now, Arvind, let's open it up for Q&A. And if you could just remind those who dial in of our customary procedures, we'll get started with Q&A.","Arvind Sood","Yes. Marvin, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A, and if you can just review the procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question on the EPO [EPOGEN] franchise in the business. Obviously, you're talking about increased risk of transfusions as dose goes down. Are you tracking data? Do you have external or internal data, and what are you tracking and what can you do with this data?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay. Tony, why don't you field that question?","Anthony C. Hooper","So we have anecdotal data to date about potential transfusion increase. Some of the related data showed about a 20% increase. We're waiting to see more finite and definitive studies to be able to discuss this further, but we haven't seen more at this stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert W. Baird.","Matthew C. McAviney - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is actually Matt in for Chris. Just had a question on the EPS for Q1. I was just looking -- if you annualize the quarterly run rate, it seems to be a bit higher than your guidance, so I was just wondering if you could give me a little color on what to expect on that.","Jonathan M. Peacock","Yes. So first comment is overall that we're well on track towards the guidance that we provided in January. And obviously, we'll keep this guidance under review as we go through the year. But a couple of comments on Q1. One is, there were a couple of onetime events in our other revenue line that I mentioned earlier on. And also as Sean referenced, we'll have some Phase III trials getting started in the back end of the year. So overall, we're well on track and we'll keep it under review as we move into the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess my question is more of a general and perhaps for Bob. Bob, there's been a little bit of investor speculation, I don't think you ever confirmed or denied, by Amgen that once you take the helm, you may entertain some -- you may look -- you may reevaluate the business and perhaps cut costs basically or change the way Amgen thinks about cost, what the right operating margin is, what the right R&D margin is, et cetera. I was just wondering in general, I know you're not going to give long-term guidance but just in general, is there something that investors should be thinking about? Or is this something that at this point you'd be discouraging us from considering and rather you'd just kind of stay the course for now?","Robert A. Bradway","With respect to my focus, Mark, clearly, it will be on growth and in particular on driving growth through innovation, whether that innovation is the product of our own research and development as in the case of PCSK9 or as in the case of sclerostin or whether that growth is from business development activity like that which we announced for Micromet or like that which we announced with KAI. So we'll be looking to drive the business by bringing forward innovative medicines that make a difference for patients that are seriously ill. And in addition, be looking to grow the business internationally. Now we'll be seeking to do that while earning an attractive return on our invested capital. We recognize the importance of being able to do that for our shareholders, and I think that will require us to continue our focus on productivity, and we look forward to doing that across the business. And Mark, more generally, obviously, I look forward with the new team to have an opportunity to engage with you and all of our shareholders at the appropriate time to talk about what we're going to do in order to achieve those objectives that we have for growth of the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Enbrel has obviously held up really well here as has Humira. So it doesn't seem like it's a 0 sum game here in the inflamed market. Can you tell us what you're seeing in terms of sustained market growth, pricing power and any other aspect you think is driving the performance and whether or not those are sustainable? And then related, Tony, as we look to the [indiscernible] system panel here in a couple of weeks, how do you think about the various commercial scenarios that can play out? How do you think about positioning yourselves with a potential oral medication entering the market?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay. There are a couple of questions there, Tony, but why don't you go ahead and try to take both of those questions.","Anthony C. Hooper","Okay. So Enbrel has been on the market now for about 14 years and we have seen continued sustained gentle growth in the number of patients getting access to these products. As we've seen, the new entries come in, so the education has increased. And we've seen some expansion in the actual number of patients. We've clearly have priced these products in line with the therapeutic value they bring to patients who are living much more extended and healthy lives. And I think if you look at the growth of our product, it's clearly around driving the new bio-naive patients. So physicians and patients themselves have seen the need to move to Enbrel first. And when you look at some of the DTC data that about 70% of the time that patients ask for drug, they get a drug. You can see why it's so important for us to have the right DTC campaign going to educate our patients properly. To your last question about the new competitors coming, given the efficacy and safety of currently available treatment options, long-term safety is going to be a key for any new agent coming to market. So until we see what the safety is like of this new agent, if I'd just remind you again that Enbrel has 14 years of a really good experience with safety as well as efficacy from a durable basis.","Robert A. Bradway","Maybe one thing just quickly to add on Enbrel. I know you're familiar with it Matt, but perhaps some of those who follow us and don't know the company as well. Of course, we look forward to ongoing intellectual property protection for Enbrel. Enbrel is a franchise that we've enjoyed successfully for the past 14 years, and we're looking forward to a number of more years of Enbrel as the market leader in this category.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit more about the deal that you signed with AstraZeneca. I guess with 827, it showed really impressive psoriasis results and arguably it could be Amgen's one of more interesting late stage products. So I guess I'm just trying to understand why you would give away half the profits for the R&D benefits you're going to see short term? And just maybe when we think about this deal, should we think about other similar types of deals that you kind of hinted at that in your  prepared remarks?","Robert A. Bradway","Yes. I think the big picture, Rachel, is that we're looking to optimize our portfolio. This is a multiproduct deals, so it's more than just a deal around 827, and Sean can talk to you about the specifics of your question behind 827. But generally, as we have opportunities to advance exciting biology like some of the molecules included in this partnership, we'll look for opportunities to do that decisively. And where we can reprioritize in our pipeline, we'll also look for places to do that. So Sean, feel free to comment about 827 or any of the other molecules in the partnership.","Sean E. Harper","Yes, I think these are all very interesting assets. I think we found this to be a particularly attractive win-win sort of a relationship with AZ MedImmune to be able to get the ability to redirect some resources and do things that we were -- we found particularly compelling within our own innovation space. And this, obviously, worked very well for AZ, MedImmune as well. So I think this particular deal is kind of reflective of the way in which we're trying to optimize the overall return on investment for the money that we invest in R&D.","Robert A. Bradway","As we said in our prepared remarks, the partner that we chose obviously has expertise in inflammation, in particular in asthma and GI. And so the portfolio of products that we're seeking to develop are ones that we think our skills are complementary with each other.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess, this is maybe best directed to Jonathan. We're accustomed to seeing Q1 as the weakest product sales quarter for Amgen. Any reason that won't be the case again this year? And then given the strong start to the year and the shrinking share count, can you help us understand a little bit more of the targets for SG&A and R&D in 2012? Any guidance there?","Jonathan M. Peacock","No. And I think I'd just reiterate, but I think we're off to a good start to the year. If we exclude ESA, the trajectory in Q4 and the rest of the portfolio was 13% growth year-on-year. In Q1, it was 17%, so we're seeing some good momentum. And Tony has given you some sort of -- some of the detail around what's driving that momentum. So I think, yes, this quarter is a strong one relative to Q1. It's normally one of the lighter quarters in the year, so that makes us feel good about the year ahead. And then on the cost structure, I think you can -- we've talked about cost of sales, there's a Puerto Rico impact, so the underlying cost is 15%. That was also a onetimer in terms of an inventory write-off. And then on R&D, I think there we've talked about the impact later in the year from the Phase III trials. And SG&A, we've been investing this quarter in SG&A in the DTC programs, both around Prolia and around Enbrel. We've continued to invest commercially in rolling out the business internationally. And as you probably saw in our press release, we had some benefit from an adjustment to the federal health care reform fee during the quarter. But overall, I feel we talked about keeping our costs in line with revenue growth over the year, and so far so good on that. And overall, we're well on track.","Robert A. Bradway","Tony, maybe you'd like to add a couple of thoughts, particularly about the trends in the first quarter sales.","Anthony C. Hooper","I would say when you look at the first quarter sales, there are a couple of things that one should actually keep in mind. Number one, we exited 2011 with a pretty good trend rate, which was as a result of the good marketing plans and the DTC programs that were in place, so there's a clear extrapolation of the good trend line running. Number two, a continued digging down into deep customer insight which has allowed us to really understand where to move the needle in terms of prescribers. And third but not last was a better and clear understanding of the need to effectively move through the reverification of insurance very quickly late in the fourth quarter into the first quarter, which resulted in a much lower slowdown of seasonality of our business as we go forward. So I think it's a combination of strategic execution, customer insight and really understanding the access environment a bit better now.","Robert A. Bradway","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sapna Srivastava with Goldman Sachs.","Sapna Srivastava - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I actually had a question on XGEVA. I just wanted to understand your comfort level with the guidance that you've given earlier on being $3 billion to $4 billion denosumab franchise and if you feel still comfortable with that looking at how Prolia and XGEVA are tracking.","Robert A. Bradway","Yes, let me -- it's Bob. I'll take the first part of that and then ask Tony to share his thoughts. Sapna, we're pleased with the progress that we're making generally with denosumab and more broadly pleased with the progress we're making towards the guidelines that we gave you last April. But rather than jump into specific guidance questions, maybe Tony you can give Sapna some perspectives on what you see with XGEVA here still on the early days of the launch.","Anthony C. Hooper","So let me talk to you about both these dmab products, and first of all, as I spend time with the oncology community, it's clear to me that the oncologists see XGEVA as a very important and differentiated product. And when I look at the actual growth, the growth is coming from both the growth of the SRE market of about 34% and XGEVA itself growing at about -- and owning about 47% of the market. So our growth of both the product and the market continues to deliver on our expectations. And all the feedback we've got from our physicians has been on track. As you know, we are in infancy in terms of our execution and launch in the international markets where we expect to see that happening later in 2012. Prolia continues to show dramatic growth in both the breadth of prescribers, as well as the depth of prescribers. And the new advertising campaign continues to deliver there. So as we continue, we're confident about the programs executing in the marketplace and confident about our ability to drive share and usage in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got one for Sean or Tony. So with the EVOLVE study and the KAI Pharma deal, you guys are investing pretty heavily in the renal space. And so 2 questions, one, should we continue to expect further investments in this space, either through deal wise or through internal? And then second, how big of an opportunity do you really see from the EVOLVE results, either in dollars or in patient numbers?","Robert A. Bradway","It sounds to me like there's a question in there for Tony. So Tony, why don't you respond?","Anthony C. Hooper","So we've obviously established on the last 20 years a very strong business in this particular therapeutic area. So we will continue to maintain our business as best we can and continue to look for opportunities to drive the franchise in this particular area. As regards EVOLVE, I think any product that shows cardiovascular endpoint improvement would be a dramatic opportunity for anyone in the marketplace.","Sean E. Harper","I'd just add, recall that there really have not been any product classes which convincingly have that effect in this population. For example, statins have never been able to show this kind of effect almost uniquely. They don't show it in this population. So it's a very high bar. If one were to actually get over that bar, it would certainly drive some interest in further utilization population.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So it's a question for Bob. Just to help us understand a little bit, how do you look at the international opportunity for Amgen? And kind of as you look at the strategy going forward, is there any specific market that you still are seeing an opportunity to bolster your presence or you're pretty comfortable with where you are so far?","Robert A. Bradway","International expansion is an important opportunity for growth for us. We've outlined our objective to be in 75 countries by 2015. We're in some 54 to 56 countries now. We have found that there is demand in those countries, as well as in the ones that we're seeking to enter prospectively for our innovative biologic medicines, and we're looking for attractive ways to enter this market. You noticed or you saw what we did last year in Brazil with the acquisition of Bergamo. We're pleased with the results there, pleased with the progress that we've made in launching our own proprietary medicines following the acquisition of that entity. So that's the type of deal that we think makes sense. Not surprisingly, when we look at the emerging markets that we've yet to establish a big presence in, they include the BRICS, with the S being South Korea, and then we include Turkey and Mexico as 2 that we think are important for us to have a presence in before we get to 2015. So Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Korea, Turkey, Mexico are key markets for us. In addition, unusually for a company of our size and scale, we don't have our own direct operating presence in Japan. We've had some very successful partnerships there through time. We have 3 partnerships there today, and we have some innovative medicines that we have not yet committed to any of those partnerships. And we're looking for the sensible ways for us to enter that market. We ran the experiment of trying to build the business organically in the past. We think there are some better ways to do that through creative partnerships. And the one that we struck with Takeda is an example, but we'll be looking for ways to develop our business in Japan over time as well. So again, international expansion and the delivery of innovative medicines in those markets is an important part of what we're going to try to achieve here over the next several years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just provide maybe a little bit more clarity around ESA weakness this quarter. When do you expect ESA to stabilize? It looked like they're continuing to fall pretty rapidly.  And did the EPO launch trigger any changes that might have contributed to the weakness?","Robert A. Bradway","Tony, why don't you share your thoughts?","Anthony C. Hooper","So as I've said in my prepared remarks, the EPOGEN business is left out in transition and it's been difficult to predict. But we do believe that any dramatic further decline in the hemoglobin levels will result in increased transfusions. I think we'll continue to be impacted adversely by label and reimbursement changes and, of course, peginesatide launches today, so we should continue to see some volatility. But I would mention that we are cautious of new competition, but ready to compete in the marketplace as the new products come in. I think we have confident about the established track record of EPOGEN and believe its dosing frequency is well suited to the dialysis setting. In addition, EPOGEN has established a safety profile, developed over more than 20 years of experience and 1.8 million patients. I'd remind you again that we have long-term contracts, an exclusive one with DaVita for 7 years and a nonexclusive contract with FMC. And these 2 providers account for 70% of our EPOGEN business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask you a question again on EVOLVE studies. So it seems to me the focus is really the [indiscernible] improvement that we are looking at. So my understanding is this study is designed to show -- how to show 20% improvement in all cardio mortality and cardio morbidity. So the question is, what level of -- more a quantified way and what level of market penetration do you expect to achieve, if Sensipar shows 20% improvement in the study from current about 25% penetration in dialysis patient?","Robert A. Bradway","Okay, there's quite a few questions in there. I think you're asking us to speculate on what reaction will be if we are able to generate statistically significant improvements in the large Phase III clinical trial. Tony, I think you touched on it earlier, but why don't you just repeat our view of what the opportunity is to demonstrate cardiovascular mortality and morbidity improvement in this setting?","Anthony C. Hooper","So Sensipar itself continues to deliver value to patients, but the market share we hold was not totally saturated. So there's already existing potential to grow the market with the existing patient population. But I would believe that, that should we be able to show some type of cardiovascular outcome benefit, there would be an increased demand for the product demand in the marketplace, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So question on Neulasta, another product that's been doing from a unit growth perspective. Could you update us on where first in every cycle penetration is right now, kind of how quickly are gaining share there? And are there particular parts of the market that are underpenetrated, either patients, physicians, payer segments, just so we can comfort around the sustainability of that unit growth?","Anthony C. Hooper","So the last data I saw was the average chemo cycle in the U.S. runs to about 7 cycles. And then our data is showing that we're getting Neulasta use in about 4.3 of those. So there continues to be a fairly large potential growth opportunity as we go forward. As you look through usage versus non-usage, it's a bit like looking at compliance. There's no real demographic reason for usage, non-usage. It's spread across the entire population. We have physicians using, some are not using it in the first cycle, going onto second cycle, not taking all cycles. So we continue to focus down customer-by-customer trying to understand prescribing behavior, prescribing practice and then focus the education and message clearly around the behavior we're seeing in the marketplace to try and make sure that patients are given this product when they have threat of febrile neutropenia in the first cycle and all the cycles as much as possible.","Robert A. Bradway","And the other big picture thing to remember here, Marshall, is there are still tens of thousands of patients admitted to hospital every year in the U.S. with febrile neutropenia, and some 1 in 9 of those patients die in the hospital of complications, including the complication of febrile neutropenia. So this is -- continues to be an area of high-end unmet medical need. And in fact, the Center for Disease Control has made this a focus of their communication effort with patients and caregivers to help them understand the importance of trying to prevent infections for patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. So this is an important disease state and one that we're continuing to try to do everything we can to serve patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Revi Mehrotra with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Relates to the FMC and DaVita deals that you mentioned before. I think you'd highlighted that there are some discounts and rebates involved in those deals. Could you give us any granularity on those discounts and rebates?","Robert A. Bradway","We're not going to talk about the specifics in the contract. What we've said and what I think is in the public filings of the 2 large dialysis operators is that the discounts are less than what was in place previously. But we're not going to get into the specific details of the contracts at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a simple R&D question. Sean, you mentioned an interim look for T-Vec at year end. Question is, is that a futility analysis? And if not, why was it designated as a prespecified interim work?","Sean E. Harper","It's a good question. It is not specifically designed as a futility analysis. And it was just written into the protocol, which is under SPA with FDA as an interim. It doesn't have a purpose specified to it actually in the protocol. I think that the view perhaps was that the data would be informative. Remember, this is an open label trial, and so it's possible in theory to look at the data on a kind of continuous basis. So in many cases, when that condition exists and you want to kind of control the amount of time that people are actually looking at the data, you actually set an interim analysis in place in order to have some kind of control over the study.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein.","Aleksandr Rabodzey","It's Aleks here for Geoff. Just have a few question on the rest of the pipeline, the oncology business, the solid tumors. You guys didn't talk much about the pancreatic cancer drug, the ovarian cancer drug. Is there any update there? What's your view on their potential, anything we should be expecting?","Sean E. Harper","Again, a good question. I suppose as these projects move through their life cycles, there are times where there's sort of no news as good news. I think right now they're kind of no news as good news. Those programs, AMG 386 in ovarian cancer, AMG 479 in pancreatic cancer are actually progressing either on or ahead of schedule. But we're in a stage right now where you're really enrolling patients, accruing endpoints. No data available yet. So that's why they didn't kind of call them out. But they're moving along very nicely. We continue to be optimistic about both programs.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of John Sonnier with William Blair.","John S. Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So my question is on blinatumomab. Just wondering what we should expect this year in the way of visibility? At Micromet, we are hoping for some insight into durability or retreatment data from the ongoing Phase II.","Sean E. Harper","Yes, I think that there are plans to have additional data available at appropriate scientific meetings this year from those type of studies, and so I hope we'd be able to continue with that. So to my knowledge, we're planning essentially the same schedule of presentation and data from the studies that Micromet had planned before the acquisition.","Arvind Sood","Excellent. Thank you, Sean. Bob, do you want to make any some closing comments?","Robert A. Bradway","Once again, thanks for your attention and your interest in Amgen. We're pleased with the results from the first quarter, and Arvind and his team will be here if there are any questions that you didn't get a chance to ask during the conference call. So again, thanks very much for your interest. Thank you, everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect."]}}
