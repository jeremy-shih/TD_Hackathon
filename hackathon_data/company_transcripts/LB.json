All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Amie Preston, Chief Investor Relations Officer for L Brands. Please go ahead.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thank you, Carmen. And good morning everyone and welcome to L Brands third quarter earnings conference call for the period ending Saturday, November 1, 2014. As a matter of formality, I need to remind you that any forward-looking statements we may make today are subject to our Safe Harbor statement found in our SEC filings. Our third quarter earnings release and related financial information are available on our website, www.lb.com. Also available on the website is an investor presentation which we will be referring to during this call. Stuart Burgdoerfer, EVP and CFO; Sharen Turney, CEO of Victoria’s Secret, Nick Coe, CEO of Bath & Body Works, and Martin Waters, President of International all are joining us today. After our prepared comments, we'll be available to take your questions for as long as time permits. So that we can speak with as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.",
            "Thanks, and now I’ll turn the call over to Stuart.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were very sold and represented a record for the company. Total sales increased 7%, comps increased 5% on top of a 3% increase last year, and operating income dollars increased 35%. Earnings per share increased 42% to $0.44 versus $0.31 last year.",
            "As you know holiday in the fourth quarter are critical representing over half of our earnings for the year. While we have momentum in our business and we are well positioned, last holiday was challenging. Therefore we remain focused on the execution of retail fundamentals and we will continue to manage the business discipline.",
            "Turning to our third quarter results in more detail. Total sales increased 7% to $2.319 billion and comps increased 5%. The gross margin rate increased by 130 basis points to 40.8% driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate and slight buying and occupancy leverage.",
            "The SG&A rate improved by 110 basis points to 28.6%. Operating income dollars increased by 35% driven by our growth in all three of our major segments and our operating income rate increased by 260 basis points to 12.3%. Earnings per share increased 42% to $0.44.",
            "Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8, retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 12% versus last year, we’re very comfortable with our inventory positions. They are clean and in good shape.",
            "Turning to Page 11 of the presentation, our guidance for the fourth quarter is consistent with our prior year. As previously announced our full year forecast includes a negative impact of about $0.10 to $0.12 from the exit of certain apparel merchandise and make-up, and about $0.05 of incremental non-operating expense, primarily interest, for a total of $0.15 to $0.17 of pressure. Importantly, we expect a more significant impact from the exit of apparel of Victoria's Secret Direct in the fourth quarter. We have sold through the majority of this product so the magnitude of the sales decline will increase in the fourth quarter. Whereas direct sales increased by 2% in the third quarter, our expectations is that sales will decrease in the high single digit range in the fourth quarter which will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.05. ",
            "For the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per share between $1.61 and $1.71 against last year's $1.65 result. Our fourth quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect fourth quarter gross margin rate to increase primarily driven by improvement in the merchandise margin rate. We also expect the SG&A rate to increase primarily driven by forecasted increase in incentive compensation as last year's payout was below target.",
            "Non-operating expenses consisting principally of interest expense are projected at about $80 million in the fourth quarter. Our projected tax rate is 38% and our weighted average shares outstanding are forecasted at about 299 million. We expect to end the fourth quarter with inventory per square foot down in the mid to high single digit range to last year. For the full year, we are projecting positive low single digit comps, totals sales growth will be about two points higher than comps due to growth in square footage in our international business. We expect our full gross margin rate to be up to last year and the SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2014 to be between $3.21 and $3.31 per share. ",
            "We are projecting 2014 CapEx of about $750 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores, remainder relate to investment in technology, logistics and facilities. As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by just over 5% this year driven by expansions of existing VS stores and the opening of 33 news PINK stores and 20 Victoria's Secret stores. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%. ",
            "Turning to liquidity. We expect 2014 operating cash flow of $1.5 to $1.6 billion and free cash flow of about $750 million to $850 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividend. Our free cash flow and cash position along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.",
            "Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen.",
            "Sharen Turney ",
            "Thank you, Stuart. And good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results are detailed on Page 14 of your presentation materials. The Victoria’s Secret segment grew both sales and operating income in the third quarter. Total sales increased 6% and comp sales increased 3% on top of 4% last year with operating income increasing $40.7 million or 27% and our operating income rate increased 220 basis points. Merchandise margin dollars and rate for the segment increased with the strength in the store channel offsetting the impact discontinued apparel merchandise in the direct channel. We also finished the quarter with inventories down double digit to last year.",
            "Now let me give you a recap of each channel, starting with the stores. In the stores channel, third quarter sales increased 7% and comps were up 3%. Operating income increased over 30%. Sales growth was driven by lingerie and PINK, our beauty business was down from last year reflecting the impact of the exiting the make-up category. We were very focused in our core categories and therefore have had solid momentum in bras, panties and fragrance, complimented by strong growth in PINK loungewear and sport. The stores merchandise margin rates increased during the quarter, we continue to focus on the fundamental of frugal expense and inventory management as a result SG&A expense leveraged versus last year while buying and occupancy held flat.",
            "Now turning to direct. Or third quarter results reflects our strategy to exit non-core apparel category. Third quarter sales were up 2%. The merchandise margin rates were down and the operating income rate declined slightly. Merchandise margin dollar and operating income dollars were roughly flat to last year. Our strategy to distort the direct channel to core category where we have our best growth opportunities is working. Collectively, sales in bras, panties, PINK, sport, beauty and lounge were all up in mid teen. And the merchandise margin increased during the quarter. These results were partially offset by the exit of non- go forward apparel merchandize. ",
            "As we transition to the fourth quarter, we are excited about our upcoming launches and product offering. We have strong assortment still with both self purchase and getting opportunity for the holiday and we are looking forward to provide our customers with excellent in-store and online experiences. However, as Stuart mentioned earlier, we are sold through the majority of our non-core apparel in direct, as a result we expect to see a high single digit sales decline in direct in the fourth quarter. ",
            "Following Black Friday weekend, we are very excited for the Victoria's Secret fashion show which will be held in London this year, and will air on December 9th featuring musical performances by Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Ariana Grande, and Hozier.",
            "In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We know that the majority of the season is ahead of us. Therefore, while we are cautiously optimistic, we know that we must remain intensely focused on our customer and execute the fundamental in order to deliver our goal.",
            "Thank you. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick. ",
            "Nick Coe",
            "",
            "Thanks, Sharen, and good morning everyone. At Bath and Body Works, we were pleased with our third quarter results where we were able to grow sales and increase earnings versus our record performance last year. While effectively managing inventory levels about flat to last year.",
            "Total sales for the quarter was $650 million, up 9% or $53 million to last year, comps increased 7% on top of 2% last year. The overall assortments of shop activity were able to drive sales growth in the competitive retail environment. We continue to be pleased with our -- with the customers acceptance of product newness across our three key businesses, our signature collection product line, the Soap and Sanitizers business, and our Home Fragrance assortments.",
            "For the quarter, operating income was $93 million, up 30% from last year, operating income as a percentage of sales were 14.2% in the quarter and with that 230 basis points for last year driven by expense leverage and improvements in merchandise margin rate. ",
            "We were also pleased with the performance of the BBW direct channel during the quarter. Total sales were up 16% and operating income grew significantly versus last year. Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we are excited about the holiday assortment and the confidence in our approach following a disappointing fourth quarter last year. We will leverage our read and react capabilities, provide a world class in-store experience and reestablish ourselves as the Christmas destination by celebrating the moment better through the floor sets and activities.",
            "We will flow newness throughout the quarter beginning this month with our newest signature fragrance launch a Thousand Wishes along with new seasonal fragrances in our three key businesses. Our inventories are well positioned heading into the quarter, and are flexible enough to react to customers' preferences, expenses are well managed but we will continue to take the appropriate investments to drive growth in our business. ",
            "With that I'll turn the discussion over to Martin. ",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our international segment. We continue to be pleased with our results and progress. Reported revenue increased by 34% to $80 million and operating income increased 60% to $16.1 million. The operating income rate increased to 20.1%. You will recall that results in this segment include both our wholly owned UK business and the majority is in our franchise model in other geographies. ",
            "At Victoria's Secret international, we continue to be pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. In the UK, our London flagship stores on Bond Street continued its exceptional performance and we've begun construction to expand the store. Our eight mall locations are also doing well and we will be opening one more store this year in the UK.",
            "Elsewhere in the world the eight stores under our Alshaya partnership continue to do very well and we will be opening another seven stores this year across the Middle East region. ",
            "Our Victoria’s Secret beauty and accessories business continues to progress well, and we ended the quarter with 245 stores open and we are on schedule for just under 300 stores by the end of 2014. We are also on track to open nine VSBA stores in China in January. As a reminder, all of our VSBA stores are franchised.",
            "In Bath & Body Works International, we are now to 67 stores outside of North America, again all franchised. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the business and will open another 18 stores this year.",
            "It's peak season right now so we are focused on slow execution. That's all from international. With that I'll say thank you and turn it back over to Amie. ",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Martin. That concludes our prepared comments, and at this time we’d be happy to take your questions. Please as a reminder and in the interest of time and consideration to other, please limit yourself to one question. And with that I'll turn it back over to Carmen.",

            "Jennifer Davis",
            "Hey, good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Bond Street store. Can you remind us when you started construction there and is it having any impact on the margins in your international division and when you expected to open. Thanks.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Yes, I'll take that one. So we started construction about three months ago. It did having an impact on business not much. We have some hoardings up inside the store which has meant that we have to give over some space to the construction project. But most customers wouldn't notice the difference. So a few less fitting rooms but it is not really noticeable to the human eye. Does it have an impact to our margin? No. But we did take some accelerated depreciation nothing particularly significant. The new space will open in three separate -- at three separate times. The first amount of space will come to is just before Christmas this year. Then we will get another amount in early spring and then the final reveal will be sometime in April, May of 2015. ",

            "Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great job in the third quarter. Not sure who I'd direct the question to but my question is on the VS Direct side. Understand the exiting of certain businesses and packs of sales for Q4. How should we think about how the trajectory VS direct into the first half of next year, the go forward categories are growing nicely but when do we finally get clean-- clean up to really see that number go in the right direction and also how do we think about the international opportunity with e-commerce kind of ramping up as well. Thank you.",
            "Sharen Turney",
            "Hi, Ike. It's Sharen. Thank you very much. We will continue to go up against the non-go forward apparel business offer to spring season. So we will -- and we will not finish anniversarying this probably until next October. Obviously, we feel strong about our strategy and think that we can offset some, maybe all of that apparel business as we go forward with the shared categories and manage the strategy. As we think about the international opportunity, we've already put things in place to help us to better service our international customers through our domestic website. We do believe that's an opportunity and something that we can talk more about in 2015. ",

I was wondering, at the analyst day you talked about doing a better job on the BBW promos in the third quarter. Is there potential for this in the fourth quarter also and maybe if you could talk a little bit about clearing that up thanks.",

            "Sure, yes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how your changing up the BBW promos? It sounds like you had a much better job in the third quarter and do you see those opportunities in the fourth quarter? Thanks",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Sure. Based on the customers' acceptance to product and the trend that we were on during the last few months, particularly from late spring, it is allowed us to pull promotions back slightly so we have been slightly less promotional than we were last year which is a good thing. And this helps from the margin rates and just from the brand equity perspective. As we go into the fourth quarter, it will be a comp, we are planning at this juncture for to be a comfortable level of promotional activity, but expressed in a different way so it feel different to her so it should be comparable amount but feel difference in terms of cut through as we think about how promotional the market place is going to be at that time.

Would you anticipate a nice uptick in performance from that? And can you --really about fulfillment, can you handle fulfillment of that out of Columbus? What plans are you considering on a go forward basis as they are progresses and when would you all look to turn on e-commerce in local language as well? Thanks. ",

            "Hi, good morning, everyone. Sharen, you talked little bit about the exit of makeup. And I was just wondering if you could remind us where were at in terms of the beauty business, in terms of the margin opportunity for the beauty business? How much margin opportunity potential do we have going into this holiday season and then maybe next year to improve profitability there? And then when you think about core drivers of the beauty business going into holiday season, can you maybe just talk about what you are most excited about? Thank you.",
            "Sharen Turney",
            "Number one is that we have a very large profitable beauty business today. And as we think about the opportunities that we have go forward, our total focus is on fine fragrance. And we have seen increases within our fine fragrances; our launches have been bigger and better than they ever had been. So we are excited about the opportunities as we go forward. When I think about the core drivers going into this holiday, number one is going to be all the new fragrances that we have launched, plus the fragrances that have been in our foundation. And when I think about those fragrances such Tease, Dream Angel, those that we are actually seeing some high single digit, double digit increases in those fragrances plus the new fragrances which we just launched Scandalous, which was the largest fragrance launch we ever had. So we feel very confident in terms of that business as we go forward. The second core business that we have is the gifting business. And gifting business is always a little hard to predict as that it really happened in the last -- in the first three weeks and going into the last week of Christmas. So we have some early indictors but we are still cautiously optimistic as we think about going into the holiday season. ",

            "",
            "Great, thank you, good morning. Terrific third quarter here. Stuart, it seems like the third quarter profitability has really moved meaningfully higher as the revenue in the quarter has gone from about $2 billion a few years ago to $2.3 billion. Your operating income in the quarter has almost doubled with that, it would seem only 15% move higher in the revenue picture. So I'm wondering is it just that you're better able to flow more of the incremental revenue to the bottom line in the quarter, better able to cover your fixed expenses? Or have you taken a different philosophy to sort of expense management and really tightening up the P&L?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Kimberly. To be honest I wouldn't say that there is different philosophy on third quarter expenses. I think as you mentioned in your question, it is really been driven by revenue growth and healthy margins, merchandise margins in the third quarter. You are right to point out that we've grown the revenue and the profit in the third quarter meaningfully over the last few years. Sharen or Nick could elaborate on this, but one of the things that the business is trying to do is to make the most of all meaningful selling periods including those out of traditional holiday, and I think the business did some very smart things. VS and BBW, this third quarter should drive volume and profit, but in terms of -- is there a different philosophy or mindset around expenses in the third quarter versus the rest of the year, no. It is managed -- obviously expenses with discipline and forcing trade off but I wouldn't say there is anything unique in the third quarter with respect to that. It's really been about volume and trying to make create events and maximize sales and margin in the third quarter. ",

            "Sure. We haven't really moved the needle a lot in terms of full assortment PINK in Victoria's Secret stores, where the opportunity has been -- have we actually moved the PINK into freestanding real estate. So today we have -- when we think about more than 800 stores do not carry all of the lingerie assortment and more than 650 stores do not carry all of the PINK assortment. Now we have grown the PINK real estate by opening up the fourth PINK, the pre standing PINK stores. When I think about the sport business, we will have the full assortments in about 181 stores per fall and then we have the bra assortment just a very small bra assortment in the rest of the all stores. But it is someway about a cabin to two cabin. And we do believe that there is a lot of opportunity. So therefore you can surmise by that we proven with the real estate expansion that we have been able to grow the business and return on investment. And we are not seen the end of the light of the tunnel yet and still look forward to these opportunities that we do have in front of us. ",

As we think about our stores and our selling associates is that obviously we want everyone everybody have to careers with Victoria's Secret and they are, we are so fortunate to have such passionate sales associate. When we think about productivity, we really do measure by our spot [ph] though selling productivity per average hour. And really looking at how do we make sure that we have our best people and most productive people where we have the most traffic. And if something that we have the capability of measuring, we have the capability of tracking our sales associate that sale, therefore we can coach them, and we can ask them what new more training if they need so that we can give them the tool necessary to help them to be more productive. And it's an ongoing initiative and we are just at the very beginning at the beginning of the beginning and as you know that at this time of year, it is holiday, we start to hire new seasonal people so we started at, we are going to kind of continue to play with it through holiday but then it will be even more in detailed manner we will talk for spring 2015.

So I think the question is less about how much faster can we go and the question for us is probably how much more breadth of assortment that we are able to put on to that speed model that will allow us to have a greater degree of the business being fast versus the business being faster if that make any sense.

And I'm wondering if you could just kind of give us some guidance in terms of how we should think about modeling each of those revenue streams? Because if you look at the sequential pattern of margins, you've been down obviously up significantly year-over-year, but you've been down sequentially.

And but really the key source of input if you will would be our guidance that we, Martin gave few weeks ago at our annual update about our growth in stores. And then again understanding the sources of revenue and the margin profile, the franchise business which is different than company owned business.

Obviously there has been pressure generally speaking related to business in Canada, some pressure economically on the business, it has been partly offset by some favorability at least in some periods and related to the British pound.

So I would say I am cautiously optimistic and looking forward to the fourth quarter. As far as store in the US are concerned, this time last year we were expecting to open stores in 2014, holiday didn't go the way we wanted it to, so we cancel that and we said no we don't do it.

Years ago you earned just a few pennies in 3Q and now clearly you've grown 3Q to be much more important. And Stuart as you mentioned increasing volumes has been a part of that and your ability to leverage your speed model really seems to be at an inflection point. So I'm just wondering how your speed model is changing the way you think about quarterly contribution to full year sales and profits? And if you think it could shift at all over the next few years?",

            "Yes, I mean I don't -- while the speed initiative and the work that we have been describing to you over the last few years and Sharen and Nick commented on again today, that drives value throughout the year. Certainly and it is the start we share a few weeks ago going into the fall season being 90% open. This is on the 1st of August, we were 90% open for holiday business in terms of open to buy, that's a very powerful thing. But I wouldn't say that I think that benefits the third quarter more than it does to fourth quarter or the first quarter or the second quarter. Obviously, the bigger benefit would be where you do more business since and so the tool is an important one. But I think at the end of the day economically what's driven the significant improvement in the third quarter as we've done a nice job growing volume and we've done so with healthy margin rate, the speed tool in and of itself has application throughout the year.

            "Turning to the balance sheet on page 8, retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 10% versus last year. Inventories are clean and well positioned. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot down in the mid-single-digit range.",
            "Operating cash flow in 2014 was $1.786 billion. Free cash flow was $1.071 billion and capital expenditures were $715 million. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock this year for $84 million. As we announced earlier this month, our Board authorized a new $250-million share repurchase program, which included the $91 million remaining under the previous program.",
            "We also announced a 47% increase in our annual dividend to $2 per share and declared special dividend of $2 per share. The $2 special dividend and the quarterly dividend of $0.50 a share will be paid on March 6 to shareholders of record on February 20.",
            "Turning to page 11 of the presentation, our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we're taking to grow our business growth in Victoria's Secret real estate; increased store selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience; and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates.",
            "Our first quarter earnings forecast reflects a low- to mid-single-digit comp increase. It reflects an updated February comp forecast of up mid-single digits. We expect the first quarter gross margin rate to be about flat to last year. We expect some deleverage in the SG&A rate, driven primarily by an increase in marketing and store selling costs. We expect non-operating expense in the first quarter to be about flat to last year, at $80 million.",
            "We expect earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.55 in the first quarter, against last year's $0.53 result. This forecast includes a net negative impact of about $0.03 related to a decline in operating income at Victoria's Secret Direct, as we're lapping about $65 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel from last year. It also includes a negative $0.01 to $0.02 impact from foreign exchange.",
            "For the full year, we're projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 percentage point.",
            "We expect our full year gross margin rate to be about flat and the SG&A rate to be about flat to down slightly to last year. Non-operating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315 million; roughly flat to last year.",
            "Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07. We're forecasting weighted average shares of about 300 million in the first quarter and the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.45 and $3.65. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10 to $0.12.",
            "We're projecting 2015 capital spending between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.",
            "As detailed on page 13 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 5% this year, driven by expansions of existing VS stores and 26 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 24 net new openings and 90 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%.",
            "Turning to liquidity, we expect 2015 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.",
            "Thanks and now I will turn the discussion over to Sharen.",
            "Sharen Turney ",
            "Thank you, Stuart and good morning, everyone. 2014 was an important year for us, as we delivered positive results while also making significant changes to our Business. In 2014, we exited both the apparel and makeup businesses, which allowed us to focus more on our core and shared product offerings. We delivered strong growth in sales and profitability despite these headwinds.",
            "Now let's talk about our performance in Q4. The Victoria's Secret segment grew both sales and operating income. Total sales increased 5% to $2.4 billion. And comp sales increased 4%, on top of 2% last year, with operating income increasing $46 million or 10% and our operating income rate increasing 110 basis points. Merchandise margin dollars and rate for this segment increased, led by the growth in the stores channel. We also finished the quarter in good inventory position, down double digits per square foot to last year.",
            "Now let's turn to specific channel performance, starting with the stores. We're pleased with the fourth quarter, as sales and operating income both increased to record results. Entering the quarter with leaner inventory levels allowed us to read and react with speed and agility. It positioned us to be able to get back into trends more quickly, reducing markdowns.",
            "In addition, we executed a thoughtful approach to our promotions. As a result, this approach and leaner inventory levels allowed us to drive significant improvement in our margin rate. SG&A deleveraged, driven by higher incentive compensation and store selling costs. Volume and occupancy also deleveraged, driven by our continued investment in store real estate. Operating income in the quarter increased; a result of higher sales, coupled with margin rate expansion.",
            "Now turning to the direct channel. Our fourth quarter results continue to reflect our strategy to exit non-core apparel categories. Fourth quarter sales were down 2%, as we exited roughly $80 million of non-go-forward apparel sales in the fourth quarter of last year. Our strategy to distort to core categories where we have our best growth opportunities is working. Collectively, in sales in bras, panties, PINK, sport, beauty and lounge were up mid-teens.",
            "The merchandise margin rate was up during the quarter, as we continue to distort to the core. This increase was partially offset by the exit of non-go-forward apparel merchandise. Merchandise margin dollars were flat to last year. Operating income dollars and rate declined, driven by investments in our digital shopping experience and higher incentive compensation.",
            "Turning to our full year results, total Victoria's Secret segment sales increased 5% to $7.2 billion, operating income increased by $118 million to $1.3 billion and the operating income rate improved by 80 basis points to 17.6%. In the stores channel, comps increased 3%, with total store channel sales up 6%. The merchandise margin rate increased versus last year; as a result, operating income rate and dollars were up year over year.",
            "In the direct channel, sales were roughly flat. The merchandise margin rate declined, driven by the exit of non-go-forward apparel and expenses deleveraged. As a result, operating income rate in dollars were down. Looking ahead to 2015, we will continue our focused, fast, frugal approach, managing both inventory and expenses appropriately to optimize our Business. We're planning conservatively, while focusing on driving growth in our core categories and leveraging speed to read and react.",
            "As a reminder, we will continue to be up against the exits of non-go-forward apparel and makeup, which collectively represented roughly $185 million in sales in 2014. However, we're cautiously optimistic that we will maintain our positive trend. We're excited about our fashion offerings this season and feel good about our bra business in lingerie, sport and PINK. We're investing in real estate, store selling and digital enhancement to create an even better shopping experience for our customers. We have momentum across the brand, coming off holiday and heading into spring break, for both PINK and Victoria's Secret lingerie. Finally, we're very excited for the first-ever Victoria's Secret Swim Special, which will air tonight on CBS -- so make sure to tune in -- featuring musical performance by Maroon 5 and Juanes.",

            "Nick Coe",
            "Thanks, Sharen and good morning, everyone. At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our record results during the quarter, after a disappointing fourth quarter last year. We were able to drive significant growth in sales, while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down.",
            "Total sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 9% or $122 million to last year. Comps increased 8% and our direct channel sales grew at 25%. Sales were strong across the quarter and we were able to drive growth in each of our three key businesses, our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment.",
            "We were pleased with the customers' acceptance of our holiday assortment, the visual appeal of our stores and the in-store execution of our plans. We were looking to reestablish ourselves as the holiday destination by celebrating the moment better in our floor sets and in our activities. We believe that this approach helped drive a successful holiday period.",
            "The momentum from holiday continued with a strong semi-annual sale performance and a positive response to our early spring collections. Promotional activity was relatively flat to last year and we were able to execute a plan that balanced fewer and more impactful activities that generated a strong response from our customers. For the quarter, operating income was $449 million, up 13% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 110 basis points to 32%, driven by expense leverage and improvement in merchandise margin rates.",
            "We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel. Fourth quarter operating income grew significantly versus last year and annual sales went over $300 million.",
            "For FY ‘14, total sales grew by 7% versus last year and comps ended up 6%. Operating income was $737 million, up 14% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 120 basis points to 22%, driven by expense leverage and an improvement in merchandise margin rates. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2015, we will continue to leverage our read and react capabilities and provide a world-class in-store experience to our customers. We're optimistic about the trend of our Business and confident in our plans, but understand we need to keep getting better to win in a competitive retail environment.",
            "We will flow newness throughout the quarter, beginning this month with our Love and Sunshine theme, that features new and seasonal fragrances in our three key businesses. Our inventories are well positioned heading into the new year and are flexible enough to react to customers' preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, but we will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the Business.",
            "With that, I will turn the discussion over to Martin.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Thanks, Nick and good morning, everyone. As in previous calls, I shall give you a brief overview of our progress in the international businesses. As we all know, our opportunity for international growth is significant and we feel good about the strategic choices we made to be steady and purposeful, to pursue a test and learn philosophy that reflects the DNA of our Company.",
            "We made good progress in the fourth quarter and, as detailed on page 14 of your presentation, we opened 140 international locations in 2014 to end the year with 394 stores in the segment. For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 40% to $105.5 million and operating income increased 76% to $29.5 million.",
            "In 2014, revenue and profit from our Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works stores outside of North America grew substantially. Revenue increased by 51% to $335.9 million and operating income more than doubled to $78 million and 23.2% of revenue.",
            "At Victoria's Secret International, we're pleased with the performance of our full-assortment stores. In the UK, we continue to be very pleased with our London flagship store on Bond Street, as well as our nine mall stores. We will open another four stores in the UK this year. In the Middle East, we now have 13 Victoria's Secret stores and one PINK store open under our partnership with Alshaya. We continue to be delighted with the results and will open another 8 to 10 stores this year.",
            "Staying with Victoria's Secret, our Victoria's Secret beauty and accessories business continues to progress well, with 290 locations open at the end of the year, about a third of which are in airports. We've opened nine VSBA stores in China and are pleased with the results. Mexico is also looking promising, with 14 local-market VSBA stores now open. We will open another 120 stores or so across the globe in 2015.",
            "Turning to Bath & Body Works, we now have 80 BBW stores under our franchise partnerships and we continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores, with notable openings in southeast Asia and Latin America in 2014. We expect to open another 50 or so BBW franchise stores in the year ahead.",
            "So in summary, a good year for international in 2014 and we remain focused on the fundamentals, great execution of our brands wherever we go.",

            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So, on the guidance, what's reflected in what we shared externally would be target or slightly below target incentive comp assumption. Obviously, based on the results that we achieved in 2014, our payouts were -- given that they are performance-based, were meaningfully above the par target or the base target. In terms of quantification, Tom, we want to be thoughtful about how we do that, but there is some upside obviously and it's not insignificant in the 2015 guidance related to IC.",

            "Sharen Turney ",
            "Thank you, Anne. I'm very pleased with the performance that we really have made in speed. And this year, it's interesting -- is we're really focused even taking out more on terms of the front-end product development process, in terms of being able to identify things even later to get them into work later to get closer to the customer.",
            "We were fortunate that we bypassed all the west coast strikes because we made decisions to air everything. We will continue to air everything in. So, I think that we still have opportunity to get better and better, in terms of our speed initiatives as we go forward. But the primary focus now is really on the front end.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "We've made obviously significant progress and where we're really thinking the opportunity for the future will continue to be with the breadth of the assortment that we can get onto the speed model. Also, looking at the home business and thinking about the growth that we see in home and how do we make sure that we're seeing that shift also into the speed aspect of that. And then, really, trying to do what we did last year, which was reap the business, react to the best full-price selling area and make sure we're using the speed model to speed into the stuff that is obviously selling well and got the higher margin. So, we will continue to focus on that.",

            "Kimberly Greenberger",
            "I just wanted to follow up on the progress on speed in the supply chain as well. Nick, maybe you could start by sharing with us the percentage of your current inventory or maybe 2014 inventory that was on a four- to six-week lead time. And do you have annual targets for migrating a certain percentage of your inventory to those faster lead times?",
            "And if Sharen could give us any similar data that you might have to share on your panty category or your bra category, or any other data that we could -- that would help us understand where you are today and the annual progress we could see. Thanks.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "To me, the question is more about our breadth of the assortment and less about the inventory because, as you know, we keep our open-to-buys very, very open, which allows us to be as nimble as we can. So, to me, it's the breadth of assortment that we can get into the speed model, so that we've got a broader chance of reading and reacting to a broader selection of product that would then allow us to actually shift the inventory to match that.",
            "So, in terms of percentages, I'm not going to go into the percentages, but the breadth continues to grow of things that we can get into the pipeline on a faster basis, so that we can react to the Business. That was an important piece of why we had a good fourth quarter -- that we had a slightly broader amount and we were able to chase into it.",
            "Sharen Turney ",
            "I would say there are similar things, Kimberly, in terms of Victoria's Secret. It's interesting, each category has different characteristics. We're very fast in panties and continue to get faster in panties and basically almost all of our panties today are on some kind of speed program. And those speed programs allow us to read the business on a Monday and be back in stock in the stores within 15 to 25 days. So, we continue to hone in, in terms of making sure our toolboxes that we put together with our vendors are important.",
            "We continue to think about the bra business, which obviously has a little bit more complexity to it. That's probably an understatement. And we have worked very hard, both in the PINK and lingerie business, to be able to read those businesses on a Monday and to get back into the stores within four weeks. We continue to think about different ways and how we can even improve our opportunities across all categories. And as I said earlier, the opportunity as well is how we can even shorten our development time.",
            "Now, we've already taken probably four months out of our development time and believe there is probably another two months to continue to work in as we go into 2015. We've done that work and so we're in the piloting stage of that work for this year; very excited about the opportunities. And it really takes a strong partnership with our vendor and supply base. We're very fortunate to have a lot of strength in our supply base and with our partners.",

            "You guys had a stellar holiday; congrats. As you think about this and you post-game, as you always do, where would you articulate some of the bigger surprises were in terms of potential opportunities, acknowledging it was excellent across the banner? And then, Stuart, just a modeling question, so, the comp guidance for low to mid and full year at low -- is that expected to sequentially moderate towards the back half? I know you're generally very conservative in your guidance and your inventory planning. Thanks.",
            "Sharen Turney ",
            "In holiday, there were really not a lot of surprises in terms of how we were thinking about approaching the Business. I think that the holiday season is really just one of promotion out there, starting from the weekend before Thanksgiving, all the way through Christmas. We decided that we just did not want to continue to play in that; that we feel that more emotion is better than promotion. I think even the consumer is seeing a fatigue in promotion.",
            "The opportunity to win even earlier in the holiday season, whether it's the first part of November, continues to be an opportunity for us. We had a stellar record Black Friday. So, I can't tell you that there was really any surprises for us. We were fortunate to pull back on some promotions. And then, therefore, I think the real opportunity, as we continue to think about holiday 2015, again, is how do we get more emotion, better products, better fashion, more covetable items. And I think that's what the customer is yearning for, versus just this continued [inaudible] it out into the promotional world.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Hey, Oliver. The big learning or surprise for us -- less of a surprise, more of a learning -- was we expected and it happened, which was the peaks and troughs associated with November -- her reacting, her behavior in November and reacting to the dynamic of the marketplace and the necessity to purchase in that period. And then, obviously, the trough of early December and the great build in late December.",
            "And then, the second thing is I think we're really seeing how savvy she is, as it relates to leveraging the promotional activity that is out there and figuring out how to really take advantage of it. And we were able to do the same as Victoria's Secret, which was not fall into the overtly promotional activity on an omnipresent basis, but really leverage it at the right times and really leverage it with the traffic that came or didn't come at the right time of the year.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Oliver, as you mentioned in your question, we plan our Business conservatively. We do that so that we manage inventories well and expenses well. And then, we work like heck, obviously, to do better than that. In terms of sequentially or variation across the quarters, as we outlined in the guidance remarks, the comp assumption in the Q1 guidance is low to mid and for the whole year is low.

So, I believe that this is an opportunity for us to come out strong to own the spring season.

And I would say, everywhere that we've opened it, it works. It's the simplest of all of our businesses to scale internationally. So, I think it's just a logical progression that we start to speed up the rate of expansion a little bit. I would say, as I always do, in international, the rate-determining step is the availability of the right real estate. We could go faster with the wrong real estate and we don't think it's the right thing to do.",

Obviously, as we always do, we will look at results and we will adjust either up or down, more activity or less, more investment or less, depending on results. But I would say that 2015 numbers are largely baked at this point.",

After we see what our viewership is tonight and what the acceptance is -- we will be waiting and seeing. There is always many opportunities for us, but I think it's how much exposure, what is the right balance and we want to see what happens tonight.",

            "Sharen Turney ",
            "Yes, we're very excited and very pleased with our sport business, especially in our bra category. That's where we've been putting a lot of our emphasis and seeing tremendous growth there. We will have a full assortment in about 189 stores. We're very excited about this category. It's one of the fastest-growing categories in the direct channel as well and this is something that is helping them to offset their apparel business. Our biggest challenge in terms of how fast we can grow our sport business is just real estate. As we continue to optimize our real estate and as we move as we go forward -- we're going slow to go fast. And as you see us expand our stores, you will see the expansion in the 150 stores we're expanding this spring season. We will be expanding our sport presentation, opportunity for growth, very focused on the bra business and excited to see how big we can make this category.",

            "Nick, just given the ongoing improvements and the opportunities you've addressed, can you quantify a longer-term BBW operating margin target? And then, Stuart, what's the right way to think about the other op income line, just recognizing the margin contraction this year? Thanks.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "I think the way we're looking at our Business currently is that we've got pretty healthy margin rates and we've made a significant amount of product upgrades. And the result of that has been -- we've built customer loyalty and we're pretty happy with where we're. I think the opportunity for us is less about that and more about continuing to drive top line and any opportunity we get to reinvest back into the product, because where we've seen quality improvements, we've seen customer ship go with that. We've seen product acceptance go with that and we know that builds loyalty. So, I think the longer-term play is more about -- can we continue to drive top line and less about margin opportunity.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "With respect to the other segment, in terms of our view for 2015, we think it will be pretty consistent, in overall result, with the result in 2014.",

            "I would like to talk about Victoria's Secret margins versus the store. What was the effect on operating margins of vacating the apparel and makeup categories? And could you remind us qualitatively where the margins were in VSD three and five years ago versus today? And then, Nick, would you comment on margins in BBW versus the stores? And is there any chance you would ever bring that business in-house? I think you are still using a third-party provider for fulfillment?",
            "Sharen Turney ",
            "Between Victoria's Secret Direct and the beauty business, for the fall season, it was about $80 million in operating income that we obviously offset and then grew on top of that. So, that was the magnitude of the operating income for that time frame. When I think about -- when you go back and you look at Victoria's Secret Direct three to five years ago, direct has been, on an operating income basis, between 20% and 21%. So, this fall season they dipped. But I believe that we have the opportunity -- now, again, we're going to go up against $189 million in sales this year -- I think we have the opportunity easily to get back to those numbers.",
            "And then, I think the other thing is that the opportunity to really grow to go forward. It will be easier for us, from a margin perspective and operating income, especially in the fall season where we took our markdowns -- so, I see opportunity. But three to five years ago, direct was sitting between the 20% and 21%, depending on the year.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Fortuitously, we're in a good place from an operating margin perspective because that channel operates at or above the store, so there's no need to worry about moving stuff around. As it relates to outsourcing, we're pretty comfortable with where we're currently, but we're always assessing and looking at different opportunities. And as the Business grows and it continuously grows, who knows? But at this juncture, no plans for that.",

            "A question for Stuart, can you go over the puts and takes of the gross margin guidance and how we should be thinking about the different divisions? And then, with regards to the inventory turns over the last five years -- done a great job of getting that 1 turn plus up. Do you think we have another opportunity to get another full turn out of the business in the next five years? How should we be thinking about inventory turn potential going forward? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So, in terms of the components of the gross margin rate and as we're thinking about 2015, we think that there is slight opportunity or a small opportunity in terms of improvement of the rate. As we think that through -- by way of reminder, the foreign currency impact is a drag on the merchandise margin rate in 2015. But with that as a headwind, if you will, we think there is slight opportunity in merchandise margin rate. And as you know, based on our investments in stores, the B&O dollar increase is beyond a low single-digit percentage increase; so, a little bit of deleverage on B&O.",
            "In terms of further opportunity to improve turn, it's not going to be at the same level that we've accomplished over the last few years. We're in business to sell stuff, obviously and we want to make sure that we're in stock at the right depth at the point of sale. We sell high-margin goods; and being in stock is really important to our customers.",
            "With that said, are we always looking to get a little bit better and push and understand trade-offs and further leverage what we're doing with respect to reducing lead times and speed? Absolutely. But, again, in terms of magnitude of opportunity, there is some, but not at the same level that we have seen over the last three, four, five years.",

            "Omar Saad",
            "Looking through your slide deck, one of the things that jumped out at me the most was, especially on the U.S. side, the Victoria's Secret side, the difference between expected store count growth and the selling square foot growth. I think one is 2% and the other is 5% -- obviously implying significantly larger stores in the offing.",
            "Can you help us understand your strategies around store size and how you are thinking about that, especially since this seems to be coming at a time when you are also seeing your direct business having finally been cleaned up and the core of the direct business really starting to grow very nicely. Just want to understand in context how you are thinking about store size versus direct and if that also applies globally or across the other brands? Thanks.",
            "Sharen Turney ",
            "Omar, today, our average store selling square footage has been about 6,000 square feet. We believe that our average selling square feet, depending on the market, probably needs to almost be double that. When you think about the opportunities in growth that we have in PINK and the productivity that we're doing in PINK, we think that there is huge upside in that category. That is where we've been investing a lot of our real state growth. But at the same time, we're still under space in terms of Victoria's Secret lingerie.",
            "And we probably quoted these numbers before, that 80% of our stores don't have the full assortment of PINK and don't have the full assortment of Victoria's Secret lingerie. So, these larger square footage stores gives us the opportunity not only to do Victoria's Secret lingerie correctly, it gives us the opportunity to do PINK correctly. And then the two emerging categories, when you think about sport and swim.",
            "So, we're at a great place today, in the fact that we have more proven ideas than we have real state to support them. So, this real estate and bigger store gives us that opportunity. As we have learned over the last three years, with the bigger real estate, not only have we grown square footage, we've also grown productivity in these larger square foot stores.",
            "Now, we're very cautious; we don't want to overbuild the square footage and therefore, it gives us excitement and opportunity to grow the categories. And just as I spoke a little bit about the sport business earlier, we only really have real state in 189 stores out of the 1,049 that we have, to actually do sport and to do sport well. I'm excited about this. It's the right strategy and I honestly wish I could go faster.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Sure. Outside of North America, as you would expect, our approach to real estate is substantially similar to that, that we see in the U.S.. Of course, we size the stores to the size of the market opportunity.",
            "So, what you see in Victoria's Secret international is larger stores than the U.S. average to begin with, because we've gone to the best malls in the world with our stores. So, that's what's really driving that phenomena, I think.",

But excluding FX, would you be looking for operating margins to move higher this year and maybe you could quantify if the opportunity is as significant as it was in FY ‘14? And also, I was wondering about -- Sharen talked about air freighting in product. I was wondering if there would be an opportunity to reduce air freight as the year goes along, or perhaps influence gross margin there?",
            "And lastly, Martin, I was wondering if you were considering or have plans to enter western Europe in the near-term future with company-owned stores? Thank you. Maybe just the operating margin question for Stuart? The rest I can get later, thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "In terms of the operating margin rate or the operating income rate in the Business, we've talked consistently about pursuing a high-teens and ultimately a 20% operating income rate. There's nothing about 2014 that doesn't tell us that we have that opportunity, meaning 2014's improvement certainly validates what we think the potential of this Business is.",
            "You commented on that the guidance would get to roughly flat or just slight improvement in the operating income rate. It is impacted by the FX, $0.10 to $0.12 -- we can all do that math in terms of what that would mean, in terms of operating income rate. So, it's a pressure, but we're very focused on driving top-line growth and further improvement in the operating income rate and again, very much believe that there is a lot more potential there for our Business.",
            "Sharen Turney ",
            "I'm so passionate to air everything, so there is not going to be a reduction of air freight. And I will tell you why I'm passionate about it; because I think that it more than pays for itself, in terms of being closer to the customer. You have less markdowns, higher churn rate, better accuracy. I am sitting on the other side of that, if you believe that, from a cost is irrelevant piece on the air freight. I think it pays us back in so many other ways and so many other lines on the P&L.",

            "Not sure if this one is more for Martin or for Stuart, but when we look at the profitability of the international segment, it continues to move higher. Could you walk us through the puts and takes over the next 12 to 36 months there? Should that margin rate continue to move higher? If so, is that more a function of your UK business beginning to scale and make some profit dollars, or is that your franchise business continuing to ramp and the royalty flowing through? Any help there would be great, thanks.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "I'll take that. At the beginning of the international journey, we said that you should expect our rate to be at or above the overall rate of our Company and some of that proves to be at 23%. It's complex to model. As you rightly pointed out, we have a mix of ownership and partnership. So, I don't particularly like giving guidance on this. I don't expect substantial movement in either direction on this particular number, to be honest with you. We will learn. The international business is small; we're still developing; we're still growing the foundation. So, I would say watch this space and stay close.",

Some of that store growth that is projected forward is coming from Canada. I think the more interesting thing is the remodel, where we're starting to -- we're beginning the process of really going into the chain and saying, there are places that we need to upgrade and start reinvesting in there, which is a great thing because it's about building the brand, building the brand equity and making sure we do what we always say we want to do, which is really be focused on the customer experience.

            "Nick Coe",
            "First of all, the BBW business is younger than Victoria's Secret direct business. But we have seen very, very healthy growth in that channel over the last few years -- well, frankly, since its inception -- and we continue to expect that. The really important aspect of that channel for us is obviously the ability for us to tell the brand story, to market the brand, to make sure that we're in a two-way dialogue with the customer, making sure she sees what's most important from us. That's really where we're thinking of that.",

We continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement, and sound inventory management across all of our businesses. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to $0.61 versus $0.53 last year. To take you through the first quarter results as detailed on page four of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 5% to $2.512 billion and comps increased 5%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 point. The gross margin rate increased by 90 basis points to 42% driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate.",
            "SG&A expenses deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily driven by our investment in store selling. Operating income dollars increased 11%, driven by growth in all three of our major business segments, and our operating income rate improved by 70 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to a record $0.61.",
            "Foreign currency negatively impacted our first quarter EPS results by about $0.02. Turning to the balance sheet on page six, retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 7% versus last year. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock in the first quarter for $170.5 million. At quarter end, we had $79.5 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.",
            "Turning to page eight of the presentation, our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business, growth in Victoria's Secret real estate, increased store selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience, and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates. Our second quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect the second quarter gross margin rate to increase versus last year, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, partially offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage.",
            "We expect the SG&A rate to deleverage, driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs. We expect second quarter net non-operating expense consisting primarily of interest expense to be about flat to last year at $80 million. We expect earnings per share between $0.60 to $0.65 in the second quarter against last year's $0.63 result. This forecast includes a negative $0.02 to $0.03 impact from foreign exchange. We are also lapping approximately $60 million in sales of non-go forward apparel and makeup at Victoria's Secret. We expect to end the second quarter with inventory per square foot up low single digits to last year.",
            "For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage in our International business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 point.",
            "We expect our full-year gross margin rate to be up slightly, and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat to last year. Net non-operating expenses consisting principally of interest expense are projected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07.",
            "We are forecasting weighted average shares of about $300 million in the second quarter and the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.50 and $3.70. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10 to $0.12. We are projecting 2015 capital spending between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.",
            "As detailed on page nine of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 25 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3% driven by 24 net new openings and 83 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%.",

We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.",

            "Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. The Victoria's Secret segment delivered positive results in the first quarter while continuing to make significant changes to the business. We were able to grow both sales and profit despite an $80 million reduction in sales from non-go forward apparel and makeup.",
            "Total sales increased 5% to $1.7 billion and comp sales increased 5%. Operating income increased $10.6 million or 4% and our operating income rate decreased 20 basis points to 17.1%. We finished the quarter in good inventory position, down to last year.",
            "Now let's turn to specific channel performance starting with the store. We are pleased with the first quarter as both sales and operating income increased to record results. Sales for the quarter increased 8% to $1.3 billion and comps increased 5%. Sales growth was driven by PINK and lingerie. Our beauty business was down to last year reflecting the impact of the exiting of makeup category.",
            "We were very focused on our core categories and as a result delivered high single to double-digit growth in bras, panties, and fragrance. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year driven by strength in full-price selling. Buying and occupancy expense leveraged versus last year (9:24) driven by our investment to improve the customer experience. Operating income dollars and rate increased versus last year, a result of higher sales coupled with margin rate expansion.",
            "Now turning to the direct channel. Our first quarter results continue to reflect our strategy to exit non-core apparel categories. First quarter sales were down 6% as we anniversaried roughly $65 million of non-go forward apparel sales in the first quarter versus last year. Our strategy to distort to core categories where we have our best growth opportunities is working collectively.",
            "Sales in bras, panties, PINK, sport, beauty and lounge were up mid-teens. The merchandise margin rate was up significantly during the quarter as we continued to distort the core merchandise margin – as we continued to distort to the core. The merchandise margin dollars were down slightly to last year. Operating income dollars and rate declined driven by the decline in sales and an increase in expenses driven by investments in our digital shopping experience.",

We are excited about our fashion offerings this quarter and are focused on driving growth in our core categories.

            "We continue to be pleased with the customer's acceptance of product's newness and our in-store execution. For the quarter operating income was $97 million up 22% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 210 basis points to 15.8% driven by expense leverage and improvements in merchandise margin rates.",
            "We're able to effectively pull back on promotional activity versus last year, driving growth in average unit retail. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW direct channel, which grew sales by 15% and operating income significantly in the first quarter versus last year.",

We continue to be very pleased with the results and we'll open another eight or so this year.",

Can you help us understand, number one, how much you think that initiative might cost? And some of the specific targeted improvements that you're looking for in terms of implementation in the store.

We believe wholeheartedly that we are a brand with high emotional content and fantastic, loyal customers, so anything we can do that improves that experience is something that we're constantly looking at. As it relates to how much we've invested in that, and not at this stage wanting to talk about that, but more about how we're really improving the customer experience.

We're not slowing down. Where we have opportunity and can get real estate, we would move faster. So this is something that we're constantly focused on.

Obviously, you keep having amazing results there, so is it at this point just a pure story around like lower level of markdowns, from like more speed to market? Do you think that you have pricing power in your key categories? So what's the growth outlook go-forward for merchandise margins?",

One is, we continue to get a better product acceptance, which is helping us to have somewhat of a less promotional experience as we've gone through the course, which has been really helpful. The other aspect of that is mix. We've seen a healthy mix in terms of different pieces of the business that have naturally been at a higher-margin rate. And then we continue to, as see things work, our ability to read and react to those continues to be a really powerful tool for us, and that in general has helped the margin rate expansion.",

As the competitive set moves to $9.00 and then $10.00 an hour, do you anticipate some additional upward pressure on wages as we move into 2016?

I would say first and foremost, they're not in reaction to things that are happening on – happening competitively or otherwise as it relates to wage rates. We just believe we have great brands with pricing power and great store environments, and we think there's sales growth potential through a higher-paid, more stable, more motivated, better-trained workforce, and we'll get sales growth from that.",
            "In terms of the specifics about selling costs as a percent of sales, obviously we're continuing to learn. We believe that there's some potential for driving productivity on that over time. But in specific answer to your question, when does the pressure relieve, we're still learning, Kimberly. But again, when we look at the potential to drive sales growth and overall profit growth, we're very clear-minded about that, how it plays through specifically on selling costs through 2015 and into 2016. We're still learning there, but very optimistic about the sales growth potential through the work that we're doing.",

            "In terms of, what does it mean on a go-forward basis, it's really a case of, more about how much – how many styles and which styles do we put on into the Beauty Park that we believe is where the customer is going to go, so that we can react to that. So it's very much – at this stage it's been open for a while and we've been leveraging it for a while, it's very much business as usual. And as I said at the beginning, I think it's just a critical component of our business model. We expect to continue to leverage it and hope that it continues to allow us to read and react to customer preferences, which going back to the earlier conversation of what has helped margin expansion, that is a piece of it because it really allows us to do what we've always wanted to do, be close to the customer and focused on full-price selling.",

For Stuart, on the inventory growing in the second half, can you maybe talk about how you're thinking about inventories versus your sales expectations especially as we lap those big inventory declines in the back half? And for Nick, obviously mall traffic very challenging. You've been one of the few I guess inflationary categories in some of your businesses. What are some other traffic drivers that you have planned? Maybe you could talk about in the back half of the year if mall traffic continues to struggle. Thanks very much.",

            "Good morning, Brian. So on inventory, we're forecasting that it'll be up low single-digits at the end of the spring season. Our commitment, Brian, to grow inventory slower than sales has been there, if you will, for as you know, more than five years. That commitment continues because it's reflective of further progress on our speed agenda and offering the freshest most compelling assortments to customers.",
            "So over any meaningful period of time our goal is to grow inventory slower than sales. We're not looking to have empty shelves and be out of stock obviously, so we'll do that carefully. And as you acknowledged in your question, some of the – you've got to look at a multi-year comparisons to understand your current year percentage changes. So we're – inventories are in great shape and our commitment to again getting more productivity and faster turn, growing them slower than sales is an ongoing commitment.",
            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - Chief Executive Officer, Bath & Body Works LLC",
            "Hey, Brian. It's Nick. So I think three things. The first of them all would be as I mentioned earlier on the visual differentiation of the store is a really important aspect I think of driving traffic. And so we're very, very committed to with each floor set trying to create a very differentiated story to tell. That's the first one. Second is we have a number of interesting product launches coming up as we go through the year, which obviously we figure out how to market and how to promote in order to drive traffic.",
            "And then thirdly, we are constantly testing different promotional vehicles, and different ways of communicating that and different price points. And in some cases we've been able to price up as we've gone through, which has helped from a margin expansion side. But between those three things, those are the things we'll be focused on this year in order to combat any potential traffic challenges.",

Is it just a result of having the cleaner go-forward assortment? Or is there more to it than that? And then what do you expect the impact to be on the sales growth and the margin rate? Thank you.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "The number one reason is that for – as we continue to align our direct channel and our store channel, the direct business had always had a little longer timeframe for semiannual sales so now it's about putting power on power both, where the store and direct channel go out at the same time. So we would be reducing the day for semiannual. We think that by reducing the days that we'll still be able to do close to the same amount of volume. It's just in a shorter timeframe.",

Stuart, quick one for you, I think I just heard you mentioned that you expect your inventories to kind of normalize and start to be up a little bit per square foot. Does that change your – or I guess what's baked into your outlook and your guidance for the back half of the year in terms of markdowns and pricing both at VS and BBW?",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Yeah, I mean, Ike, what I would say is that we consistently worked to plan our business conservatively both as it relates to the management of inventory and the management of expenses and again that mindset's been at the forefront if you will for the last five, six, seven years. So, there isn't really any change on that.",
            "Obviously when we execute that strategy well and plan conservatively and leverage our speed agenda and our shorter lead times, as you understand and we've already talked about some again this morning, that creates opportunity for more full priced selling and one of the drivers of some expansion opportunity in merchandise margin rates – I'm not trying to be general in the answer; I'm just trying to share with you how we think about it and that is that we plan our business conservatively. And then where we've got trend and business we chase like heck to maximize sales and through that we get some opportunity to improve merchandise margin rates and there's nothing about 2015 on that agenda that's different than how we've thought about it for the last three to five years.",

So being somewhat less promotional and then as I mentioned earlier on we've been successful being able to in some cases take some promotional prices up, which has also helped on the AUR expansion.",

            "Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch",
            "Thank you. It sounds like you're still fulfilling most of your international business through Columbus. What's the tipping point there in terms of revenue to build a distribution center to fulfill some of the e-commerce and franchise and VSBA demand? And then I know you said you were pleased with China, but any other reads on potential for the rest of Asia?",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Lorraine. For the direct question, we'll go to Stuart.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Yeah, as it relates to supply chain for international, as you can appreciate, that's a complex subject and obviously, one that we're thinking about. We do believe that there are some inherent advantages to having fewer pools of inventory versus more, so that's important. You're asking about scale. Obviously, that'll depend on which business we're talking about and the nature that merchandise.",
            "And the last point I just want to register is that we don't feel compelled to \"build those assets ourselves\" meaning that there are third parties that can help us with that, that will help us with that and so as we get to those scales and again, it'll depend on the situation, category, et cetera, we'll work with third parties to advance our supply chain internationally.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Great. Martin, China?",
            "Martin Waters - President-International",
            "Yeah, China's been good. We're at 10 stores so far. We're actively looking for real estate for the full assortment of stores and for BBW stores; we think they'll open in 2016. You asked about the rest of Asia. Of course, we already have over 100 stores in Southeast Asia right now across the VSBA and BBW brands. So we're in the markets of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand all of those countries, we're actively operating in. The one part of Asia where we haven't gone and we don't intend to any time soon is North Asia, so nothing in Japan, nothing in Korea for the foreseeable future.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Martin. John, I think we have time for one more question.",
            "Operator",
            "Certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Markets.",
            "Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets",
            "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just maybe a broader question on real estate. And I think Sharen had mentioned having more ideas than space to put them in, so I wondered if you could just talk more broadly about what's going on in the real estate world? There seem to be a lot of retailers closing stores. Just what's going on there, why can't you get the space that you want and what's kind of happening with rent as we see all these store closings going on? Thanks.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "So, I'll take a crack at that. So importantly, as we think about our business, it really comes to light in the most compelling way in the store environment. Obviously, we have good direct businesses as well, but first and foremost, our brands come together most clearly in a physical environment in stores.",
            "As you know, our real estate is in very good shape in terms of the percentage of stores that generate profit and cash flow, 99% plus. The productivities are very good. As it relates to what's going on in the real estate environment generally, I think generalizations can be dangerous. Obviously, the very best malls are doing very well with growing sales, growing traffic, increasing rents reflective of the fact that there are dynamic, vibrant environments. We do see, as Sharen outlined, we talk about pretty consistently we see the opportunity for sales growth and profitable sales growth, good returns through expanding square footage in the United States.",
            "As it relates to what I'd call distressed real estate, typically in the lower volume malls and maybe some others that are struggling with real estate, frankly, that would be real estate that we would be less interested in, obviously, so our real estate locations are generally very good, main-on-main locations in the better malls in the United States. And we're not as focused on how do we get $5 off the cost per foot, but rather how do we make sure that we've got great locations, driving sales growth and profitability, working with the key developers in North America and internationally.",
            "So again, generalizations are dangerous. It's not a cost game for us. Obviously, we don't want to overpay for anything, but it's the most important economic evaluation is getting a great location and getting the right size and creating the right store environment, and that's what we're focused on. And analytically, where that comes through is in increasing sales productivity, sales growth, good investment returns, good cash flow and profit for our store-based business. So that's how we think about it.",

After our prepared comments we'll be available to take your questions for as long as time permits. So that we can speak with as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.",
            "Thanks, and now I'll turn the call over to Stuart.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68 versus $0.63 last year. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange rates, earnings growth was 11%.",
            "To take you through the second quarter results as detailed on page four of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 3% to $2.765 billion and comps increased 4%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about one point. The gross margin rate increased by 130 basis points to 40.3%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. Buying and occupancy expense deleveraged, driven by our investments in real estate. SG&A expenses deleveraged by 70 basis points, primarily driven by our investment in store selling to improve the customer experience. Operating income dollars increased by 7% and our operating income rate improved by 50 basis points. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68. Foreign currency negatively impacted our second quarter EPS results by about $0.02.",
            "Turning to the balance sheet on page eight, retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter flat versus last year. Inventories are clean and we are well-positioned. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock in the second quarter for $131.2 million. At quarter end we had $197.8 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.",
            "Turning to page 11 of the presentation, our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business; growth in square footage, increased selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience, and investments in International expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and a higher tax rate.",
            "Our third quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single digit comp increase. We expect the third quarter gross margin rate to increase, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage. We expect the SG&A rate to de-lever, driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs. We expect third quarter net non-operating expense, consisting primarily of interest expense, to be about flat to last year at $80 million.",
            "We expect earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45 in the third quarter against last year's $0.44 result. This forecast includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.03. We are also lapping approximately $35 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel at Victoria's Secret Direct. We expect to end the third quarter with inventory per square foot up low single digits to mid single digits to last year.",
            "For the full year, we are projecting positive low single digit comps. Total sales growth will be about one point higher than comps due to growth in square footage in our International business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about a point. We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up and the SG&A rate to be slightly up to last year. Net non-operating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014.",
            "The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 296 million in the third quarter and 297 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.58 and $3.73. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.12. We are projecting 2015 CapEx between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.",
            "As detailed on page 12 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions at existing Victoria's Secret stores and 25 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 28 net new openings and 83 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%.",
            "Turning to liquidity, we expect 2015 free cash flow of between $700 million and $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.",
            "Thanks, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. In the Victoria's Secret segment, we were able to grow sales and earnings versus our record performance last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates. Comps increased 3% on top of 3% last year, reaching $1.8 billion in total sales for the second quarter. Operating income of $298 million was up $5 million or 2% to last year. We had hoped to do even better, but remain committed and focused on the fundamentals. We recognize that we must keep getting better to win.",
            "Included in our results are the exit of apparel and makeup last year, or $65 million in sales. Excluding these items, our segment sales growth would have been up mid-single digits and comps would have been about one point higher. We had solid performance in bras and panties, with positive double digit growth and increased margin rate. In addition, we remain pleased with the growth and strong customer response to our PINK loungewear business. We were disappointed in the performance of swim and beauty, which were both below our expectations and were the primary drivers of our miss in operating income. We finished the quarter with inventory level up low single digits per foot to last year and in line with our expectations.",
            "Now, let's turn to the specific channel performance, starting with stores. Sales for the quarter increased 5% to $1.4 billion and comps increased 3% on top of 3% last year. Sales growth was driven by strength in PINK along with growth in lingerie, bras and panties. Our beauty business was down to last year, reflecting the impact of exiting the makeup category and softness in gifting. Swim was also down to last year, driven by fashion misses during the second quarter.",
            "Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year, but the rate was about flat, as strength in full priced selling was mostly offset by increased swim clearance and unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Expenses, including buying and occupancy and SG&A, de-levered in the quarter versus last year, driven by investments in store real estate and higher store selling costs. Operating income dollars were about flat to last year. Excluding the impact of exiting makeup, earnings would have been up mid-single digit versus last year.",
            "Now turning to the direct channel, our strategy to distort to core categories with our best growth opportunities is working, and we were pleased with results in our direct channel. Second quarter sales were down 4% as we anniversaried roughly $45 million of non-go-forward apparel. Operating income dollars and rate improved driven by the increase in merchandise margin and decrease in expenses. Collectively, sales in go-forward categories were up over 10%. Swim also missed expectation in the direct channel. The merchandise margin rates and dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continued to distort to the core.",
            "Looking ahead to the third quarter, we will continue our focused, fast and frugal approach in order to grow our business. Our fashion offerings are strong and we will continue to flow newness this quarter. We are focused on driving growth in our core categories: bras, panties, lounge and fragrance. We started August with the Body by Victoria and Wear Everywhere bra launches. We're prepared for a strong back-to-school season with our second annual PINK Friday. We're entering this season with well-positioned inventory, enabling us to be agile and respond with speed. We will continue to be up against the exit of non-go-forward apparel which represents roughly $35 million in sales in the third quarter last year.",
            "In addition, we are continuing to vest in real estate, store-selling and digital enhancements to create a more seamless shopping experience for our customer. These are the right investments for the long-term growth of our business but will pressure (12:21) in the third quarter. We are continuing to test and learn for holiday in order to set ourselves up for success in the fourth quarter.",
            "Thank you, and now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick.",
            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - Chief Executive Officer, Bath & Body Works LLC",
            "Thanks, Sharen, and good morning, everyone. At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our second quarter results where we were, again, able to grow sales and increase earnings versus our record performance last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and continuing to maintain inventory levels, manage inventory levels down. Second quarter sales at Bath & Body Works North America were $748 million, up 6% or $44 million to last year, and comps increased 5% on top of 3% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter and we were able to drive growth in each of our three key businesses, our Signature Collection product line, the Soap & Sanitizer business and our Home Fragrance assortment.",
            "We were able to pull back in promotional activity versus last year. We reduced clearance selling throughout the quarter and we were able to effectively leverage product newness in our semi-annual sale. We were very pleased with our customers' continued positive reaction to our brand, our product assortment and our storytelling as well as our in-store experience.",
            "For the quarter operating income was $138 million, up 20% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 210 basis points to 18.4%, driven by improvements in gross profit and SG&A expense leverage.",
            "We continue to see strong performance in our BBW direct channel which grew sales by 15% and operating income significantly in the second quarter versus last year. We ended the quarter with inventory down to last year, well-positioned heading into the third quarter and flexible enough to react to customers' preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management but will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.",
            "Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2015, we will continue to leverage the strength of our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class in-store experience by constantly delivering differentiation within visual display and maintaining a strong customer service focus. We begin the quarter focused on our Welcome to Wine Country theme, featuring new and seasonal fragrances in our three key businesses and will transition to our full floorset in September time period.",
            "With that, I will turn the discussion over to Martin Waters.",
            "Martin Waters - President-International",
            "Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. As in previous calls, I shall give you a brief overview of our progress in our International businesses. As we all know, our opportunity for International growth is significant and we feel good about the strategic choices we made to be steady and purposeful, to pursue our test-and-learn philosophy that reflects the DNA of our company.",
            "As detailed on page 13 of your presentation, we opened 64 gross International locations so far this year, 35 in the second quarter, to end the quarter with 453 stores in the segment.",
            "Revenue increased 12% in the quarter to $88.7 million and operating income increased 19% to $20.2 million. The operating income rate increased 140 basis points to 22.8%. The revenue growth deceleration versus the third quarter was driven by timing shifts in the shipments of product to our wholesale partners in the VSBA business. These timing shifts will smooth out over a longer period of time. Importantly, retail sales growth in the International business continues to be strong and has been consistent over the last several quarters.",
            "At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full-assortment stores. In the U.K. we continue to be very pleased with our 10 stores. We opened the Bond Street expansion in May and we will open another four stores in the U.K. later this year. In the Middle East, we now have 14 Victoria's Secret stores and three PINK stores. We continue to be very pleased with the results there and we'll open a few more stores later this year.",
            "Staying with Victoria's Secret, our Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories business continues to progress well with 325 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We opened 12 VSBA stores in China and are pleased with the results. We'll open about 100 or so VSBA stores across the globe by the end of 2015.",
            "Turning to Bath & Body Works International, we now have 101 BBW stores outside of North America and we continue to be very pleased with their performance. We expect to open another 30 or so BBW stores in the balance of the year.",
            "So in summary, continued progress for our International business in the second quarter and we remain focused on the fundamentals; great execution of our brands wherever we go.",
            "And with that, I'll say thank you and turn the discussion back over to Amie.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thank you, Martin. That concludes our prepared comments and at this time we'd be happy to take any questions you might have. In the interest of time and consideration to others, please limit yourself to one question.",

            "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC",
            "Thank you. Good morning; a very nice quarter here. My question is for Stuart. Stuart, you guys have been investing in store-selling payroll for a number of years now testing different wage structures and such. I'm wondering, it sounds like the 70 basis points pressure in SG&A this quarter was largely higher store-selling payroll. As you look at the competitive landscape and what both Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works need to do in order to stay competitive and an employer of choice, what further changes are you anticipating and making in those structures as we go into 2016? And maybe just give us an update on the evolution of your strategies over the last three years. Thank you.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Kimberly, thanks for the question. In the most summary sense and the way that we commented on it in our prepared remarks, we're investing to improve the customer experience and we're doing a number of things to improve that experience, some of which relate to compensation but there are other things that we're doing and we're learning a lot. It will be an ongoing journey, if you will. But again, our focus is on improving the customer experience. We obviously see that as an opportunity to deliver incremental sales growth over time. And we've got a number of initiatives within Victoria's and Bath & Body Works pursuing that agenda.",
            "We're not speaking in a lot of detail about it but at the end of the day it's about investing in the customer experience to drive sales growth to improve the customer experience over time both at Victoria's and Bath & Body Works.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Stuart. Thanks, Kimberly. Next question?",

            "Tom A. Filandro - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP",
            "Hi. Thank you very much, and congratulations as well on another strong executed quarter. So question for Martin; can you help us understand the timing shift in deliveries at the VSBA locations, like what's driving that shift and how should we think about the underlying growth of the business? And I'm going to slip in one for Nick. How's the White Barn test going? Thank you.",
            "Martin Waters - President-International",
            "Yes, thanks, Tom. So you're right, there was a deceleration in growth in Q2 and that is all driven by timing shifts in the wholesale proportion of the VSBA business. So a good chunk of the VSBA business works on retail royalty, but the balance which is somewhere between 30% and 40% is wholesale, and that does experience lumpiness as we go through the year. We do expect it to level out over time, Tom. Importantly, most important of all, retail sales have been strong and we continue to see about the same level of growth that we've seen in each of the previous four quarters.",
            "Tom A. Filandro - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP",
            "Thank you, Martin.",

            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - Chief Executive Officer, Bath & Body Works LLC",
            "Hey, Tom. Excuse me. Well, we're very encouraged with the initial results, but I really want to preface that we're in the early stages and still very much in the learning curve. This is really about leveraging our strength that we currently have in the Home business. We're very much at the early end of that. We'll continue to read the results and react appropriately.",

Wanted to ask a question about the bra category; I know you had strong growth there again, but was wondering if you're seeing any kind of changes in consumer – subtle changes in consumer behavior in that category, shifts within the business? And there's some talk about the athleisure trend seeping into the more traditional bra category. Would love to see how you see that category evolving currently and into next year. Thank you.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "Omar, hi. Thank you very much. We're very excited about the bra category and as with any category, we are going to see shifts, and we're very prepared for those shifts. We're very excited about the low double digit growth that we have in our bra category. We continue to look at the landscape in thinking about the segments of the business. We entered into the sport bra business about two years ago, three years ago. It is a major focus and doing quite well. I believe that it's going to be part of the bra business as we go forward. So I think that we are well-positioned. We're very excited about our position as we go forward, and we continue to see double digit growth across all of our bra categories.",

Maybe as we think about the gross margin composition going forward from here, if you think about the buckets of the markdown improvement, the buying and occupancy deleveraging and then maybe even AUC on what's happened to cotton, how should we think about the drivers going into next year really?",
            "I mean, do you still need a 5% to 6% comp next year to get BOW leverage. Are there just ways you're thinking about – I know we're getting ahead of ourselves, but does the model change at all next year on the gross margin composition?",
            "And then maybe for Sharen, on PINK, I think last year, back-to-school, you had a very strong PINK business. You said you were off to a good start. Are there any categories that you're either lapping or you're introducing that you're most excited about in PINK? Thanks very much.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "So, Brian, there's a lot in that question, and that's okay because we're in an interesting business. As we think about merchandise margin, as you know, it starts with the product and what I mean by that is how consumers react to our product. And when we get it right, as you know, we've got a lot of pricing power with the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret brand, so it really does start with getting the product right, which as you know, is one of the key reasons or rationales for all of the work that we've done and that we continue to do on our speed agenda. When you combine that with inventory management and discipline, those things in combination get to merchandise margin rate improvements that we've realized over time including year-to-date in 2015.",
            "With that said, you also know that we try to be smart about the trade-off between rate and dollars, and we really think a lot about reinvesting in our product and driving dollar volume at the end of the day trading off price levels, promotions, opening price points, et cetera, to get the best merchandise margin dollar result.",
            "And then as you move into occupancy, the other component of the gross profit rate, frankly, we are very enthused and bullish about the opportunity that we have to reinvest in our store fleet. And as we report out regularly at our Annual Investor Meeting, those investments certainly in aggregate have been paying off very well in terms of investment returns driving sales growth, profit dollar growth, and very importantly, setting our business up for the next five years or 10 years with the store environment that's very compelling to consumers.",
            "And so reflecting those investments, I would expect that we'll continue to see some deleverage in the occupancy line over time but, again, view that very favorably because of how that contributes to the long-term health and growth potential for this business. So big subject, I think that reflects our views ,and we'll be careful about managing rate versus dollars. Thanks.",

The biggest investment that is different this year versus last year for PINK is in the bra category. We did a lot of testing in some districts last year. We ended up rolling out a brand-new fixture package and capacity for our bra business. So that is where we have our largest growth category as we go into back-to-school that is different from last year.",

            "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me offer my congratulations as well. Just wanted to ask about swim for a moment; can you just comment a bit more about what drove the weakness there, primarily a fashion issue or something else going on?",
            "And then could you also comment on your supply chain test and respond capabilities for that category in particular? Just wondering if there's anything structurally different about that category that may limit your ability to respond to demand in season. Thank you.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "Thanks, Mark. Swim has been my biggest disappointment and we did it to ourselves. We had a great first quarter. We changed instead of reacting into the things that were working, we said let's land a brand-new fashion delivery, which we did, and it was a big misstep. It affected both the store channel as well as the direct channel. When I think about our supply chain in swim, it was one of the first to go on a speed model. One of the other things that we did is we designed really complex swimsuits with macramé, all of those kinds of details that were much harder to chase into. So the whole swim thing is something we did to ourselves. The business is there to have. We messed it up. We didn't follow our own fundamentals and it's been my biggest disappointment.",

            "Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the results. Sharen, as you think about holiday for 2015, how are you planning marketing? And what do you think the difference will be this year versus last year? And also on the Bath & Body Works side, how do you think of holiday this year versus last year? What should we be seeing? And is there margin opportunity for holiday for both businesses? Thank you.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "Hi, Dana. As you know, we're taking a pretty conservative view for fourth quarter and holiday this year. Our marketing plans -- we actually are adding a bra launch in the first week of December, which will be different this year versus last year. We're continuing to test early so that we can identify bigger opportunities. Our promotional activity is basically planned slightly down but we have contingencies in place that if we need to balance out, responding to traffic or driving to traffic as we protect the brand.",
            "I think for the PINK business, August is a good indicator for us about how holiday can be. We really tore holiday apart last year to think about how to approach things differently and to maximize that timeframe between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day because we all had -- know that that has been declining for the industry over time and we're just trying to make sure that we can get more of our fair share.",
            "So we're positioned well, inventory is under control, we're doing a lot of testing, we've got a new bra launch that's happening, PINK has actually got some – we're very fortunate that we're in a backpack cycle right now which is just perfect for PINK. Our beauty business -- we are in the throes of repositioning that beauty business because we want it to be more elevated and in line with the lingerie categories.",
            "So we have introduced body care for the August timeframe. We're repositioning Fantasies, which is a big chunk of that business, in October and as we continue to elevate our fine fragrance. So I think that we're prepared but we're also being very cautious in terms of going into holiday.",

            "So for us, we really want to leverage our fortunate position of being very much a destination during the holiday period, so obviously that means we've got to be as giftable as we possibly can. So things that spring to mind for us will be obviously the notion of distorting to the things that we know are really, really critical at that timeframe as well as making storytelling as powerful as we possibly can. So we'll continue to heavily invest in that side of it.",
            "Obviously newness at that timeframe is important and how we mix that with the things that she really expects to get from us. We have a rich heritage set of products that she really expects to get, so the mix is important there.",
            "From a margin perspective, obviously we'll plan that flat and then leverage the speed capabilities that we have to be able to react to what's working and what's selling which should give us hopefully some upside. But the real plan there is to be flat. I think the most important thing for us during holiday is to make sure we go into it with the highest amount of flexibility we possibly can, both from an inventory perspective as well as obviously how we're flowing goods, et cetera.",

I can say with confidence that the offer is well-received. I can tell you that the bestsellers are by and large the bestsellers; the best colors are usually the best colors. We see a very high degree of similarity in most cases. Obviously in certain countries where there are particular cultural norms, for example, Saudi Arabia, we see slight distortions, but honestly not that much greater than the distortions that we would see across the enormous country that is the United States of America.",
            "So all in all, very, very pleased with the VSFA business and broadly consistent with what we see in the U.S. and excited about growth in lots of new areas in the world in 2016.",

I know you talked about the outlook for next year and kind of the drivers which I assume are very similar in the back half but maybe just directionally given merch margin kind of started to improve last year in the back half, how should we think about the upside there starting in the third quarter now?",
            "And then also if you could maybe talk about just the direct business which seems to be converging a bit more with the stores and anymore focus on Omni-Channel. Thanks.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "It's Stuart on the merchandise margin question. To be honest, I don't have a lot more to add beyond what I already commented on in response to Brian's question. We've realized some improvement. There's the potential to realize a bit more. As I mentioned, we make a lot of judgments within the season ultimately thinking about what will resonate best with customers and drive the best sales and margin dollar outcome. But again, with all that said when we get the product right, leverage our speed tools really well, continue to stay disciplined on inventory, there's some opportunity for further improvement but we're always going to balance it against reinvesting in the product and driving dollar growth.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Stuart. And, Sharen, on direct?",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "Yes, I'm really excited about our direct business as we continue to reposition Victoria's Secret and edit out the peripheral and really focus on our core businesses. And when you think of the direct business over the last 12 months, 18 months, walked away from $280 million and basically are replacing a lot of that with the core categories, just bodes well for the customer and for the brand.",
            "As I think about Omni-Channel, I think Victoria's Secret because we've been in the catalogue business so long, because we moved to the Internet business, we've been an Omni-Channel business. We're just getting stronger and stronger. We're engaging more with our customers. Our customers are buying more with us. They're becoming – they're attriting at a slower rate for us.",
            "So I think that from a brand perspective and from a direct perspective, we're moving in the right direction. We're going to continue to elevate our catalogue. We're going to continue to think about that, shifting a lot of our emphasis to mobile because that's where the engagement model happened and that's where we're investing in our technology. So I feel very good about where we are and what our capabilities are.",

And can you talk about any successes and challenges in opening the numbers of new stores that you've planned in the first half of this year and the back half?",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Lorraine. Martin, yes?",
            "Martin Waters - President-International",
            "Sure. Yes, happy to take that question. Yes, happy to take that question, Lorraine. Thanks for asking. As we look forward into the back half of the year, we're very well-positioned across all of our markets. To be honest, we focus less on trying to predict exactly what that growth rate will be and more on solid execution and getting the stores open that we have in our plan. We have over 100 stores to open in the back half and getting that open on time and getting them open well is mission critical. So, I'm more focused on that than predicting precisely what the rate will be but I will tell you that there's been a great deal of consistency in our growth rate across each of the last four quarters in terms of retail sales.",
            "Highs and lows in terms of things most pleased with, I would say China is an area of real excitement for us. We've opened 12 stores, VSBA stores. We have another seven or eight to open in the balance of this year. We're well-positioned to open full-assortment stores in China in 2016 so particularly excited about that. If I had to pull out one big challenge that we face, it's really delivering the right real estate. We've made a strategic choice not to go at a pace; that means that we need to compromise on our retail real estate. If we want the best real estate in the new malls, sometimes we have to wait for it. So there's a frustration in getting the right real estate as quickly as I would like it but by and large we work our way through that and continue to stay focused on solid execution.",

            "And then, Sharen, I think you said the bra and panty business was up double digits, which is very impressive. Is that driven primarily by PINK, because you did also call out PINK bra and panty business being very strong and a focus one of the changes in the back half of the year versus last year?",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "We look at the sport bra business in – what I do is I category all the bra business in terms of total and then internally, we look at sport bras, PINK bras, VSL bras. We dissect it and segment it in many, many different ways. But as we report to you guys, we look at total, total sports. We look at total bras altogether. What I'm pleased to tell you is that we had growth in all segments of our bra business. The VSL bra business grew, the PINK bra business grew and the sport bra business grew. Obviously, from an increase, you saw more growth from a percentage in the sport category as well as the PINK category because they're coming off of much smaller bases. VSL has a huge base, over $1.3 billion in terms of bras, so they're coming off of a big base, and that business grew high single digits.",

            "Thanks very much, guys. Just a couple of thoughts; one about real estate and one about the direct business. Just want to know about the VS growth. Is it new stores or bigger stores? How's that balancing out? And how many stores are still not right-sized, still not been expanded? And then given the direct business and its success, is there further investments being anticipated, whether it's mobile shopping or ship from store, pick up in store, some of these features we've been seeing other retailers add? Thank you.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "So in terms of the Victoria's Secret growth, basically, our growth has, in terms of the 4% real estate growth that we have, part of that is new stores where we're actually taking PINK and segmenting it out of the Victoria's Secret stores, so then therefore, you'll have a freestanding PINK store and a freestanding Victoria's Secret store. The other piece is just making our stores larger and having PINK be side-by-side. We still have, when we look at it, probably 50% to 60% of our fleet still cannot hold all of our assortments, and that's just going to take time because first of all, you want to get the right real estate.",
            "And as I think from a Limited Brands' perspective, that we do an outstanding job managing that real estate fleet because we have very few stores that don't make money. So one of the things as I think about our real estate as well is that how do we – are we our dominant real estate, is it actually more leveraged to our core categories, that it takes the repositioning and adjacencies with inside our store. That is one piece that we're working on as well.",
            "We have proven that we can actually pay for these. It gets a very high 20% over return in the first year, which is great from our real estate. So I think that we're on the right track and excited about where we're going and it's still a lot of opportunity that we have left on the table.",
            "When I think about the direct business, we've already shifted probably I think now 52% (sic) [25%] (44:01) of our – about 52% (sic) [25%] (44:03) of our business is coming through mobile, so that is something that we have been focused on and that continue to focus on and continue to leverage. In terms of the Omni-Channel work, we actually have where you can buy online and return in store. If we're out of stock, we can buy, from store out of stock, you can buy online. We haven't done the pickup yet, and it's something that we're continuing to think about, but we have already put all those other things in place and have had those things in place over two years now.",

We'd like to think there's opportunity still remaining within the Signature business as we come up against last year. We've got an awful lot of newness flowing and we continue to see a very healthy customer shift against that core business of Signature.",
            "The other side of that is our Home business continues to be very strong, and our investments in the Home business will maintain as we think about holiday. And really the second half is the time that our Home business typically grows, outpaces its first half results. So those are really the two big opportunities for us really.

I'm just curious about what we should expect there and maybe how your assortment will evolve with the fast-turning items as a percentage of total. Thanks.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Yes, Oliver, there's not a lot of new news to report, if you will. Our thinking is pretty consistent, which is actually first and foremost we sell high margin stuff and we want to be in stock, so that we never get confused about that. With that said, we've been pursuing strong inventory management through what I call basic disciplines and in pursuit of that speed agenda now for three years, four years, five years.",
            "Our numerical goal, if you will, is to continue to grow inventory slightly slower than sales, to have some spread. But with that said, we want to be careful about it because we go back to point number one, which is we want to be in stock and we want to be well-positioned to pursue business. But there's not any major change in our thinking. It's a fundamental part of our business. We managed inventories well in the spring. Our inventories are very clean.",
            "As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect inventory per foot, store inventory per foot to be up low single to mid-single. You might be curious about the mid-single. When you look at things on a two-year basis, fall inventories will actually be down a little bit more or pretty consistent with the inventory changes in the spring. And there's a lot of moving pieces to it. But again, our overall thinking and our overall goals are very consistent and we'll manage it with discipline.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Great. Thanks, Stuart. Thanks, Oliver. Next question?",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.",
            "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC",
            "Hi. Good morning. So on capital allocation, any change in mindset as we think about the consistency of share repurchase versus special dividends in the total return algorithm going forward? And then higher level, what type of comp is needed to actually leverage fixed costs this year versus next year and beyond as we do lap some of the selling initiatives?",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Matt. We'll go to Stuart.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Yes, so on capital allocation, the thing that is very consistent for us is that any excess cash that we generate, and we generate a lot of excess cash through the profitability and the operating cash flow of the business, we're going to first and foremost reinvest in our business and as you know, we are reinvesting meaningfully in our business to grow it and doing so we think in a very profitable way.",
            "And then to the extent that we have free cash flow after that we're very clear minded again about returning that to shareholders. And as you know, first and foremost is a regular dividend that we want to be very compelling and appropriate for our shareholders, and we've increased that regular dividend very materially or very significantly over the last several years including a very significant increase over the last 12 months.",
            "Then in terms of the interplay between special dividends and share repurchases, we use our judgment and we use our judgment about our sense of the desire of shareholders and our sense of relative opportunity in the marketplace, one component of that thinking is we do want to generally offset dilution from equity awards with share repurchases, but beyond that will be what we believe to be opportunistic, obviously thinking about our view of the intrinsic value of the company.",
            "So again first and foremost is invest in the business; second, any excess coming back to shareholders; third, compelling regular dividend; and then fourth, some swing between repurchase and specials depending on facts and circumstances at the time.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Great. Thanks, Stuart. I'm sorry.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "And then in terms of leverage point – it's okay. In terms of leverage point, we've mentioned that we're – and you said on fixed costs and then you mentioned selling expenses, I mean, selling expenses to some degree are fixed and to some degree you would appreciate that they're variable. So if we put the selling expenses off to the side for a second and really more so think about occupancy expenses as we've mentioned pretty consistently, we're investing in our business and that percentage increases depending upon the business and the period of time 6%, 7% maybe even in some periods 8%. But again that's because we're investing in the business.",
            "So, on that part of the expense structure, that's kind of the breakpoint in terms of total sales growth, that's not comp but total sales growth. And then the selling expense will be in season and annual management, and as you've heard we're investing in that part of our business to improve the customer experience and thus right now we're seeing some deleverage in that part of our P&L.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Stuart. I think we can take a couple of more questions. Next question, please?",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question comes from Adrienne Yih Tennant with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.",
            "Adrienne Yih Tennant - Wolfe Research, LLC",
            "Good morning. Let me add my congratulations as well. Stuart, I think this is for you. Can you talk about a number of the input variables that are going in cotton, oil, the devaluation in the yuan from a sourcing perspective and the impact on AUC? When could we see those and of what magnitude, if you can help us out there? Thank you very much.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Sure. Importantly, and again, consistent in our thinking, while we do think about and certainly I would want you to know that we don't want to overpay for anything, first and foremost, in our mind as we think about the business and manage the business is creating compelling product that commands very strong retails, and that's where our dominant emphasis is, on driving dollars and margin rates. With that said, you mentioned a number of items that do have the potential to drive some favorability in product costs, but I wouldn't describe them as in aggregate material.",
            "And again, our bigger opportunity is to minimize markdowns and drive compelling product and flow with speed and innovation and quality in our product and importantly, we will continue to reinvest in the spec and the quality of our products, whether it's in intimate apparel or personal care and beauty; so a lot of moving parts. We're not a cost driven company as it relates to merchandise or store environment, particularly, and the bigger drivers of margin rate opportunity for us are some of the things we've commented on earlier in the call.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Stuart. One last question?",
            "Operator",
            "Your last question comes from Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Please go ahead.",
            "Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research",
            "Good morning. Glad I snuck in. Great quarter. Sharen, I heard your comments on the beauty category and I'm wondering how confident you are that the improvement in that business – if we will see improvement in that business in the back half and if beauty can contribute to improvement in 2H 2015? Thanks.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "Hi, Janet.",

            "Hi.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney - President & Chief Executive Officer, Victoria's Secret Direct LLC",
            "I think with the repositioning that we're doing and the exits that we're doing, that I would tell you I would be very cautious about the beauty business in the back half. I am more optimistic as we go forward. I think we're doing a lot to trade out, a lot of moving pieces going on, and so I would approach it very cautiously.",
            "Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research",
            "Okay, great. Thanks and good luck.",

            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered record third quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management.",
            "Earnings per share increased 25% to $0.55 versus $0.44 last year. Excluding the $0.04 negative impact from foreign exchange rates, earnings growth was 34%. As Les commented in our press release, our brands are differentiated and have high emotional content and we continue to deliver new, compelling merchandise in an exciting in-store experience. We remain focused on executing fundamentals and staying close to our customers. We are pleased with our month-to-date performance and we are well-positioned for the most significant part of our year which is in front of us.",
            "To take you through the third quarter results as detailed on page 4 of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 7% to $2.482 billion and comps increased 7%.",
            "Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 percentage point. The gross margin rate increased by 80 basis points to 41.6%, driven roughly by an improvement, driven roughly equally by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy leverage. SG&A expenses leveraged by 70 basis points. Operating income dollars grew by 19% and our operating income rate improved by 140 basis points.",
            "Turning to the balance sheet on page 8, retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 7% versus last year and down 6% on a two-year basis. Inventories reflect some early receipts at the end of the quarter and are clean and we’re well positioned. We repurchased 751,000 shares of stock in the third quarter for $61 million. At quarter end, we had $137 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.",
            "Turning to page 11 of the presentation, our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business: growth in square footage; increased store selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience; and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and a higher tax rate.",
            "Versus our previous forecast, our full year guidance reflects our third quarter beat less the impact of incremental interest expense from our recent $1 billion 20-year note issuance of about $0.04. As a reminder, interest expense related to this debt will be about $69 million on an annual basis.",
            "Our fourth quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect a 2 to 3 point positive spread between comps and total sales. We expect the fourth quarter gross margin rate and SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. We expect fourth quarter net non-operating expense consisting primarily of interest expense to be about $95 million, $18 million more than last year, driven by the new debt.",
            "We expect earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95 in the fourth quarter against last year's $0.89 result. This forecast includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.05 and the incremental interest expense of about $0.04. A higher assumed effective tax rate is having a negative $0.05 impact. Adjusting for these factors, earnings per share growth at the high end of our range is about 10%. We expect to end the fourth quarter with inventory per square foot of mid single digits to last year.",
            "For the full year, we’re projecting positive low to mid single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps, due to growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 point.",
            "We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up and the SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. Net non-operating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $335 million.",
            "Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact EPS by about $0.07. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 296 million in the fourth quarter and 297 million for the full year.",
            "Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full-year 2015 to be between $3.69 and $3.79. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.12. We are projecting 2015 CapEx of about $800 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.",
            "As detailed on page 12 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 26 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 26 net new openings and 83 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by between 3% and 4%.",
            "Turning to liquidity, we expect 2015 free cash flow of between $750 million and $850 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.",
            "Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. Thanks.",
            "And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney",
            "Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. The Victoria's Secret segment grew both sales and earnings during the third quarter. Total sales increased 8% to $1.6 billion and comps increased 7% on top of 3% last year. Operating income of $211 million was up $19 million or up 10% to last year.",
            "Included in last year’s results are approximately $36 million in apparel sales in the direct channel, which we have fully exited this year. Excluding this item, our segment sales growth would have been between 2 and 3 points higher.",
            "We began the quarter with successful Body By Victoria and Wear Everywhere Bra launches as well as a record back to school results in our PINK business. That strength continued throughout the quarter as customers responded to our newness and fashion leading to double digit growth in our bra, panty and loungewear categories.",
            "In regard to the beauty business, we’re in the process of a full repositioning of this category and remain committed to delivering an elevated beauty business that is more consistent with the Victoria’s Secret brand. Throughout this transition, we expect and are seeing beauty results which are down to last year.",
            "Merchandise margin dollars for this segment increased versus last year, driven by strength in both stores and direct. Rate was up slightly to last year. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up to last year, driven by planned strategic investments in PINK and increased beauty inventory related to the [indiscernible] restage.",
            "Now, let’s turn to the specific channel performance, starting with stores. Sales for the quarter increased 9% to $1.3 billion and comps increased 7% on top of 3% last year. Sales growth was driven by strength in bras and panties, as well as PINK loungewear.",
            "Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year, margin rate declined driven by planned promotional activity including our Angel Card reissue and unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Additionally, lower beauty sales led to an unfavorable mix impact.",
            "Total expenses leveraged slightly versus last year as an improvement in the buying and occupancy rate was partially offset by deleverage in SG&A, driven by investments in selling expense to improve the customer experience within the stores. For the quarter, operating income dollars were up to last year and the operating income rate was down.",
            "Now turning to the direct channel, our strategy to distort the core categories is working and we were pleased with results in our direct channel. Third quarter sales were up 4% as 20% growth in our go-forward categories more than offset $36 million of non-go-forward apparel. The merchandise margin rate and dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continued to distort to the core. Operating income dollars and rate increased significantly.",
            "In summary, we know that the majority of the season is ahead of us. And in order to deliver our goals, we are going to remain focused on our customers, our core business and executing with excellence. We’re excited and optimistic about holiday, which starts with Black Friday next week, so happy Thanksgiving everyone. We’re positioned with a strong fashion-wide assortment and activities that will drive both self purchase and gifting. This includes our new bra launch in early December.",
            "Following Black Friday weekend, the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show will air on Tuesday, December 8 10 PM EST, featuring musical performance by Ellie Goulding, Selena Gomez and The Weekend.",
            "Thanks and now I’ll turn the discussion over to Nick.",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "Thanks, Sharen, and good morning, everyone. At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our third quarter results. We were again able to increase earnings versus our record earnings last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and continuing to manage inventory appropriately.",
            "Third quarter sales at Bath & Body Works North America were $705 million, up 7% or $46 million to last year, and comps increased 6% on top of 7% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter and we were able to drive growth in each of our three key businesses: our signature collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment.",
            "Merchandise margin rate for the quarter was up, with gains from effective leveraging of pricing and promotion, being partially offset by negative impact of foreign exchange in our Canadian business. For the quarter, operating income was $136 million, up 46% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 510 basis points to 19.3%, driven by improvements in sales, margin and SG&A expense leverage.",
            "We continued to see strong performance in our BBW direct channel, which grew sales by 20% and operating income significantly in the quarter versus last year. We ended the quarter with inventory up slightly to last year as we prepared for the fourth quarter.",
            "We remain focused on disciplined inventory and expense management and will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.",
            "We’ve begun the fourth quarter of 2015 with a holiday theme featuring customer fragrance favorites as well as new winter fragrances in our three key businesses. We will be focused on delivering the perfect Christmas and giving her the holiday experience that she’s come to expect from Bath & Body Works, including newness in our core product categories, gifting options and an irresistible in-store experience.",
            "With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin Waters.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. As in previous calls, I should give you a brief overview of progress in our international businesses. As you know, our opportunity for international growth is significant and we’re making good progress.",
            "As detailed on page 13 of your presentation, we’ve opened 93 gross international locations so far this year, 29 in the third quarter, to end the quarter with 480 stores in the segment. Revenue increased 16% in the quarter to $92.8 million and operating income increased 13% to $18.2 million.",
            "The operating income rate decreased 50 basis points to 19.6%, driven by FX headwinds. Absent the impact of FX, OI rate would have been 3 to 4 percentage points higher. Retail sales growth in local currency in the international business continues to be strong.",
            "Victoria's Secret international, we’re pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. In the UK, we have a busy quarter ahead with another four stores to open to end the year with 14 stores. In the Middle East, we opened our fifth store of the year two weeks ago in Istanbul, bringing the total to 16 VS stores and three PINK stores.",
            "Staying with Victoria's Secret, our beauty and accessories business continues to progress well, with 342 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about a third of which are in airports. We have another 40 or so open in Q4.",
            "Turning now to Bath & Body Works, we now have 110 international stores and we continue to be very pleased with their performance. We expect to open another 15 or so BBW international stores in the balance of the year.",
            "So in summary, continued progress from our international business in the third quarter and we remain focused on the fundamentals, great execution of our brands wherever we go.",
            "With that, I'll say thank you and I’ll turn it back over to Amie.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Martin. That concludes our prepared comments this morning. At this time, we'd be happy to take any questions you have. And as a reminder, in the interest of time and consideration to others, please limit yourself to one question. I'll turn it back over to the operator.",
            "Question-and-Answer Session",
            "Operator",
            "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR.",
            "Susan Anderson",
            "I was wondering, Stuart, if you could talk about just the gross margin composition going forward? Do you think there is opportunity still with markdown in the fourth quarter, especially given the environment around the holiday? Then also any AUC opportunity and I guess if you could talk about just the B&O bucket, if you can continue to comp mid single digit opportunity there.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "There were a lot, Susan, in that question and thanks for your remark about the third quarter. As we think about merchandise margin and the related buying and occupancy expense and our thinking has been very consistent about this. We have some additional opportunity, probably not a lot in the merchandise margin rate and the reason for that is the most important thing is to get the product right. And from that, obviously we get full price selling and all good things happen.",
            "There is a little bit more opportunity or some more additional opportunities related to speed and the value that that creates. But all of that is balanced against making sure that we’re providing great value to customers. And what we don’t want to do is have the margin percent get too high and as a result either limit our growth in terms of dollar growth or have the outcome where the customer doesn’t feel like she is getting a terrific value. So that’s really how we think it.",
            "As we’ve talked about previously, we’re not a company that’s particularly focused on AUCs. We obviously do buy a lot of merchandise and we’re not looking to over-pay, but what we’re really focused on is innovation, newness, fashion, speed, product quality, that’s where we spend most of our time and energy working with a great group of partners in terms of the folks that manufacture our merchandise.",
            "As it relates to buying and occupancy expenses, we are investing in our stores. And as we outlined a few weeks ago at our annual update, we’re very energized and optimistic about the growth that that will provide for the company. And frankly, the strategic importance of that, if you will, in terms of ensuring that our store environments remain very compelling for our customers. And as a result, the dollar growth in our buying and occupancy expense will be in the mid single digit range for the remainder of this year and going into next year. So that would be how I would outline our thinking about gross margin rates.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney",
            "Susan, one point to add on that just specifically as it relates to the fourth quarter, so as Stuart mentioned in his comments that we will see 2 to 3 points of sales spread versus comps in the fourth quarter primarily because of the direct business is flipping around against exited apparel merchandise. So we will have bit of a lower leverage point on buying and occupancy going forward.",

            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "What I would say is as we renew leases, as a general matter, rents are increasing as you would expect. So our lease terms, as a general point are 10-year lease terms, and as we renew leases, the rents are higher. With that said, and unlike our thinking as it relates to merchandise and margin rates that we talked about earlier, the most important thing obviously as it relates to real estate is having a terrific location within a given shopping venue. So we’re not looking to get the lowest rents, if you will.",
            "We’re looking to get the right locations, we drive a lot of productivity as you know in terms of sales per foot, so our ability to do that with the major developers frankly throughout the world is pretty good. But we’re not focused on getting the lowest rent terms if you will, we’re focused on getting great locations, driving lot of sales, lot of [four wall] profit. And as we renew leases, our rent per foot or rent dollars do increase. But at the end of the day, the four wall economics remain very, very powerful.",

Retail sales in local currencies are up significantly to last year and broadly in line with the increases that we saw in the previous quarter. Secondly, the recorded revenue which you’ll remember is a mix of three things: it’s a mix of owned retail in the UK, retail royalty streams that come from our franchise businesses and wholesale income that comes through travel retails. So there are three things in that part.",
            "Those recorded revenues have been up significantly to last year, but have been impacted by really three things. The first is FX headwinds, which had about 6 points of impact. The second is delays to some store openings versus the prior year. We still have over 50 stores to open between now and the end of January, which is a little late than I would like. And the third is the travel retail businesses globally have seen a little bit of slowdown. So those are impacting our revenue stream.",
            "As far as the [OI] rate is concerned, I’d just remind you that FX wind pressure is pretty significant and if we adjust it for that, we’d see about 3 or 4 percentage points higher rates than we’re seeing right now.",

By recollection, I think beauty has largely not grown here over the last eight to 10 years and as a result, the beauty piece, the mix percentage of beauty to the overall assortment has declined. I don't know if you have those statistics, if you do, it would be great to hear them. And that would seem, given beauty's high margins that the brand has absorbed actually a gross margin headwind over the last number of years. I'm wondering if you any quantification around that and what's the outlook for beauty with all of the new packaging and the new relaunch and the new restaging, how should we think about the growth of that business over the next one, two, three years?",

            "Our beauty business is about a $1 billion business today. And you’re right, it has not grown really over the last three years, it’s pretty much a flat business. As we have thought about our beauty business, we have continued to shrink the real estate in our beauty business because we feel like it has the opportunity to be much more productive. The strategic intent of taking beauty off the lease line and closer to the cash wrap has allowed us to become more productive, therefore we’ve been stagnant a little bit in our growth category.",
            "We felt like the beauty business was trading on the brand equity versus the opportunity to trade up to have it really lead the category from a prestigious perspective. And as our base of our business was in the fantasies business which is more of an opening price point high-unit velocity business, we’re trading in to more as a fine fragrance business as well as a higher in-body care business.",

We’re very, very focused on best quality selling, we’re very focused on newness, we’re very focused on story-telling and that seems to be what’s helping insulates us from challenge in traffic.

The promotions we did actually were bigger and better. So we’re trying to get fewer but bigger and better, therefore driving traffic and efficiencies within the store.",

So as you know, we’re testing a lot of different programs, we’re really working on thinking about how to educate our people. Obviously, going into the holiday, we’re focused about making sure that we get all the holiday help that we need. So we are still focused on testing and learning at this point. We’re seeing past results of our effort, but there’s still so much for us to learn and we’ll continue to evolve along on this focus over the next 24 months. And we’re really going to get leverage out of the selling cost as we think about it and as we go into next spring and the fall season.",

This will allow us now to really convert into spring, convert out of all of the – getting sale off the floor and really coming out strong with spring fresh merchandise and really wear now merchandise in terms of the transition.

And as we talked about it, our read, react and chase capabilities, we've talked about it generally as sometimes we use the metaphor of a baseball game and I'd say we're in the middle to maybe the sixth inning or so.",

And we’ve made substantial progress across all of our businesses. There is some additional opportunity, but it’s been a very important focus for us now for three or four years and we’ve realized a lot of benefit from it. There is more yet to do, but we’re well into the opportunity. And again, Nick, Sharen, if you want to add to it, certainly feel free to do so.",

But I would say it’s pretty well leveraged at this juncture.",

And each and every one of our partners throughout the world are on this journey with us and it’s amazing how powerful these collaborations are when we think about the opportunities that we have.

Curious on the SG&A side and where are we on the payroll investments, particularly at VS, and what are we lapping and maybe what new markets are we extending into? And then maybe for Stuart or Nick, maybe on the BBW EBIT margins, I think now you're poised for a mid-20%s operating margin this year. That's pretty incredible. So as we think about that business going forward and the remodels that you're initiating, what do you think is the right margin level for BBW?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Brian, I will take the first part of that. So on SG&A expense as a percent of sales, what our goal as a company is overtime and we’ve been pretty consistent in our thinking about this is to grow expenses slower than sales. You pointed out in your question we’ve talked about, you’re aware of the fact that we’re investing in a more highly-paid more productive sales associate in our business and that certainly is putting pressure on near-term results, but we’re also, in many cases, finding ways to at least partly offset some of those investments. And you should be sure that we’ll continue to look for ways to work to offset those investments.",
            "But as a general matter, we will be looking to hold SG&A rates flat or get slight leverage overtime. We referenced in our remarks a few weeks ago in the broader group that we’re also thinking about dollar growth versus rate expansion. And as you appreciate, there’s a lot of balance in that. And that certainly applies to the SG&A line as well. But as we sit here and knowing the minds that of Sharen, Nick, Martin, the other leaders in the business at the end of the day we will continue to make sure we’re making the right investments to grow our business, but also be top-minded about driving trade-offs to either fully fund or at least partly fund those investments. So that’s our state of mind there.",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "So I think I’d echo what Stuart was saying, so it’s an awful lot of energy in that for going into top line growth as opposed to further margin rate expansion. And we’re very, very focused on first quality selling. So a lot of investment will continue to go into products to make sure we’re innovative as possible. And obviously as we head into the fourth quarter, which is rather into November, December which is such a dynamic period, maybe naive to think there was more in that.",

            "La Senza continues to be a work in progress, no doubt about that. But we’re pretty pleased with the progress we’ve made. We continue to see positive sales momentum in the business. We’re getting closer to the target customers, better assortments, more fashion on significantly tighter inventory. So that's all really good and really positive. We also see sales momentum in the business where we’re colocated with Victoria’s and PINK is really strong. So there’s a real relevance for that brand in the market place alongside the other two businesses that we own.",
            "The logic for keeping it I think is obvious and compelling. We own the number one, number two and number three lingerie brands in the world, having a value play underneath of Victoria’s makes a ton of strategic sense. And so we’re very committed to its future. But the one bogey we have on La Senza, of course, and we've referenced it a number of times in this call is the FX rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar that gives us a really, really significant headwind.

I think it’s pretty much the way we see in the US. The one exception I'd draw out from a regional point of view that is a little different than the US is the West of Canada is significantly weaker.

I think that as we go forward and we look at fourth quarter, the beauty business is about 18% of the business in the fourth quarter. So I think hopefully that we have tried to architect the business in a way to help offset that. We feel that there is probably some opportunity in participating merchandise margin dollar improvement in Q4. But I think the margin rate will continue to be impacted mostly by the FX and the beauty business. So we are trying to look at that very carefully as we go forward.

We typically talk about and report on a monthly basis inventory per foot because we think that’s a relevant measure. And on that basis, inventory for the quarter ended up plus 7% and down 6% on a two-year basis. The bottom line is we think inventory is in great shape as I commented on in the prepared remarks.

We have a revolver, it’s a $1 billion revolver. We generally don’t use it. One could debate that, we obviously seek to manage the business conservatively.

Some of that’s also reflected in the fact that we haven't invested a lot in the store fleet in terms of remodeling stores and so on.

            "Maybe just to keep it in the family, if I can piggyback on Brian's other question, just Stuart given the VS stores deleverage despite that 7% comp, what would you expect the SG&A leverage point for stores to be next year? And then can you contextualize what percent of the store expenses are now fixed versus variable?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Simeon, there is a lot in that question. So in terms of the flex point on SG&A or store selling, it’s not actually static, it’s more dynamic. Really the only – at least in meaningful times of the year, important times of the year, the only fixed part of store payroll is the management complement, certainly in lower volume periods in the year, more of the payroll is fixed if you will.",
            "But again, we’ll be looking to grow expenses lower than sales as we move forward. We’re making investments in store selling, we’ll give you more guidance about 2016 when we give guidance in February for the coming year. But again, know that we’re looking to grow expenses lower than sales. And I know it’s handy or helpful to have a breakpoint, but I’m just being transparent with you, it’s not as simple as [indiscernible] because it’s more dynamic than that and we manage it in a more dynamic way than that.",
            "Operator",
            "Your last question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.",
            "Oliver Chen",
            "As we look across holiday season for other retailers, a big theme is earlier promotions, the integration between online stores and buy online and pick up in store, as well as some degree of differences in the traffic patterns of the customers. I just wanted to get your highlights about how you're competing in that context and if you expect the holiday sales to be spread out, but I know you mentioned you're intensifying some of the marketing?",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "We’re not looking to go earlier or later. I think we want to be in a position to fundamentally follow last year’s pattern, but be in a position to react to the market and/or react to the customer in terms of the dynamics of that particular period. How that relates to the online channel, we’re pretty well integrated from a comparable product, comparable price, comparable promotion and that works really, really well for us. So we’ll leverage either channel depended upon what’s really going on in the market.",
            "Sharen Jester Turney",
            "We over the last I would say four years, five years, have seen the patterns of holiday being changed. What you see is that there is a big Black Friday weekend and leading up to the – tranches down a little bit in the last two weeks gets stronger and then continue through past-Christmas. I think that having seen these patterns, we’ve been – we’re very well positioned in our thinking, in our programs, how we deliver in merchandise to take advantage of those changes in the patterns.",
            "We also have had much alignment and are still aligned within our direct channel as well as our store channel. We believe the engagement in social and how we are looking at using our social media this year will be very important. So I think that we’re ready and I think the most important thing is that you just never know. There is always something that comes up and surprises you.",
            "And because of our – trying to make that we stay as agile as we can with our contingencies and out thinking and how we’re going to operate the business in holiday, I think we’re prepared for those. You never know, there are always some surprises. But we’re not really starting earlier, I think we understand where the big days are and where the traffic is going to be and that’s what we’re focused on.",

            "In an environment where a lot of retailers struggled, we delivered a record year and fourth quarter across all key metrics: sales, operating income, operating income rate and earnings per share. These results are a testament to the strength of our brands and our differentiation and a result of solid execution within our business and a focus on the fundamentals.",
            "While we managed the business conservatively, we utilized speed to chase back into what was working and maximize our opportunities. We improved our full year operating margin by 90 basis points to 18% and we grew operating income dollars by 12%. We also continued to return substantial value to shareholders. We increased our annual dividend by 20% to $2.40 per share. We declared a special dividend of $2 per share and authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program.",
            "Looking ahead to 2016, we're optimistic and confident in our opportunities for growth. As you know, we manage the business conservatively with respect to inventory and expenses to protect against any potential downside. Reflecting this mindset, the high end of our full year guidance implies a conservative view of mid-single digit percentage growth in operating income dollars and a decline in the operating income rate. We would not be satisfied with that outcome, and we will continue to leverage speed to chase back into what's working and deliver upside to our forecast. We remain committed to our goal of 10% or better annual growth in operating income dollars and an operating income rate in the high teens.",
            "Looking at the fourth quarter performance in more detail is described on page four of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 8% to $4.395 billion and comps increased 6% on top of 6% last year. The gross margin rate increased 50 basis points to 45.6%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy expense leverage, SG&A expense leveraged by 60 basis points.",
            "The operating income rate increased by 100 basis points to 24.5% and operating income dollars increased 13% to $1.078 billion. The tax rate in the quarter of 35.2% provided $0.08 of upside to our initial guidance. Earnings per share increased 14% to $2.15 versus $1.89 last year. Foreign currency had a negative impact of about $0.05 to 2015 fourth quarter EPS.",
            "Turning to our full year results on page 5, adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $3.99 versus $3.50 last year. FX negatively impacted full year 2015 results by about $0.13. Net sales increased 6% to $12.154 billion, and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. The gross margin rate increased 80 basis points to 42.8%, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate leveraged by 10 basis points.",
            "Page 7 details our full year operating income results. Our full year operating income rate was 18%, up 90 basis points to last year. Operating income dollars increased $238.4 million or 12% driven by growth in all three business segments.",
            "Turning to the balance sheet on page 8, retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 4% versus last year, down 6% on a two-year basis. Inventories are clean and well positioned. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot up in the mid-single digit range.",
            "Operating cash flow in 2015 was $1.869 billion, free cash flow was $1.142 billion, and capital expenditures were $727 million. We repurchased 5.5 million shares of stock in 2015 for $483 million.",
            "Our 2016 forecast is detailed on page 11, reflects actions we are taking to grow our business, growth in Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works real estate, including a new Victoria's Secret flagship store on Fifth Avenue, increase store selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates, incremental interest expense related to last October's note issuance and a higher tax rate.",
            "Our first quarter earnings forecast reflects a 2% to 4% comp increase including an updated February comp of up mid-single digits at Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. To be clear, the store-only comp is expected to be up mid-single digits at both Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works.",
            "The earlier Easter this year will negatively impact March comps and positively impact April. As noted in our press release beginning with our February sales release, we will include direct sales with reported comps consistent with industry practice. We expect the first quarter gross margin rate to be down to last year driven by some decline in the merchandise margin rate primarily driven by foreign exchange and buying and occupancy deleverage. We expect some deleverage in the SG&A rate driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs.",
            "We expect interest and other non-operating expense in the first quarter to be about $100 million. We expect earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.55 in the first quarter against last year's $0.61 result. This forecast includes a total negative impact of about $0.08 related to foreign currency, incremental interest expense and pre-opening cost for the flagship Fifth Avenue Victoria's Secret store.",
            "For the full year, we are projecting positive low single digit comps. Total sales growth will be about one to two points higher than comps due to growth in square footage. Foreign currency translation is expected to have a slight negative impact to total sales growth. We expect our full year gross margin rate to be down to last year driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy deleverage. The merchandise margin rate decline is driven primarily by the negative impact of foreign currency. Excluding this, we expect the merchandise margin rate to be about flat. We expect the full year SG&A rate to be about flat to last year.",
            "Non-operating expenses consisting principally of interest expense are projected to be about $390 million, about $0.12 a share higher than last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37% versus 36.2% in 2015. The higher projected tax rate in 2016 will negatively impact EPS by about $0.05.",
            "We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 292 million in the first quarter and the full year. The lower share count will benefit earnings per share year-over-year by about $0.08. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be between $3.90 and $4.10. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10. We're projecting 2016 CapEx between $900 million and a $1 billion. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.",
            "As detailed on page 13 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 13 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 5%, driven by 27 net new openings and 145 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 4%. Our increased investment in real estate will result in high single digit percentage increase in buying and occupancy expense in 2016, about 3 points higher than growth in 2015. The Victoria's Secret Fifth Avenue store will drive incremental expense related to pre-opening costs of about $30 million. Bath & Body Works will also see more pressure from buying and occupancy costs as a result of our investment in Bath & Body Works and White Barn remodels.",
            "Turning to liquidity, we expect 2016 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, result in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and any other foreseeable needs.",
            "Turning to Victoria's Secret, I would like to express our appreciation to Sharen for her leadership and all that she accomplished in her 16 years with the business. Victoria's Secret is well positioned for growth. We have a strong brand, great momentum, and a highly talented team that is capable of leading the brand to continued success.",
            "Now to turning to results, the Victoria's Secret segment had a strong fourth quarter, growing both sales and earnings to record levels. Total sales increased 9% to $2.6 billion, and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. Operating income increased $84 million, or 17%, to $593.6 million, and our operating income rate increased 150 basis points to 22.7%. Our focus on reading and reacting with speed and agility positioned us to get back into trends more quickly, and drove mid-teen growth in bras, high single digit growth in panties, and low 20%s growth in PINK loungewear.",
            "Specific to the key holiday time period in the quarter, we delivered record results, both Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday. We continue to reposition our Beauty category to be more consistent with the Victoria's Secret brand. Results for the business were down to last year, as expected. Merchandise margin dollars for the segment increased versus last year, driven by strength in both stores and direct. The rate was about flat to last year. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up to last year, in line with expectations, driven by planned investments in PINK and additional Beauty inventory to support the Fantasies restage.",
            "Now, let's turn to the specific channel performance, starting with stores. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance as sales and operating income increased to record levels, on top of record levels last year. Sales for the quarter increased 7% to $2 billion, and comps increased 5% on top of 4% last year. We were pleased with the customer response to our holiday storytelling, which linked a consistent theme across all our customer touch points. We also added an incremental bra launch to December, which is successful in driving newness and holiday right product for gifting and self-purchase. As a result, we had strong sales growth across our key businesses, bras, panties, sleepwear and PINK loungewear.",
            "Merchandise margin dollars also increased versus last year. Merchandise margin rate was about flat, as full price selling strength in PINK was offset by a planned sport event in January, declines in Beauty as we reposition this category, and an unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Both buying and occupancy and SG&A rates leveraged in the quarter as we remained focused on disciplined expense management. For the quarter, operating income dollars and rate both increased.",
            "Now, turning to the direct channel, strong performance during the holiday period drove record sales and operating income results in the direct channel. Fourth quarter sales increased 15% to $567 million, driven by strength across the assortment. Bras, panties, sleep, PINK, and sport all experienced double digit growth to last year. We fully anniversaried last year's exit from apparel during the fourth quarter. The merchandise margin rate and dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continued to distort to the core. Operating income dollars and rate increased significantly, driven by the sales increase, margin rate expansion and expense leverage.",
            "Turning to our full year results, total Victoria's Secret segment sales increased 6% to $7.7 billion. Operating income increased by $119 million, to $1.4 billion, and the operating income rate improved by 50 basis points to 18.1%. In the store channel, comps increased 5% with total store channel sales up 7%. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year with rate about flat. Total expenses leveraged versus last year. As a result, operating income dollars increased versus last year and the rate was about flat.",
            "In the direct channel, sales increased 3% as 16% growth in go-forward categories more than offset the exit of non-go-forward apparel sales last year. The merchandise margin rate increased, driven by the category mix benefit from the apparel exit and expenses leveraged. As a result, operating income rate and dollars were up significantly.",
            "Looking ahead to 2016, we will plan the business conservatively, while focusing on driving growth in our core categories and leveraging speed to read and react. We will continue to invest in real estate, store selling and digital enhancements to create an even better shopping experience for our customers.",
            "Thanks, and now I will turn the discussion over to Nick.",
            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - Chief Executive Officer, Bath & Body Works LLC",
            "Thanks, Stuart, and good morning, everyone.",
            "At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our record results during the quarter, building on record fourth quarter last year. We were able to drive solid growth in sales, while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down. Total sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 8% or $116 million to last year. Comps increased 6% and our direct channel sales grew by 24%. Sales were strong across the quarter and we were able to drive growth in each of our three key businesses: our Signature Collection product line, the Soap & Sanitizer business and our Home Fragrance assortment. Our concept of the perfect Christmas resonated well with our customers, and we were pleased with the acceptance of our holiday assortment, the visual appeal of our stores and the in-store execution of our plans. The momentum from holiday continued with a solid semiannual sale performance that built on last year's strong sales results. Promotional activity for the quarter was relatively flat to last year, and we were able to execute a plan that included fewer but more impactful activities that generated a strong response from our customers.",
            "For the quarter, operating income was $487 million, up 8% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 10 basis points to 32.1%, driven mainly by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, somewhat offset by increase in buying and occupancy expense as we continue our store investment program. Operating income for the quarter was negatively impacted by continued unfavorable foreign exchange pressure in our Canadian business. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW direct channel. Fourth quarter operating income grew significantly versus last year, and annual sales were over $360 million.",
            "For fiscal 2015, total sales grew by 7% versus last year and comps increased 5%. Operating income was $858 million, up 16% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 190 basis points to 23.9%, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate and expense leverage.",
            "Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2016, as you would expect, we will continue to monitor customer preferences and leverage the strength of our read and react capabilities allowing us to put the right product for full price selling in front of our customers at the right time. We will flow newness throughout the quarter beginning this month with our Let's go to Italy theme that features new and seasonal fragrances in our three key businesses. Our inventories are well positioned heading into the new year and are flexible enough to react to customers' preferences.",
            "We remain focused on making the appropriate investments in our business including the necessary increases in occupancy costs in order to continue our White Barn and Bath & Body Works remodel and expansion program.",
            "We have been pleased with the results to date of our White Barn format. We ended (21:13) 2015 with 67 of our stores in the format containing White Barn. Of the 27 net openings and 145 remodels that Stuart mentioned in his remarks, all will contain our White Barn concept either in a side by side, or a shop-in-shop format.",
            "And with that, I will turn the discussion over to Martin.",
            "Martin Waters - President, International",
            "Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We continue to be very confident about our opportunity for growth internationally. Our brands are well received wherever we open around the world and our execution has been excellent. Our foundation is very solid. We saw strong growth in retail sales on a constant currency basis across all of our formats in the fourth quarter. However, not all of this growth translated into recognized revenue. Fourth quarter recognized revenue in the international segment increased by 6% and operating income declined by $1.4 million to $28 million.",
            "Foreign currency had about a five-point impact on our recorded revenue growth and about a $3 million negative impact to operating income. We had very solid growth in both recognized revenue and operating income in our company owned stores in the UK, in our franchise or assortment stores and in our Bath & Body Works stores. However, the VSBA business experienced a significant decline in both revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter. This decline was primarily the result of foreign currency translation, softness in travel retail and tourism generally and a decline in shipments of Beauty products in anticipation of the new Victoria's Secret Fantasies collection being launched in the spring.",
            "In the full year 2015, the international segment revenue increased by 15% to $385.2 million and operating income increased by 13% to $87.9 million. FX negatively impacted 2015 operating income by about $15 million. So absent the FX impact, operating income would have increased 32% and the rate would have increased by 200 basis points to 25.2%.",
            "We opened 144 new stores in 2015 to end the year with 531 stores in the international segment, and we plan to open about 175 stores in 2016.",
            "At Victoria's Secret International, we're pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. Our London flagship store on Bond Street, as well as our 13 mall stores are operating very well and will open another five stores in the UK this year. In the Middle East, we now have 16 Victoria's Secret full assortment stores and three PINK stores opened under our partnership with Alshaya.",
            "These stores continue to do well, and we will open another 12 or so full assortment stores this year including in new geographies such as China, Mexico, Singapore and earlier this month, in Russia. We'll also open about five more PINK stores. In the VSBA business, we ended the year with 373 locations, about a third of which are in airports. We'll open another 90 or so across the globe in 2016.",
            "In Bath & Body Works, we now have 125 BBW stores under our franchise partnerships, and we continue to be very pleased with performance of these stores and expect to open another 65 or so BBW stores in the year ahead.",
            "So in summary, despite headwinds from foreign exchange, we made significant progress internationally in 2015 and we remain focused on the fundamentals which is great execution of our brands wherever we go.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Martin. That concludes our prepared comments, and at this time, we would be happy to take your questions. As a reminder, so that we can get to as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.",
            "Question-and-Answer Session",
            "Operator",
            "And your first question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.",
            "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC",
            "Great. Thank you. A great quarter and a really exceptional year, so congratulations. Stuart, my question is on the Q1 guidance and just looking out to 2016, can you just talk a little bit more if you have some direction on the amount of gross margin deleverage? How much of that is coming from pre-opening rent? And, is the big change in pre-opening rent in 2016 primarily related to the Fifth Avenue store, or are there other sort of chunky stores that are going to be working their way into the expense base through the year? Thanks so much.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Sure. In terms of the gross margin decline particularly in Q1, the deleverage in buying and occupancy is more significant than the merchandise margin decline. Again, the merch margin decline is largely a function of foreign currency, but the B&O deleverage is the more significant component. And the pre-opening related to Fifth Avenue is the biggest driver of that. As Nick commented on, though, however, we are, which we view as a very good thing, these investments are good investing in remodeling Bath & Body Works locations including White Barn elements. So, the B&O deleverage is the bigger part, to answer your question. The fact that we're building a global flagship on Fifth Avenue we view as a very positive thing. It certainly put some short-term pressure on the P&L, but for our business over the long-term, it's a terrific thing. It's going to be a great store. And again, the opportunity to remodel Bath & Bodies and include White Barn in those remodels is also a very good thing, but it puts some short-term pressure on the P&L.",
            "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC",
            "Thanks. Is the pressure...?",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Stuart. Yeah, go ahead, Kimberly.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Go ahead, Kimberly.",
            "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC",

            "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Stuart, I wanted to ask, you opened the call by talking about how you are planning the business for mid-single digit underlying profit growth, but you wouldn't be satisfied with it. You look for 10% plus; you're committed to it. I was curious what the drivers of meeting those targets this year would be in light of some of the incremental expenses? Is it you have to do better on comps than you have planned or are there other tools in your tool kit?",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Yeah, that's a great question. As you outlined the question, I mean getting a sales result better than what's inherent in the forecast is the most important thing at the end of the day. But we do have other tools in our tool kit, and while there are pressures whether it's currency or other things, Beauty at Victoria's, pressures on the merchandise margin line will continue to leverage our speed tools and work to get some further improvement related to that in our big businesses. And we manage expenses in a tough-minded way. And we're clear-minded about growing expenses in aggregates lower than sales and some of those things we can adjust more quickly than others, but we're not looking to go backwards on our operating income rate, which is what would be implied by this guidance, I realize. But starting with Les and the other leaders in the business, we're not of a mindset where we go backwards on profit rate.",

            "Great. And just to quickly follow up. In the past, when you've had reporting changes, I'm thinking specifically when Canada moved into North America and away from being a separate entity, it actually reflected some internal changes in how you thought about the business, whereas before, there were a wall between the two. Now, they work together. At least that was my impression. Is the reporting of direct comps with store comps similarly a reflection of how you might be thinking about the businesses?",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Not so much, to be honest with you, Lindsay. And this change got some good debate within the business, and you may have heard me speak previously about some of our views on it. At the end of the day, we were the clear outlier in the industry. And folks externally were trying to estimate what our comps would be with direct in it, as everybody else in the industry does. So that's why we made the change. There's no signaling about the trend of our business. There's no significant change organizationally or how we think about the business. We've always thought about the business from a customer first standpoint, and this change in reporting is solely to follow the trend in the industry. We were the only one, as we could understand it, that was not including direct in comps and that's why we made the change. There's nothing else, nothing else to interpret from it.",

As you're aware, we've made changes to the product line that we call Fantasies, mists and body lotions and body creams. And we think we elevated the product to be more consistent with the emotional content of the Victoria's Secret brand. But there's more work to do to continue to elevate product at Victoria's Secret Beauty, and to ensure that we get the other elements of merchandising in line with that elevation, whether it's about how it's displayed in the store, how it's sold in the store, its pricing, we will be looking at all those things.

We like our read and react capabilities. We were happy with being slightly less promotional, and the mix of the business was healthy. If I think about 2016, it's really going to be about trying to ensure that we continue to grow whilst taking into consideration the investments that we're making into real estate from both a White Barn and Bath & Body Works perspectives that will obviously put some pressure into the business. And that is really about leveraging two things. One is the natural strength – on the ongoing strength that we have had at the Home business and, of course, the necessity to keep the fleets looking as good as possible. So that's really where our attention is going to be, is making sure that top line continues to perform well so we can continue to afford the investments that we're making.",

That would be helpful. Thanks.",

            "Omar, it's Stuart. I mean, the business is performing incredibly well. So, let's just start with that. I mean, the merchandising, the sales growth, the margin results, the momentum in that business, the strength in that business is terrific. As I think we have been relatively clear about over time, the specifics on real estate are largely a function of what's going on mall-by-mall. Our views about expanding square footage for PINK haven't changed at all, meaning we believe that there's substantial sales growth and profit growth opportunity adding more square footage for PINK, and we'll continue to do that through a combination of remodels and freestanding PINKs. But there will be year-to-year variation in the number of freestanding PINKs versus growth through remodels. That again, is a function of mall-by-mall circumstances that are in front of us.",

Kind of comparable to last year, really, in terms of the overarching both flow of how we think about how we're flowing merchandise and also probably around the level of newness that we anticipate. There's no major shift as it relates to sale timing or launch periods. There's probably an opportunity to think about how we performed in November/December Christmas timeframe, and the timing associated with the flow of that, but from a material change, nothing of a significant magnitude.",

            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - Chief Executive Officer, Bath & Body Works LLC",
            "Hey, Paul. So, we are constantly looking at pricing through the lens of both customer acceptance from a product perspective, as well as what elasticity we think we have in both ticket price as well as promotional price. And as you know, over the course of the last couple of years, we have taken some ticket increases that we haven't had any barrier to. And I think our ongoing goal is always to think about how do we get paid for the innovation that we put in, how do we get paid for the newness in a way that gets us to full price selling.",
            "As it relates to whether we think we have power, I think in both our Signature business as well as our Home business as we continue to see strength in it, there's obviously opportunity to look at how are we priced and is there an opportunity for either price up or more aggressive full price selling. And that's typically par for the course in terms of how we actually think about running the business on a day-to-day basis. So, price is obviously top of mind for us.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "As it relates to Victoria's Secret, I think it's generally true for the company. I mean the pricing power starts with the power of the brand and the differentiation that we provide through the brand, through the store experience, through the merchandise. And I would say the balance point as we think about it is always being mindful of reinvesting in the product and being thoughtful about driving transactions in units versus rate. And I think the business, including at Victoria's Secret, works hard to strike that balance and has a range of pricing evaluations including good, better, best pricing and so on.",
            "So, yeah, I think we look at pricing carefully. The particular area that we're thinking about and I imagine a number of retailers are as it relates to foreign exchange, how does one think about pricing? I don't have any specific comment on that but you would appreciate that we're thinking about that, but the pricing power starts with the brand and it runs with newness and speed and we try to balance velocity and rate.",

I think in the prepared remarks, you guys commented that the revenue and profit was down and a lot of that was currency. But could you comment a little bit more because there's 100 more VSBAs than there were last year. I'm just kind of curious if you ex out the currency and whatnot, the organic trend of that business. And also I think in the guidance you're planning to close 10 of them. I don't know if I've ever seen you guys put that out. And could you just give us more color on that? What areas are that – the tourist focused areas? Just kind of interested what's going on with VSBA. Thanks.",
            "Martin Waters - President, International",
            "Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ike. So just to dimension how VSBA fits into the segment as a whole, there are four businesses – as a reminder, there are four businesses within the international segment. So there's the Victoria's Secret full assortment owned stores in the UK, the full assortment stores under the franchise business, the Bath & Body Works international business under franchise arrangements, and there's VSBA. Three of those four businesses had very strong year and very strong quarter.",
            "As you rightly point out, our problem in the segment was VSBA. And I'll tell you there are three drivers of that difficulty as I said in the pre-prepared remarks and they are about in equal measure. One is FX which impacts both recognized revenue and operating income. The second is a general softness in travel retail. Particularly people from Russia, from China and tourist destinations that are related to the Middle Eastern security pressures there have been affected and I think that has been written about widely across the travel retail industry. And the third, which we absolutely own and take responsibility for is weakness in our Victoria's Secret Beauty business, particularly related to the Fantasies re-launch, and that affected our business globally.",
            "To the questions about how we feel about the fundamentals of the business and store closures, feel very, very, very good about VSBA. It's a very profitable business, has a lot of runway ahead of it. It tees up the brand internationally very well for us. And we will continue to increase our footprint in that business. The closures and I think there will be maybe 10. We're guessing. We can see about five right now and we're positioning that it may be up to 10, come from a number of things. One is, on occasion, we close a VSBA in order to replace it with a VSFA. S",
            "o it's put a big store where a small store was. That's good news. That's a really good thing. Second is the nature of travel retail is that these leases tend to be three-year leases. So just by normal course of business, some of our stores that are five years old or more will be coming up for renewal. And other times, they're just relocations. So there's nothing sinister in the closure numbers. We have a lot of confidence in the business and the foundations are strong.",

It's on the Beauty side of the business in terms of getting faster and there's work happening to get after that opportunity. But PINK is very fast. Lingerie has made substantial progress and is also very fast and inherently a little more complicated given the more complicated construction of its bras and things like that versus the PINK assortment. So lingerie has also made very good progress. And to be clear, I think the biggest opportunity – we think the biggest opportunity in speed at Victoria's is in the Beauty side of the business.",

I think the balance point is – and so there's opportunity there, but the balance point is how it sequences and prioritizes versus something like the selling initiative that we have got going on in our stores. And one of the things that we try to be very disciplined about is being focused in our business. And there is no doubt that there's opportunity in click-and-collect and driving more footsteps to the stores, but I think the balance point is we also see very substantial opportunity growing sales in stores through more effective selling. And so, I think we'll get to those things over time.

So, I think on an ongoing basis, whenever we can, we're very, very focused on, one, how do we maximize price point but also at the same time look for the margin gains that come with that. And so we've seen a couple of things work well for us. We have been slightly less promotional overall, playing with the price points and that has absolutely helped margin. But we've only really been able to do it because of product acceptance. So we think about how our number one goal is really putting a product out that she likes and trying to get it to full price. And in certain businesses we have seen very, very good traction. So we've seen AUR up but we've also seen obviously margin rates come along with that, and if we can get to that magic place of continuing to pull back less promotion, we know that that's a brand equity building play for us.",

And so our activity has been significant over the last three years to five years in terms of remodeling stores, and we have made progress. And we will continue to make progress in 2016 with a lot of projects. We obviously wouldn't look to have the full assortment in all stores. So we'll use our business judgment about tiering assortments based on the venue and the sales potential. But we'll continue to make good progress in 2016 given the real estate activity we've got for Victoria's Secret in North America.",

            "And then separately, just a quick follow-up for Martin. Appreciate all the additional color on the drivers of international performance. Just any help on how we should be thinking about the growth rates and margin profile of that segment in 2016? Thank you.",

            "So on Victoria's Secret leadership, Les has always been involved in the business and as you would understand from our announcements, he'll be substantially more involved in the business. As things develop in 2016, we will be looking for ways to simplify and focus that organization. Do we have specifics? Absolutely not. Is that our mindset? Generally, in our business, it is. But in terms of the detail of that, we've got a great leadership team, as I mentioned earlier. What we are most focused on are things that impact the customers, so merchandise and speed and doing things in stores and online well. But certainly, the business will look at ways to simplify and focus things as we move forward.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks. And, Martin?",
            "Martin Waters - President, International",
            "Yes. I think in terms of growth on international, we are pretty transparent in the analyst pack on page 15 about where the store growth will come from. If it helps to interpret that, the biggest area of growth for us in 2016 will be in the full assortment business. So we will have our biggest year of store openings ever by some distance and the complexity of that will increase significantly as we're opening in new markets with new partners that we haven't operated with before. So as I mentioned, we have Russia that already opened earlier this month, we have Mexico coming, we have China, we have Singapore. We're actively looking at real estate in lots of other geographies as well. So I think you will see a real ramp-up in the full assortment store participation of the business.",
            "How you model for that? I recognize it's tricky. You've got four businesses and you've got three different models, owned, royalty and wholesale. It's difficult to do. I would say, overall, you should expect our revenue growth to be below that of our store growth as the stores are skewed to smaller stores. And if it was around the 20%, I think that's where I would expect it to be.",

            "Yeah. A question regarding White Barn. I think mid last year when you had roughly 60 of these locations, if I recall, you were comping up around 25%. And I'm wondering if that – did that trend continue through the end of the fiscal year? And do you think that's sustainable as you remodel the 140 plus for the current year?",
            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - Chief Executive Officer, Bath & Body Works LLC",
            "Hi. Good morning. So, yes and yes. So, we continue to like the trend of that business. Hence, as we mentioned, we're rolling obviously more of them out next year. I want to preface, obviously, when you hear that kind of number, it's a range. We see a range of all sorts of performances. On average, we very much like the performance that's happened and they've continued to be good.",
            "And so, as we think about 2016, obviously, we have got more stores rolling and our number one goal is to maintain the comp in the business, period. And then, obviously, the comp performance that we've seen in those White Barn stores primarily because of the investment that we have made. But yes, we like the results from last year. We like the results currently. And obviously, we will do what we do really well, which is, we will read and react and we will monitor it. So, we won't just continue to go blindly if things change, but so far, so good.",

            "Thanks very much. And a question about my favorite division, La Senza. You noticed, or I noticed, the expansion into the U.S. and wondering what's inspired the investment in La Senza and what we should look for in the U.S. in terms of product mix, differentiation from Vicky and especially the PINK business. Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston - Chief Investor Relations Officer",
            "Thanks, Richard. We'll go to Martin for that question.",
            "Martin Waters - President, International",
            "Thanks, Richard. I'm glad it's your favorite segment. Mine too. So we continue to make really good progress in La Senza. We have had a multi-quarter run of positive comps, very strong sales performance, really driven by being faster to market, more fashion right, and zeroing in on the customer with a young, sexy, obvious value positioning. And that positioning is what really differentiates it from both PINK and from Victoria. And in markets around the world where we see the three lingerie brands present, we know that they trade effectively alongside each other. They appeal to different customers and where they appeal to the same customer in different shopping modes and different moods, it's all good.",
            "So, yes, we're excited to bring La Senza to the U.S. We will open probably five stores in the fall, first stores opening in November. Not particularly material in terms of the CapEx as those stores are only 2,000 square feet in space. Not particularly material in terms of pre-opening costs, but very significant in terms of the future growth opportunity that that represents. We won't get too far ahead of ourselves in claiming victory. It's just a test. And we'll call it over the holiday period and we will report back in January, but certainly, very exciting progress for the brand.",

            "Hey. Good morning. So with the direct business now having inflected to the positive side, what's the best way to think about leverage points in 2016 and then beyond, both on the buying and occupancy and then on the SG&A from a fixed cost comp hurdle?",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President",
            "Yeah. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, occupancy will be growing at a faster rate in 2016. So, as it relates to that part of our cost structure, the leverage point is higher. And then, as it relates to the direct business in terms of its overall impact on leverage points, not a significant effect. The biggest effect is our investment in real estate in 2016 and growing at a high single digit rate above the growth rate from 2015.",

            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning everyone. Although we delivered first quarter results above our initial expectations, we were not satisfied with our overall results, as adjusted operating income declined to 4% compared to last year, primarily driven by a decline at Victoria's Secret. We had a range of performance across the company in the first quarter with PINK and Bath & Body Works delivering strong results and weaker performance at Victoria's Secret lingerie and Beauty. From a macro perspective, we did experience a deceleration in trends through the quarter but we are focused on what we can control and we have opportunities to improve our execution.",
            "It's important to note that we have made significant changes in the last couple of months at Victoria's Secret. Making organizational and leadership changes, exiting merchandize categories, exiting nearly 300 people from the business and changing our promotional strategy. We're making these changes proactively from a position of strength and following a record fourth quarter and 2015 for the brand. Our revised outlook for 2016 will reflect the impact of the actions at Victoria's Secret as well as incremental cost related to our plans to develop China as a company owned business. Our brands are strong and we're energized about our opportunities for growth. We will continue to leverage these in the business and be flexible and agile in our approach in order to maximize profitability. ",

            "Nick Coe",
            "Thanks, Stuart. So I think the only comment I would add from the notes that went out last night is I've sent an amount of time in the stores over the course of the past few weeks so I’ll comment on those observations. And I think firstly we remain pleased with the traffic and the energy that we're seeing in the stores. Secondly we appear to be keeping customers pretty engaged through the newness and the compelling stores that we're telling, which is really important for us when you think about the destination brands that we really need to continue to keep engaged.",
            "Thirdly for the most part, pretty pleased with customers' response to products and assortments on our collection. I think we can do better but pretty happy from that perspective. As it relates to speed, really pleased with our ability to have been able to leverage the speed model into --our ability to chase in the home business and that's been important for us not only because it's the most difficult business to chase into but also because it's still very, very healthy business for us. And were pretty pleased in terms of what we're seeing from the real estate investment and the type of return that we're getting there. So again we're relatively pleased with what's happening there and will continue to monitor that and we think we act as, as we would. And then finally as we see the marketplace remains pretty dynamic, we'll continue to leverage our most important discipline which is really the motionless thing as close as we can to the customer and then reading and reacting to help behavior.",

Although there's still much to do, I'm really enthused about the teams that we put together for China and the progress that we've made in resonance for the launch of our full assortment stores at the end of this year and also our direct to consumer business which will open later this year in China. I'm also very focused on growing our existing businesses in the UK which have been good and in the Middle-East which have been tough recently, as well as on improving performance in the VSBA business. All in all, I feel good about our prospects for growth and of course remain focused on the fundamentals which is also that great execution of our brands wherever we go in the world. Thank you.",

            "Hi Christina Brathwaite on for Matt. Thanks for taking our question. Would the goal of replacing this preliminary product apparel merchandise, can you just walk through some of the puts and takes of exiting those businesses on this year and any quantification -- pressure that you are expecting in the SG&A reduction would be helpful.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Christina. We'll go to Stuart.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. The rational first of all for the category exits is to focus our energy at all levels of the business, our resources at all levels of the business on our most significant core categories, bras, panties, beauty in the Victoria's Secret business. And we made a conclusion -- come to a conclusion that this one business was not one of those core categories that had been flattish business for the last several years, many years and we're putting our energy against those core categories to accelerate growth in bras, panties and Beauty. It is going to put some pressure on the business along with some of the promotional changes that we're making, less direct mail couponing, et cetera, but as you outlined in your question, we have some expanse savings that we've actioned as well including the elimination of the catalogue spend and a meaningful reduction in our home office overhead, which in part offsets the sales and profit pressure from the category exists and the impact of the promotional changes that we’re implementing. But at the end of the day as outlined in our commentary that we send out last night and the brief remarks we’ve made this morning. We’re making these changes from a position strength to accelerate growth in these core categories and there will be some short-term financial pressure as outlined in our guidance both for Q2 and the full year. But we’ll then work hard to beat that guidance as you would imagine and we’re absolutely confident that these changes are the right thing to do for the long-term health of Victoria’s Secret and again to accelerate growth in that business.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "And Christina I just want to clarify something. In your question you said we were exiting athletic apparel. That’s actually -- what we are exiting is apparel that we are now selling in the direct channel that is not carried in the stores. So it’s things like T-shirts, sweaters, boots for example. So we’re still very focused on growing our sport and athletic business.",
            "Christina Brathwaite",
            "Right, I misspoke. I think, I was trying to say, you’ve replacing athletic apparel or tilting that, or replacing it with more additional athletic apparel?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. Again we’re not exiting athletic apparel. Just to be clear, we’re not exiting athletic apparel. We believe strongly in the sport category. Our primary focus in that category is in sport bras, but we sell a lot of sport pants and related sport merchandise and we have strong belief in that category and we’re realizing good sales growth in that business. So we’re existing non-athletic apparel at Victoria’s Secret direct that is not carried in the store.",

            "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.",
            "Brian Tunick",
            "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess two questions. One, I guess Stuart, do you view 2016 being the resetting year or do you think there is potential, more pressure in 2017? I guess do you think you can grow earnings again next year? And then the second question really is on the expected traffic impact on pulling back from these promos. You’ve mentioned macro a lot in the script. And just wondering what’s going on in the core lingerie business, yet you feel confident you can pull back on some of these promos and still drive improving comps?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So Brian, I appreciate you asking me the question about kind of is 2016 a reset year and then how do we think about 2017. One of the things I love about working for our Company and love this point to be most significantly, but the leadership team, our point of view is that while we’ve reset guidance and I’m not altering that guidance in mindset, this isn’t a reset year at all.",
            "So we’re going to have some challenge in the near-term and we’ve done our best to outline that in our guidance. But I’ll tell you starting at the top and with some acknowledgment of short-term pressure, we’re going to work very hard to exceed that guidance and in no way do we have in our mind that 2016 is kind of reset year with no growth. Again the guidance is the guidance, but you should know and known us for long time, our mindset is we’re going to work very hard to drive great experiences for customers, very strong sales growth and resulting profit growth.",
            "So I’m glad you asked the question, and obviously from that expecting very good 2016 after some short-term pressure. Again the guidance is the guidance and then certainly expect a very, very good 2017. So good question. With respect to the traffic generated from direct mail couponing, we’re working hard to replace that volume and that profit. And again we’re doing it for reasons that I think you appreciate from our earlier remarks in terms of doing promotion that drives trial in key categories, and at the end of the day is healthier, we believe for the business. But in the short-term it’s challenged, but we’re doing a lot of things in terms of test and rolling different ideas to ensure that we have healthy traffic and good sales results and that will be a week-to-week, month-to-month exercise listing, very actively worked on Mondays and Tuesdays every week and with good test and learning and adjustment.",
            "Again another thing I really enjoy about the company and respect about the company is that we test, we read, we react, we are agile in our thinking and in our execution and its more dynamic right now than typical, no doubt about that, but I’m confident that we’ll read and react and adjust appropriately.",

            "Richard Jaffe",
            "Thanks very much. I guess two-part question. The lost sales you described at 525 million. Could you just give us a sense of how that will breakout apparel and shoes in the direct channel and the swimwear from both direct and store. So the impact on stores versus direct? And then if you could just comment on how this is different from 2014 when you consolidated the store with the catalogue and eliminated a number of merchandize categories at that time.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So the biggest component of that -- Richard, thanks for the question -- is the swim business. And it distorts or mixes higher to the direct channel versus the store's channel. The apparel that were exiting that we commented on early in the call, that solely indirect and the swim business was larger in the direct channels and in the store channel. I'm not going to go deep on numbers but directionally that would be the way to think about it and that's how that's how it frames. What was your second part?",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Yes. How's it different from 2015 [ph.].",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thank you. So what's different about this versus the earlier exits Richard is that truly now with these changes, we will only sell merchandize in the direct channel that's sold in the store. And while we made important exits, as we all remember earlier we still had merchandize stalls and categories that were sold online that weren’t sold in the store and with this set of changes the offering will be truly the same, online as different stores and part of that frankly has been drive to take our complexity and simplify the business and focus the business. But that's how I characterize it.",

            "Kimberly Greenberger",
            "Stuart. My question is on inventory. Here at the third quarter I think you said is up 3% at retail and I think you got mid-single growth at the end of Q2 has been a touch higher than your inventories been running. I'm wondering if you can comment, are there some pockets of excess inventory here in the first half of the year that you think you need to work through in the second half and sort of medium to longer-term what sort of inventory growth rate do you think is appropriate for the business.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So our thinking about the inventory and inventory discipline hasn’t changed, and I'm not saying that because it's convenient. It just hasn’t changed. With that said we are experiencing some short-term sales pressure for the reasons described in the context of the sales. So Kimberly it's going to be up mid-single as we outlined. In terms of any significant pockets of inventory that we're concerned about -- we're not -- and we're very focused on ending the spring season clean and at the right levels and that's requiring some pretty intensive energy right now. But it's a discipline that's very important to us and while mid singles are a little ahead of sales, certainly not dramatically ahead of sales and we were working it actively to get to that result. But again not intending to have any significant pockets of inventory in the business that we won't have dealt with through the semiannual sale activity as we wrap up the spring season.",

            "Dana Telsey",
            "As you think about Victoria's Secret business, and the people and product changes, how do you think about the guide posts of how that business changes go forward with its new product introductions, how are you thinking about integrating loyalty and what does this mean for the long-term top line growth of the business. Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, I mean Dana, at the risk of thing repetitious, which I'm certainly not intending to be, we're making important changes to the business. So just again to step back in an effort to respond to your question we think that reorganizing the business into three units; Victoria's Secret lingerie, Victoria's Secret Pink and Victoria's Secret Beauty, each of which have the stores and direct activity under common leadership for those three businesses, we think that's an important change in organization that will simplify and focus the business on those three broad categories. ",
            "In terms of guide posts or objectives, the purpose of all it is to ensure that we're focused and to accelerate growth in core categories. Obviously Pink has been our strongest performing business over the last several years and that sales trend, that sales performance has continued in 2016. Beauty has been the weakest of the three businesses, and as we shared in our commentary, a new leader joining the business at the beginning of this month, and it will take some time, a logical question we get asked understandably within and outside the business is how long will it take to substantially improve the term of that business, and it is a bit longer in lead time and cycle and approach development activity than some of our other categories, but with new leadership and again the focus through the organizational changes I mentioned certainly optimistic that we'll see an improvement in trend there.",
            "And then the lingerie business is the core in terms of bras and panties, a new leader coming in at the beginning of September with very substantial experience and an existing strong leadership team. So an additional resource in leadership -- leader coming in to strength in that team, but coming from a good base, and again optimistic through these changes that it will accelerate growth and all the measures, whether customer satisfaction, sales growth, margin improvement, inventory turn, those are all the things that we'll be driving towards.",

            "I was wondering, if you can talk a little bit about the thinking behind China making it company owned versus franchise, and sort of the timing what now and kind of when we can expect some contribution from that business? I know that there's already been 26 stores? Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Betty, we’ll go to Martin for that.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Hi Betty, thanks for the question. Yes, China is obviously a massively important market for us. We’ve been very engaged in the last 12 months with our partner, who've done a terrific job. Really they did a great job and standing up some 26 VSBA stores. But as we look forward, and we think about the shift scaling opportunity of the market and we combine that with the complexity -- the intrinsic complexity that there is in China, particularly around regulatory affairs, around how we build our stores, how we operate those stores, it seems to me that we’re going to be doing most of the heavy lifting anyway. It makes sense that we should be in it completely.",
            "So when can you expect this should start to make a contribution? Well the sales contribution will start at the very end of this year. From a profit point of view, I don’t really know. Our experience in the UK is that it takes two to three years to get a business from the investment phase to the profitable phase. And it really depends on the amount of time that we take to build it. Our goal here is to be in it for the very long-term rather than to take short-term gains. Hope that gives you some insight.",
            "Betty Chen",
            "Martin, do you see the customer behaving any differently than you've seen in the U.S. or elsewhere?",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Well, the business that we’ve got right now is the beauty business and that performs remarkably similarly to the rest of the VC business globally. One of the neat tricks about the VSBA businesses is it’s a replication model of what we do here and the sales patterns that we see are very broadly similar everywhere. To the extent that lingerie will be different, well, don’t really know. Find out at the end of the year, when we open the stores and you’ll be the first to know if u call me.",

            "Paul Trussell ",
            "Just wanted to ask a question regarding the catalog. You mentioned that you had tested over the past year reducing the distribution. Maybe you can just give us a little bit more insight on the results of that test and thoughts overall around catalog impact. And then just secondly, with the sales guidance adjustment that was made to flattish comps, can you just speak more specifically about where that down take occurred? Is this simply a slowdown expected across each of the banners equally or to what extent is this more of a beauty biz step down lingerie et cetera?",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Great, okay. So with respect to catalog, we did test the elimination of catalog into significant markets for a year, and saw a relatively small to no impact on sales. And if one does simple math on it, need to get a lot of sales or meaningful amount of sales to take for the catalog. And round numbers, we were spending $125 million to $150 million a year on the catalog and we ran it again for a year and two significant markets, and didn’t see a significant change in sales. Separately, and I think importantly for the whole business in the fourth quarter 2015, we reduced our catalog activity by nominally 40%, and demand in the direct channel was up, if I remember right about 15%. So both based on two markets every tested and significant reduction in activity in our fourth quarter last year for the whole business, it made us confident that while there might be some sales pressure certainly from an operating income standpoint meaning that it paid for itself on NOI basis, we felt that this was an appropriate change to make in our business. Importantly one of the things that we try to do as we say, if we were starting this business today in current context 2016, would you start with, one of your major ideas being a catalog, a paper based catalog sent through the mail, as one of your key if not your key marketing activity for a global brand. And as we thought about it in that way, along with the numerical test and financial evaluation, very comfortable with the change that we’ve made.",
            "Separately, with respect to your second question on sales guidance and the reduction in comp guidance, I’m glad you asked. It’s important to know that as we outlined in our overall remarks, that we have a range of performance in our business. So in terms of the sales reduction, we haven’t changed our assumptions about Bath & Body Works at all. Bath & Body Works grew operating income 15% in the first quarter. There will be some occupancy pressure in that business in the latter half of the year in connection with the remodel activity for the wipe on in Bath & Body remodels, but Bath & Body is running a very good business.",
            "As we also outline the PINK business, very strong. So I wouldn’t want outside analysts or investors to think that L Brands has a broad based concern about sales trends. We actually have important parts of our business, most notably Bath & Body Works and PINK that are doing very, very well and we've got some pressure in other parts of our business, in part due to changes that we're making in terms of category exits and reduction in promotional activity, but some weakness in the Beauty business that we've been experiencing now for some time. So a range of performance -- overall, yes we've taken our numbers down but it's on it's due to various specific things in only certain portions of our business. Thank you.",

            "Thanks. Next question, please?",

            "Your next question is from Anne-Charlotte Windal of S C. Bernstein. Your line is open.",
            "Anne-Charlotte Windal ",
            "Two questions if I may. So the first one is a big picture question. So we're picking the long-term view. What does the VS business look like in five years down the road? So what's the contribution from PINK, Lingerie, Beauty, Sports and where would you like this business to be in terms of operating margin. And then I was on wondering if you could also give us a little bit more detail on the impact from the category exit. So if you could help us think through the seasonality of this $525 million business that you are exiting, what's the cadence of the exit and the expected impact to the comps in the back half of this year, and then through a fiscal 2017 as well? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Okay, so in terms of what's the Victoria's Secret business looks like in aggregate and advising [ph] the major component five years from now as a mindset and in terms of goals that we aspire to in our business, in many periods we accomplish, we're looking to grow the top line sales in major parts of our business on the low side at 5% per year and on the high side when we're really doing well 10% or 15% per year. So in terms of what are we trying to get done top line wise over the next five years, it would be growth ranging from 5% to 15% depending upon category and frankly how well we execute. ",
            "In terms of the operating income rate for the Victoria's Secret business, this is one of the best brands in the world, and from that brand equity, emotional content leadership position, when we execute really well, we have pricing power. We deliver emotion, great customer experiences, differentiated from competition and that creates pricing power which ultimately creates productivity and margin. And so with that belief, and we got to work hard to continue that leadership position, we believe the operating income rate for Victoria's Secret should absolutely be high teens, if not 20% when we think about our own history and the best in the world. So hopefully that gives you some sense of our thinking and what our goals are over the next five years.",
            "In terms of the exists and their seasonality, we will sell through the swim that we have -- the swimsuit business that we have in stores in the spring season and to the extent that we have some swim inventory remaining after spring, we'll sell that through the fall season 2016 in the direct channel, that's our current thinking and our current plan. With respect to the apparel exit, again that's mostly or fully I should say in the direct channel and we'll sell that both in the spring season and to some extent into the fall season. So we're looking to -- particularly in the store side of the business move through the inventory. This is about swim at pretty reasonable taste to simplify store level execution and frankly to pre up space through other categories like core Bras and sport and other things, but we won't be as urgent with respect to the swim and non-go forward apparel exit in direct because it doesn’t create the same kind of complexity from an operational standpoint in that channel. So in terms of dollarizing that by a quarter, it's going to be more dynamic but hopefully that's helpful to you in an overall modeling sense. ",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks. Next question, please?",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Your line is open.",
            "Lorraine Hutchinson",
            "Stuart, the comments around the catalogue testing were very helpful. Can you provide any color around what you've done to test cutting the promotional cadence and what results you've seen there? And then what portion of the $525 million of discontinued categories will hit revenues this year versus next?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. With respect to the change and promotion and testing of that, we have pretty reasonable measurement of attached sales and the view of incremental sales related to our historic promotions, meaning we have pretty good analytics around what we got from that activity historically. And what we’re doing now as I think you appreciate is we’re looking to replace that activity, which was -- we called it customer relationship management. What it really was, was couponing through the mail in many respects. And we’re looking to substitute that with various category level promotions in particular that drive trial of key categories.",
            "That activity and the results from that new activity or being evaluated every week and so that will be dynamic. And while the nature of the offers that we utilize through direct mail, which most typically were a free panty and $10 off of a bra, we concluded that A, we’ve been running that for a long time; B, a lot of customers came and they got the free panty and didn’t buy anything else. And so we think there is a clever way, a smarter way to drive traffic that's more healthy for the brand. The details of that are being literally worked every week, including test key promotional ideas in the business.",
            "So hopefully that gives you some sense. It would be easy to return to the prior approach and we know what it’s worth. We have a pretty good sense of what it’s worth. What’s important here is we’re making important changes in the promotional approach to the business for the long-term health of the business. It wouldn’t be hard to turn that stuff back on in our collective judgment. But the right thing to do for this business is to have smarter ideas about driving trial and driving traffic versus get a free panty and $10 off a bra.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "And Lorraine, I'll try to help a little bit with that $525 million of exited sales. So I’d say this is very big picture high level, that about two-thirds of that is swim and the remainder is apparel. As you can expect, we typically sell most of our swim business in the first half of the year and we still have that product that we’re selling through this year. So that impact will be more fully felt in 2017. The apparel business, we’re winding that down through this year. So we’ll see some of that impact in the back half of this year and then the remainder in the first half of next year.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "And Amie is outlining it particularly on a sales standpoint. There will be some margin pressure in 2016 and it's completed in our guidance. So margin pressure in ’16, margin rate pressure related to the exit activity that we're talking.",
            "Amie Preston ",

            "Omar Saad",
            "Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping maybe you could dive in a little bit more detail around the Victoria’s Secret Lingerie category, what’s going on there. Especially in bras, I’m wondering, if you could specifically maybe address the braless trend? Is that something that's significant, lower price point or maybe higher units. Any greater details around the category outside of the macro would be helpful and where you think the opportunity to improve it is.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, Omar, thanks. So first of all, our total bra business, lingerie, PINK, store and direct, grew in the first quarter. So in aggregate, all types of bras across both channels had positive sales growth, high low-single-digits in the first quarter. There are fairly some trends in the business including the braless trend that you mentioned and I think is well known and being well covered and we’re participating in that trend in a big way, as you would expect a market leader or the market leader to do. And frankly that’s -- there's nothing new about that. We’re in a business that has different fashion trends from time-to-time. And hopefully in most cases, we’re leading those trends or certainly taking good advantage of those trends, and things like sport bras or braless, we think we’re participating well with respect to those trends.",
            "So again total bra business including PINK up, certainly some changes in trend that you comment on that we’re participating in. And we’re working -- we’re not satisfied with a bra business. We want to grow faster than that and particularly in the core lingerie part of it and it’s not a sick business but it’s not growing at the rate we want. And it's so core to this business that that's in part why we’re making some of the organizational and leadership changes that we've talked about.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Omar. Next question, please?",

            "Your next question is from Anna Andreeva of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.",
            "Anna Andreeva",
            "I guess the question to Stuart on SG&A, an increase in the guidance for the year from previous for flat, I guess help us reconcile of that despite the additional savings from catalogues and headcount reductions and should we expect additional SG&A opportunity in 2017? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "The SG&A guidance is expressed on a rate basis, a percent of sales basis and what you are noticing in a change is the effect of us lowering our sales assumptions. So on a dollar basis not a meaningful change from the view that we had roundly three months ago. We will continue to mine for expense opportunities as we've outlined. We have reduced the home office at Victoria's Secret in a meaningful way, by the way a tough thing to do as a business leader and as business people. But from time to time we make difficult decisions for the long-term health of the business. That would be an example of more than but we'll continue to be tough minded about expenses and again the change you're are seeing in the guidance is largely about a change in sales assumption versus the change in expense assumptions.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "And Anna just to clarify one thing in your question, so catalogue costs actually are on buying and occupancy and therefore you are going to see that as a reduction to SG&A. Next question, please?",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.",
            "Lindsay Drucker Mann",
            "I wanted to clarify, to the degree that you've decided to get rid of the bunch of different types of promotions and then we'll figure out other better high quality ways to engage the consumer going forward, was the elimination of those specific promotions, did that happen completely in May or as we think about balance of year, is there maybe sort of a gradual step forward process where the headwind from reduced promos intensifies as we get deeper into the year. And then maybe just to tackle on a second one on a different angle, just given your high level view of the world, I was hoping Stuart, maybe you could give some perspective on what you think might be going on with the consumer right now? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. So with respect to the promotional changes and particularly the direct mail promotions that we've changed, we came to a conclusion about that or a decision about that in late march which we implemented beginning in April. But as you would appreciate Lindsay, the specific activities that we're lapping or anniversarying from last year varies by month and there is a meaningful amount of activity in May of 2015 that we're lapping and again it does vary from that month. So didn’t see a lot of -- saw some but not a lot of impact in April. We'll see more in May. The other thing going on with May as there is the memorial day shift that effects comp we think between one and two points as well, but that would be the color on the timing of our decision around the direct mail pull back, and again, the impact will vary by month. And then with respect to big picture view of the consumer, Nick could comment on that from Bath & Body, and his accent is better than mine.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Hi, Lindsay. I think she is behaving pretty consistently actually in an odd way. I think she continues to want to be excited. I think she continues to want to have a story or a compelling story telling to her, even though she has remains value oriented, but if she sees something that she likes or if she's engaged, clearly that value price fluctuates and we can see it in both ways. We see it fluctuates to really important when a compelling story isn’t told, but we can also see it become significantly less important when the product is good.",
            "So from that perspective I think it's actually pretty consistent behavior. There's lot of talk about where is the customer, what's she doing. But from our perspective I think it's a pretty consistent story. And I think that also ties itself to traffic where we have been -- we've seen pretty consistent levels of traffic. Now we're having to work very hard to maintain the traffic, given the modest assets, but my overall point of view is that the traffic is there, we're working hard to get it and her behavior is consistent. So at the end of the day when big periods happen, big timeframes, such as Mother's Day, she is still coming out, she still wants to participate. So kind of that's my overall point of view in terms of sort of a macro level what's going on with the customers.",
            "Lindsay Drucker Mann",
            "And was there any difference -- I was going to say, do you observe any differences by region or mall type?",
            "Nick Coe",
            "No, not dramatic differences. It's very difficult by region because regions come up, regions go down, regions come up. On aggregate that seems to be about okay. Obviously some malls are better than other malls and we have a very broad mix, because we’re not adjusting for mall. We are also in strips, power centers. Sometimes we see a different mix as it relates to products by mall. But in general, we’ve been pleased with relative consistency.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Lyndsay, just to add-on, it really does with the point we’re trying to make, which is we had a wide range of performance in our business. So Bath and Body had a very good quarter, all metrics, all measures. PINK had a very good quarter in business. And so we’re not sensing some broad based issue, but rather specific execution opportunities which we're proactively getting after, but we’re not of a mind that there’s some major macro phenomenon going on that impacting all of our businesses, because we had a wide range of performance, including some very good in the quarter.",
            "Amie Preston ",
            "So, thanks, Lindsay. We have a Board Meeting unfortunately that is starting and I apologize. I know we’re going to leave many of you probably in the queue, but we will take one last question. ",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS. Please go ahead.",
            "Michael Binetti",
            "Thanks for squeezing me in here. Thanks for all the detail. Obviously there's a lot of balls in the air. Just two questions really quickly on the guidance. Can you help me think about few of the changes, particularly it looks like about low teens reduction in the free cash flow for the year? The CapEx didn’t change. I think back into the net income it looks like the change is based most that net income. Is that fair or is there anything to think about related to working capital? Any change in the working capital profile in some of the business, new businesses that you’re getting into?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Short answer is no, no major changes. The change in free cash flow estimate, which again remains very healthy is related to the adjustment in income.",
            "Michael Binetti",
            "And could you just give me one thought. You mentioned that you’re only reselling in store, online what's being sold in stores. And that’s a little bit different and what some of the other retailers in the space have been saying. It seems like it’s been more liberating for other people to say we can offer a wider array of product online than we do in stores. Do you have any thoughts and what might be different for your business versus what we've heard in other areas in the sector?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. We just believe that focus is so fundamental to what we do. It starts with the beginning in the business more than 50 years ago, which is as a specialty retailer being extraordinarily good at a very few things. And while it's tempting, and we were tempted by it, that you can sell a lot of things online, and you can do so in some respects quote more efficiently than stores, we believe that the power and advantage of focus and the consistency between channels far outweighs the increment that you pick up by adding categories online.",
            "Amie Preston ",
            "Yes. And Nick, any thoughts there.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Yes. Hi Michael. I think, at the end of the day, what we’re trying to really achieve is a very seamless customer experience. So the brand stands for the same thing, whether you're in a store, or whether you’re online, and the benefit that we get from that and not just from a brand perspective, but the alignment of same product, same price, same cadence messaging, really drives terrific efficiency and it doesn’t confuse the customer. So I think it’s a win, win on both sides when we get very, very good alignment of the marketing message, the brand message and the product message.",

            "We continue to leverage our speed model, which has really provided us the opportunities to chase into winners across the business which is obviously beneficial from a top line and a bottom line perspective. Once again, our inventory is well positioned and clearly we’ll closely monitor that position to maximize our agility as we maneuver our way through the season.",
            "Finally, we remain very, very committed to one of our most important disciplines, which is all about staying very close to the customer and reacting to her behavior. This is something that allows us to feel confident as we work through the season with newness, floor sets and changes, et cetera, so it puts us in a pretty healthy position.",

            "Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everybody. As we mentioned in the pre-prepared notes, the pattern from Q1 really continues into Q2 with impacts from our investment in China, from FX, and sadly from weakness in our Victoria's Secret Beauty business.",
            "I’m actually just back from a long trip around the world. I went to the UK, Dubai, Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai. I just got back last night, and I will tell you that everywhere I went around the world, I felt the standard of execution was just fantastic in all markets.",
            "As it relates to China, I was particularly impressed with the talent that we’ve been able to recruit into that market with the leadership that we now have in place to take us forward, so feeling very excited there. I also saw some great real estate list in front of us for China, so overall feeling very optimistic.",

            "Thank you. Good morning. Stuart, I wanted to follow up on the other segment loss which was much better than we had expected. Can you just give us a little bit of insight into the cost cuts there, how sustainable they are, and then perhaps an update on the Henri Bendel and La Senza pieces of that? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, in terms of the year-on-year improvement in the other segment result, we certainly are working hard to manage corporate overhead and other expenses with discipline. We did have lower bonus payouts for the spring season reflecting our results versus a year ago. Also in LY results, we had a few discrete expenses that didn’t repeat in 2016. All that said, we’ll continue to manage corporate overhead with discipline, and we’ll continue that mindset. In terms of Bendel business, we remain optimistic about that concept in that brand, that business, that opportunity that continues to drive sales growth in their stores and are developing a very nice online business as well. And so, we’re optimistic we’ll continue to work to get the best results this fall season and periodically think about how and when to best expand that business. But the focus right now is on driving further sales growth in the stores that we have, driving good results online which we are and improving the margin architecture of that business, but good overall trends for Bendel.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Maybe a few comments on La Senza, really good performance in La Senza. In fact, we’ve seen positive comps in each of the last several quarters in that business really getting closer to the customer and sharpening up the proposition around young, sexy, obvious value positioning. I’m excited that our launch in the USA will take place later this fall, so good progress in that business.",

            "Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Was hoping you could dig into the beauty repositioning a bit, just when do you begin to lap the more significant pressures on that business? And given the shorter lead times there and the aggressive clearance activity through Q2, why wouldn’t we expect to see a more significant inflexion point in Q3? And then kind of separately still on beauty, on the international side, do you have any ability to make some shifts in the product or pricing given the learnings in the U.S. over the last few quarters? Just wondering if that might impact the timing of an inflexion on the international side? Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Mark. We’ll start with Stuart and then go to Martin.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So I think as you appreciate, maybe in order from our standpoint, we’ve got a new leader in the beauty business. He started in May. He’s learning about our brands in Victoria’s Secret and is onboarding but now getting into the business of the business, if you will. Second point I would probably register is that through promotional and other activity, changes in pricing and promotion, we certainly tried to and did drive a lot of trial in the second quarter, and we expect to continue that in the fall season. So through pricing and promotional activity driving trial in core categories of beauty to drive business, to drive results. And encouragingly, we’re seeing some pretty good repeat, customer repeat post-trial at some of those products. The third thing I’d mention is Greg working with Les and others developing a point of view and implementing a point of view about rationalizing or narrowing the assortment in a meaningful way this fall season. And then lastly, as you cued up in your question in terms of what we’re lapping, the year-on-year pressure in '16 will moderate as we go through the fall season. And maybe last, last is we all recognize the importance of speed in our business and including through the eyes of new leadership really working to reduce lead times in that business make further use of the beauty park that we have for personal care and beauty at Victoria’s Secret Beauty and those changes are beginning, and we’ll have some positive impact on the fall season, so we’ll see some year-on-year reduction in pressure certainly through fall, and it’s such an important category and such a strong category for us that we’re very committed to it and optimistic about the growth potential for that business over the next, call it 12 to 24 months.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Stuart. Martin, anything to add there?",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Yes, we see very similar patterns in the international business through the patterns that we see in North America. As you know, it’s a replication model in international, so we sell the same merchandise that we have in the home market. So to that extent, not much opportunity to do things differently. But as you suggested in the question, Mark, as it relates to pricing and promotions, we do have opportunity there. We are taking the learning from North America and reflecting and adapting our plans in that respect.",

            "Great. Thanks so much. Good morning and congratulations to the team for making progress. I guess a question on SG&A, Stuart, leveraged pretty significantly here in the second quarter. What drove that? I think you’re just starting to see lower home office costs and trying to understand the expectation for the leverage in the third quarter, why wouldn’t we see some of those benefits continue? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. So the management of the company is very focused on balancing our investments in the business, including those that hit the SG&A line and doing that with discipline. In terms of the difference between second quarter and the third quarter results, in Q3 we have a lower sales assumption. Now we’re going to work hard to beat that sales assumption but just in terms of the map of it and the impact on rate guidance, we have a more conservative assumption about comp and total sales growth in Q3 versus Q2. Secondly, our investment in China and its impact on SG&A is more significant in the third quarter than it was in the second. And then lastly, as I mentioned in the context of the other segment, our spring and Q2 specifically, expenses related to short-term incentive comp provided benefit in Q2, and our going-in assumption for Q3 is that year-on-year, benefit won’t be as significant in the third quarter. So those would be the highlights.",

            "Oliver Chen",
            "Hi. Good morning. Your core lingerie business growing at low single versus PINK double digits, could you just brief us on how you feel about core lingerie and how do you expect to unpack the assortments? I was also curious about the average unit retail across your core lingerie and how you feel about the mix between good, better, and best in fashion versus core? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Oliver. It’s Stuart, I’ll respond to that. So in terms of core lingerie, there are some important trends going on in the business and we’re taking significant actions to participate in and frankly lead with respect to those trends. And what I’m speaking about is the unconstructed or bralette trend is one and separately the sport bra business as a second important development in the bra category. And we’ve made significant progress and drove meaningful growth in both of those areas in the second quarter and intent to pursue those segments of the bra business very aggressively in the fall season. One of the important things about the bralette business or unconstructed bra business particularly is we do think it has a higher fashion element to it and we think that’s a good thing for us where we’ve been a fashion specialty retailer for a long time. Our abilities in terms of lead times and speed and read and react, particularly play well into the bralette category. And while the AUR in bralettes is below some of the other categories in bras, we believe that the unit volume or their frequency of purchase given the fashion element to it in part makes up for the lower AURs. So those are two important trends in the bra business. Again, we drove very significant growth in both of those trends in Q2 and expect the same or even greater growth in the fall season. In terms of the average unit retail in total, importantly in connection with our promotional changes, we had a large number of offers in our history in our base that included $10 off a bra, and we have substantially reduced or eliminated those offers, so that provides an upside in the AUR. And kind of when you pull it altogether, our non-red line AUR for the second quarter was pretty consistent with prior year or steady compared to prior year, so the combination of all those things, we didn’t have a decline in AUR in non-red line categories of the business. PINK continues to also grow its bra business at a very healthy rate, so some changing dynamics for sure, but we had good overall results in the bra business driving sales growth and very optimistic about the fall season with respect to bras.",
            "Oliver Chen",
            "Stuart, on the unconstructed bra comment, what would you say the skeptics I think that the marketing that you’ve traditionally done isn’t necessarily conducive to the changes happening, just curious on that? Thanks a lot and best regards.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Well, we – just in terms of promotional approach, we think the direct mail couponing that we were doing, we think there’s just frankly a better way to market and promote the brand. And so we’re pursuing different types of promotions and we made good progress on that in the second quarter and we’ll continue to learn about the most effective ways to promote within Victoria’s Secret. But again, we’ve been doing a lot of direct mail couponing for a number of years and we think there’s a better way to drive business and build our brand go-forward.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Yes. Oliver, I’ll just add to that in terms of the marketing as it relates to image or television advertising or anything like that, certainly the same way we focus on speed within our merchandise assortment, we can take the same approach with respect to marketing. So I think we can be agile with our product. We have made changes in terms of visual marketing and so it’s about fashion. We are a fashion business and so constantly evolving.",

            "Thanks very much, guys. If we could talk for a minute about PINK and obviously with rapid growth seems to be the winner in your portfolio, I’m wondering looking ahead your opportunity to invest in that space and to accelerate or expand line extensions, new products, I’m wondering what your thoughts are regarding investments and can you give us some visibility into the fourth quarter in particular? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Well, Richard, the first thing I would say is PINK is a very strong business within L Brands. The other business that’s been consistently very strong for us is the Bath & Body Works business and I wouldn’t want that to be lost through our discussions. But with respect to PINK, it’s been a terrific business and we see very substantial ongoing growth for that business. It’s easy to say, hard to do but Denise Landman and the team there are very, very good at what they do. As you know, they have a clear mindset on their target customer, their ability to execute their business in-season and longer term is outstanding. Their use of speed, read and react capabilities is terrific, so they have a very clear customer segment, they’re executing very well, they have very deep and strong capabilities. With respect to investing in that business, a lot of the square footage that we’re adding and a lot of the capital that we’re spending on real estate is positioning and supporting PINK growth. And so as you know, Les Wexner and our company, we’re not afraid to invest when we’ve got a trend in results and the payback and we’re investing record levels of CapEx in our business and not suggesting that all that money is going to PINK but a lot of it is in terms of square footage growth at Victoria’s and again a lot of that flowing to PINK. Denise is very optimistic about the fall season. It’s off to a good start. And again, her ability to read, react and adjust within the season is very strong, so great business, great second quarter result, very optimistic about the fall and L Brands is investing very heavily in that business and getting very good returns.",

And then lastly, your confidence on continuing to have merchandise margins up in the back --?",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Paul. So we’re going to start with Andrew and then since Nick is off-site and if he has anything to add, he can jump in.",
            "Andrew Meslow",
            "Hi, Paul. Thanks for the question. On the first part of your question in terms of category performance and what’s been driving our results, as you saw in our prepared remarks we specifically called out our home fragrance business which has been a consistent strong driver of our overall business now for the last several years. In addition that, obviously we have our other product categories such as our Signature Collection fragrant body care business and our soap and sanitizer businesses. And while we do not call those out explicitly in our prepared remarks, those businesses are also growing over the last year. And so in total I would say we continue to be pleased with our overall results and our overall portfolio of performance. I believe your second question was regarding our remodel strategy. As a reminder that remodel strategy is one that is focused on touching this year about – will finish this year with about 250 stores in that new remodel that again includes both a remodeled Bath & Body Works store as well as a White Barn concept either in a side-by-side location or a shop-in-shop format. And again, our overall results continue to be very positive. We continue to be very pleased with that performance and we are committed to driving continued investment into that strategy both for the balance of this year and well into the next several years. And then last, your question on go-forward and our thoughts there, again, as we’ve heard Stuart say, read and react is a very, very important lever in our business. And so as we start any new season we go in with a relatively conservative perspective. We then follow the trends of the business. We’re constantly testing whether it’s new product categories, whether it’s new promotional strategies, whether it’s new story-telling strategies in stores and we use that read and react capability to chase to the upside. So again, as we come into the back half of the year, which is especially in the Bath & Body Works business a very important timeframe, we are still very confident in our ability to use that business model to chase to the upside.",

            "Great. Thank you so much. Stuart, my question is on the Victoria’s Secret promotions. That brand has obviously been adjusting a number of the promotions used as you mentioned eliminating the $10 off coupon and instead offering alternative kinds of promotions. I’m wondering if you can share any of your learnings from that and if you – and your three months in have a greater degree of certainty about how to guide the brand through lapping that $10 off coupon here in the next few quarters based on what you’ve learnt so far?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Kimberly. What I would say is that we shifted our promotional strategy from that free panty, $10 off a bra direct mail coupon generally to promotions intended to drive trial. And that might be a trial in beauty as we’ve talked about, it might be a trial in sport or sharp pricing and promotions related to the bra business and particularly the unconstructed bra business. I would say we absolutely have shown that we can drive trial in those important categories. We are lapping a lot of this direct mail volume in that amount of business that was driven is more significant in Q3 than it was in Q2. But again, our view is we really want to have purposed promotions that are brand building and drive trial for merchandise that we think is terrific merchandise, again, whether it’s in the beauty business or sport bra business or in the unconstructed or other parts of the bra business. So that’s our mindset. I would say what we learned is that we can absolutely drive trial but I wouldn’t suggest and you recognized and posted in the question, do I think we have all of that figured out in the first few months of this would not represent that. But good progress on it in the second quarter and I know we’ll continue to learn more in the third quarter and the fall season.",

            "Hi. Good morning, everyone. On the international side, I guess Martin a question for you. Correct me if my math is off but based on the remarks you gave in the script, it sounds like your China business might have contributed around 8 million in sales and about $8 million loss in the quarter. I guess is that right? And is there a good way to think about sales and losses the next few quarters for that part of the business and how would you characterize profitability and sales growth next year and maybe a timeline to potentially breakeven there?",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Ike. Go ahead, Martin.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Thanks, Ike. I appreciate the question. I think the way you characterized the numbers is about right, 8 million in sales, about 8 million of loss. And sadly it’s hard to put those two things together because they reflect different parts of the business. So the sales is reflected at VSBA stores that are up and running and are trading. The loss represents the efforts that are going into building the full assortment business which will open in February of 2017. So those two parts are not related to each other. In terms of thinking forward and how do we project what’s going to happen over the next several months; very, very difficult to do that. What I will tell us that we’re on track to open two full assortment stores probably towards the end of February 2017 and then another flagship store in Beijing around the middle of the year. And we’ll continue to trade the VSBA business and add to that collectively probably about six stores over the course of the next six months. And then in addition to the sales part of the business, which is our direct to consumer business where later this fall we will test a full Chinese language, Chinese currency site which will initially be fulfilled out of the USA on a test basis ready for full fulfillment out of China in the middle of '17. So just so many moving parts, so it really is quite difficult to predict. We have, as you know, in terms of the way that we run the business, we don’t spend that much time looking through the crystal ball to try and predict what will happen. We try and follow a pattern, a test and run. The most important thing is to get the business up with the right brand presentation, in the right way, see what happens and then be flexible and agile and adopt as necessary. So I’ll probably be able to tell you more when we get to our investor conference later in the fall.",

Stuart, I just wanted to confirm my calculation to get to your SG&A guidance for the year that you should be able to get some SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter even though I think your comp assumption for the fourth quarter is something around flat using the guidance that you gave us last night in the [indiscernible]. I wondered if that was a correct calculation. And then for Martin, I wondered if you could just tell us in the core international business, ex the acquisition of China, how the tourist traffic is trending and if you’ve seen any improvement versus prior months? Thank you.",

            "Thanks, Janet. We’ll start with Stuart for the SG&A question.",

            "So, Janet, in terms of our current view, as we talked about earlier in the context of Q3, we’re expecting some deleverage in Q3 reflecting our more conservative sales assumption. With respect to the fourth quarter, we also have a pretty conservative sales assumption in our Q4 view and as a result also some deleverage not as much as the third quarter. And that gets us for the year to be – for SG&A to be roughly flat to what it was a year ago. I think as you know you’ve followed us for a long time, we’ll work very hard to manage expenses with a tough mind and with discipline and we want to make the right investments in our business to deliver great experiences for customers. But we also want to make sure that over time we’re growing expenses slower than sales.",

            "Yes, so tourism does continue to be down slightly around the world. A couple of areas that I’d point out specifically I think Russian tourists and Latin American tourists are the two groups that are most impacted both as with those geographies and into those geographies, so that’s one that I will call out. The second is tourism to high-profile cities around the world is also down. So if I look at our business in the UK, we’re seeing real strength outside of London, a little more difficult in London in areas where we are dependent on tourist traffic. So overall, about the same pattern in Q2 as we saw in Q1 and I think that’s probably the new normal for the balance of this year.",

I wanted to follow up on the discussion around bralettes and sports bras, I’m wondering if you’re seeing in your data whether it’s through the loyalty program and Angel Card kind of insights around behavior around the categories? Are you seeing consumers’ kind of dapple in the new types of bras or are you seeing heavy adoption? And when they are buying bralette and sports bras, do they tend to be incremental to their historical bra purchases? Any insight around the behavior, especially since you can probably get a lot of visibility through the data you get in your loyalty program and Angel Card? Thanks.",

            "Yes. Omar, thank you. The most significant insight that we’ve had and this is we think a very important one for us given how we think about what we do is that the customer is absolutely a younger customer. And we think that’s very important to our business. We’ve always been about marketing, segmenting, targeting customers certainly with a young mindset and any time any of our business we feel like the customer is starting to not be in that target of a young mindset, we get concerned. And the good news is through our efforts in unconstructed bralettes, sports bras we’re absolutely seeing a shift to a younger customer which we view very positively. We’re seeing some good signs of repeat but the data around that not as clear. The data around younger is very clear and very compelling.",

The integration of how we’re presenting product to the customer, the integration of pricing and promotion, the interplay in terms of driving business online versus to store, all of that is happening much more naturally today than it was 6 or 12 months ago. And I wouldn’t suggest from the comment that we’ve completely nailed that and we’ve completely figured it out and it’s all perfect, it’s not. But that coordination is more effective, more natural than it was 6 to 12 months ago. And we’ll make from time to time deliberate decisions about driving business one way or the other in terms of the channels obviously with the customer in mind through all of that.

            "Lyndsay Drucker",
            "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Stuart, I wanted to just follow up on the Victoria’s brand and the changes in promo strategy. I was wondering now that you’re a few months in, you can talk about how much you think the shift in promotional strategy is weighing on your core lingerie business but from a comp perspective what sort of order of magnitude drag it’s been? It seems like it’s probably been less of a drag than what you were initially thinking about when you talked to us after the first quarter. And as you contemplate your guidance for the full year, what sort of an overhang you think that is Victoria’s into the back half to the degree that 3Q had more of a year-over-year comparison, is that even more amplified in the fourth quarter? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. So we did drive a fair amount of volume in prior years, in 2015 and prior years through that direct mail promotion that you’re familiar with and that we’ve talked about. With that said and again as I think you’d appreciate and we’ve talked about on the call, we’ve been able to replace a lot of that volume through our targeted promotions, particularly as it relates to sports bras and bralettes. The amount of direct mail volume that we’re lapping is more significant in Q3 and Q4 in dollars than it was in the second quarter. But Q4 in relation to the total quarter, it will be a little less than Q3. Separately, one way that we were able to drive a lot of volume and we’re committed to and did drive a lot of volume in the second quarter was clearance activity. We wanted to make sure that we ended the season clean and particularly as it relates to exited categories. And so that sales driver, if you will, or that source of sales that existed in the second quarter we won’t really have that opportunity in the third quarter. So able to replace some of the volume, clearance was also a contributor in Q2, it does represent pressure in Q3 and Q4 but you should know that we’re of a mindset that we’re going to offset that volume. And whether that’s every month or every week and the right people involved in those discussions, including Les and other leaders in the business, we’re working hard to replace that volume and do it in a way that’s healthier for the brand and it drives trial and business in core categories. Thanks.",

            "Paul Lejuez",
            "Thanks, guys. Stuart, can you maybe give us the puts and takes on the Victoria’s Secret merchandise margin? How much did fewer promotional offers help versus the clearance that’s been hurt and I guess weakness on the beauty side hurt as well, if you might be able to help us out there? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Paul. In terms of the magnitude, the effective clearance related to exits and just ensuring that we ended the spring season clean, that drag or that pressure, Paul, was the biggest impact of any of the impacts in the margin rate for inventories for the second quarter. The other pressure that we had, the next biggest pressure would be related to beauty. And so as you know, we restaged what we referred to as the fantasy’s business last fall, we believe we improved the product quality a lot of packaging and so on, a fair amount, which drove some increase in costs which we were fine with. But as we’ve talked about previously, we needed to make some adjustment in pricing this spring to drive appropriate volume in that business. And so that combination of things along with some use of beauty giveaways to drive business for our business and other business put pressure on the business. And then going the other way, which you mentioned but not as significant as the two things I just called out, was the benefit of the cessation of the direct mail couponing and promotional offers. So those would be the main drivers.",

            "Thanks. Good morning. I guess two questions; one, on the exiting of the 525 million, I believe, Stuart, you’re guiding for that 2 to 3 points of that headwind in the back half of the year. Just wondering if you’ve informed your view of what the first half of next year – what’s the rest of that pressure look like, either is it in the Q1 or Q2, just if you have any viewpoints on the 525 million. And then I guess outside of bralettes, can you talk about the core bra launch calendar, how do Les and Jan think about the biggest opportunities in the back half, particularly Q4, for the bra launch versus last year? Thanks very much.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. So, Brian, in terms of the exits there will be pressure in the first half of 2017 and we know what we’ve sold in terms of business from those exited categories. And when we get closer to 2017, we will get more specific about the calendarization of that. But I think what you know and you’ve know us for a long time and we commented about this on the last call, we’re going to work like heck and we’re optimistic that we’re going to replace that volume with growth in other categories. And so we got to prove that, we got to do that, but you should know that that’s our mindset and we’re taking specific actions to do that this fall and certainly we’ll work to do that next spring. Does the math get harder next spring in terms of the dollar impact of those exits, it does. But again you should know that we’ll be working hard to offset that volume. With respect to the bra launch calendar and key drivers of bra growth in holiday, a couple of thoughts. You mentioned Jan, Jan hasn’t started yet. She starts in early September but that doesn’t mean that we don’t have a plan, we do have a plan. But given competitive aspects, Brian, and so on and I’m not trying to be in any way unhelpful, but we’ll be close to the vest about our bra launch strategy for holiday given where we are in the calendar is helpful as I want to be to competition. I’m not sure I want to be quite that helpful. So we’ll keep that closer to the vest.",

            "Simon Siegel",
            "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Stuart, just a follow up on an earlier question, just given how much Victoria’s Secret sales be the initial guide this quarter, can you contextualize the be [ph] maybe versus the original expectations? Did the promo reduction or category eliminations have less of initial impact? How much did that extra clearance activity add to the guide? And then just maybe the corollary, are there any similar variables within initiatives that could come up over the next few quarters that might impact your guidance? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So, Simon, thanks for the question. Two things, one, the clearance activity did drive a lot of volume in the second quarter and some of that was hard to estimate as we entered the quarter, but what we were very clear minded about is how we wanted to end the quarter with respect to our inventory position and that was dynamic within the quarter. But headline answer your question, some upside related to clearance. And then the second thought I would register being repetitive but it’s a theme through the dialogue is that we drove some good volume and some of the emerging trends in the bra business. So the bralette business and sport business were very healthy for us and good growth in the second quarter. And the panty business, we got some good results there as well. So that’s what I would call out and continue to have a very nice business in the second quarter as well. But in terms of what was really different, I would say clearance very strong and some good growth in these emerging categories within bras.",

            "Great. Thanks for taking my question. One, just a quick follow up on earlier comments on BBW, I’m wondering how you think about AUR as a lever in the second half either through pricing or through mix. It’s obviously been an important lever for you and a nice driver of comp over the past few years. And second, as you think about the bralettes driving a younger, more fashionable customer, how do you think about the potential for increased cannibalization with PINK? Obviously, it doesn’t seem like you’ve seen it given the strength in PINK but how do you think about that? Do you care if there’s an increased overlap and just how are you managing that? Thanks a lot.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Roxanne. We’ll start with Andrew.",
            "Andrew Meslow",
            "Hi, Roxanne. Thanks for the question. To your observation, AUR has been a strong driver of growth in sales for Bath & Body Works both for spring 2016 as well as for the past couple of years. And to your point, some of that is driven by mix in business. So as we’ve talked about, the home fragrance business has been our strongest growing category and that is general at higher retails relative to the balance of our assortment. So that certainly is a contributing factor. But then I’d say the other maybe even more important factor is our ongoing again testing into how to get paid for investments that we continuously make into the product. So obviously one of the key levers in terms of driving our business is constant innovation, constant investment into newness across all product lines in our business. And when we do that, we do extensive testing around our ability to command higher retails that go along with that. And that is an ongoing effort in our business, one that has proven to be successful again in our past and we would look to continue to be a driver in the future as well.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Roxanne, with respect to bralettes, we believe that that business is highly incremental to the bra business. Nothing’s ever perfectly incremental but we believe it’s highly incremental. With respect to how that category interacts or interplays with PINK, PINK’s been in the bralette business for a long time and it has a very nice business there with good volume and good growth. We believe that the brand positioning and the customer segmentation PINK vis-à-vis Victoria’s is relatively clear to customers. And while there’s always a little bit of interplay, we believe again that the segmentation and the positioning is pretty clear between the two businesses, so feel good about it.",

            "Susan Anderson",
            "Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I have another question on BBW as it relates to White Barn. So I guess when you have a shop-in-shop, I was just wondering are their products performing similar to the BBW products or are there any differences in performance of price points? And then also, do you think this is an additional purchase the customer is making or is it something that they’re making instead of a BBW product? Thanks.",
            "Andrew Meslow",
            "Hi, Susan. Thanks for the question. So in terms of performance in the White Barn stores by category, again, in general the remodels that we do that include a remodel of both in the Bath & Body Works portion of the store as well as then the addition of a White Barn component, whether it’s in the shop-in-shop or side-by-side format, is driving total performance of the overall bath. And so we do see a lift in essentially all categories when we do one of those remodels. Under the covers, we do see a slightly higher growth rate in our home fragrance business associated with again that addition of a unique White Barn component. And so that is something that we do see as a result of that real estate strategy. In terms of different products or new products in those stores, again, there are more home décor aspects in the White Barn portion of those stores but that is not a larger material portion of the overall performance of those stores. On your question of whether or not we’re seeing that as an incremental purchase, we are absolutely seeing incrementality across all of the aspects of those remodeled activities in terms of driving sales across all categories. So yes, we would definitely categorize that as incremental.",

There is an acquisition side of it as we see new customers coming into the brand, but there’s also a renewal aspect as customers get reintroduced to Bath & Body Works as both sides of the store or both front and back of the store are completely remodeled. So there’s an additional benefit from that too.",

            "Matthew Boss",
            "Thanks. Can you just talk a little bit about the positioning of sport in the marketplace today for you guys? How’s it been performing versus maybe your internal expectations? And then just with catalogue cost now more in the rearview mirror, not as much pressuring buying and occupancy, what’s the best comp to think about needed to leverage B&O for 4Q? And then where do you see that leverage point going next year and beyond?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Okay. So with respect to the sport business and how we’re doing and what’s our assessment, it’s obviously an important category in the bra business. We think we’re well positioned today generating very substantial growth. But we’re working hard to accelerate that growth and frankly increase our position and our dominance in that space. And so you’re seeing regular flow of new products, you’re seeing relatively short price points, you’re seeing promotion targeted to sport and we’re getting good results. So we would grade our paper pretty well for the second quarter with high ambition for the fall season in terms of growth of sport and particularly sport bras. In terms of the comp needed to leverage buying and occupancy given the benefit of the catalogue lap there, low-single digit would be the breakpoint, if you will, to get B&O leverage within gross margin net of the benefit of the catalogue elimination.",

Wanted to talk on – great operating margins and we’ve talked a lot about the upside, the potential. A little bit of narrower gross margin expansion this quarter and besides some of the things you talked about, I’m wondering if that’s entirely due to the remodel program or mostly. Maybe give us a feel for what to expect there go forward? Thanks.",
            "Andrew Meslow",
            "Hi, John. Thanks. As you saw in our prepared remarks, obviously buying and occupancy is a growing expense associated with all the real estate remodel activity that we spent some time discussing today. And if you’re looking at the difference between second quarter 2016 versus first quarter 2016, it is that growth in buying and occupancy cost that was the driver of slightly lower total operating income growth in Q2 versus what we experienced in Q1. And then when we looked on a go-forward basis that buying and occupancy growth we do expect it to continue not only in the back half of 2016 but frankly into 2017 as again we continue on this initiative. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we obviously are seeing very good results associated with the real estate remodel strategy in general and so we remain very committed to those investments but it does have the headwind obviously of that buying and occupancy growth.",

            "John, the only other thing I would just add is even at kind of a higher level and when we’ve talked about it and it’s an additional view is that Bath & Body Works operating income rate is very high and what we’re looking to do is reinvest in that business for the long-term health of that business and to accelerate growth. And whether that’s through the investment in real estate that Andrew and Nick have remarked about or other things, we want to balance operating income rate with top line growth and dollar growth. And so the observation about the impact of real estate is there. But again, over a multiyear basis it’s a terrific business. We want to keep it a terrific business and accelerate growth. And so we’re going to invest in the business and we are.",

            "Hi, guys. I have to say your Victoria’s Secret fall line, the new colors, really do look beautiful. It’s quite a change from what we’ve seen over the last couple of years and I think it looks fantastic. Can you talk, Stuart, maybe a little bit about input costs just where they’ve been trending especially through the back half of the year at VS and BBW? And can you update us on a couple of things like wage, cost and any pressures, any different pressures that you’re seeing or an easing that you’re seeing? I know you’ve pulled back the catalogues, so any changes that we should expect to see in marketing at Victoria’s Secret that you haven’t talked about yet?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "There’s a lot in that question, Marni, but that’s okay.",
            "Marni Shapiro",
            "Well, after they [ph] called me the trucker, I figured it was only fair.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "All right, fine. The most important point I want to register frankly in response to the question and I mean this sincerely but I think it’s the most important thing for an investor to understand about us is we’re not trying to win by being a low-cost player. That’s not what we do. And so you’re asking about cost inputs and I understand, I mean we’re a big company and we do pay attention to cost whether it’s about product cost or other cost inputs in our business. But what this management team is most focused on is delivering emotional content, great customer experiences, great store environments, great digital experiences, great interactions with store associates, et cetera, and we’re willing to pay for that and great product quality as well. So, are there material changes in input cost related to merchandise fall '16 versus fall '15, I would say no. Are there some changes related to mix; yes, sure. But in terms of year-on-year cost input related to merchandise, no significant changes. We got a great sourcing organization that does terrific work but what they’re most focused on is product quality and speed that do manage cost, but no big changes. With respect to wage inflation, we are seeing that more in the United States, which is at the end of the day probably a good thing. As you know from prior conversations we’ve had, we want to make sure that we’re attracting and retaining terrific associates whether it’s at the store level, in our distribution centers, in our home office and so we’re not looking to be the low-cost player in those space either we’re looking to pay for terrific people, ensure that we’re getting productivity from those people in terms of sales productivity in stores or other forms of productivity in other parts of our business. But in terms of cost pressures, the wage piece is affecting store selling but as you again heard us talk about it over time, we believe that through sales growth and other leverage that can come from more productive store associates, we believe that we shouldn’t have over time significant deleverage in store selling costs. Lastly, you mentioned the catalogue, we did cease producing the catalogue this spring. A big cost in our business I think is part of what you’re asking, have there been a few changes in marketing at Victoria’s Secret? There already have been and I’m sure there will continue to be more. And I don’t mean that in an unsettling way but that’s just the dynamic aspect of our business and we’ve made some good progress in marketing in the second quarter but there will be more change in the fall and I’m sure there will be more change in 2017.",

Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So when we remodel stores or most of our stores, Jeff, if we have a change in square footage, they’re out of the comp base. So you may be asking about how does it contribute to sales growth. We are getting sales growth in those locations as we’ve talked about and we’ve provided some dimension that last fall and I would say in general results have been pretty consistent. But just specifically as it relates to comp, those stores often if there’s an expansion in square footage of more than 20%, those stores go out of the comp base.

            "Thanks, and now I'll turn the call over to Stuart.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. While we delivered third quarter earnings results that were within our beginning of the quarter guidance, we're not satisfied with our overall results.",
            "Third quarter EPS declined 24% to $0.42. Pink and Bath & Body Works continue to deliver strong results and the Victoria's Secret business continues to face headwinds related to changes we implemented in the business earlier this year. Results also reflect about [indiscernible] of pressure related to our investment in China, the Victoria's Secret Fifth Avenue flagship store, higher net non-operating expense principally interest and FX.",
            "The changes we've made within the Victoria's Secret business were proactive, delivered changes that will result in a more streamlined and efficient organization and will accelerate growth in our four categories. We made progress in the quarter on the implementation of these changes combining our store and product channels clearing through merchandise in the exited categories of swim and apparel and making changes to our promotional approach.",
            "Our brands are strong and we are energized about our opportunities for growth. We will continue to leverage speed in the business and be flexible and agile in our approach in order to satisfy customers and maximize profitability.",
            "With that, I'll turn it the discussion over to Nick.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Thanks Stuart. So a good start to our fall season. We grew sales and earnings against good results from last year. We continue to leverage and will continue to leverage our speed model to chase into proven windows across the business. We've been able to keep inventory very well controlled confidently monitoring our position and maximizing our agility. We remain pleased with the results of our real estate activity and we'll stay in the read and react mode to ensure the investment and the strategy are smart.",
            "We're very focused on executing Christmas and we're excited about the assortment and we will continue to leverage one of our most important disciplines which is obviously staying as close as we can for the customer and read and reacting to her behavior.",
            "Thanks and I'll turn it over to Martin.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Thanks Nick and good morning everyone. As Amie said I'm joining in from Singapore this morning or this evening my time where our latest and greatest Victoria's Secret first owned store opens tomorrow morning. And earlier this week I was in China with our team there.",
            "As I said at our Investor Conference Day a couple of weeks ago, we are very bullish about the opportunities for global growth and continue to be confident about the strength and perception about brands outside North America. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have, but in the meantime I'll turn it back over to Amie.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Martin. So that concludes our prepared comments this morning and at this time we'll be happy to take any questions you might have. In the interest of time and consideration to others please limit yourself to one question. Thanks and I'll turn it back over to Heidi.",

            "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.",
            "Dana Telsey",
            "Good morning everyone. Stuart, as you think about the Victoria's Secret business and the gross margin rate as we go forward, how much, how do you think about the declines in the merchandise margin before you see a balancing of new business versus exiting the old business, how much should this gross margin decline of 190 basis points that we saw this quarter, how do you see that transitioning going forward? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes Dana, as we for forward there will be some ongoing pressure in the fourth quarter and probably to some degree into next spring. But as we look further out I would start with we see Victoria's as a business that should be a high teens or better operating margin rate business just based on the quality of the brand and the emotional content of the brand and good retail execution, a place where - consistent with our overall corporate goal.",
            "So there will be some pressure in the fourth quarter. There will be some pressure on the rate probably going into spring of 2017, but on a midterm basis those things will level out and we'll have improvement in the gross margin rate, the merchandise market rate and the overall profit rate of Victoria's after the first part of 2017, that's how I see it.",
            "Dana Telsey",
            "Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Stuart and thanks Dana. Next question please? Operator?",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.",
            "Omar Saad",
            "Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about some of the things you discussed at the Investor Day especially around the sport and bralette categories and any update in terms of your effort to really focus on market share in that category to build up your business there and any sort of effect those efforts are and will have on the gross margin line? I guess a little bit of follow-on from Dana's question, thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Omar, it's Stuart. So we're pleased with our results in the sport and bralette categories within the broad business. We drove a lot of unit volume growth, a lot of trial in those segments, and for that reason pretty pleased with the result. What our company has been able to do pretty consistently over a long period of time is to get to a margin rate and an overall margin architecture that works well for the business over time.",
            "And I can think of numerous examples in the business over the years including our Pink business five or seven years ago that didn't have the same margin rate as the core lingerie business in Victoria's where through understanding the customer well, great delivery of newness in fashion and leveraging read react capabilities and speed, we've been able to strike a right balance and appropriate balance between dollar growth, dollar results and rate.",
            "And so we're pleased with our growth, extraordinary growth frankly in the bralette and sport bra business intentionally driving trial and unit growth. And as I've mentioned we're confident that over time we'll get the right balance as it relates to dollar growth and rate in those categories and in the overall bra business for Victoria's.",
            "Omar Saad",
            "Thanks Stuart.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Omar. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Yes, your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi Research. Please go ahead.",
            "Paul Lejuez",
            "Thanks guys. I think at the Bath & Body Works can you talk about your comp performance by location type? I'm just curious what locations, what type of service locations are performing the best may be on an absolute basis, but also where did you see the biggest acceleration, if you could talk about different types of locations, A malls, B malls, C, maybe street locations? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Hey Paul. Let me think here, so we've actually seen pretty consistent results over the last number years across our real estate in general. And I could say probably the same regionally. So we're not seeing any with spikes by region, we're not seeing any with spikes by location. Obviously where we have put investments into the new real estate strategy or rather the remodel strategy, we continue to see very healthy lifts in that business consistent with what we've communicated in the past.",
            "And as you know we monitor that very, very tightly to ensure that we continue to invest in the right locations to get the right return and that so far has been tightly monitored and that's monitored and that's so far has yielded the results that we would want. So we'll continue rolling out through the end of this year and into next year.",
            "Paul Lejuez",
            "Great, thanks, good luck.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Yes, your next question is from Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.",
            "Anna Andreeva",
            "Great, thanks so much. Good morning guys. I guess two quick ones for Stuart. A question on the fourth quarter guide wider range of outcomes for EPS than we historically see from you guys, maybe talk about what kind of performance are you embedding at the high-end and at the low end of the range? And then secondly, at Victoria's Secret I think you called out an increase in the legal expenses, maybe talk about what drove that and should we expect that going forward? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks Anna. So with respect to the breadth of our range or forecast what we would – what I would say, what we would say is that the width of that range or the degree of that range has varied from time to time as you look back in our history. And it reflects in the current situation just over a wider range of outcome as we forecast the business and some of that is macro, but more of that is just frankly reflecting the number of changes we've made at Victoria's Secret.",
            "And we're trying to be thoughtful about how we run the business and in addition to an EPS range that you guys are focused on understandably we're trying to make sure that within our thinking is a conservative mindset so that we manage inventories and other aspects of our business appropriately if we end up at the lower end of a range of outcomes. So it's a big quarter obviously, a lot to play for.",
            "We believe we have good plans for the quarter consistent with how we think about the business and run the business, we will read, react, and adjust week to week and in some cases day-to-day depending upon what we're seeing and the results of various tests that we always run. But we do have a little bit wider range than we've had in the last few years reflecting fundamentally a little less predictability given the number of changes at Victoria's Secret.",
            "With respect to the legal matters that we - expenses that we referenced in our pre-circulated commentary, those we would expect that those would not be of an ongoing nature as you would appreciate. From time to time businesses like ours have situations that that are infrequent and that's what that represented in the third quarter. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Stuart and thanks Anna. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Yes, from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.",
            "Kimberly Greenberger",
            "Great, thank you, good morning. Stuart, my question is on the EPS headwinds here in 2016 and how we should think about them in 2017. I'm wondering if you could just bucket them into two different sort of broad pockets if you have that detail available. The first obviously the temporary or one-time ones like FX hits, the investment in China, preopening rent on Fifth Avenue maybe there are others?",
            "And the second, obviously there was some EPS headwind here in 2016 from strategic changes at Victoria's Secret and ongoing real estate investments in Bath & Body Works and just inventory management. So I don’t know if you have that level of detail with you, but I'm just wondering, what are the pieces that were headwinds in 2016 that go away in 2017 and what were the headwinds in 2016 that you expect to continue going forward? Thanks so much.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, thanks Kimberly. So there will be pressure from the changes at Victoria's Secret as I commented on at our Investor Day that continue into the first half of 2017 and the specifics of that we'll provide the best update that we can Kimberly in February when we give our guidance for 2017. The drag or the impact from China, we would expect will decline in 2017 versus the impact in 2016.",
            "Fifth Avenue obviously was a unique situation, so that should not recur. Based on what I see today and what our thinking is at this point, I wouldn't see meaningful incremental borrowing in 2017. So it shouldn’t be an additional interest drag which we had some of this year. So the VS pressure will be there for the first half of 2017. Some ongoing drag from China in the first part of the year, but that we'll lap that pretty quickly in 2017 and in terms of capital structure it shouldn’t be anything meaningful based on what we know at this point.",
            "So hopefully that gives you some flavor for it and you've been following us for a long time, as you know we'll do a lot of work after we get through this fourth quarter which again is about 50% of the year tightening up our views. And frankly also making operating decisions based on our results as we really get ready for 2017, but broad brush that's how we see it at this point. Thanks.",
            "Kimberly Greenberger",
            "Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Kimberly. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Yes from Lyndsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.",
            "Lyndsay Drucker Mann",
            "Thanks, good morning. Stuart, I wanted to ask a bit about the margin outlook for the fourth quarter and it seems as if you have some factors that should actually sequentially be helping you in 4Q whether it's opening the New York City flagship or wrapping the Beauty relaunch and also maybe some of the progress you've made in clearing out some of the excess inventory in structured bras that had been an overhang.",
            "So can you, as you think about 4Q and why the outlook for margins is in a little bit better, is certainly versus what we had contemplated even exiting the second quarter, what are the factors that are sustaining that pressure despite some of the things that I highlighted that might be allowing for some improvement? Is the structured bra business or the Victoria's business or core businesses any aspect of that getting worse versus 3Q or maybe just helping me square those numbers? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, so in answer to the last part of your question first, actually we don’t have a point of view Lyndsay that the core bra business at Victoria's is getting worse by any stretch. I would say what our guidance reflects and again this is dynamic and we manage it week to week and month-to-month is the balance between driving trial and volume between these two new categories of bras that we've talked a lot about, sport bras and bralettes and balancing that trial and margin pressure, margin rate pressure with growth in those categories.",
            "As you pointed out, the Beauty pressure will diminish and that will be a benefit in Q4. But just as we laid out a view and we're going to work hard to beat this view obviously trying to strike the right balance between ensuring that we end the season with clean inventory and really striking a good balance between sales growth and rate. And so, as we add that up there is some, a little bit of improvement, slight improvement versus the third quarter, but still pretty dynamic in trading those factors up and again trying to take a conservative point of view about the rate and we'll work hard to beat that and we'll see if we can.",
            "Lyndsay Drucker Mann",
            "Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Lyndsay. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Yes Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.",
            "Paul Trussell",
            "Yes, good morning. You made some comments regarding the impact of category exits both for the fourth quarter and the first half of the year. If you can just maybe elaborate a bit more in terms of detail on how we should be thinking about that impact to the total P&L and the offsetting factors to those category exits? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure, so we did provide a little bit more perspective on the sales pressure that we estimate related to the category exits prepared commentary that was in our last night. But in terms of offsets, number one is we're looking to drive accelerated growth in other categories and number two is you are familiar with and we've talked about before we took a fair amount of expense out of the business. So a pretty meaningful reduction in expenses related to the catalog at Victoria's Secret Direct a reduction in overhead at Victoria's Secret and rationalization of some other marketing activity at Victoria's Secret.",
            "And so we're working hard to drive volume in core categories and existing businesses to offset that sales pressure and again took meaningful expense out of the business as part of the changes that we began implementing in the spring season of 2016. So a big offset is on the cost side of business.",
            "Paul Trussell",
            "Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Paul. Next question?",
            "Operator",
            "Yes, your next question is from Janet Kloppenburg from JJK Research. Please go ahead.",
            "Janet Kloppenburg",
            "Hi everybody. Stuart, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the lingerie [ph] business total bra and panty sales declined a little bit year-over-year I think that's driven by AUR. So when you look at the business and consider the growth of the online bras and the bralette should we think that along with the sports bra business, should we think that the AUR declines you'll be seeing could prevail or do you think that the higher AUR structured bra business can gain some momentum as we go through the fourth quarter next year? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, I guess, Janet, thanks for the question. I mean I would just start with the fact that the bra business is absolutely core to Victoria's Secret and our growing, healthy, very strong margin dollar growth for our business is among our highest priorities in our company. And so, knowing that, just you should know how we think about it, its importance and what we'll be working towards. There have been some important shifts in merchandise categories, but one of the other benefits is we have that offset at least in part the lower AUR is for bras and bralettes is we were doing a lot of those $10 off a bra promotions that as you know we have stopped doing.",
            "And so the timing and specifics of when do we get to meaningful dollar growth in the bra business and the outcomes that are so important to us we're working through some significant transitions right now. We're very clear minded about what the goals are and that's you know from the line point of view through the organization and at the end of the day I'm highly confident that we'll achieve that outcome. But it's a little dynamic right now based on some of the changes in the merchandise assortment and the proactive changes that we've made.",
            "Janet Kloppenburg",
            "Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Janet. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.",
            "Brian Tunick",
            "Thanks, good morning everyone. Two quick ones, first on the fourth quarter comp guide, I guess you are saying flat to positive low singles versus I guess November you are guiding low single, so just curious how we should read into that and is there any timing shifts on semiannual or anything we should think about? And then I guess Stuart, from a capital allocation or really special dividend question we've been getting from investors, you were able to cut your full year earnings outlook, put the CapEx at the high end of guidance, but still maintain your free cash flow range. So just curious how you think about special dividend when you rank your priorities of use of cash flow? Thanks very much.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, Brian, on the first part of that the pressure from category exits is a little greater in Q4 than it was in Q3 and most particularly as it relates to the swim business in the non-go forward apparel business that we exited. So that pressure is a little greater for Victoria's in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter. So that's related to the delta that you are asking about observing in the comp in the question that you asked.",
            "As it relates to special dividend and return of cash, you've also been following us a long, long time. You know what our point of view is about that which is it is a very important source of return for our shareholders and one that we're deeply committed to in a balanced approach between regular dividends, special dividends and repurchases, particularly as it relates to, operating cash flow and CapEx and minimum cash levels.",
            "We earn a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter as you know, we generate a lot of our cash in the fourth quarter and we'll have the right discussions as we always do with our board and work to strike the right balance between a lot of interest and you should know that, the planning of any of the stuff including CapEx is dynamic.",
            "And so, we can, we regularly review the performance of our business and make judgments about how to balance reinvestment in the business and the results have been very strong today based on that reinvestment in real estate with IRR 20% to 25% or better for both Victoria’s and Bath & Body and that's where the substantial majority of the CapEx is going.",
            "But we also take very seriously managing the business appropriately to ensure that we've always have the right cash and liquidity in the business. We’ve got a strong balance sheet and a very good maturity profile and out debt and $1 billion revolver et cetera, but it's dynamic and a lot of cash generated in the fourth quarter and we’ll have the right discussions with our board as we go through the fourth quarter. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Brain. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Yes. Your next question is from John Morris from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.",
            "John Morris",
            "Thanks. Good morning everybody. Just a quick clarification Stuart and then a question for Nick and Jan if she is there. You know in the prepared pre-release transcript and we talked, we touched on the impact and thanks for pointing that out for Victoria’s Secret for the first half, in terms of comps, potentially negative high single, are we to think in terms of impact are we to think all things being equal, if you’re guide had been plus 2 to 3 or positive singles it's been would that sort of negative mid single or as far as we can see here it’s more like negative high single?",
            "And then maybe if we can just get a quick commentary from Nick and/or Jan if she is there, about the outlook for holiday this year versus last year and I know Jan wasn't there last year, but maybe what she is most excited about, what the differences are, what are you really most excited about? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So John, as you mentioned in your question we were trying to be helpful and qualify where we can, the effect of the exits including, preliminary view of the impact in the first half of 2017. But I really don't want to get ahead of ourselves and start to provide, full 2017 guidance when we haven't really even started the fourth quarter in a meaningful way yet. So, I understand your curiosity and why you’re curious about it, but again I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and say okay so and provide L Brands total revenue or comp guidance at this stage is premature, but we're trying to be helpful to you and others following the company about the qualification or significance of the exits in the first half of 2017, but I don't want to get, go down a path here where we're we now issuing 2017 guidance in early November, mid November of 2016.",
            "John Morris",
            "Understood.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Jane isn’t with us today, but the Victoria’s team is very enthused about holiday and we believe we have good plans for that business. And one thing that we're sure of is we will read and react and adjust based on those plans and we're enthused about having a very strong holiday result through, a range of new items and key items and giftable moments et cetera. And we'll all see how it unfolds and Nick will comment about their plans for Bath & Body works. Thanks John.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Hey, good morning John. Let's start with, I think we're in pretty good shape from an inventory perspective, so that sets us up well. Most importantly, you know as well as we know the backbone of our business is agility and so going into fourth quarter making sure we leverage in those muscles so we can react appropriately frankly to her shopping trends and/or the environment.",
            "And we do know the levels that we need to pull in the event that we need to drive traffic and/or drive units. We’ve very much like our customers flow effect. I know you saw that when you were out here and we continue to be comfortable with that. And I think things that we're most excited about probably evolve around understanding how our real estate will continue to perform during that timeframe or type of customer behaviour we get, both in those side-by-sides and in the shop in shops as slightly larger portion of our total fleet then they were at this time last year.",
            "And we're excited about the continuation of frankly strong and healthy home business and obviously the newness that we've delivered, what will transpire from that we’re excited about a fair chunk of the newness that's coming into the store that should be setting us up well for next year. ",
            "John Morris",
            "Nick, the assortment looks great and that eastern store looks terrific. Thanks.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Thank you very much.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks John. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Yes. Your next question is from Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.",
            "Matthew Boss",
            "Thanks. So at Victoria's Secret what's the best way to think about the evolution of the promotional strategy from here as we move into next year? What inning of change would you say we're in today? And then just how would you rank the underlying same-store sales opportunities to help offset the category drags into next year?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So, in terms of change in promotional strategy and where are we in that journey, I would say we’re still relatively early in that journey. So we have made some clear decisions to eliminate or reduce broad-based promotions like the free penny and $10 offer broad promotion that drove a lot of activity in the history of the business obviously made an important change in terms of the marketing, advertising and the prudent in promotion as well around, how we communicate with customers with respect to the catalogue, has made very good progress on driving trial through pricing and promotion in sports bras, bralettes and certain of the Victoria's Secret Beauty categories. But it’s a big subject as you are aware in how do you think about loyalty and loyalty programs, how do you think about proprietary credit, how do you think about the best ways to communicate with customers over time, these various promotional ideas.",
            "And others, more heavily involved in this, but I'm involved in it. I think we’re still relatively early on and as I think about that, I think that’s just a lot of opportunity for the business. So that would be my – in terms of some other things that can offset some of the drag, the most important thing for a business like ours, whether its Victoria’s or Bath & Body or Bendel any of them is to have great merchandise. That is a very clear point of view about the customer to have compelling regular flow of new key items that were she says I just got to have that, so that’s the most important thing. And we've got a lot of talented people working on that in all the major categories of the business at Victoria’s.",
            "And then the other thing I would mention because we believe strongly that it is a driver of sales growth and comp growth over time is continuing to improve our in-store selling and our in-store customer experience. And we've made some progress on that front. We've been talking about it as you know for a number years and we've laid out, our core ideas if you will, but we would share a view that, that there is ongoing meaningful opportunity to drive sales growth through continued improvement in the customer experience for our business, so and that’s just another category of opportunity for us.",
            "And maybe lastly, and Nick's spoken a lot about this, but into the corollaries, Victoria’s as well, when you get the store environment right and Nick's talked about the result of remodelled Bath & Body and Victoria’s has some pretty compelling store designs. That aspect of the experience is also very powerful in these categories and another driver of sales growth in these businesses.",
            "Matthew Boss",
            "Great. Best of luck.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thank you. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Yes. Your next question is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.",
            "Ike Boruchow",
            "Hi, good morning everyone. I guess Stuart, just a quick one, just looking through the segments in little bit more detail, can you help parse out some of the moving pieces in the other segment? Just because the losses I think came way down in the Q2 and now they are higher again in Q3 this year. So just curious what exactly is driving those quarterly puts and takes and how to talk about Q4 I'm not sure if that's your sense r what exactly we should, is moving that around? ",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Ike. The year-on-year driver in the other segment for the third quarter was the impact of a number of technology projects that are underway in the business and the expense portion of those projects that’s reflected in the other segments. So, in terms of the key year-on-year driver that’s what it was like in Q3.",
            "Ike Boruchow",
            "Got it. Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks. And I think we have time for one more question.",
            "Operator",
            "Certainly, your final question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.",
            "Oliver Chen",
            "Hi, thank you. As you do engage in the edits to the promotional strategies would seem really prudent for the long-term brand equity. What's the interplay with that and just setting our expectations appropriately for traffic over the medium term. And as we think about omni-channel for the long-term Stuart, what are the features which will continue to integrate Bricks and Clicks whether that be buy online, pickup in store and ship from store and what are the key opportunities you see are that make sense for, materially continuing to drive a big and relevant part of the business?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks Oliver. In terms of promotional strategies and how they affect traffic, big subject obviously, and as you appreciate Oliver a lot of things drive traffic and I would even start with we believe and I'm not trying to avoid your question, I'll get to it but just trying to share with you how we think.",
            "We believe we have a lot of sales growth opportunity with the traffic that we have, that you with the steady-state amount of traffic even as strong as our conversion rates are and I think they are among the best in specialty retail. The fact is, a lot of people that come into our stores that for whatever reason were not able to convert to buyers and again attract our conversion rates are very high, but there's more that we can do with the traffic that we have.",
            "So I would start there. Separately, promotional strategies are about striking balance on a number of fronts and certainly can and do drive traffic into the store. And through some of that promotional changes that we've implemented at Victoria’s we're continuing to evaluate the interplay between driving trial in key categories and the dynamic you're asking about which is driving incremental traffic into the store.",
            "And I think we're learning more about that and again we'll seek to strike the right balance. But the most important thing as it relates to promotional strategies is to do things that are healthy for the brand and don't damage the brand over time, but lot of balances to strike in the short-term.",
            "With respect to digital, Oliver, in terms of like what's going to be new or different, as you know we've terrific digital businesses the grow for both Victoria’s and Nick can comment about BBW very, very strong. The biggest opportunity for us in digital beyond continuing to grow the existing platforms well that are primarily focused on North America is to really go after the international opportunity for digital.",
            "So as opposed to one or two additional features for a consumer experience, the big opportunity for us in digital beyond what we're already doing is to more aggressively go after that business outside of North America.",
            "Oliver Chen",
            "Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Hey Oliver. If I bring it up just slightly higher level for us, we are constantly trying to figure out and indeed we are evolving the brand. And so the primary focus for us is how do we get the brand to next. And on the assumption that we fundamentally have the identical assortments online and in stores on the identical pricing strategy that allows us to really go back to basics, which is the number one goal for us online is to be able to market the brand, drive traffic, use it for storytelling and really use it for launching and information sharing of new products especially, if you go back to the beginning which is we're trying to continue to evolve this brand.",
            "That doesn’t negate our responsibility to figure out, how to grow the business and as you've been able to see we've continued to see very, very healthy growth in that and we will continue to invest in different formats, different models and different testing to ensure that we can do both of those. So it is really important channel, but is very much a complementary channel and very much used to market the brand.",
            "Oliver Chen",
            "Thanks for this transparency, best regards for Holiday.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thank you.",

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Amie Preston, Chief Investor Relations Officer for L Brands. Please go ahead.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Heidi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to L Brands' fourth quarter earnings conference call for the period ending Saturday, January 28, 2017. As you know, we released detailed commentary last night, which is available on our website, www.lb.com. Since our opening comments are brief, we plan to end the call around 9:45.",
            "As a matter of formality, I need to remind you that any forward-looking statements we may make today are subject to our Safe Harbor statements found in our SEC filings. Our fourth quarter earnings release, additional commentary, and the earnings presentation are all available on the website.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer, EVP and CFO; Nick Coe, CEO of Bath & Body Works; and Martin Waters, President of International, who is joining us from China this morning, are all joining us today.",
            "And now I'll turn the call over to Stuart.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We are not satisfied with our overall fourth quarter results. Performance was mixed. PINK and home fragrance at Bath & Body Works delivered solid results, but overall mall traffic decelerated in December, and at Victoria's Secret merchandise margin rates were negatively impacted by actions taken in order to end the year with clean inventory.",
            "Looking forward to 2017, we have confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for our business. Our brands are strong and lead their categories, and we have a talented and aligned leadership team. We are continuing to invest in initiatives that will drive significant growth, including White Barn remodels at Bath & Body Works and investment in China.",
            "As you know, in early 2016, we also made strategic changes at Victoria's Secret to streamline the business, focus on our core categories and accelerate growth. While these investments and strategic actions will continue to put pressure on results in 2017, we are confident that they are providing the platform for accelerated future growth.",
            "Beyond the short-term impacts to this year, we remain committed to our goals of growing annual operating income by 10% and an operating income rate in the high-teens. We will continue to focus on the things that we can control and manage inventory, expenses and capital spending with financial discipline.",
            "With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Nick.",
            "Nicholas Coe - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Stuart. So, just a few comments. While results were better than last year, they were below our expectations. And it really was out of speed or our business model really translated as agility that allowed us to win during a challenging Q4 environment.",
            "Looking back at Q4, though, there really continued to be a shift in traffic patterns, and that put pressure on us to think differently about how to play or how to maneuver our way through that really critical timeframe of the year. However, that shift in traffic provided an opportunity in January, allowing us to grow sales and margin as the quality of our inventory mix was good and demand was strong.",
            "Clearly we're not immune to the ups and downs or the fluctuations in customer behavior, but our business model becomes invaluable to ensure we can react appropriately. Missing our expectations on top line growth, but finishing with inventory down to last year and not having to overly promote the brand is a good place to be and frankly a positive outcome for the season.",
            "All in all, it was a challenging quarter, but we managed to grow top line and operating income with terrific insights into next year that we've already started to take action on. We remain committed to staying close to the customer and leveraging our business model to remain as nimble as we possibly can, as the market appears to continue to remain pretty dynamic.",
            "Just a thought on February, February was very much a month of ups and downs, and we were surprised by traffic trend, especially in the middle of the month during the holiday shift, about a 12-day period. Outside of those two weeks, our trend in the business really wasn't dissimilar to what took place in November and December. Some category shifts, nothing startling, and pretty much in line with what we've really been witnessing in the past. So I think it's difficult to predict true run rate until we get through March and April, where we obviously have more holiday shifts. And our online business has been good, so with the same assortment that leaves us back to what has been going on from a traffic perspective that we see in the mall.",
            "With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.",
            "Martin Waters - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everybody. As Amie said, I'm joining the call from Shanghai, where we just opened our first full assortment Victoria's Secret store in China today. Really a terrific store. About 25,000 square feet, four-floor store, a real global flagship for the brand, and I'm really delighted with our execution and frankly blown away by the customer reaction we've seen today.",
            "I was in Chengdu earlier this week. That store opens tomorrow. And before that, I was in Beijing, visiting the site of our flagship store for the Capital, and that opens in December. I continue to believe that China will be an enormous market for us and I'm very happy that we made the decision to invest now for long-term success.",
            "And, with that, I'll turn it back over to Amie.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Martin. And at this time, we are ready to take your questions. I'd like to remind everybody that we're trying to get to as many people as possible on the call, so please limit yourself to one question. Thanks. And I'll turn it back over to Heidi.",
            "Question-and-Answer Session",
            "Operator",
            "Your first question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.",
            "Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",
            "Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to really get a little bit more context around how you're approaching this year from an earnings guidance standpoint and perhaps give us a little bit more clarity on expectations around the extent of the deleverage in occupancy versus the merchandise margin opportunity, especially as we go throughout the year.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "So Paul, it's Stuart. Thanks for your question and good morning. In terms of how we're approaching earnings guidance this year versus what I'll call our historic approach or mindset, it's consistent. And that is that internally we seek to plan and run the business conservatively. And then when we have indication of opportunity and sales trends, we read and react and chase and pursue upside opportunity. And that mindset, as it relates to how we run the business on a near-term basis, is reflected in our earnings guidance. Meaning, we try to plan and forecast the business relatively conservatively.",
            "As it relates to the buying and occupancy rate for the year, there is going to be some deleverage in the P&L, driven by sales pressure on a top line basis and also ongoing investment both at Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works and remodeling stores. 2016, B&O benefited from the reduction of catalogue marketing activity, which we have historically classified, or do classify, in B&O. So, in terms of 2017, consistent overall mindset and some deleverage in the P&L and B&O driven by sales and ongoing investment in our stores. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Stuart. Next question, please",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS. Please go ahead.",
            "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC",
            "Hey, guys, good morning. Just a quick modeling question. If you could, could you please clarify the comment you made on the holiday shift in the middle of February. And I think you were trying to help us normalize that for some of the noise in the month and how you're comparing it to trends that you saw before February. I just want to make sure I was clear on that.",
            "Nicholas Coe - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Sure. Michael, I think the way we're looking at it is the timing shift between when Valentine's Day fell last year, when it fell this year, the timing shift between President's Day last year and President's Day this year. And in that 12-day window, we saw both mall and then ourselves pretty heavy traffic declines. Outside of that, which is where we saw a decline in our business, outside of that, the periods pre and post have been more stable and more consistent with the run rate that we had in November and December.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "And the other thing that I would add is that our quarter guidance, and it was in the commentary that was circulated last night, our quarter guidance assumes an improvement in the sales trend from February for the balance of the month.",
            "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC",
            "Okay. Thanks.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Balance of the quarter, excuse me. Balance of the quarter.",
            "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC",
            "Can I just ask you on, as we look at how the year could flow for you, maybe just a little more about what you're seeing in the business for the second half? Obviously, we're going to have two very different things going on, first half versus second half. But can you talk about some of the puts and takes to land you at what I think you're pointing to is maybe positive low single-digit comp trajectory in the second half, if I'm reading correctly that that's where you feel like the go-forward categories will be trending coming out of first half?",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "From a business standpoint, I mean, the assumption that's reflected in our modeling and our forecasting is that we'll continue to make meaningful improvements in our merchandise assortments and how we market and sell those in our business, particularly at Victoria's Secret. PINK has been a steady business and running well and very strong growth. We assume that that will continue. Easy to say, hard to do. But PINK is led by Denise Landman and has a great team.",
            "But as it relates to Lingerie and Beauty, as you know, we've got two new leaders in that business: Jan Singer and Greg Unis, and they're doing fundamental important work to improve merchandise assortment, the product itself, and we have a belief that the benefit of those efforts will particularly benefit the back half of the year. Also it will be a function of what we're lapping and it will be a function of the negative impact in the first half of the year related to the category exits at Victoria's. The pressure from China moderates in the back half of the year is another aspect of what's going on.",
            "So acceleration in business at Victoria's Lingerie and Beauty, the effect of the swim and non-go-forward apparel exits concentrated in the first half, and then some timing as it relates to the drag from China year-on-year putting pressure on the first half of the year and not so much in the second half.",
            "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC",
            "Thanks a lot, guys.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Sure.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks. Next question, please.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.",
            "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC",
            "Good morning, everyone. How are you thinking about real estate and the store base, given the mall traffic environment and what's happening in the malls, how do you see it evolving go forward? Thank you.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "So, to answer it, obviously an important question, we believe that our brands best come to life in a store environment. We have strong, terrific, compelling, highly profitable online businesses, as you know, about $2 billion in sales related to our online business and a big global opportunity. But kind of reflecting our belief in the store business, Martin Waters is on this call from China in part because of the importance of the physical store and the experience that that represents.",
            "With that said, as provided in the circulated commentary last night, we will continue to monitor our real estate investment, our square footage, our productivity, our profitability, our CapEx on a regular basis. And as compared to the view that we had and shared with you during the October Analyst Day, we pulled back our CapEx related to real estate, about $125 million, between then and our current view. And we'll continue to look at it through the year, depending upon the performance in our business. And that reduction was in dollars about equally split between Victoria's and Bath & Body Works.",
            "So, our real estate is in terrific shape. As you know, 99-plus-percent of our store is cash flow positive. Our sales per foot, more than $800 a foot. A lot of the investment in square footage expansion that we're making relates to the PINK business that has sales productivity of $1,300, $1,400 a foot. But again, all that said, we'll continue to monitor the results and adjust accordingly. And last, last, (15:50) we're participating well in both channels. So, we have a very strong store base business and we have a very strong online business in North America and one that will emerge globally.",
            "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC",
            "Thank you.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Sure.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Great. Thanks, Dana. Next question, please.",
            "Operator",
            "From Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.",
            "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC",
            "Great. Thank you. Good morning. I'm wondering if you can sort of step back and reflect on all of the strategic changes made at Victoria's Secret last year and share with us what are the results that you've seen that are in line with what you were hoping to see. And relative to your expectations when you started on this journey, what are the pieces that have come through in a somewhat disappointing way? Thanks so much.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Sure. Thanks, Kimberly. So, in terms of an overall assessment of the changes that Victoria's implemented in 2016, the first I would say is that we attracted through the changes that we made a younger customer, which we believe is very important to our business. We've always felt that way, Les has felt that way about our businesses from the very beginning. Having that younger customer is very important and we believe we made substantial progress on that.",
            "Secondly, Kimberly, I would say that we drove a lot of unit growth in the bra business. And as you're aware, as most are aware, there are two emerging categories or newer categories in the bra business that we pursue very, very aggressively, and we drove a lot of growth in those categories, and those being bralettes and sport bras. And so that was a goal. We went after it in a big way and we drove substantial growth in those businesses.",
            "The next thing that comes to my mind in an assessment is that we brought two new – we reorganized the business. As you're aware, it was run as one business. We broke it into three parts: Lingerie, PINK, and Beauty. And through that, combined the store and online channels under each of those three leaders.",
            "And how I would assess that is Denise Landman's been in the business a long time, has a very strong track record. And through those changes, I think that that organizational change only gives us more confidence in the ongoing growth opportunity for PINK. And that manifests itself in terms of space allocation, marketing resources, et cetera, selling efforts online and in stores. The ability to pursue growth in PINK is enhanced through that organizational change.",
            "We're very optimistic about what Greg Unis and Jan Singer are going to do for our business. It's early. If you said, well, tangibly, what have they done, we'll see more of that in 2017. But based on their entry into the business, their onboarding into the business, and how they present themselves as retail leaders and merchants, marketing perspective, et cetera, very, very encouraged about what they'll be able to do for our business.",
            "I would say, as it relates to the marketing of the business, as you know, Kimberly, we were spending substantial money in an old idea called the paper catalogue, and realized that there's probably some controversy with that idea of eliminating that marketing vehicle, but it was a primary vehicle for us, and we believe one that was out of date. And I think we made good progress, more to do, but good progress on shifting and accelerating – we've obviously always been a digital marketer, but taking some of that financial resource and maybe more importantly mind time and shifting that to more relevant ways of communicating with today's customer, I think we made good progress on that. More to do, but that shift, I think, was reasonably well-executed.",
            "We've spoken before, but I think in answer to your question, it's worth highlighting again, one of the specific things that Greg was able to do in the Beauty business is he reduced the SKU count, the assortment, by 35% to 40%. And working with the Mast sourcing function is now making very heavy use of what we call the Beauty Park here in the Greater Columbus area, the benefit of which, as you know, is about reducing lead times and driving speed. So, very good progress in rationalizing the assortment and reducing lead times through the Beauty Park opportunity.",
            "Maybe lastly, I would say we drove a lot of trial in key categories with promotions. But I would say that we're still learning how to balance driving overall traffic to the store with, and in that goal, with driving unit growth and volume in select categories. And I think we made some progress there, certainly, but that's an area that the team is thinking a lot about, how to strike the right balance between driving, again, growth in key categories and more fundamentally just driving traffic to the store.",
            "So, those would be the – we exited the swim business and we ended our inventory clean. So, we sold through the swim goods that we bought and did so in a pretty reasonable way at a healthy margin. And those goods have been sold through. And through all the changes that you're aware of and I've tried to headline here, we ended the year with inventory numerically and qualitatively at Victoria's in very, very good shape.",
            "So, we've got pressure in the first half of the year, as we've outlined, as you appreciate from the sales and margin impact on the non-go-forward business that we had a year ago, but we're optimistic that we've laid a good foundation for accelerated growth in the back half of 2017 and for the next several years. Long answer, but a big question.",

            "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Following up, Stuart, on those comments about promotions and the shift towards driving trial versus just driving traffic to the store, last year when you made a pretty dramatic change in your approach to promos. As you think about this year, could we see a bit of a reversion to some of the old methods that had been successful in driving traffic? Maybe not a full return to the mailers, but are you kind of reevaluating the sort of aggressive reduction in promos as maybe an opportunity to do a little bit better in traffic?",
            "And also, as you think about how aggressive the markdowns were, in bras specifically, towards the end of last year and into holiday, do you feel like maybe there's just a little bit of fatigue right now from the consumer that's weighing on the business because they came off such a very promotional holiday that she needs a bit of a reset and that's part of what's kind of weighing on the business in the short term? Thank you.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Sure. So short answer to your first question, which is about continuing to evaluate the nature of promotion, the short answer to that is absolutely yes. And one shouldn't conclude from that and you recognized it in how you phrased the question. We're not going to go right back to where we were promotionally in terms of just very significant quantities of very simple, not brand-building coupons as we would refer to them. But we are reevaluating how to have relevant promotion delivered in a brand-building way to her in traditional mail and electronically and communicate it in a number of ways as you would appreciate and those evaluations continue and they're very important to the business. And I'm optimistic that we'll make good ground on that this year in 2017.",
            "As it relates to the promotional fatigue, Lindsay, I think there could be some aspect of what you're describing. But what I really think about, in answer to your question, is what is most important to Victoria's Secret or Bath & Body or businesses like these is having fresh, new, compelling product. And if we deliver well on that, or I should say when we deliver well on that, all these other aspects diminish in importance pretty significantly. And that is absolutely what Denise and Greg and Jan are focused on, which is regular flow of compelling new merchandise into the business. Again, is there some aspect of what you're describing that may be true? Probably, it's a reasonable theory. But I'm highly confident that what really solves all of that is compelling newness in our assortments.",

            "Hey, thanks, guys. Just curious if anything changed in how you promoted either of the businesses in February. And also, have you seen periods in the past where things fell off to this magnitude one quarter to the next? And if so, what was the reason behind it, how did that get fixed? Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Paul. We'll start with Nick.",
            "Nicholas Coe - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Hi, Paul. It's Nick. We didn't really make any major changes to the promotional activity in the month of February. So, obviously, we came off of a very strong January and came into February. And, as I said, the real challenge was in the middle of the month. What was interesting to us during the month was where we tried to fight traffic and pulse different ideas, we found pretty solid receptivity from the customer. So, whether she was in the mall or not or whether she was anticipating to shop or not during that change in traffic, our ability to drive traffic if we needed to with different pulses was actually pretty positive, which says, underneath all of that, do we have product acceptance, do we still have a compelling brand proposition? And so that's kind of one aspect of it.",
            "The other aspect of it was we were also – we're very much a short-cycle business, and the importance of us testing especially product, less so price, but especially product to give us clues into where should we be going has also been very valuable during the month that gives us a pretty solid point of view in terms of how do we want to evolve the brand and where do we want to take the brand to, especially in light of the fact that we are a very short cycle business.",
            "So, that's really the – there was no major change to the promotional or marketing aspect to it outside of just trying to understand receptivity during those difficult traffic periods.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Paul, Nick alluded to it earlier in his remarks for both Bath & Body and Victoria's Secret, the businesses continues to be very strong online. And that's just a very important point to register. And we have seen, in our businesses, and as reported by third-party service, a substantial reduction in mall traffic in February for whatever reason. Is it tax refunds? Who knows what it is. But it was a substantial falloff. And so fundamentally, that's what's going on. And what we're focused on, as a management team, is what we can control, which is about, again, product and managing the business with financial discipline. And we'll do that.",
            "But I think we had – and then the last point, just to make sure we understand, we quantified it for you guys in the pre-circulated remarks is another compounding factor in all this is the impact of the exits at Victoria's on their number and on the total company number, which in the first part of the year, as you know, is significant. So, when you look at the headline level number, it gets your attention and it certainly gets ours. But, again, it's mall traffic. It's the impact of the exits at Victoria's. And, again, what gives us some level of confidence and comfort is the business continues to perform very well online.",

            "Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, guys. I guess, a follow-up on February. So, historically, do later tax refunds affect the BBW customer disproportionately or is this additional volatility being seen at both businesses right now? I guess, understanding the limited visibility out there, but what kind of a comp at Victoria's are you embedding in 1Q guide and for the year? Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "So, we'll start with Nick.",
            "Nicholas Coe - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Yeah. Hi, Anna. I don't know if we can genuinely sit here and factually comment on whether there's an impact associated with that. It wouldn't surprise me if it's a nation of fierce consumers and they're waiting for cash to come back. There could be an impact of that. But I think it would be dangerous and/or difficult for us to genuinely quantify that. I think it will be interesting to see what will happen. And, as I said earlier in the remarks, it's going to be difficult anyway because of the Easter shift. So, it will be important to get through March and April and understand the combination of both of those months. So we shall see.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "The guidance assumption for Victoria's for the quarter – first quarter in total is down low double-digits. So, call it, 12%, 13%.

            "Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. Stuart, just with the moving pieces on the top line, can you help quantify the puts and takes and the gross margin expectations for Q1 and the full year? Just thinking through, with the exits largely behind, you mentioned clean inventory. I think you called out Beauty being up mid-single. Just shouldn't there be some merch margin improvements? So, maybe any help thinking through the size of the pieces behind the significant Q1 decline. Thanks.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Sure. The decline in gross margin percentage in Q1 is driven by the occupancy deleverage that I mentioned before. And so, for the company in total, there's a slight decline in the merchandise margin rate, but the real phenomena going on within the gross margin line is the deleverage effect related to occupancy.",
            "Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura/Instinet",
            "And then just thinking through those pieces, should there be a point where the merch margin starts – or ends up being a positive, a tailwind to merch margin?.",

And if mall traffic remains negative and mix skews to that lower price point, what do you guys see as the path to getting back to positive comps at Victoria's Secret? Thank you.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "So mix will present some pressure for Victoria's in the first half of the year as we went after the bralette and lower AUR sport bra business aggressively in the second half of 2016. So the mix will present some pressure in the first half of 2017, should not in the back half of 2017.",
            "In terms of how we're going to grow sales at Victoria's Secret, it really gets back to the merchandise most fundamentally, and then how we market and sell effectively, both in stores and online. And through some of the commentary previously, hopefully you know that our dominant emphasis is on merchandise itself, and then through compelling store design and compelling online presentation, good interactions with associates, sales experiences in stores, that's how we drive growth in the business.

            "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two quick ones. Just wanted to hear more about PINK. Which opportunities in category growth do you think are the greatest? I obviously know you're not getting out of swim there, but how big do you think that business could be and what are the most exciting opportunities there?",
            "And then maybe just Nick could just talk briefly on the Signature. I think that was a little bit of a slowdown in the holiday quarter, and curious what the timing is of the opportunity to course-correct that product category. Thanks very much.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Brian, I think, as you know, with respect to PINK, we continue to be very bullish on that business. And they've got a very strong loungewear and apparel business, and they've had that for a long time, and they've always had a very strong panty business, and they've also developed a very compelling high growth, high profit bra business within that brand.",
            "So, in terms of the growth opportunity, we see, and I realize how this may come across, but we see several billions of growth and opportunity really to double that business over the next four or five years based on results that have been achieved over time and our extrapolation mathematically around square footage in North America, let alone what we may be able to do internationally.",
            "As you know, that starts with a clear brand identity and brand position. And then very strong merchandise and marketing execution consistent with that position and leveraging capabilities that you've heard us talk a lot about, including read and react and chase and short lead times and all of that, that whole mindset. And, again, Denise and her team have such a strong understanding of that customer. They're not perfect. They don't get it right every time, but their record is very, very good. And when they do have a miss, which is inevitable in these businesses because of those short lead times and just their mindset of how they run that business, they adjust very quickly. So, very optimistic about the growth potential for PINK over the next several years.",

            "Thanks. Nick?",
            "Nicholas Coe - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Yeah. Hi, Brian. So, I think the best way to think about this is, obviously, I mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of having a short cycle business is that we get to leverage one of our best competencies, which is testing. So we've had a relatively aggressive testing agenda taking place during spring, and that will continue. And those reads will be most beneficial for the back half. So more to come on that, as we get to the back half.",
            "I think the other way of looking at it is, and with each delivery as we go through the spring season, there will be newness that is of a nature that's helping us to evolve the brand as we move forward. And I'm talking specifically about Signature, as per your question. So, we'll be in a read and react mode in spring for the back half and we'll also be in a read and react mode for things we've put into the assortments that are coming anyway or have come and are coming anyway that will all lead to how do we evolve this part of the business. And so far, we're confident with what we're seeing, and I think we're moving in a pretty solid direction.",

            "Thanks. So, with the moderation in the core Victoria's Secret comp, how much of the decline do you think is company-specific versus category dynamics? And, I guess, said differently, do you think you're losing share in the Intimates category, or is it overall category growth perhaps declining, just given the lower AURs?",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Yeah. I think depending upon whether you measure share in units or dollars, you might get a little bit different answer, because we drove very strong unit growth in 2016. We don't think about market share a lot, frankly. Because as the market leader and the dominant participant in the category, what we're looking to do is to grow the market fundamentally. But while there certainly are some emerging competitors and some well-known names, if you will, and then some smaller emerging players, while we've always had competition from the beginning of the Victoria's Secret business, we think we're well-positioned based on all the equities that the brand has and the capabilities of the team and the organization to continue to be in a very good leadership position. And again, we drove significant unit growth in 2016 in our categories. Thanks.",

            "Thanks. Hey, guys. I'd just like to dive in a little bit more into the bra business, into Lingerie and Bra business and AUR specifically. As I recall, last year you had pressure on AUR from sale product and from couponing: It sounds like this year and the back half of last year, some pressure there from trial on sport and bralettes. So, looking forward through 2017 and beyond, when should we start to see AUR begin to stabilize? And then can you talk about the merchandise margin complexion of bralettes and sport versus, say, your traditional bras and push-up business?",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Sure. Thanks, Marni. Short answer to your first part of your question is I would expect stabilization of AURs in the back half of 2017, reflecting the commentary earlier about our aggressive push into bralettes and sport bras that we pursued in the fall of 2016. And those categories in the bra business do come at lower AURs. We'll be anniversarying that. And so I would expect that we would have a stabilization of AUR. And I'm trying to remember the second part of your question.",
            "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker",
            "Just the complexion of the margin between bralette and sport versus your traditional bra and push-up business?",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Yeah. Over time, Marni, we would expect to have those margin rates be similar to the overall bra business. Now I said over time. We were very aggressive in pricing in 2016 to drive a lot of unit growth and a younger customer to our business. And that was intentional. It was by design. And we were successful in doing that. With that said, we will, through fundamentally differentiation of merchandise in those categories, look to have margin rates over time that are more similar to the overall bra business. And we're not formulaic about that. One should use a lot of judgment on that. And you've got to think about dollar growth versus rates and so on. And we try to do our best at that.",
            "But maybe by example, if we thought about some other parts of our business over time, for example, the PINK business, there was a time when the PINK business had margin rates that were meaningfully below Victoria's Secret Lingerie margin rate. That's no longer the case. And they did a great job through compelling merchandise, sourcing capability, speed, read, react, adjust to meaningfully improve margin rates while still driving terrific growth in that business. And we'll be looking to do the same in the sport bra and bralette categories.",
            "Marni Shapiro - The Retail Tracker",
            "If you pull out the sport bra and bralette category for just a moment and you look at your core bra business, the go-forward part of it, has that portion stabilized or are you still aggressive there as well? I'm just trying to separate the two. Because you almost have two bra businesses right now.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "I understand, and I want to be a little sensitive to how much we give out on a call. But there was some AUR pressure in the constructed bra business in 2016. And, obviously, we'll be looking to moderate that and get to flat or improved AURs in 2017 as the year progresses.",

            "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC",
            "Hi. Thank you. As we do look forward, what's the nature, or a general framework for how you are thinking about pricing between your core versus sports and bralette? And you did touch upon this, but would love any additional thoughts on the nature of competition just because as we think about categories and channels and online pure plays, curious about what's happened with competition as you brief us on pivots you're making in the business.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Oliver. So, on the first question around pricing, pricing as a subject is a big subject. And at the end of the day, in our business generally, and it would be true in the intimate apparel business and the bra businesses, we want to create differentiated merchandise, compelling merchandise where we have emotional content. And from that, as you know, pricing power. And we think we do that pretty well through the merchandise itself and through the quality of the store format, the online experience, interaction with sales associates, the emotional content in its fullest sense. First and foremost, the merchandise, but everything that surrounds it in the business. And so, that's how we work to create value. And then we balance promotional activity to ensure that in important time periods and just to drive traffic and volume and transactions, relationship over time, that we're driving volume, balancing rate and pricing and dollar results. So, that's how we think about it generally. I realize that that may sound pretty general, but that's how we think about it.",
            "As it relates to competition, the first thing I would say, and this, I realize you'll take it for what it's worth, perhaps, but frankly I'm glad we're in categories that are attracting competition. So, one of the things that we feel strongly about in this business is that we're in two great categories of retail and that is personal care and beauty and, separately, intimate apparel. And if we were in categories of retail where you'd say it was intensely competitive and the average margin was 4% operating income rate, I could think about some other categories of retail that might cause you to conclude one thing. Intimate apparel, personal care and beauty have been very attractive categories for a long time. And there has been a regular flow of new competitors for a long time, 20, 25, 30 years. At the end of the day, based on the leadership positions that we have, the quality of the brands that we have, and the quality of leadership that we believe we have in the business, we remain very confident about our ability to maintain and grow our leadership positions in those two broad categories of retailing. So, is there a little bit more news out there today? Probably is. But again, we remain very confident.",
            "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC",

I'm curious about that because I know it's been a strategy to generate trial. But will that fade off or should we expect that in the second half as well?",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",

Maybe if you can remind us when you started seeing the pressure on that business from FX? So, when should you start to cycle it? And then it looks like the VSBA business is also still seeing some pressure? But any thoughts around that improving now that we're seeing Beauty improve at VS in the U.S.? Thanks.",

And, as you know, under new leadership, we're starting to see some traction there and we're excited about what's in front of us for the spring season. And I would expect that to flow through in a replication model to all of our international businesses, be they in the big store format or the small store format. So, yeah, I think pretty much the same pattern. That what you get away from home is the same as you get at home. Stuart, do you want to comment on when we cycle the FX?",

Susan, currency started impacting our company in total and, as you would expect, largely or meaningfully in the International segment really beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014. And that effect continued through 2015, continued into 2016, but moderated in the back half of 2016, and we don't expect, at this point, a significant FX pressure in 2017.",

The extent of the change is relatively small, to be honest with you, Susan. What I would tell you and I'm somewhat biased because I'm sitting here in China is that China is absolutely fantastic. This is a great opportunity and I'm thrilled with what we're doing here. The opportunities, both in the local market and in the travel sector in China will be just spectacular in the years to come.",

            "Amie Preston",
            "Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to L Brands' first quarter earnings conference call for the period ending Saturday, April 29, 2017. As you know, we've released detailed commentary last night which is available on our website. ",
            "As a matter of formality, I need to remind you that any forward-looking statements we may make today are subject to our safe harbor statement found in our SEC filings. Our earnings release, additional commentary and our earnings presentation are all available on our website, lb.com. ",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer, EVP and CFO; Nick Coe, CEO Bath & Body Works; and Martin Waters, President of International, are all joining us today. ",
            "And now I'll turn the call over to Stuart.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Amie and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter earnings results were slightly ahead of our beginning-of quarter guidance. We reported earnings per share of $0.33 compared to our guidance of between $0.20 and $0.25. $0.06 of upside was driven by the lower-than-forecasted tax rate. ",
            "After a particularly challenging February which we believe was related in part to a delay in the timing of income tax refunds, we gained momentum through the remainder of the quarter. ",
            "Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we have confidence in the growth opportunities for our business. Our brands are strong and lead their categories and we have an experienced and aligned leadership team. We're continuing to invest in initiatives that will drive significant growth, including White Barn remodels at Bath & Body Works and investment in China. ",
            "As you know, about a year ago, we made strategic changes at Victoria's Secret to streamline the business, focus on our core categories and accelerate growth. While these investments and strategic actions will continue to put pressure on results in 2017, we're confident that they are providing the platform for accelerated future growth. ",
            "Beyond the short term impacts to this year, we remain committed to our goals at growing annual operating income by 10% and an operating income rate in the high teens. We will continue to focus on the things that we can control and manage inventory, expenses and capital spending with financial discipline. ",
            "With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Nick.",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "Thanks, Stuart. Good morning. Just a few comments. We started -- I'd like to really start by highlighting that we finished the quarter with results that were much better than we started the quarter. Once we got past the challenges of February, we were able to get back into positive territory during March and April time frame. The reason I mentioned that is because I think it really proves the agility that we have in the business when things aren't right to be able to get back on track. ",
            "Our earnings were down 9% for the quarter, but I really want to point out that, that was pretty much driven by the expense deleverage associated with the increased occupancy cost as we continue to invest in our brand and make sure that the most important place of our brand is in the stores. And we've always want those to look good and we've obviously demonstrated, we can get return on investment there. ",
            "Moving on to the retail landscape. It remains highly dynamic and certainly, traffic has not been kind to many during Q1. However, we did find ways to drive traffic, drive good traffic with our agility in the quarter resulting in AUR growth. ",
            "The home fragrance business remained the key driver for us, but we also saw body care start to build momentum during the quarter. And I think that's a direct result of the investments that we've made into that business or made into that category. ",
            "We continue to flex our muscles in speed and testing on a daily basis and we've continued to learn an awful lot about the customer acceptance of both product and promotion ideas which has given as good ideas and good momentum as we go into the second quarter. ",
            "Q1 has been one of the most aggressive testing periods for us, really giving us insights into how do we think we ought to manage the business, how do we think we ought to manage the brand as we continue to move the brand forward. We're feeling good about the direction of our product assortments, but we will continue to leverage our read-and-react capabilities to meet customer expectations. And obviously, we'll continue to make sure we're leveraging our operational and our fiscal disciplines. ",
            "With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everybody. In the international business, we experienced a continuation of some of the challenges from 2016 in the first quarter of the year, including softness in beauty; difficult market conditions in the Middle East and Turkey; some FX pressure; and of course, our investment in China, also continues to negatively impact us in the near term. ",
            "I'd also note that profitability in the U.K. was down in the first quarter, driven primarily by the exit of swim and apparel and of course, additional pressure from the preopening cost in Dublin and some FX impact as well. ",
            "On a brighter note, the Bath & Body Works business did very well in the quarter, with positive comps and growth in operating income. And we opened our first 2 full assortment stores, Victoria's Secret stores in Mainland China in the first quarter to a good response. ",
            "We continue to be bullish about growth opportunities in China and around the world. And 2017 will be an exciting year for us as we continue to build on our footprint globally. Amie?",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Yes. Thanks, Martin. That concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have. [Operator Instructions]. And I'll turn it back over to Lisa.",
            "Question-and-Answer Session",
            "Operator",
            "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi.",
            "Paul Lejuez",
            "Just curious, have there been any moves that were made on the Victoria's Secret side of the business that you're reconsidering in any way, either for the second half or F '18? And then I think you guys made a comment that you were looking to focus on the constructed bra business in the second half. Just curious if that meant in any way that you'd be pulling back from bralette and/or sport as a percent of mix.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Paul, it's Stuart. So in terms of the significant changes that we made at Victoria's Secret, are we considering reversing or stepping back from any of those changes? The short answer is no. We feel very good about the decisions that we made and that they are the right changes to drive focus and accelerated growth for the business. The second question was around constructed bras, sport bras, bralettes. It's not a deemphasis, Paul, on bralettes or sport bras, but rather, I would just say, an increased flow of newness and compelling bra launches in the constructed bra space that we believe will improve the result in the constructed bra space and get it back to the growth trajectory that we would expect. So it's not a per se deemphasis on, again, bralettes and sport bras, but rather increased flow of compelling new ideas, particularly beginning in the July period that we expect will drive healthy growth in that part of the business. Thanks.",
            "Operator",
            "Our next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.",
            "Kimberly Greenberger",
            "Stuart, my question is on gross margin. It fell 330 basis points here in Q1. I'm wondering if you could break down the buying and occupancy deleverage piece of that from the merchandise margin. And then it sounds like gross margin is expected to be a bit better in the second quarter. How should we think about those 2 components within your guidance for Q2?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. Thanks, Kimberly. In terms of the gross margin decline, the bigger driver was the buying and occupancy deleverage. There was some decline in the merchandise margin rate as well. As we move forward, we believe that based on the quality of our inventory that we'll see an improved result in the merchandise margin rate trend in the second quarter. Inventories are in great shape. We did a lot of liquidation last year in semiannual sale at Victoria's. And we believe that we'll have a better rate outcome at Victoria's, including through contributions in the beauty side of that business. Thanks.",
            "Operator",
            "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.",
            "Paul Trussell",
            "Just big picture. Could you just talk about some of the learnings regarding the changes that you've made in your promotional strategy? What's working and what's not? And then more specifically, just could you speak to the expected go-forward category comps in lingerie? Obviously, down meaningfully here in the first quarter as you have a lower AUR offsetting what you all said was a mid-teens growth rate in total lingerie bra units. Help us understand how we should think about that as the year progresses as we'd lap in cycles some of the robust bralette growth in the second half last year.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So in terms of learnings in promotional strategy, starting with the biggest change that we made in terms of communication and some related promotion, we continue to feel that the elimination of the catalog at Victoria's Secret was fundamentally an appropriate move for the business in the day and age that we're in. So that would be the first major changes that we made and again, feel that, that was a strong move. ",
            "Obviously, communicating with customers comes in various forms. And doing that digitally, electronically, through e-mail, through social media, all of those forms are important and we're active in each of those channels. And then lastly and it may be, at the heart of your question is we made important changes in our direct mail programs beginning about this time a year ago. And the learning there was that -- what we had been doing was highly promotional offers and a standard offer that didn't have much variation to it in terms of dollars off bra and getting a free panty. And as we've moved through 2016 and into '17, we're contacting customers more than we were a few months ago through direct mail, but doing so in a brand appropriate way and with a range of offers that we believe are more compelling and more interesting and not as brand damaging.",
            "So I would say that reflects the learning there. So that's kind of where we're. In terms of growth in the major lingerie categories, I mean, our expectation would be that we grow any significant category of our business on a comp basis, mid-single or better in terms of sales growth with healthy margin. That's our overall thinking as we run these businesses that we have. And we would hope to begin achieving that in the major lingerie categories at this fall.",
            "Operator",
            "Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.",
            "Oliver Chen",
            "Our question is regarding your framework and thinking around the store base. All your stores are overall profitable, the majority are. But I'm just curious about what's your assumption for when accelerations of closures happen at other competitors that are out of your control, department stores as well as specialty? And as you think about the U.S., store bases for both VS and Bath & Body Works and online, continues to grow. What are you thinking for your guideline overall? And how might that change based on the variables that you monitor as you try to prioritize the right investment across higher- versus lower-productivity stores?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. So it's a big question, big subject you're asking about. So our first guideline is to ensure that our store environments are interesting and exciting. And through a combination of the store design, the merchandise we sell and the experience that our sales associates provide that we create an environment that is compelling for consumers. So the most important guideline is that. And our belief is that when we do that well, we have a very strong bricks-and-mortar results which we do. As you know, our productivity in both our major businesses is north of $800 a foot. And as you know, 99% -- plus percent of our stores generate positive cash flow.",
            "As you know, we open and close stores every year and have for years and years, so we're regularly maintaining the fleet. We have not seen significant impact when department stores close their stores. That's not a new phenomena, by the way and we've studied it over the last 5 to 10 years on a mall-specific basis. And we haven't seen any meaningful impact to our businesses in those specific situations. Maybe a couple more points. We have a lot of flexibility in our real estate and that really comes in 2 forms. One is that we have strong protections in the majority of our -- substantially all of our lease agreements, where if mall occupancy levels fall below a certain level or certain named tenants are no longer doing business in a mall then we have the right to leave that situation with no lease liability. So that provides flexibility. ",
            "And then with respect to our capital spending, particularly in North America, it's pretty short cycle. And what I mean by that is that we can make adjustments based on macro factors, our own company-specific performance, on a pretty short cycle. And to put some -- maybe 2 points of evidence around that, when we were with you guys in October, we'd indicated that we're -- our CapEx would be as much as $1 billion in 2017 and we've made adjustments based on the performance of our business and now we're expecting CapEx at around $850 million. So a significant adjustment in our real estate activity, again, based on adjustment about risk and reward in the near term. So a lot of flexibility on that and further in on a more extreme basis in the Great Recession. As you'll remember, we pulled our CapEx back from at that time a level of around $500 million to just over $200 million based on the situation at that time. So a lot of flexibility.",
            "So again, headline level, the first thing that's most important and it's why we're investing in things like the remodels at Bath & Body Works is #1 guideline is make it interesting for consumers and they will come. And there are many in retail or certainly a number in retail outside of our company that where they've gotten a strong brand, compelling assortments, a clear position, they're actually doing very well in retail. And again, I'm referring to companies outside of L Brands. Within our company, the PINK business, the Bath & Body Works business and a part from the adjustments we've made at Victoria's Secret, the Victoria's business over a long period of time has done very, very well. And then again, the health of our real estate fleet, as I've outlined, is very strong and we've got a lot of flexibility. So that's how we think about it. Thank you.",
            "Operator",
            "Our next question comes from the line of Lindsay Mann from Goldman Sachs.",
            "Lindsay Mann",
            "I wanted to ask about monthly sales. It's great that you guys still give us the color on a monthly basis. More recently, you've had some challenges, achieving guidance that you set out ahead of the month. So I just wanted to ask about sort of the thought process when you set your target for monthly sales. Is it a function of kind of run rate? Or is it more aspirational of what you hope to achieve? And then for May, we noticed you didn't take the opportunity to update your expectation for May in this earnings release. Does that suggest you're on track with what your performance objectives are for the month?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Lindsay. It's Stuart. So with respect to the guidance that we provide at the beginning of the month, I would call it a 50-50 view, meaning an expectation as we start the month. It's not an aspirational number nor is it a sandbag number, so I'd describe it as a 50-50 view. And that's how we thought about it consistently. And in -- if we go back over the last 5 to 7 years, when our business is performing very well, we meet or exceed those numbers. And when we've got some unanticipated challenges, some of them company specific, some of them at times macro, sometimes we miss the number. But more times than not, over a longer period of time, we've met or exceeded those numbers. So that's how we think about it, a 50-50 view. With respect to May, in terms of performance to date, it's in line with what we expected at the beginning of the month which reflecting the negative impact of the non-go-forward business was to be down mid- to high single. On a go-forward basis, there'd be a slight increase in comps for the month. That was our beginning-of-month expectation and today we're running in line with them. Thanks.",
            "Operator",
            "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada.",
            "Kate Fitzsimons",
            "This is Kate on for Brian. I guess, just on BBW. Things like home fragrance has really been leading the comps, but it seems like there's some green shoots going on in the body care categories. Can you just expand on what you're seeing there and what we should we be looking for as the year progresses in categories outside from home? And then just can you also remind us, what store comp do we need at BBW in order to leverage occupancy, just given the real estate projects happening?",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "Sure. Well, I think what we're experiencing at the moment in our let's call it bodycare business, is the customers got a much higher degree of curiosity as it relates to the product from a health, well-being, good-for-you, efficacious aspect. And we feel good about the early reads, the early signs that we've got as we've ventured into that category. She continues to really want to come to us for a full bodycare experience, be that fragrance, be that shower gel or be that of a more efficacious nature. And as we continue to play in those areas, she continues to find or we're experiencing us being pretty receptive, that she's being very receptive to that. So that's a pretty big clue for us. As it relates to other categories that we'll go into around there, we're testing stuff. ",
            "As I mentioned earlier on, it was probably one of our most aggressive quarters in terms of things that we've tested that have given us really good clues as it relates to what not to do as well as what to do. So I'm not going to share with you the categories that we're going to go into rather than that we will continue it to expand in that area and grow. The return on investment -- the comp that we need to see from a return on investment with those stores is in the high single-digits comp territory. And we continue to be pleased with the results that we've got from those remodels. And as Stuart articulated earlier on, the single most important thing that we have, the single most important asset that we have are our brands. And as we look at the retail landscape and think about the lack of investment that has gone into retail, we don't want to fall into that category. So you're going to see this ongoing pressure on our P&L as we continue to appropriately invest in the stores, make sure that we're investing in a manner that provides us with the right ROI and get back to the point of is it a great experience for the customer when she comes into the store.",
            "And we like the results so far and we'll obviously do that on a basis that says, \"Are we continuing to get what we want?\" And if we're not, we'll adjust; and if we're, we'll continue. And that's a good thing, I think, for the brand. I think it's a good thing for the business and obviously, that's a good thing for the model as well.",
            "Operator",
            "Our next question comes from the line of Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer.",
            "Anna Andreeva",
            "We had a follow-up on the bra category. I guess, as you lap all of the deflationary pressure from bralettes this summer, should we expect to see some stabilization in price there? And then with the trial activity in lingerie and sport, it's been extensive for a few quarters now. How has that performed versus expectations? And do you expect to see some moderation of that in the back half?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Anna, it's Stuart. So do we expect to see stabilization in overall AURs as we move through 2017? The answer to that is absolutely yes. Given the growth that we drove in the back half of '16 and the first part of '17 in the bralette and sport bra businesses, that will stabilize. And as was commented on earlier, Jan and the team very focused on newness and innovation and compelling bra launches in the constructed space in the back half of the year. So absolutely expect prices to stabilize. With respect to driving unit growth and trial in bralettes and sport bras, I mean, we were extremely aggressive about that in the fall and into the spring. And we've been successful in driving a lot of unit growth in those 2 subsegments of the bra business. We would expect that growth to moderate in the back half of the year, still to be relevant and healthy and those are important segments. But the constructed bra business continues to be the substantial majority of the bra business for us. And it's a very good and a healthy business. And with the regular flow of newness and innovation, we expect that will continue to be a very important to our bra business.",
            "Operator",
            "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird.",
            "Mark Altschwager",
            "I just wanted to follow up on the growth margin discussion earlier. I guess, looking beyond Q2 guidance have incorporated a pretty sharp inflection in the back half of the year. Can you just update us on the drivers to that? Maybe give us a sense of the magnitude of the shift on the B&O line and what's embedded from a merchandise margin expectation perspective.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So we're expecting improvement in the merchandise margin rate in Q2 as we commented on earlier. And we would expect some improvement in merchandise margin rates in the fall season as well, the back half of the year. And the deleverage related to B&O should also moderate, given the year-on-year volume difference, meaning that we're feeling the pressure right now, the deleverage pressure related to the exits, particularly in BBW's deleverage pressure is greater in the first part of the year than it will be in the back half of the year, just given the seasonality of that business. So the B&O rate pressure will moderate as we move through the year.",

            "Kevin Heenan",
            "This is Kevin Heenan on for Bob Drbul. I just wanted to focus on the PINK business. It's been a strong performer in years and represents the big piece of the total VS business. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on sort of, the opportunities for that segment as well as maybe some of the challenges or risk factors you see maybe that are unique to that pieces versus the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works component.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. So with respect to our PINK business, we believe that, that business has the potential to literally double in North America. And that's a pretty bullish statement. But based on how clear minded the business is about the target customer, the opportunity to grow through additional square footage. As you know, many of our stores today don't have sufficient square footage to offer the full assortment of PINK merchandise to our customers. Based on their capabilities in supply chain and other retail fundamentals, business does well north of $1,000 a foot. It's just a very, very well run business. The brand is well defined and very relevant. The real estate opportunity is significant. The online opportunity is significant and growing very well today and the sourcing and supply chain-related capabilities, lead times and read-and-react capability, very, very strong in the business. So we see the potential for a lot of growth in that business over the next several years.",

            "Adrienne Yih",
            "I don't know if this is for Stuart, I think it is. Can you talk about the bralette category penetration last year being about 10% of the bra category? where do you think that could go? And it certainly looks like you're adding in kind of constructed bralettes or structured bralettes at a higher price point and I'm wondering what you've seen since you've implemented those or since you started selling those in terms of the willingness for her to buy that category at the higher price point.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. So in terms of last year, it depends on what part of last year you talk about in terms of penetration. In the first quarter of last year, the bralette business for Victoria's Secret lingerie was pretty small. And now it's running about 10% of the total. So that's where we're on that business in terms of growth and penetration. And as we commented on earlier, we wouldn't expect that, that will get significantly larger than it is today. With respect to bralettes that have some construction or support or technical benefits in them, thinking about whitespace between these broad categories is obviously an important thing for any retailer to do and we think about that. And as you observed, we're exploring some of those opportunities and are optimistic about the growth potential in some of the whitespace between the major segments, if you will. Thanks.",

            "Matthew Boss",
            "As you assess top line performance at brick-and-mortar across the fleet, any noticeable differences that you found between your A versus your B and C stores? I guess, how do you feel about the size of the fleet today? And are you seeing any flexibility with brands?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So I gave a pretty long answer earlier about how we think about real estate which really does encompass our thoughts about it, so I don't want to repeat that. But in terms of variability by mall type, the short answer is in the first quarter and maybe more importantly, for periods of time beyond that, we don't see a lot. And I've got this sheet literally right in front of me. I'm looking at it, so it's not that my memory is bad or something. So we don't see a lot of variability by mall to your sum, but I wouldn't describe it as significant. And our real estate is in great shape and that's a function of just the regular monitoring that we do. With respect to lease flexibility, I commented earlier about our lease terms, in terms of situations in the more challenged malls where we have literally month-to-month flexibility. And maybe last, in terms of the opportunity to get lower rents, of course, there is some opportunity for that. But one of the things that is pretty well understood about real estate is it's about location, location, location.",
            "And to some degree, you get what you pay for. So if a retailer's #1 strategy is to get lower rents, that may beg other questions. It's not -- it's a top of our list. We certainly don't want to overpay. But what's more important to us, frankly, is investing in our stores, having great locations, having great productivity over $800 a foot. Those are our priorities and we work closely with our developer partners to achieve those outcomes. Thanks.",

            "Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.",
            "Lorraine Hutchinson",
            "Could you give us an update on the VS beauty business, both on a sales and in margin basis? How's that trended in the first quarter? And then what's baked into your assumptions for the rest of the year?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. On the beauty business, as you're familiar with -- but I think it bears the quick reminder or repeating. The first thing is we've got a new leader in that business. Greg just celebrated his 1-year anniversary. Greg Unis is coming from Coach. He's doing a terrific job. Importantly, he rationalized the SKU count of that business in the fall by roundly 40%. So a very substantial rationalization of the assortment. And the importance of that, obviously, is to ensure that we're focused on and we can help the customer understand what our true key items are and to drive volume in key items. So he's done a nice job there.",
            "As we've also commented on, the flow of production into -- what we refer to as the beauty park, so that's the short lead time, Columbus area set up production facilities. The use of that -- of those suppliers and those reduced lead times is substantially greater than it had been historically. So 2 very important changes in the business. In terms of the results of the business, significant margin improvement in the business and we would expect that to continue and become even more significant in the second quarter. Nice growth in the business online. Some sales dollar pressure in the store channel, but improved sequentially in a pretty meaningful way through the quarter.",
            "So February was tough for beauty as it was for most of our businesses, but March was better and April was even better than that. And again, the margin dollar results substantially outperforming sales. So we feel like we've got momentum in the beauty business, very optimistic about Greg and his leadership and the team, rationalized assortment beauty park, strong lineup for fall. We've seen it. It's qualitative, but we're very optimistic about it. So we think we've got a lot of opportunity in the beauty business. It's a good business today with a lot of growth ahead of it.",

            "Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.",
            "Dana Telsey",
            "As you think about the China opportunity, any updates there? Any learnings relative to product assortment? How are you thinking about sales and the investment requirements?",
            "Martin Waters",
            "We're feeling good about China. Really making progress on forefront. So I would say -- as you heard me say earlier, we opened our first full assortment stores, 2 stores opened in February, with good results, very strong customer reaction. We have 4 more stores in the pipe for the balance of this year and then building to 10 to 12 stores next year. So very good progress there. Our beauty business which has been open for nearly 2 years now, doing very well. And those VSBA stores, double-digit comps in the first quarter. Our third business would be the direct-to-consumer business in China which started back in the fall and has been building month-on-month. And we're excited that we'll move to China next-day delivery for that business during the summer, so good update there. And then, finally, I'd say the team making real progress on hiring a very high-quality team, some really terrific people, getting them onboarded in the business and building capabilities. So feel really good about that.",
            "In terms of the patterns of demand and customer behavior that we see, I would say that it's more of the same in the sense that our replication model works in pretty much the same way everywhere. What we find is bestsellers here tend to be bestsellers there. The 2 substantial differences you won't be surprised to hear, are around size distortions that we have a smaller customer. We have to distort significantly to that. And the second is just a lead time difference in getting products into the market and through the regulatory environment that there is in that market, means that there is a time delay or an offset to North America. But aside from that, we're feeling very good about the business and thank you for the question.",

            "Our next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg from JJK Research.",
            "Janet Kloppenburg",
            "Stuart, I was just wondering if you could talk -- if -- you have a great deal of confidence in the constructed bra business rebounding in the back half. And I know that some of the data that indicates that may be sensitive competitively. But I'm wondering if you could talk about any underlying trends that give you that encouragement, perhaps those trends in place -- excuse me, tests in place that fortifying your outlook. And also, I was just wondering about the pricing outlook on the constructed bra business. Do you think you can maintain the historical ASP level in that category?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So Janet, as you recognize in your question and as we kind of commented on in the remarks that were circulated last night. We're not getting to get into the details of the bra launches for this fall. It's just too important. We're optimistic about those launches and the nature of those launches in the constructed bra business. And more newness will flow. Some will flow in the second quarter, particularly towards the end of the second quarter. And Jan and the team had a good lineup for fall, but not going to comment on it specifically on this call. With respect to the selling prices or average unit retails in the constructed bra business, as you understand, as we all understand, it's a function of the quality of the merchandise itself. It's about the product, stupid as they say.",
            "And so as we deliver a regular flow of fashion, technical benefit, fundamentally emotional content, where the customers says I've got to have that, that's how we get paid. And we're optimistic between the design folks and the merchant team and the sourcing folks and our focus on reducing lead times and our ability to read, react and adjust that we have the potential to have a very good fall season, particularly in building momentum through the second quarter. So our inventories are in great shape. As we've commented on, inventory per foot stand 12%. We've commented on the fact that when we start the fall season, more than 90% of our Q4 buy is open. Our agility is very good as a company and so we're optimistic about the momentum we have in the business and our ability to have a strong fall. Thank you.",
            "Operator",
            "Our final question comes from the line of Susan Anderson from FBR Capital Markets.",
            "Susan Anderson",
            "I was just wondering -- and sorry, if I missed this. I hopped on late. If you could talk about just in general the competitive environment, say, over the past 10 years. I know there's been a lot of talk about some smaller players popping up. But clearly, it looks like you're gaining share in terms of units. But maybe you just do you feel like the competition has gotten a bit stiffer, either because of more players now in your categories or anything else driving this?",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "That's a pretty broad question when you put it in the context of over the last 10 years. I think a number of different things have happened that have led to -- we can either call it a stiffer competition or we can refer to it as more aggressive and broader-based competition. So clearly, the marketplace is having some impact, good, better and different from what's going on, on the online channel. And I think we're incredibly appreciative of the business that we've had and the gains that we've made in that channel. And what's been impressive about that is we've been able to gain in the channel -- in the direct channel without having to lose any momentum within the store base.",
            "So I think this notion that you can have a healthy store base which is critical because it's the most important expression of the brand which is why we continue to invest in our stores and have a healthy online channel at the same time. I think the other thing that obviously comes into play is that -- the apparel business being less than exciting, that puts a certain pressure in the marketplace as it relates to price deflation, so customers' expectations around pricing, promotion and markdowns seems to get larger and larger. So what's important to us in there is how do we leverage our short cycles, our ability to get back into businesses that are at full-price selling and control our promotional strategy until we get to a sale period. I think what's going to be probably more interesting is just taking into consideration what is going on from the mall macro trends and how does that play into that retail environment.",
            "So as customers continue to be more and more engaged in let's call it a healthy, good-for-you lifestyle, even if it's only on a superficial level, in some cases, versus a meaningful level on other cases, you can see the impact on that in malls, mall traffic and customer expectations. So I think the beauty of the BBW brand is that we have an opportunity to do a couple of things. One is we've been able to drive our own traffic gains during those periods of challenging retail. And that the brand has got tremendous elasticity, so our ability to play in trends play in fashion while at the same time trying to take into consideration the foundation of our business which is really strong.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "I guess, Susan, 3 or 4 things I would just add. I mean, we're in great categories of retailing. So the interim apparel space and personal care and beauty categories of retail have strong loyalty characteristics. The potential for high inherent profitability. And so the categories or segments of retail that we're in are very attractive ones and the good news is we're leaders in those categories. Being in that leading position gives us a lot of advantage. The presence of competition isn't a new thing. There are many other retailers that have tried to get into the spaces, some successful, some not. And then just maybe lastly, one of the other things that I think makes our company unique is that we've been very disciplined about controlling our channels of distribution. So our brands, our products are only sold in our stores and online through our websites. And that control of brand and control of channel has been very important to us. And I think allows us to reinforce and protect the leadership position of these brands.",

Our second quarter earnings release, additional commentary and earnings presentation are available on our website, lb.com.",

            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter earnings per share decreased 31% to $0.48 per share, exceeding our initial guidance of $0.40 to $0.45. The earnings upside was delivered through expense control and non-operating income gains; the comp decline of 8% was below our initial forecast for a mid-single digit decline.",
            "Looking forward to the remainder of 2017, we expect continued solid performance at PINK and Bath & Body Works, and continued improvement versus our first-half results at Victoria’s Secret Lingerie and Beauty. Given our below expectation second quarter sales result, our comp forecast for the third quarter is a more conservative low single-digit decline versus our previous view of up low single digits.",
            "We have strong brands that lead their categories, with close connections to our customers. While store traffic, particularly at Victoria’s Secret has been challenging, we believe a large part of the decline is related to the exit of swim and a pullback in promotional activity versus last year.",
            "Our online businesses continue to be strong, with a 11% growth in go-forward categories at Victoria’s Secret and 16% growth at Bath & Body Works. Our stores have high sales productivity and 99% of our stores are cash-flow positive.",

Back-to-campus, one of PINK’s perennial milestones as a brand really exists for multiple reasons.",
            "Number one, it’s an opportunity to build an on-trend wardrobe of intimates, lounge and accessories for collegiate girls across America. It’s a critical brand engagement opportunity fortifying our customer’s affinity for the brand. We leverage our agility and read and react, which is a core competency of PINK, enabling us to assess based on current performance those opportunities that are scalable and mitigate any risk. This is of particular importance as we look forward to the holiday season.",

Coming into L Brands and to Victoria’s Secret with 15 years in beauty, over 10 years in sports and most recently in intimates, I’m really excited to bring Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, my passion for the consumer and the customers that we have, the insights that they bring, understanding of innovative, aspirational product creation and a really close understanding of supply chain and agility.",
            "In addition to that, brand programs that are authentic and engaging and will continue to build loyalty and conversion for our existing and new customers into the business. The vision going forward is that, there are many ways to run this offense, and I’m on the offense to mine for long-term sustainable growth with four clear filters.",
            "Number one and always first is knowing her. Putting the consumer at the center, deeply knowing her today, what she expects from products and experiences that speak sexy to her, not just to him. Number two, solving her sexy, which means really strengthening the core of our business with bras that are our best at in design, innovation, fit and finishing. Bras with benefits and key adjacent categories that also bring fashion and fantasy for her are the focus.",
            "Thirdly, serving her where she wants to shop, when she wants to shop in an elevating, engaging brand accretive way, all powered by building a high-performing team and culture of diversity and inclusion. That culture is what breeds innovation. Innovation is what helps us build the best at bras. And when we do, we get paid for that work.",
            "My focus right now and for this past year has been on the deep consumer connection, literally beginning the experience with working in stores and being in the market every week since day one. The consumer connection we have with millions of women is a competitive advantage every day.",
            "From that, we build the product in the most excellent, innovative form, resetting how we, as a team, optimize our merch, design, planning, supply chain, teams for speed, relevance and innovation is a new way of working and one that I’m excited to bring and lead the team on.",
            "And with the team, we are in – on the offense of building world-class high-performing talent. We have a balance of undeniable internal experience from L Brands and the balance of new team members that bring a lens of innovative thinking to the mix. That chemistry and competency is job one in building a high-performing team.",
            "This quarter, it begins with bras. And number one job was balancing the assortment, making sure that we have choices of sexy for her. We have a cornerstone in the business of the push-up bra, and we went to the bralette business and now we’re finding a lot of sexy in the middle, balancing that assortment and bringing sexy solution, as well as fantasy and fashion in constructed bras is the way to go for us going forward.",
            "We’re also resetting the panty architecture for the mix business, when she just want cheap and cheerful, fast fashion, as well as disruptive single ticket pinnacle product. In addition to the time this quarter, we are obsessing holiday. Holiday is an everyday conversation for us and we plan on coming into the quarter with holiday plans dialed. Transitioning the team has been our focus this quarter and also learning from last Retail 101, so that we can write the future together.",
            "I’m most excited to see the deep consumer engagement that we have, as a team, given the access to the customers. I’m excited to see the reset return of the right level of loyalty. We have an incredibly loyal customer today and building new loyals is a mission for us, and reactivating our existing customers has also been a focus. I’m excited for the future ahead and it’s a pleasure and honor to be at the brand at this time.",
            "I’m now going to turn it over to Greg Unis.",
            "Greg Unis",
            "Good morning, everyone. I’m glad to be here with you this morning. It’s been a little over a year since I joined Victoria’s Secret, and I’d like to begin this morning with sharing a few thoughts about what we’ve been focused on in beauty.",
            "So last fall, we began a journey to create a clear point of view for our brand and for our customer, most importantly, about what we stand for as a beauty business. We narrowed our assortment offering by 40% and we saw significant increase in our productivity. That decision allowed us to focus on fewer, more powerful launches within our prestige fragrance business and to create fashion and newness in categories, where we can leverage our speed model through the beauty part.",
            "So moving on to spring 2017. We were focused on laying the foundation for healthier businesses across all product line. Within Q2, by focusing the assortment, we made big bigger and-best selling fragrances are up year-over-year in both stores and digital. We layered in fashion and newness in our mist collection, lift and accessories businesses, which the customer is responding to. We reduced lead times and continued to get faster. Overall, I’m confident, we are headed in the right direction with positive sequential growth.",
            "So looking forward to fall, to this coming fall, we will continue all key strategies, continue to lay the foundation of a healthy business to set up for growth in the future. We will build upon what’s working, making big bigger, leveraging our speed model to infuse fashion and newness and testing and learning new ideas.",
            "Thank you for joining this morning. I will now hand it over to Nick Coe to share his opening thoughts.",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "Thanks, Greg, and good morning. I’d like to just add really just a couple of words of color to go with the black and white script that we sent out, where we – you can see, we continue to grow the business and the operating income on top of the pretty solid last year.",
            "So I’d like to start by speaking the obvious, and that’s it really goes without saying, our most valuable assets is our brand. And our focus and efforts in the last six months have been a critical part of us of moving the business forward. So what’s really not visible in the script, so the major investments we’ve made in two really critical areas to help move both the top line and the bottom line and we’ve been able to do that at the same time as growing the business.",
            "So during the last six months, the last couple of quarters, we’ve significantly increased the amount of newness, new product categories and new product testing, and that’s a pretty big change versus recent history. And I’m really referring to newness that isn’t just seasonal updates on new fragrance launches, it’s significant new newness for the store. And this has been invaluable for us, because it’s provided us with some critical insights that will really help us define what’s important to keep the brand relevant and remain category dominant.",
            "Secondly, we continued disciplined approach in investing in the fleet, making sure the stores are updated, making sure the stores are exciting, and obviously interesting for the customer shopping. And that investment will bring us to the end of the year to about 420 stores and the investment should continue as we go forward.",
            "And as you know, we talk a lot about the importance of the customer experience, the store experience, and how frankly that obviously translates into sales. And I really think both of these two initiatives contribute significantly to us building the health of the brand, which once again is our most valuable asset and really sets us up for success.",
            "So in summary, I think, it’s important to note, we’ve pushed hard on these two initiatives, and we’ve done it in a manner that has allowed us to drive top line and bottom line at the same time.",
            "And with that, I’ll hand it over to Martin.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. In the international business, we experienced similar overall trends as those that we saw in the first quarter, including softness in beauty, difficult market conditions in the Middle East, some pressure in the UK market, and of course, we continue to make investments in China.",
            "We did see some improvement in our Victoria’s Secret franchise and travel retail businesses, as well as continued strength in the Bath & Body Works International business. We continue to be pleased with the first two full assortment Victoria’s Secret stores in Mainland China, and we successfully transitioned to the T Mall domestic digital platform within country fulfillment back in July.",
            "We continue to be very bullish about our growth opportunities in China and around the world. And 2017 will be an exciting year for us, as we continue to establish our business in China and build on our footprint in other geographies globally. Amie?",

            "Susan Anderson",
            "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe just give some more color on the lower guide for the year. It sounds like it’s pretty much all traffic-related and just lower expectation for sales in the back-half. But then also it sounds like you feel that the swim exit did impact traffic in second quarter. So maybe just your thoughts on how you see traffic playing out in the back-half?

            "Hi.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "In terms of the guidance, as outlined, we just reduced our assumptions around sales versus what we’d forecasted earlier in the year. So that is the driver. And with that said, we’re – this team is going to work very hard to maximize our opportunities this fall. As you know, we try to run the business conservatively as it relates to the management of inventory expenses, capital spending.",
            "And so we try to be thoughtful about our sales assumption in managing those things, and that same conservative mindset place through to our guidance. We did beat the Q1 guidance that we put out, and we’re on the Q2 guidance as well. But the takedown, if you will, is sales-related.",
            "With respect to your question or further perspective on traffic, at the end of the day, traffic is within our control. And we believe based on brands and product and experiences in-stores and online that we have the opportunity to impact traffic and we do when we’re performing at our best. And so we’ll be focused on getting the best result in the back-half. But in terms of the takedown, it is sales-driven fundamentally. Thanks.",
            "Susan Anderson",
            "And just on the merch margin front, do you expect it to sequentially improve from second quarter to third quarter, or do you feel like you’ll have to promote more to drive the traffic?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, we had some merchandise margin rate improvement in Q2, as we reported, and we would expect to have some improvement in Q3 and Q4 as well.",

            "Okay, great. Thanks. Good luck next quarter.",

            "Great. Thank you. Good morning. Stuart and I’m not sure if anyone at Victoria’s Secret wants to address this as well. But traffic, obviously, seems to be the number one kind of key ingredient that’s missing to drive the go-forward business.",
            "You mentioned that you’re increasing marketing selectively in the third quarter. I’m wondering, if you can talk about the goal of driving traffic is your new targeted direct mail pointing you in the right direction? And are there any other levers that you’ve got at your disposal to try to drive traffic as we go through the back-half of this year and into 2018? Thanks.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Hi, Kimberly, it’s Jan Singer, thanks for the question. I think that when we use the marketing strategically in a brand accretive way, we have the opportunity to engage existing customers and make her aware of the new products that’s coming. In addition, we have the opportunity to engage new customers that we believe would really have a great experience with the brand.",
            "So the idea is to make sure that what we’re doing is brand accretive, inspiring and drives traffic and conversion. So, yes, that’s a strategy for us.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "And then I would add from a PINK perspective that we enter into a season with a very holistic point of view regarding how we’re going to reach out, inform and touch the customer through all relevant digital platforms in addition to pieces that we might mail. I think above and beyond just trend right product in the moment, our event strategy are movable, bus tour, which visits college campuses continues to drive interest in the brand and traffic into the store.",

            "Yes, I’m just wondering what kind of response you’re seeing to the targeted direct mail efforts? Is it helping or initially, in those test markets, is it helping to drive traffic to the stores?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Short answer is, yes. We’re getting good results. We’ve learned a lot, Kimberly, as we’ve talked about over the last six to 12 months. And we’re seeing pretty strong response to the direct mail activity that we’ve been pursuing. Thanks.",
            "Kimberly Greenberger",

So just how you think about each from a transaction versus ticket perspective that’s built into the second-half? Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Paul. So we’ll go to Stuart for that question.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, Paul, as you know, we don’t get too granular about guidance by segment, because there’s variability even at the company level and obviously further variability as you break it down into parts. With that said, as we think about it and trying to be somewhat response or responsive to your question, we would expect stronger results in the businesses that have had stronger recent trends, so that might be an extremely obvious point.",
            "But we would expect a continuation and further improvement in all of our businesses. But in terms of absolute traffic and comp results, the businesses are in different places, as described. We’re expecting improvement through the fall season across the Victoria’s businesses and a continued strong performance at Bath & Body Works.",
            "So that really be the color. But in terms of getting detail about traffic for PINK versus beauty and all that, it just – it gets so granular, I’m not sure that it’s helpful. We plan the business conservatively. We’re optimistic about the fall. Bath & Body Works had a strong spring season. PINK had a strong spring season. And lingerie and beauty made a lot of progress as well and we believe we’ve got improvement opportunity across the portfolio. Thanks.",

Was it an air play with some of the bra launch performance there? And on that topic of targeted direct mail – mailing and returning to that, what was your framework for thinking about that decision? And what will be different about the program in terms of being most brand appropriate and a brand accretive way this time versus in the past? Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Oliver. So, we’ll go to Jan.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Hi, Oliver, thanks for the question. On panties, I think there is a few things in play. Number one is, we moved from highly promotional free panty conversation into resetting the line in the architecture and making sure that we have content on a couple of different levels beginning. On the 54 [ph] business, which is our entry price point, the content needs to be absolutely on point, which requires a fast fashion model. We fortunately have speed. So resetting that proposition and getting on our existing speed model is job one.",
            "Number two is, we’ve had some success and we need to build on it and what we call the single ticket and the more elevated panties, where we disrupt the marketplace. Our job is to push the edge and bring new sexy silhouettes to the market. And when we do, she comes in and she transact. So we’re resetting that opportunity. We think that’s part of the – of clearly the growth for panty in the future.",
            "In addition, yes, there’s attachment rate to bras as well. And as we bring new product and we bring the logical balance to that business, we’ll see that traction in panties. So I’m very confident in the architecture go-forward. I’m confident in using the fast fashion model, as well as the more elevated. And I think, we’ll see a healthier panty business with more loyals going forward.",
            "In terms of the mailing, brand accretive offers mean that we are offering an opportunity to trial in a way that we are proud of and we continue to get repeat purchasing add. We offer our direct connection with the customer in a segmented way that shows to her that we know her and show her new products that are for her. When we do that, it feels personal and it is and she comes in and checks out the business. And I think that’s what we’re trying to build on when we say brand accretive product marketing.",

            "Thanks. Good morning. Jan I was just hoping to get some clarification on the panty price architecture. So are you saying that you will be taking opening price points for panties lower? And if that’s the case, how are you thinking about overall AUR for panties going forward? What kind of impact that might have on the business? Would you expect for the panty category to flatten out in coming quarters, or is this a category that’s likely to be a drag as this transition takes shape?",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Yes. No, let me just clarify. Thanks for the question. We did not talk about lowering price point on panties at all. In fact, we think there’s more opportunity in the upward motion than the down. The 54 businesses is a 54 business and we’ve been aggressive about making sure that we’re on a price value.",
            "The opportunity I’m talking about is making sure that our team is as fast as possible on content, and that the conversation we’re having with the customer through the design of that panty is current We’re doing a lot of things to reset and make sure we put more value in those panties, but not take price down.",
            "In addition what I was – sorry, yep, go ahead.",

            "Lyndsay Drucker Mann",
            "Okay. I guess, I was going to ask, will you be changing to the degree the panties were often offered as a promotional lever free panties or panties discounted. Do you expect to be further discounting promotional activity on panties, whether it’s standalone, or as part of a broader lingerie package promo? And will you be doing anything on your kind of entry price point panties to change the average unit cost, or should we be expecting overall merchandise margins in panties to be flat or maybe even up?",
            "Jan Singer",
            "I think that when we talk about panties and promotions, it’s a balance and we have to be selective. Do I want new customers to know what we have? Yes. Is there a brand accretive way to do that without giving away panties to everybody that walks in the store? I do believe so. So for me, panties are a business. They’re not just a marketing tool, and we’ll be continuing to build that business and getting paid for that work. And we’ll balance that with trial when we think that we can get a conversion from that conversation.",

            "And then also, just a bit more detail on Bath & Body Works, obviously a good overall quarter, but certainly a slowdown at the end of the period.

So I would say on your first question, as we go to balance out the assortment, especially on bras from a bralette predominant conversation, we expect to see AURs go up, of course, because constructed bras are bras with benefits and we get paid for that work. So in terms of that AUR conversation, that’s our intension.",

I talk to you a lot about the amount of change and the amount of product testing that we’ve put in, the amount of differentiated assortment. I mean, July is pretty transitional anyway as exit sale and start thinking about being in the fall season. So I really look at that slowdown in performance pretty much through the lens of – it was transitional and it was about a lot of changes and some very interesting changes under the covers in terms of mix, assortments, et cetera.

So curious about any learnings you’ve had there as we look into the fall season, how should we be thinking about any big launches and any timing for VS launches versus last year?",

            "All right. Thank you for the question and the opportunity to talk about that for a bit. Yes, we were able to – actually a couple of interesting things I’ll share. We actually reduced the assortment in that collection by 30% and made plan in comp last year’s two different collections with the one assortment, which – the assortment was a mix of few bras, the refresh and three new bras and we saw our product deliver plan – really on plan.",
            "The most exciting thing about that product was that we brought new customers into the mix and new customers for us in a – an exciting fresh way that the silhouettes that are new, not necessarily the existing. So I was really pleased with the execution of that launch and I was pleased with the results. And more importantly, the engagement with the customer was exciting.",
            "In addition to that, the engagement on social media with the customer about the bra itself was exciting. So I think, that was a leading indicator that when we build the business that – in a way that connects with her and fits and feels good, she will come. So it’s the beginning of the beginning.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Great. And Stuart, on inventory?",

            "Yes, Brian, with respect to inventory, you’ve been following us a long time, you know, what our commitment is, which is to grow inventory in line with sales. We’ve done that very consistently for a long period of time. There’s nothing, that’s changed about that point of view.",
            "With that said, we want to make sure that we’re in stock and appropriately positioned to have a good fall in terms of the guidance about the third quarter. I would describe it as consistent with that thinking, it is up a little bit, but not significantly. And there’s a little bit of timing involved, but our commitment to manage inventory in line with sales was – as strong as ever and some of this is what we’re lapping and cycling, but again, it’s a pretty conservative position.",

And as we think about 3Q guide for flat to down low singles, maybe talk about which markets do you expect to see the biggest improvement to reach that level?",
            "And then secondly, just priorities for cash, I think you bought back a bit more stock during the quarter, maybe talk about opportunity for bigger buyback, especially given the stock at these levels? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Let me answer on the August comp guidance. When we began the month we said down low-to-mid, we don’t have further comment on that today, back-to-school period we think is an important one there to get back to school result, but we are not commenting beyond that for August, we report every month as you know, but no really significant update to that.",
            "With respect to cash and – sorry, sequentially through the quarter, the biggest cadence in the quarter will be as we’ve described, the diminishing effect of the non-go forward exit and so sequentially that will be become less unless as we go through the fall season including their by month and the third quarter, so that’s the additional color we provide on the comp.",
            "With respect to cash, as you know, we have a very strong record and commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders and we had spoken a lot about that, you are familiar with it. We are executing under our share repurchase authorization, we are also paying a very healthy regular dividend as you are aware right now given recent earnings results that have very high payout ratio and a very attractive yield for shareholders, but we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders using regular dividends, through repurchase programs and from time-to-time with special dividends. We consult with our Board about that as you would expect and we’ll continue to execute against our authorized program, so it’s kind of where we are now. Thank you.",

What’s kind of baked into the back half assumptions and the top line for the international business? And then maybe any update on the operating loss you expect this year from China given all the investments and how you expect that to scale maybe as you move into next year?",

            "No problem.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "So yes, the driver of negative comp really in the international business really were coming out of the UK, where we are seeing a couple of things happening. One is the same patented business that we see in North America, particularly around the exit of swim and apparel and also the lower AUR in bras. That said, we have seen significantly, I mean really significantly higher unit sales of bras in the UK, so we are winning share with bra, which is obviously a positive.",
            "I think the other thing in the UK that we are seeing is just generally somewhat of a malice and most retailers are reporting that traffic is down, not helped by the terrible incidents around terrorism and so on and so forth. So that’s really the big story in Victoria’s Secret International. We had some softness in beauty, but nothing that that I would say being particularly significant. And as we head into Q3 and Q4, we certainly expect to get back into positive comp territory, so feeling optimistic about that.",
            "The area where we have seen positive comps in Victoria’s in China and I think what you should expect to see is that we grow stores in the third and fourth quarter, we have two full assortment stores open now, we have four more in production. Those are the good and the bad thing and that we have pre-opening costs associated with them, which means we have to live with more loss, but of course getting them open gets us to trade. We then have 10 to 12 more full assortment stores coming in 2018.",
            "In terms of how the loss will be impacted, Q3 and Q4 you should expect to see somewhat of an increase in lawsuits year-over-year in both of those quarter, but the scale of that increase will moderate, moderate significantly as we get into Q1 2018.",

Maybe you could kind of talk through what you think some of the reasons are that maybe drove a deactivation if you will and what the strategies are to – what caused the deactivation of some of those customers relative to brand?

And we needed to do that for a very good reason, so we could reset to get to the right customers at the right level. So perhaps that pause had a conversation with R&D team, no matter where we are now is really understanding whose is our file and how to reach our best. So we have had almost as much as 40% engagement with customers that we haven’t talked to in quite some time and that’s a very positive reconnection for us and an important one to make.",

I’m looking to Jan, Jan if you can give the progress of the new bra launches, how is it developing in your mind and where do you see the penetration of the lower AUR bralette and sports bras going to is stabilizing at? And then as you think of the new product, store environment, do you see that at all changing in terms of either look or brand? Thank you.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Thanks Dana for the question. I think I’ll take it a little bit high and then go detailed for you where I can. Theoretically, having a push-up bra constructed businesses are really important part of the mix. Giving her choices of sexy with bralette was a good do. Finding the balance between those businesses with our constructed bras that provide options of her is an important part of the future.",
            "So I think it’s important to say that bralette and unconstructed bras have a price in the assortment, but they trend up and down. And so we are in the business of building bras and I think that you and I probably know if you’d want a bralette for more than a day, trying to wear them for the rest of your life is probably not your best option. So we are in the business of building bras that have a lot of make and benefitting that and we are in the fashion business, so when bralette trend and they are important, we will have them in the mix, as we do right now.",
            "So I think it’s about choices and making sure that we have balance in there. And when we start to role launches forward like we did with T-shirt, we see her responding and really excited and the launch is going forward with same, so it’s a balance.",
            "In terms of new stores, what I’m really passionate about is the balance of our selling, being able to be where she wants to shop. So we have a healthy digital business and bra fitting happens in person, and as a person who spends three months in the store, six days a week for over 10 hours a day and became certified as a Bralette Specialist for Victoria’s Secret, we offer a very life-changing experience in that fitting room. And I’m very serious about that, it can only happen in person. It’s a really important part of our experience and when you have a retail store that offers an environment with an experience, that’s elevating aspirational brand rights, she comes in. So I think when we have a product like bras and we have a place like our stores, and we have specialists like our associates, we have a reason to drive engagement in that space.",

And is it reasonable to think about SG&A expense leverage next year?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Well, it’s Stuart, I’ll take the second part of that question first. As a general matter, a low-to-mid single comp which gets to a mid-single revenue growth typically will allow us to have slight leverage in our business, in a normal period of time which implicit in your question recognize 2016 and 2017 haven’t been normal given the volume declines related to the category exit and the China investments that you’re familiar with. So, 3 to 5 comp mid-single revenue gets to slight leverage would be how we think about it.",
            "With respect to the back-half of the year in comparison to the first-half of the year, we are making significant investments in real estate. We’ve moderated those, as you know, in our updated script or our commentary in the script. We took our CapEx guide down $50 million additional recently so at $800 million versus $850 million.",
            "But with that said, we’re making, we think very important, and as Nick commented on, successful investments, particularly in Bath & Body Works and otherwise in real estate. And so I mean it’s driving pressure in the occupancy line. What’s different about the back-half versus the first-half is, we’re going to have volume increases – dollar volume increases in the back-half of the year versus the declines in the first-half. And so on a dollar basis, we’ll have some variable expenses that run with that.",
            "So on a dollar increase, there will be more in the back-half than it was in the first-half driven by volume. And again, the percent growth and expenses, including some pressure related to the CapEx in the occupancy. Thanks.",

            "Your next question comes from the line of Adrienne Eugenia with Wolfe Research.",
            "Adrienne Eugenia",
            "Good morning. My question is for Jan. I want to know how many new bra launches do you have kind of scheduled for the next sort of back-half of this year versus last year? And then the penetration of bralettes in the third quarter or actually in the back-half this year versus last year and whether you’re seeing AUR lift?",
            "And then, Stuart, for you, can you just talk about rent reduction opportunities, what percent of your leases come up for auction in the next three years? And then your longer-term view of the numbers – number of stores you should have at each brand? Thank you.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Thanks, Adrienne, it’s Jan. So in terms of launches, I mean, the I think, if you’re in this business, is constant newness. So we will continue to flow constant newness faster than most due to our speed model. So there’s a difference between newness and launches and I recognize that, we’ll have the appropriate amount of launches that bring bras that have the right build in them. And when you cadence those correctly, I think that we can create spikes that matter for the business.",
            "In terms of the mix, it’s less than 5% of bralettes as we go forward. Again, I think anybody can make a bralette and that was a moment that will come and go, it will come again. But for us, we make constructed bras best. And when we do, even in our bralette business, bralettes that have more construction in them, we get paid for that work.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Stuart?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, Adrienne, with respect to real estate stores, rent reductions, our thinking has been pretty consistent. Now, we review the facts and the data on a very regular basis and take appropriate action, And as I’ve mentioned before, reducing our plans in 2017 significantly a couple of times.",
            "But to reiterate our philosophy on it and to be very clear about it, including the example that Jan spoke about a minute ago, in terms of that in-store experience and bra fitting, the store part of our business is critical whether it’s fragrance of Bath & Body Works, or bra fittings at Victoria’s Secret, Lingerie or Victoria’s Secret PINK or fragrance at Victoria’s Secret Beauty that in-store experience is a critical part of our brands, our customer experience, et cetera just inherent in the categories of business that we are in.",
            "Secondly, as you know, our sales productivity, our financial results, our metrics related to our store fleet are very, very strong on a selling foot basis with productivity over $800 a foot in total, and continuing at 99% of our stores being cash flow positive. An additional point I would make is that, we’re opening and closing stores literally every year. And so based on performance and consumer experience, we very actively manage our real estate fleet.",
            "With respect to the number of stores that we should have for the business at the end day that will be performance-based. Again, store – a store-based experience we believe is foundational to our major brands and it will be performance-based and we see the opportunity for some additional square footage in North America and obviously significant expansion internationally.",
            "We have a lot of flexibility on the CapEx and we have a lot of flexibility with respect to our situation in the lower tier malls with co-tenancy and named tenant provisions in our leases and a meaningful number of stores with very short lease term or even month-to-month lease provisions that contribute to our ability to close them when it makes sense.",
            "So with respect – lastly, with respect to rent reductions to be frank, it’s not the key part of our real estate strategy. They say about real estate, it is about location, location, location. And the biggest priority, or the highest priority that we have with respect to our relationship with our developer partners is to get terrific locations that provide great experiences for customers, a lot of foot fall, a lot of sales productivity, a lot of revenue and a lot of profit. And so that’s our dominant focus with the major developers.",
            "With that said, we’ve got a very experienced real estate team and we’re not looking to overplay and we don’t believe that we do. But it’s not our key real estate strategy to figure out how to get rent reductions. Our key real estate strategy is to ensure that, we’re in the right locations with compelling store designs that set us up well currently for the future. So hopefully, that answers your question. Thanks.",
            "Adrienne Eugenia",
            "Great. Thank you very much. Excellent color. Best of luck.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Adrienne. Next question, please.",

            "Your next question comes from the line of Roxanne Myers with MKM Partners.",
            "Roxanne Myers",
            "Great. Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up to Adrienne’s question for Jan. What do you think is going to be the bigger game changer, new bra launches or the opportunity to improve existing categories? And then I’m just wondering, obviously, there are many sub-brands within the structured bra business. I’m just wondering what percentage of the assortment have you been able to reposition for fall? What do you think you’re going to be able to touch for holiday? And then just longer-term, how you think about what percent of the assortment needs to evolve? Thanks a lot.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Okay. Thanks, Roxanne, for the question. In terms of category, it’s a great question. Clearly, we’re going to be strong at the core with bras and panties our best at – and win that categories. But it’s not lost on us, the key adjacent categories matter that we’re in. The sleep business and the sexy lingerie business are categories that have higher velocity of fashion in turn.",
            "I think, right now, as you can see in trend, the lingerie one on the street pajamas as apparel is a thing, a real thing, and we’re taking our fair share of that business. It’s a fast fashion model and we’re optimizing our speed to get there, bring to back to store more often than we have at our core, which then gets our core stronger.",
            "So I think we have to be really focused on the core and cognizant of the appropriate adjacent categories and how to grow them. In terms of the changes, I look at it from the beginning when you walk in the door, I saw you are a team player out all in day one. So when – in the conversation of the product that I personally I’m affecting as much as I can, as fast as I can, as ready they’re.",
            "So there’s a percentage of change that you’re feeling right now that are clearly been focused on some upstream innovation to product creation and assortment. And you’ll feel more as the holiday season comes and then again into 2018, it’s just the builds, but I think starting fall forward.",
            "Roxanne Myers",
            "Great. Thanks, and best of luck.",

            "Marni Shapiro",
            "Hey, everybody. I’m curious, Les, had talked about when things were trending downward in the bra business, as the sizes were going up and this was an indication of the customer was getting older and as you brought bralettes back in, that starts to reverse.",
            "So I’m curious a couple of things, are you still seeing that trend? Are you getting your younger customer back in? And then importantly, when she’s coming in? You’ve talked a about AUR and bralettes in the active business. Is she only buying the bralettes? Is she more price sensitive than she used to be, or is she buying around the store? And is there any pushback on the pricing of restructured bras?",
            "Denise Landman",
            "Thank you, Marni, for the question I think, we’re seeing – I know, we’re seeing our new customers come in and the average age of that customer in both our existing business like BBV Demi as the new business of T-Shirt. The customer we have the demographics of who she is and she is younger and that’s very exciting for us, because everybody wants to fill the file with the new, as well as engage our important existing high-value customers.",
            "So it’s not, I mean, bra is not a barrier of entry for her. When the bra fits and it feels like it’s changing her expectation of what a bra should do in agood way. She is coming in. And I was most impressed with that when I worked in the fitting room personally. And I will tell you, for instance, the BBV Demi, which is our tried and tested and most famous bra, she is opting into. So that’s exciting. I don’t see not having a high penetration of bralettes equally not having a new customer quite the opposite.",
            "Marni Shapiro",
            "And then the pricing question?",
            "Denise Landman",
            "In terms of, Marni, one more time, is there a barrier on price, or if it’s – she shouldn’t care what it costs?",
            "Denise Landman",
            "No, there’s no barrier for price. And again, what’s interesting is the bra itself has a price, but then what she builds her basket to is always much higher. When you have a bra and we know that fits and helps you feel confident, sexy, whatever your goal is. There is really no barrier to price on that, especially one that will work with your body, feel comfortable. I think, we’ve seen time and again, especially from a younger customer, it doesn’t seem to be a barrier on our side of our business in terms of constructed bras.",
            "Marni Shapiro",
            "Okay, thanks. Best of luck.",

            "HI, everybody. Jan, I was just wondering given some of the softness in panties and sleepwear and the rebuild on bras. You expected a lingerie comp to match that the brand – the Victoria’s Secret brand in the second-half of the year, or we should expect that to continue to trail as these adjustments are made?",
            "And Nick, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the newness level in August? And if you felt that that you had brought in enough innovation in the month, so that we see a change from the July trend. Thanks so much.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Janet. We’re going to go to Nick first.",

            "Nicholas Coe",
            "I think, you’re really going to start to see the newness ramp up more specifically as we get into September, October, November. So a lot of the learnings that we took place during the first-half of the year has started – and partly assortment more aggressively as we get later on into the year.",
            "So I’m looking forward to September. There’s an awful lot of change in newness coming in from that, that builds the way into holiday. So we’re sitting in the peak period of the area with probably the most amount of change.",
            "Janet Kloppenburg",
            "Great. Thanks so much.",

            "Janet Kloppenburg",
            "Actually not. The lingerie business mix comp underperformed. I think the plan in the second quarter has and may have impacted your overall comp performance. So I’m wondering how we should think about the lingerie before - the lingerie comp in the third and fourth quarter relative to the overall Victoria’s Secret comp? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, we would – we believe that with respect to the overall Victoria’s Secret comp, we would expect that PINK would have the strongest results. And that beauty and lingerie in terms of absolute level of comp well, would not be at the same level, but will improve through the fall season.",
            "Janet Kloppenburg",
            "Okay. And can you talk about performance at sports store and how that’s going?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "I think, Jan can speak to that and provide a perspective on it. Thanks, Jan.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Sure. Janet, yes, happy to talk about it. I think, in general, we’re very excited about this sport business. We can see our trajectory over time. It’s been a growth driver and it is a growth opportunity for the business. At the end of the day, the center of the business is around the sport bra and we know no sport bra, new sport for her. So that’s an important part of our business. And again, we’re excited with the new launches that are coming in that space.",
            "Our bottoms business has also been a rapid growth driver for us. The more that we come out with our core, core fashion and then really provocative sport. I like to say, we’re more and more girl than girl, we win. So we have a unique position to be in this space relative to bras and bras and sport having to perform. And the second thing about really sport, sexy is strong, and we are in the business of fashion and sexy and we titles two things together, she is coming in.",
            "We’re also seeing a high penetration of new customer to the business. In addition, I’m most excited about the repeat customer that’s coming in as well, so we’re building loyals, it’s an exciting category for us.",
            "Janet Kloppenburg",
            "Can you give some margin outlook there on sport?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Janet, it should be very healthy over time. So we would expect in any major category of the business that we have. And sport certainly is one of the day and we’ll have substantial growth potential, but it will have a very healthy margin rate over time.",

            "Simon Siegel",
            "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jan, just for a perspective, could you quantify how much the aggregate AUR is down versus last year? And then just to be clear, your expectation for the moderating lower AUR bra penetration, is that a function of lapping the increased penetration from last year, or are you expecting sport and bralette units to decline in the back-half?",
            "And then, Greg, I know it’s quiet on your end this morning, but still there, nice results of beauty. Can you help quantify the top and bottom line benefits you’d expect beauty to contribute through the consolidated back-half results and then maybe the margin implications? Thanks.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "So, Simon, I’m going to take the first part of that question. We actually said in the script that for our lingerie bra units were up mid-single digits and total lingerie bras were down high-singles. So I think based on that math, you can get back to the AUR results in the business. And with that, let’s go to Greg for the beauty question.",
            "Greg Unis",
            "Yes. as we said earlier, we’re seeing nice – we saw in the second quarter nice sequential growth. And as we think forward to fall similar to the way that Jan spoke about the evolution of the lingerie business in fall we’re really – we’re very excited about what’s to come, and I’ve learned a lot over the last year and it makes impacts on the business there.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Simon, did you have another question in there?",
            "Simon Siegel",
            "Yes, sorry Amie, so what I meant in the first part was just thinking through the go-forward, so the penetration – the moderating penetration, is that because you’re lapping the increased penetration in the lower AUR bras or do you actually see right there the growth in constructive offsetting that?",
            "Jan Singer",
            "So, actually it’s Jan, hi. I mean by nature of not over assorting the line, something goes in, something comes out, so the mix is changing into contracted bras, by staying close to the customer, we see the demand for that. So, yes, by nature it’s actually both things on purpose, right.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Great, Simon.",
            "Simon Siegel",
            "Thanks a lot guys.",

            "John Morris",
            "Under the wire, all right, good morning guys, thanks for getting me in here. Nick, if you can give us a little bit more color directionally on the improvement that you’re seeing from the store renovations. If you can share any productivity metrics that would great. With the store learning – what the learnings are there from a traffic perspective, ticket perspective etcetera?",
            "And then Jan, I guess if you can briefly – you know I think this really would be, from your perspective, I’d be curious to hear a little bit more about your take on the Victoria’s Secret marketing as you’ve gotten familiar with it now, thought given to any innovation in the positioning, you know including the fashion show etcetera, but just overall the brand positioning and how you feel about it go-forward should we expect any changes, what’s your take on that? Thanks.",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "Hey, John, good morning. A couple of thoughts on that. So, as usual, we get a pretty wide range of performance from the new real-estate. But in general that continues to meet our expectations that allows us to continue to make those investments, so we see a pretty solid ROI, very consistent with what’s we’ve seen frankly over the past – close to the past three years. So, we continue to be pretty happy with that.",
            "I think the biggest thing is around customer-ship, John, so we see a high degree of new customers coming into the store, because it’s a better experience, it’s a new experience. We see obviously overall traffic is up in those stores, which is a key driver for the success behind it. And I think at the end of the day the real value in there is it’s an opportunity to introduce the brand in its best format and its most exciting format and the opportunity to introduce the newest products in the best format. So we continue to – in summary, I think we continue to be excited with the performance and performance has been consistent and we’ll continue to invest in those stores over the course of the next couple of years until we find out other ways.",
            "John Morris",

            "So John, hi, it’s Jan, thanks for getting us under the wire, that’s awesome. Number one, most of the time as I mentioned earlier, but I want to make sure I’m really clear about it is that you know the focus is deep customer connection and making great products job one. So, I’ve spent this year really up in the value chain, way up into innovation, product creation, our supply chain ensuring speed and agility, as well as our merchandising assortment, so I’m deep into that space and without that I can’t market anything, so I’m really excited about the time spent there.",
            "That said, we know the marketing space in total for the universe is changing and it’s about performance marketing and we are embracing that notion. We have the mission of attracting, engaging and converting our new customer as well as engaging our existing. Our new CMO will be joining the brand in September this fall on-boarding, so that is important for the VSL business.",
            "And you mentioned the show, although I can’t say too much about it, what I will say is that, Greg and I are deeply connected into this event to make sure that is actually ticks and ties for the business and we’re excited about what that means for our activity in traffic and conversion for holiday.",

Importantly, performance improved throughout the third quarter.",
            "Looking forward to the remainder of 2017, our forecast assumes a continuation of improved comparable sales growth and operating income results in the business. We have strong brands that lead their categories with close connections to our customers. Our stores have high sales productivity and 99% of our stores are cash flow positive.",
            "Our digital business continues to be strong, with both go-forward Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. We have confidence in our upcoming product launches and are focused on execution, staying close to our customers and leveraging our speed and agility capabilities to read, react and chase. We will also continue to manage inventory, expenses and capital spending with discipline.",
            "As a reminder, our comp guidance for November is roughly flat, as we're anniversarying aggressive promotion in the Victoria's Secret business last year. We will not be commenting on November business to date this morning, as we still have over half of the month ahead of us.",
            "With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Dein.",
            "Dein Boyle - Victoria's Secret Stores",
            "Thanks, Stuart. Good morning, everybody. I met many of you in Columbus recently to share the PINK brand strategy and outlook for Holiday. We are pleased with our Q3 performance. The business continues to have momentum, driven by our core categories of bras and panties.",
            "The brand remains focused on rigorous execution of our cost strategies, which include enhancing our customer engagement programs, continuous evolution of our speed-to-market practices, and disciplined approach to inventory management. As we approach the key holiday selling season, we have distorted focus to execution to ensure the best experience for our visitors, and initial results validate our assortment distortions.",
            "Thanks, and I'll turn it over to Jan.",
            "Jan Singer - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Thanks, Dein. Thank you, everybody. Again, great to meet a lot of you at Investor's Day. I remain very optimistic and very energized by the progress we're making at Victoria's Secret Lingerie. We're on the same offense. Obviously, a very sustainable construct; three frameworks knowing her. It starts with the customer and knowing her deeply through the thousands of associates we have, reaching millions of customers in store as well as digital and direct through data analytics and our customer service center.",
            "We are also focused on building great products and assortments that offer choices of sexy and an edited assortment to amplify the results. And third, we're here to serve her, where she wants and when she wants at the moment of truth, whether that's stores or online. To be loyal to her with authentic engagement is always our opportunity in serving her, all powered by a high-performing team that has come together as recent as last week when our CMO joined the team.",
            "The progress for Q3 – we are focused and continue to be focused on the core of the business, our best act which is bras and bras balancing our portfolio with choices on sexy. Unlined, lightly-lined and push-up are all in the portfolio. The strength of the core is constructing bras with benefits, balanced with fashion and emotional content and that's working for us.",
            "In Q3, we launched Illusion. Illusion is a constructed bra that comes in three choices. It has IP around its benefit of sexy smoothing and it has high emotional content. The bra exceeded unit launch and continues to sustain at a higher rate than our previously constructed bra launches. It's working and we will stay on that offense.",
            "In addition, in the bra category, Dream Angels, a very important portfolio for us, has been up double-digits on three constructed bras as well, romance, lace, embellishment, all working. We are going to continue to offer her choices in the bra category.",
            "In panties, as we discussed, we're resetting, but there are three books of business; the Five-Four business, the Three-Four Matchback business and Single Ticket. Five-Four has been tracking up for the last six weeks and we're very excited to see the progress on this reset already happening. Easier to navigate, better content and our pipeline is full going into spring. We are constructing the Matchback business and the Single Ticket, and we'll learn more about that as we head into holiday.",
            "Sleep, two choices for us; one we've been testing for six months in the Mix-and-Match and one that we do every year called Packaged Goods. Mix-and-Match is an incremental business. It has rolled to the chain and it is working. We are excited that she can make her own solutions of sleepwear. She's attaching it to bras in the box as well as panties, and we are seeing a high penetration of new customers.",
            "In addition, in Sleep, we have a Sexy Sleep business which is 100% on trend with sleepwear being one on the street, lingerie. It's been up double-digits for us in the last quarter and we see that continuing as we head into holiday and spring.",
            "Sport, growth driver for us, up double-digits as well. The base business is also growing and it's a new customer. The anchor to that in Q3 was the launch of the Angel Max Bra. The Angel Max Bra launch was strong. In the first single day did more than our best sport bra launch did in one full week. We continue to see that build. It's attaching to tights, multiple tights and tops. A very simple sport construct, a new customer, and we're excited to see that business continue to grow.",
            "In the spirit of serving her where she wants to shop, we've integrated the digital business into the brand. As you heard Mr. Wexner talk about, we are having a more emotional connection with her through that offense in edited assortment and offering, simplified navigation, and the results are strong.",
            "In addition, our loyalty program, Angel Card, has been reactivated and reengaged and we're seeing momentum in that space. We are leveraging marketing investments previously made around things like the show in the spirit of connecting with her and we're developing a deeper authentic engagement through our social channels, so she's converting through digital. Focus go-forward, Win at Holiday, heads are down on that, bringing the momentum into spring and making sure as it is that our pipeline is full for 2018 as well as 2019 in innovation.",

            "Thank you, Jan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to share some high-level thoughts about third quarter performance in Beauty.",
            "In Q3, we are pleased with the progress we made to establish a strong foundation and are beginning to build a dynamic business. Since spring, we've experienced positive sequential growth. Our best-selling fragrances are up year-over-year. During the quarter, in September, we launched LOVE, our new iconic fragrance. It was the number one prestige fragrance launch in Victoria's Secret history and we were very pleased with the results.",
            "We layered in fashion and newness in our Mist Collection, lip and accessories, as our customer responded very well to. By focusing in assortment and reducing lead times, we've significantly increased our agility. Overall, I'm confident we are headed in the right direction with positive sequential growth headed into the holiday season.",
            "This holiday we're focused on winning the season. We've developed a thoughtfully conceived balanced assortment of gifting, fragrance, mist, and accessories that hits multiple price points, introduces new gift categories, and is seamlessly integrated with the total Victoria's Secret brand. On the PINK Beauty side, we have significant growth opportunity ahead and we'll deliver excitement and newness across gifting, seasonal fashion, and stocking stuffers.",
            "In closing, we are headed in the right direction, seeing positive sequential growth in the business. We're building upon what's working, making big bigger, leaning into speed and agility, and always continuously testing and learning from new ideas. Ultimately, our main focus is on building a healthy business to set us up for accelerated growth in the future.",

            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Greg. Just really a couple of headlines on Q3, and I'd really like to reiterate what we talked about at the investor meeting, which was we really saw a nice improvement as we went through the quarter. As the quarter progressed, our business got better, and that improvement in performance was predominantly based on us rebalancing the mix from being – well, rebalancing the mix to a more overtly seasonal products and concepts.",
            "As you know, earlier in the season we were heavily focused on relaunching some of our Body Care businesses. And as a result, I think we really missed some of the seasonal fragrance that she was expecting from us. And we were able to correct that in the month of October, so a nice trajectory change. And that trajectory change really proves three things about the business.",
            "First of all, one is that we have tremendous agility and our ability to chase into the right products to meet customers' preferences is a really important part of our business model. Secondly, it proves just how sensitive the brand is to seasonality, and that's a good thing as we think about trying to continue to drive traffic at all times of the year. And thirdly, the customer has a very deep loyalty to some very specific returning fragrances, returning concepts and returning franchises as we go into those seasonal periods, which again is good for our ability to control our own destiny, control our own traffic.",
            "Us being able to correct that before we got into holiday leaves us feeling cautiously optimistic about the Christmas season. And I think, hopefully, as you've seen in the stores, we are setting very clearly for a very seasonal look as it relates to Christmas, a very festive feeling and the store environment really starts to scream Christmas right now, so we should be in a very good shape.",
            "Thank you, and I'll hand that over to Martin.",
            "Martin Waters - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everybody. Third quarter revenue in the International segment increased by 11%, driven by growth in sales in both Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Bath & Body Works in particular had a very strong quarter, with solid growth in all categories in all regions of the world.",
            "Our Victoria's Secret full assortment business benefited from significant new store growth. However, the base business continued to see negative comps similar to those experienced in North America.",
            "The U.K. business continues to be tough and we're very focused on getting that business back on track. The Victoria's Beauty business gained traction in the quarter as newness started to be delivered during October. As you know, our primary focus is China and we're investing meaningfully in people, infrastructure, real estate with a conviction that China has enormous long-term potential.",

            "Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC",
            "Great. Thank you so much. Good morning. My question is on gross margin. I wanted to know, Stuart, if you could quantify the shrink impact to gross margin in the quarter, and any strategies you have to address shrink? And then secondarily in gross margin, maybe Nick could address the merchandise margin decline at BBW, the drivers there and how he's feeling about that going forward. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Kimberly. We'll start with Stuart.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "So the shrink impact in the third quarter, which was driven by Victoria's Secret, was about $12 million. And so that's a significant amount and absent that effect, the margin rate would've been up in that part of the business. And it's a complex subject, Kimberly, as you and our listeners would appreciate. And our store teams are focused on it, first and foremost, providing a great experience for our customers, but also managing that part of the business. And we're making, we believe, some appropriate improvements in how we manage that aspect of the business. But what we're most focused on is how to best serve our customers. But it had a meaningful effect in the quarter as we trued-up our shrink rate. Thanks.",

            "Nick?",
            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Hey, Kimberly. Yeah, so as I mentioned, in Q3 it was almost a tale of two cities. The first part of the season was not as good as the second part, and we were slightly more promotional in August and September, and not as promotional as we got into October. And so, obviously, that had an impact on gross margin.",
            "Your question in terms of how do we feel about margin rate as a go-forward, I would say pretty good, as we've seen a shift in our business in the latter part of October that led us to be slightly less promotional. And if I think about our plans going into holiday, we're planning it at about flat to last year, which was – well, obviously, planning at about flat to last year.",
            "Now the caveat, obviously, with that would be holidays. In a normal season, holiday is a long timeframe, and we'll see how the environment does. And, obviously, with our read and react capabilities, our agility to follow the customer, that may change. But at this juncture, we're planning about flat.",

Could you quantify the impact of the decision to increase investment in direct mail, and then any other puts and takes that we should be thinking about? And then just should we be expecting a larger impact from the increase of the investment during holiday, just given the more promotional nature of that quarter? Thank you so much.",

            "So with respect to SG&A, we are certainly working to invest appropriately in our marketing activity and also in our store payroll activity in our businesses. We work to strike the right balance, obviously, to make those investments to drive top line growth and drive profit dollars. But in response to your question, we are making what we believe are appropriate investments year-on-year particularly at Victoria's Secret in marketing and store payroll that we believe will contribute to a good sales result and a good profit result.

            "Hey, Brian. So on a macro level, we're going to be flowing more newness than we flowed last year, and that'll come from two points of view. The first point of view being, we've continued to evolve the brand and are looking at and getting into newer categories, and that obviously creates newness. The other point of view on the newness that we're flowing is, as we look at things that we are famous for during that timeframe, they look dramatically different this year than they did last year, and so that sort of adds to the newness.",
            "As it relates to the calendar, there are some minor changes in the calendar – or flow calendar, for us, some minor changes that are really about trying to maximize different timeframes of the month. But nothing demonstrable that would make you think differently about thinking about our business.",

            "Great. Thanks, Nick. Jan?",
            "Jan Singer - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Yeah. So we will continue to flow newness as planned. We will distort things that she wants most at that timeframe. We talked earlier about the casual sleep and pajama business as an example. And we will have Sport always on. So we have stepped up our game with things that we have speed and agility on, specifically around things like Sport and casual and Sexy Sleep, and we will react to that as we see going into December and into January.",

I think that it is about the journey of getting us into that balance and we're finding our footing in constructed bras. As you read in the script, constructed bras were up this quarter. We continue to see the momentum in that space, and we have healthy margins on that business. That's a really important book for us, and we will continue to build bras with benefits balanced with fashion. And when we do that, we do get paid for that work.",

As it relates to the investment, Paul, in China and the near-term operating losses and kind of cutting to the thrust of your question, we would expect and will give more guidance, obviously, in February as it relates to 2018. But we would expect that the loss in China will be meaningfully lower in 2018 than we believe it will be in 2017, and that there'll be a steady progression to a profitable business over time.

I wanted to drill into the outlook for November, which anticipates a sequential acceleration on a two-year basis, because you're going up against a really tough comparison. And maybe just getting specifically into Victoria's Lingerie, Jan, if you could talk about some of the initiatives or specific reasons you feel confident that you can sort of go up against a really challenging comparisons from the prior year, which was obviously of low quality, but still drove a pretty big top line number.",
            "Jan Singer - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Hey, Lindsay. Thank you for the question. I think, first and foremost, it comes back to two things, customer at the center and building great product, having the right assortment. So I feel really confident about the assortment of the product that we have coming in. I feel it completely resonates with who she is today, giving her those choices. Again, the balance in the portfolio at the core of bras feels right and flanking that with adjacencies, like the sleep business we talked about, like Sexy Sleep, is a great combination. We're seeing, again, attachment to the core when she buys those adjacencies, and we're able to read and react in those adjacencies quite quickly.

            "And then secondly to Jan, at Victoria's Secret, you've been testing various marketing and promotional events. Some of the couponing is coming back to the brand. Can you maybe talk about some of the learnings there? Where have you seen the biggest attachment rate thus far? Thanks so much.",

            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "So on the gross margin guide for the fourth quarter, I guess the first thing I would say is it's an estimate and it's our best view of an estimate. But the reason I start with that is at the end of the day, guys, what we're driving for is margin dollars, healthy sales growth, profitable sales growth. And in the major parts of our business, as you've heard this morning from the team, we're not expecting to be more promotional at this point in the fourth quarter than we were a year ago. So in terms of the promotional aspects that would affect gross margin, not expecting meaningfully more promotion in 2017 than we had in the fourth quarter 2016, and in some cases we would expect to have less promotion. But we'll see as we manage through the quarter, as Nick described, in terms of how we run the business.",
            "And we enter the quarter with inventories in great shape and we believe that we've got good, compelling product ideas. So the gross margin year-on-year change is not that significant and directionally it's down slightly. Some of that's affected a bit by the other segments, a mix dynamic going on with the other segment. But again, in the major businesses, pretty steady in terms of year-on-year promotion. Thanks.",

We feel good about that and the margins are strong there. We have brand accretive promotions which enable us to do three things. Number one, introduce the new customer to the store and the new product; I feel good about that.",
            "Number two, we are reengaging with customers we haven't seen in about 12 months. That feels also very strong. We've had great success there. And we will always surprise and delight an existing customer, things like giving her a lip product when she tries an Illusion bar, feels good for both of us and the customer. That is what we're talking about when we are talking about promotions.",

I'm wondering if you guys are seeing much of a change in the environment and whether you believe that any of these competitors are changing your pricing power at all. Thank you.",

            "Okay. Thanks, William. I think two things about this. Number one, we all love competition. It makes us stronger. I think that's always great to see the landscape and we're well aware of it. I track it pretty closely on intimates and apparel as it relates to our customer.",
            "What I love about our business is, we have a 1,000 stores and a strong digital flagship store. We are able to offer choices for her. Coming into the store and being fit for a bra is a unique experience with – I think we have five bra associates per store that have an average tenure of 10 years.",
            "So having that engagement and having been a person that did that for three months, eight hours a day, six days a week, there is nothing that can replace that engagement with the customer. And I welcome the landscape to continue to evolve, so it helps us raise our game. Feel good about that. Dein?",

            "Hey. Good morning. So, one of the challenges that you've cited for Victoria's Secret in recent periods has been this weaker store traffic related to the exit from swim and your pullback in some of the promotional activity. As you're lapping some of those actions, are you seeing traffic trends start to stabilize? And just in general, it'd be helpful to understand how you're thinking about brick-and-mortar traffic trends across all the vendors in the holiday period. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Okay. We'll start with Jan.",
            "Jan Singer - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Okay. So, Chethan, thank you for the question. Actually, we've seen our traffic improve, especially over the third quarter. It's sometimes outpacing the mall in fact. We track both our freestanding stores and our shared stores. And, again, when we have great product and we bring her a product that is emotionally resonating with her, she shows up. So, I feel very good about the trajectory of that traffic. And, again, the key adjacencies balanced with the core is what's bringing that momentum into the box.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Jan. Nick?",
            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - L Brands, Inc.",
            "So I think we've seen a nice trajectory in traffic recently, as we've been able to get into very seasonally relevant products, and how we tried to partner that with the right promotional activity has been working well for us. I don't see that changing as we go into holiday, especially as the assortment continues to get more and more seasonal as we go through the season.",
            "But, once again, holiday is a very volatile period and we obviously reserve the right to a certain degree to sit back from that and see just how is the customer behaving and is there something difference incremental or change that we want to do that could change the course of that traffic, if it was to go into a negative place. But I see the trend we've got now, would like to hope that that maintains itself as we go through holiday.",

            "Nicholas P. M. Coe - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Yeah. How we manage across the two channels is probably the most important part which is, we really do want it to be a comparable product, pricing and promotional behavior, so that it doesn't matter where the customer is interacting with the brand, she gets the same product, same price, the same promotion.",
            "And obviously, that has been working for us for the last number of years as we've been able to maintain growth in both bricks-and-mortar as well as growth in the online channel, and very healthy growth in the online channel. At the end of the day, the operating income is fundamentally the same. We don't see a – in terms of how we manage the business, it just nets itself out with the – very similar. So, there isn't a major difference between the two of them.",

            "Hi. Thank you. Our question was about the target to direct mail ahead. Could you articulate factors that the program needs most going forward and the big opportunity there, and help us just contrast it with prior versions? Some of the points around what you're thinking about the consumer and how do you balance traffic versus margin and making sure that your brands stay very elevated? Thank you.",
            "Jan Singer - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Hey, Oliver. Thank you. I think the thing that's the biggest difference for us year-on-year around direct mail is really about customer segmentation. Being able to really get deep into the file, understand who's in, who's out, how we pivot the file towards the woman who's going to emotionally and actively engage and connect with product. Getting that fidelity going is, as you know, the new landscape of marketing.",
            "So, the big difference is no blunt instruments. I think Greg would agree with that as well. It's high fidelity. It's absolutely about engagement and it's meeting her where she's going to react. That was the first part of your question. I didn't quite track on the second. Sorry, Oliver.",
            "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC",
            "I think that helps us understand. Just contrasting this to prior versions of the program and the key differences about how this is going to work now versus how you've pursued direct mail in the past.",
            "Jan Singer - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Well, again, I think the past – there's a lot of past that's catalog direct mail and different kinds of direct mail. But essentially what I can talk about is go forward the high fidelity and emotional engagement and the segmentation. That's what the difference is.",

            "Yeah, absolutely. We've been deep into this since I've arrived. We've dissected the business. I think we have a very good architecture go forward. You're starting to see some of the results of that in the Five-Four business. Yes, we know the three books of business are all important and we have a speed model against the most important side of that.

Putting that into context, I guess I've got three questions for Jan. In thinking about the negative low-single digits for lingerie overall, is it just the unconstructed bralettes at this point that are on offset? Or are there other items as well?",
            "When do you anniversary the heavy investments made in the bralette category? And what does your flat- to low-single digit comp guidance for the fourth quarter assume about lingerie performance overall? Thanks a lot.",

            "Yeah. I mean – thank you, Roxanne, for the questions. Thank you also for the support on the progress. It is about the balance of the portfolio. And when you build great bras, again, with benefits and emotional content, those take time and we have to fill that pipeline. I think the pipeline is now full and so you'll start see those roll more often.",
            "As those roll and she votes yes on those, it helps us right-size the portfolio. Again, also going with choices of push-up, lightly-lined and unlined in the right balance is important.

            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. Although our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.11 were above our initial guidance of $1.95 to $2.10, the upside was related to a favorable tax rate. Absent the impact of the lower-than-forecasted tax rate, we delivered an earnings per share result toward the lower end of our range.",
            "On a 13-to-13-week basis, operating income declined by 5%. And although this result is an improvement versus the third quarter, we had expected to do better. Our performance was mixed. Growth in operating income at Bath & Body Works versus last year and our forecast was more than offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret.",
            "Turning to 2018, we're very focused on improving performance in the Victoria's Secret business, staying close to our customer, improving the customer experience in stores and online, and improving our assortments in compelling new product launches. We will continue to be disciplined in the management of inventory, expenses and capital.",
            "Following an extensive evaluation of our wage rates by market, we are making investments in our workforce by increasing wage rates and benefits, principally for hourly associates. These investments will help us continue to attract and retain high-quality talent and be an employer of choice. The impact of these investments is approximately $100 million in 2018 and is included in our guidance.",
            "Excluding the impact of these wage investments, our operating income forecast is for low single-digit growth at the high end of our range. We, as a management team, would not be satisfied with that result and are working hard to do better.",

            "Thanks, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. I plan to share a brief overview of PINK's Q4 results and brief thoughts about our outlook leading into spring. For the quarter, our intimate's category, specifically bras and panties, both drove mid to high single-digit growth versus last year, while expanding margin rates. Bra sales and unit growth were driven principally by our Wear Everywhere and Sports franchises, driven by a strong fashion offering. Panties were also strong across all silhouettes and collections, driven by continued newness.",
            "For holiday specifically, we felt strongly that we succeeded in servicing the gift-giver through a strong fashion offering. Our gifting collections as well drove strong double-digit growth versus last year on an expanded margin rate.",
            "Apparel had areas of success and disappointment. Therefore, we would characterize our apparel performance as mixed. Key packages related to opulence, cozy and bling, that were shared at the prior investor walk-through, performed very well and experienced high sell-throughs. The balance of the apparel assortment, however, disappointed our self-purchaser, and we're applying those learnings to our go-forward assortment architecture.",
            "Therefore, in aggregate, PINK's Q4 comps were up slightly and category performance, as mentioned, was mixed. Despite this result, we continue to feel positive about the strength of the brand and our ability to serve and emotionally engage our customer. Our digital and social channels are strong. Engagement is up and the PINK Nation program continues to grow and be effective. Leading into spring, we will continue to focus on our customer and operate our business with speed, agility and simplicity.",

            "Thanks, Denise. Good morning, everybody. As you read in the pre-circulated materials, 2017, we made progress on resetting the business post the changes in 2016. While results overall were down, we improved sales and margin throughout the year from down high single-digits in Q1 to down mid-single-digits in Q4. This progress was led by a deep focus on the customer and products, starting with the core, our bra business.",
            "Based on continued engagement with the customer, we continue to rebalance the bra mix, offering her choices of bras with benefits, balanced with high-fashion in constructed and unconstructed. This was led by launches of Illusion, Angel Max, T-Shirt, and the results here were sales growth in our constructed bra business.",
            "In addition, we began to reset panty business, as promised, making progress with comps in the 5-For program, which were up 12 of the 13 weeks in non-red lined (06:35) product during the quarter. Our sport business and base continue to grow with apparel comps up and sport bra AUR up.",
            "We offered her key adjacent categories, like casual sleep and lounge, that we shared at the last investor meeting, that worked to attract new customers and had a 40% attachment to bra selling in Q4. We integrated digital into the brand, and progressive growth has happened throughout the year, ending with a double-digit comp up in Q4.",
            "Engagement with millions of consumers in-store and online continues to be our competitive advantage in terms of product creation, but also in terms of how we stay connected and build and retain loyals. We're proud of the progress, but also recognize there's much more for us to do, as we continue to reset this business.",
            "In 2018, we're focused on continuing to strengthen the core with bras with benefits, balancing with fashion, and we feel optimistic (7:27) and fashion pipeline in this space. We're continuing to improve our panty business by focusing and reframing our 3-For business and single ticket. We're focused on building our key adjacent categories, which are important, as mentioned, to driving our core bra business and new customer acquisition and retention.",

I'm most excited about the competency, chemistry and the composition of this team, as it's a blend of 100% L Brand knowledge with external knowledge. The diversity of those thoughts is bringing new solutions. Again, I feel confident and optimistic that we are making progress, and I look forward to your questions.",

            "Our best-selling fragrances are up year-over-year, where we drove mid-single-digit growth in sales and margin. We transformed our Mist Collection business through relevant fashion and newness. Our digital channel drove significant growth for the quarter and for the full year.",
            "As we look forward, at the beginning of February, we successfully relaunched the PINK Beauty business, which is off to a strong start. Last week, we launched Bombshell Seduction, a new complementary scent to our number one fragrance, Bombshell, with promising results. We continue to be focused on driving fashion and newness through Mist Collection, lip (09:16) and accessories.",
            "We are confident in our business model and our continued growth. We're focused on building upon what's working, making big bigger, leaning into speed and agility, testing and learning from new ideas and always maintaining connectivity to the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands.",

At Bath & Body Works, we are encouraged that we were able to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter, our biggest and most important quarter, as both sales and operating income grew 11% in the 14-week period.",
            "As Nick described on the Q3 earnings call, we had seen sales momentum building through October as we were able to utilize our read and react capabilities to chase into more of the seasonally-relevant collections that the customer expects from us in the fall. That same read and react approach on both chasing seasonal product and flexing holiday promotional activities allowed us to maintain and build sales momentum in our key November and December Christmas selling season. We also were able to end the year with a very successful Semi-Annual Sale that drove strong January comps.",
            "Looking forward to 2018, we remain cautiously optimistic that we can continue to drive strong sales and operating income growth while also investing in the long-term health and relevance of our brand. Those investments include: developing and launching new and innovative products; continuing to invest in our fleet, with the ongoing remodel strategy that continues to deliver solid results; and investing in our customer experience in both our stores and digital platforms.",

Firstly, the partner-based businesses are doing well, with good operating income growth for the quarter and the year and at high operating income rate.",
            "Secondly, we continue to invest in China, which we believe will be a significant market for us. VSBA stores and e-commerce through the Tmall platform are both doing well. And the seven full assortment stores, five of which were opened in the fourth quarter, are progressing pretty much as we expected.",
            "Thirdly, as you know, the UK business was very challenging for us in 2017. And finally, overall, comps in the International segment were broadly in line with the patterns that we saw in each of our North American businesses.",
            "In 2018, our priorities with respect to International are: firstly, continuing to scale in China, where we'll open another 10 to 11 stores; secondly, improving our performance in the UK; and finally, continuing to build on the success of our partner-owned stores globally.",

Can you maybe talk about any productivity benefits that you're expecting from this $100 million spend?",

As you know, we launched bras like Illusion and the T-Shirt bra recently, which is helping us get there quicker. We're lapping also in Q1 and Q2 significant bralette business. And I would say the more velocity we have on constructed, the faster we can get there, but we're still in a balancing mode and the bralettes are still part of our mix. But I'm very confident in the bras that we are launching and those driving a rebalance in the time needed.",

            "Hey, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the gross margin line a little bit? It looks like when you make the adjustment for the reclassification in the credit income, you're kind of implying gross margins will be down 30 bps, but given the 2% to 4% comp guide, it feels like maybe there should be some leverage in there on occupancy, but maybe help us walk through how we're thinking about the puts and takes in gross margin this year. Thanks guys.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Yes, so, Omar, it's Stuart. So we think we'll be and will work hard to do better than this result, but we think there'll be some slight for the year, some slight de-leverage or decline in the merchandise margin rate. And we think that the buying and occupancy component of – which is all at the high end of the range – the buying and occupancy component of gross profit will be about flat year-on-year.",
            "To your point, the classification of the economics related to the proprietary credit card provide a benefit in that line, so that is part of the equation and put pressure on the SG&A rate. So we're going to work hard to improve on that result through the year. But as we made a judgment about how to position things, at this stage, we think there'll be a little bit of pressure on the merch margin line in 2018.",
            "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI Group",

            "It's a combination. I'm not trying to at all avoid the question, Omar. It's a combination of a lot of things, as you can appreciate. And as we just balanced the recent trends in the business, along with our views about the quality of ideas that we have and what it will take to move the business in 2018, we think there will be slight pressure on the merchandise margin rate, but it's a function of a lot of different things. And, again, we'll work hard to get to a better result.",
            "Another thing that we shared consistently and, again, you would appreciate this, is it's always a balancing act between volume and margin rate, and we're focused very much on margin dollars, and we do our best to obviously to strike that balance between volume and margin rate.",

            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "And the last point in the equation is that as our business grows at a faster rate online in the direct channel, there is a little bit of mix dilution on the gross profit or merchandise margin line in that business.

            "Great, thank you so much. My question is on the Victoria's Secret operating margin. I'm wondering, Stuart, if you could explore what needs to happen either in 2018 or 2019 and beyond that would allow Victoria's Secret to start recovering some of the 500 basis points of operating margin it lost over the last two years. And I just want to confirm on the answer to Omar's question regarding the direct business at a lower merchandise margin, is that strictly because the shipping expense is classified as a component of merchandise margin or is there some other factor that causes the online merchandise margin to be below stores? Thanks so much.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "I'll take the last part of your question first, Kimberly, and that is, as you suggest in your question, it is due to the fulfillment and shipping cost economics providing a drag on that line versus the store business, so that is, in fact, what's happening.",
            "With respect to the operating income rate for the Victoria's Secret segment, as you appreciate from following us a long time, we believe, based on the quality of the Victoria's business, the PINK business that's part of it, that that business in time should get back to, if not a little better than, its best ever result. And it's not going to happen overnight, as you appreciate, but there's no reason structurally that that can't be a high teens operating income rate business when it's running at its peak, if you will, and we see that opportunity. In terms of how it'll get there, the number one driver of that or determinant of that will be volume. And so we've had deleverage in the P&L, as part of the category exits and other pressures on top line volume, that have hurt the operating income rate of that business.",
            "And then secondarily, the merchandise margin rate is down meaningfully versus peak, given needs to have different types of promotion and other pressure in the business that in the near-term have put pressure on that merchandise margin rate. But the headline answer is driving more volume through that business and also being thoughtful and tough-minded about expense trade-offs in that business.",
            "We made a big announcement today about investing in wages, but there are lots of aspects to the P&L, if you will. And we will continue to scrutinize all the significant areas of spend in that P&L to make sure that they're appropriately driving sales and profit dollars to the business. But short, short answer is we need volume, and the team very really focused on that through merchandising activities and other activities to drive volume. Thanks.",

We have a ton of data about who's buying from both stores and online. And we direct messaging recommendations and products that she'd be interested in.

Firstly, I would say that the pattern of performance that we see generally internationally is pretty much the same as the pattern that we see in the domestic businesses, be it in Victoria, be it in PINK, be it in BBW. So I think we always say, if you have strong business at home, you have strong business away. And that's pretty much the shape of it in the UK, except that the UK performance has been exacerbated by very difficult market conditions there that I've talked about on previous calls, don't need to go into now.",

So it's the market, it's the area of the world where we are least penetrated, as you probably know. We feel good about the partners that we have and we will be advancing there. It's a lower priority than other areas, as you know. Number one priority is China. We have a very big business with Alshaya in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. That's a high-priority.

I know they're largely almost all profitable and the opportunity for rent reduction there. And then just another question on the e-commerce, you had said it's profitable, but is it more profitable as a channel than the brick-and-mortar currently? Thank you very much.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Yes. So I'll take the last part of that again first. So our online businesses are more profitable than our store-based businesses, both at Bath & Body and at Victoria's Secret.",
            "With respect to our real estate footprint, as we've outlined pretty consistently, we are well-diversified across mall types, and by reminder, about 30% of our store locations are not in enclosed shopping malls. We very actively manage the fleet, opening and closing stores every year.",
            "As we look at our capital spending plans for 2018, the level of activity and the level of investment in Victoria's Secret is down versus the last several years, and we're continuing to invest at a pretty steady rate in the project activity for Bath & Body Works, those White Barn remodels, as we refer to them. We're continuing on that program, given the strong sales results that we've seen. And we're continuing to invest as it relates to real estate store buildup in China, as you would expect. So we believe we're moderating. We're adjusting our investment in North America appropriately based on recent performance.",
            "With respect to a strategy or a game plan about rent reduction, the headline there would be we certainly don't want to overpay for rents, and we don't believe that we do. And with that said, as we've talked about pretty consistently, the most important thing as it relates to managing real estate is to ensure that you have the best locations.",
            "And certainly, in the best malls, there is some inflation when one renews leases. And it's well worth it in terms of the sales result that you get and the profit dollar result that you get. But in mall situations that are more difficult in terms of the nature of the mall, we have very favorable rent terms, including a lot of flexibility where we can leave those situations with little, if any, lease liability based on tenancy provisions and other aspects of those leases.",
            "So, again, actively managing the portfolio, but rent reduction as a strategy per se is not a big part of our strategy, understanding that we're not looking to overpay on rents. Thanks.",

Those areas have been well-identified and isolated. And through the agility work that we do in region with our mass partners, we are rapidly course-correcting the mix issues as we've isolated them.

Thank you so much.",
            "Andrew Meslow - Bath & Body Works LLC",
            "Hi, there. Thanks for the question. So through much of 2017, we actually communicated that merchandise margin rates were down because of increased promotional activity that was required to drive results in the first three quarters. But in fourth quarter, actually, what we communicated was slightly different, in that we were about flat promotionally in the November and December timeframe. We had a lot of new and differentiated ideas from a promotional standpoint, but in aggregate, about flat. Really, what drove the increase in promotional activity for the full quarter was the out-performance of our Semi-Annual Sale activity in the month of January, and that is what fundamentally put the drag on merchandise market rate for Q4.",
            "On a forward-looking basis, as we discussed on prior calls, we generally enter into any timeframe planning essentially flat promotional activity year-over-year. And then we adjust up or down accordingly, based on what we see from a combination of activities, including customer acceptance of our products, traffic patterns that we see both in stores and online, and then the results of the very diverse group of tests that we're constantly running.",
            "And those group of tests are really what, when we talk about our read and react capability, it is those group of tests that we look at for results, both from a long-term strategic ability to make changes to our promotional cadence, get higher AURs as we make investments into our products. And then very importantly, on a very short-term basis, where, literally, day-to-day, week-to-week, we may change our promotional activity up or down based on the results of those tests in order to maximize short-term results.

It's a platform we've been running with for a long time that needs to be updated, and we're in the process of updating that. And it will provide the foundation to do a lot of things from a customer standpoint that we'll look to do over the next several years.",

I believe you had a net loss of around $50 million in 2016 and had been expecting the losses to peak in 2017 and then step down in 2018. So can you provide a little more detail on the actual EBIT impact this year in 2017 and just how you're thinking about that for 2018?",

But in our current view and what's implicit in our guidance, is a 2018 loss that's similar to the 2017 number. We had thought six or 12 months ago that that might be slightly improved, but, as we sit here today, we think it'll be about the same, and we'll work hard to get to a better result.",

            "Well, as soon as we opened, we realized that we hadn't distorted anywhere near enough. The customers' significantly smaller than we see anywhere else in the world, and that shows up particularly in 32 brand bras. So your question is have we resolved that. Yes, we have. We now have the same representation of choices in 32-band that we have in our most popular size, which is 34-band, and we have significantly more depth of inventory.",
            "So when the five stores that I mentioned earlier opened in the fourth quarter, they opened with at least 50% of their bra inventory in 32 brand or smaller. So, yes, we've resolved that. We've also made additions in terms of color, where there are different customer preferences around color, red being particularly strong. And yes, we remain confident in the appeal of brand and our ability to execute. So thanks for the question.",
            "Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.",
            "Perfect, thanks so much.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Martin. Thank you. Next question.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.",
            "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC",
            "Hi, thanks, good morning. Martin, I'm going to keep you busy, just another follow-up on the China business. I guess, when we take a step back, you guys have taken that business in-house about two years ago. Can you just talk about the pieces of the business where you're pleased or you're seeing above-plan results? And maybe on the other side, just maybe where you hope you could have done a little bit better and hope to do better, maybe piecing that business out across your online Tmall business, the retail stores, the flagships you've opened? And then just on top of that, just what kind of revenue growth should we expect in 2018, just for China specifically?",
            "Martin Waters - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Yeah. Thanks for the question. I could take the rest of the call, talk about China and my colleagues around the table are asking me not to. So I'll be relatively quick. There are three components to the business in China. You're right. When we took over the business from our partner Valeron (39:50), who did a terrific job. There were about 30 VSBA stores widely spread across the country. And following our ownership of those stores, we've seen significant improvement in comp performance, not just in the first year, but in the second year on top of that, so very pleased with the performance of that business.",
            "And what we have done is we've closed some of the stores where the deals weren't as good as they should be, but we definitely see potential for the VSBA business for the standalone Beauty business to grow significantly across China in the coming years. So that's the first part.",
            "The second part of the business is the online business, which has been through three phases. We began with Tmall Global, which is shipping from North America on a 14-day lead time. We then morphed to Tmall Local, which is shipping on a next-day basis and business has been growing very rapidly. It is now more than our largest store, as one might expect, and we're seeing growth day-on-day, week-on-week, and a really, really good response to that.",
            "We'll, also, this year, be adding a China.cn site so that we can direct customers directly from all social media platforms to our own site, as well as to the Tmall site. So, a significant progress online. And of course, it enables us to reach every corner of the Chinese market, which gives us great learning in terms of sizing and customer appeal for geographies where we are not currently active.",
            "And then the third business is the full assortment stores, where we're anchored with three flagships that enhance the presence of Victoria's in China, in Hong Kong, in Shanghai, in Beijing, and then opening smaller mall-based stores at sort of 5,000 to 7,000 square feet in all of the major Tier 1 to Tier 2 cities.",
            "I mentioned earlier, five open right now, we'll add another 10 or 11. And I think you probably have enough data there to do your own modeling about how we see the growth of the business. It will be significant growth year-over-year. And what the plan is for 2019, we'll wait and see. We'll read through the early part of Q1, Q2 and then make commitments for 2019 beyond that.",
            "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC",
            "Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Martin. Next question.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.",
            "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC",
            "Hi. Good morning. I had a question for Jan. Jan, how are you feeling about the matrix that you laid out with day, night and overnight in terms of the occasions, and also, what you're solving for in the context of the recent performance?",
            "And a second general question, just about LB and customer analytics. What are your thoughts about loyalty and analytics to drive customer acquisition, retention and lifetime value as you look to use that and to empower that? What can happen there? And can there be an interplay with utilization of direct mail, just to ensure that that is a healthy brand-appropriate level?",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Okay, let's start with Jan.",
            "Jan Singer - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Okay. Hi, Oliver. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Well, as we mentioned along the way, it always first starts with the customer, know her and then solving her sexy, I'd like to say, with product, and then serving her. And in the solve part, we do believe there is a day, night, overnight part of her life. And in addition to that throughout the year, we've launched products against that. So if you think about her every day, the Illusion launch is an everyday bra. It has VS technology, and side smoothing wings and we saw great success in the launch last August, and we re-launched about a week ago a new strapless bra, and there's been really strong response.",
            "In the night, our high-fashion part, Dream Angels business for us has been a real shining star. It's about plus 30%, let's just say, growth in the last fiscal year, really seeped in fashion, bras as fashion matter. A lot of bras are outerwear at this moment and it comes from this book of business.",
            "And in the highly-provocative segment, we do also have some moments of great, great brightness. Our collaboration last holiday drove real interest in this space. We saw bras with very high ASP with baskets and new customers coming in. There's clearly work to do in all three sectors to offset the highly promotional unconstructed bra business that was there the year before. But I like that I'm seeing traction against her wardrobing for her life, same consumer buying for different reasons. Second part of the question, I'll turn it to Stuart.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Yes. Thanks, Jan. On loyalty and analytics, just to cover it broadly, Oliver, obviously, it's an important subject. As a company, L Brands has made and is making investment, discrete investment, in people and technology to deepen our big data, machine learning, analytical capabilities, and we're getting some utility out of that. Obviously, a lot of information in our business about consumer behavior, customer behavior, and I'd say we're making progress on that big agenda, a lot more to do, but we're making meaningful investments in that space.",
            "With respect to loyalty, probably three main thoughts, one is loyalty, first and foremost, comes from great experiences with our brands and stores and online. And everyone in the business is focused on that. As you know, the Angel Card at Victoria's has a loyalty component to it, as a second thought. But as a third thought, Victoria's, PINK and Bath & Body all are evaluating, thinking about, nothing specific to announce in detail today, about loyalty programs beyond that, but no specific announcements today on what that may look like in 2018 or 2019, but a big subject.",
            "But investing in capabilities, very focused on great experiences. Again, Angel Cards have meaningful portion of tender and customer activity within Victoria's. And there's more to do. Denise has a great following through PINK Nation, as another example of a loyalty communication. But there's more for us to do, and we're sorting out what those priorities will be for 2018 and 2019. Thanks.",
            "Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC",
            "Thank you. Thanks very much.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Oliver. We have time for two more questions.",
            "Operator",
            "Our next question will come from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Please go ahead.",
            "Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research",
            "Good morning, everyone. I have a question for Denise and for Jan. Denise, perhaps you could talk a little bit about your lead times and your confidence in being able to turn around the fashion business in short order and maybe a comment on trends in the logo business of PINK? And, Jan, when you review your most successful traffic-driving initiatives at Victoria's Secret, I'm wondering what the learnings are there and how you can capitalize on that as we look forward. Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Thanks, Janet. We'll start with Denise.",
            "Denise Landman - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "So with respect to lead times, we've worked systematically over, I would say, the last three to five years on doing two things with respect to lead times: one is effective in-region work through our partnerships that would facilitate speed within the manufacturing sector; equally, looking for opportunities within our own sphere of influence, what I would refer as the upstream work to simplify our model to enable faster decision-making that then (47:20) operate more efficiently on our behalf. So we make slow and steady improvement. We see opportunity every year to make that better. And I think we avail ourselves of those opportunities as the opportunity resides in speed always.",
            "With respect to the logo business, our hallmark has always been the logo of the brand. It continues to be a cornerstone of our success. We, however, happen to be in a trend that pays some deference to brand logo, known as logomania. So we take full advantage of the market interest in that particular sector as freely as we might, preserving the integrity of our own logo as a reference point, which has always been very important and meaningful.",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Great. Thanks. Jan?",
            "Jan Singer - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Sure. Thanks for the question. I would say just building on what Oliver asked, it starts, first and foremost, with great traffic comes from great product, which comes from great consumer insights and customer insights. So we feel really confident about the exposure and time we have with customers and the product that we're building against that. And then, when we really build the assortment in a way that emotionally connects, we drive traffic.",
            "The next thing that's important is, of course, engagement. We're seeing great traction most recently engagement on social media as well as our emails. When we get into that dialogue with her and we really are agile with that vehicle, we see traffic because she has to be aware of what we're building. That awareness is a really important thing, obviously.",
            "And then, we do reward her for shopping, for our existing customer, to build loyals. And we also surprise and delight those that just started shopping with us. And we do that many different ways, depending on the moment, depending on the book of business, but it is a very thoughtful approach that starts with connection to the consumer, product, engagement and then a way to reward her or thank her for being part of our loyal program.",
            "Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research",
            "So...",
            "Amie Preston - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Great. Thanks, Jan. Janet, go ahead.",
            "Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research",
            "Yeah, I just wanted to ask Jan, it seems she wants to be rewarded and that the discounting is really what drives the customer traffic. I'm just wondering. As the product continues to get better, and I do think it looks great, do you have confidence that that level of rewarding her or discounting and hits to margin can start to come in a bit?",
            "Jan Singer - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Yeah, I don't really think rewarding is just discounting, right. There are many ways to do it. Stuart mentioned, and Denise has proven, with PINK Nation, there are many ways to have a reward for your customers. Simple things like engagement with her, giving her early access to our fashion show online, content that she wants from us. We have many ways to reward the customer, so I think of rewarding in a much broader spectrum, but thank you for the question.",
            "Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research",
            "Thank you.",

            "Roxanne Meyer - MKM Partners LLC",
            "Great, and thanks for taking my question. My question is for Greg. I know that you launched Beauty at PINK, just wondering how you think about that business, how big is it now and how do you see the opportunity?",
            "And then just a follow-up on the wages and the workers, I know that you spent the last couple of years investing in your full-time workers. And I'm just wondering if you're satisfied with the balance of full-time versus part-time. Is that optimized? And are you getting the productivity out of that balance that you're looking for? Thanks a lot.",
            "Greg Unis - Victoria's Secret Stores LLC",
            "Yeah, thank you for the question. We're very excited about PINK. It relaunched in our stores at the beginning of February. We spent a lot of time connecting with our customer to evolve the assortment. We have a deep connection with the PINK customer through our campus reps, and so we spent a lot of time getting to know her and tailoring the assortment appropriately.",
            "The early reads are very strong. You can see it online and in our stores. Lots of excitement around it. We started in holiday in Q4 really going after PINK in a much bigger way with some key items that sold quite well, and were driving traffic into the store. So we're overall very pleased. It's very early days. And it's an underdeveloped business for us, we recognize, but see big opportunity in the future.",
            "Stuart B. Burgdoerfer - L Brands, Inc.",
            "Roxanne, it's Stuart. With respect to full-time and part-time complements and how we manage our sales force in stores, I would say, we've made progress on that opportunity. And with that said, it's complicated, as you can appreciate. Fundamentally, what we're trying to do whatever possible is try to have associates work more hours per week so that they're more familiar with the assortment, the business, the customer. That's pretty intuitive.",
            "With that said, we have a business that has different traffic patterns, five day a week and even within a given day. And so we know you've got a pretty variable traffic pattern that you also got to figure out how to deal with and optimize. So I'd say we've made progress. And the goal is to have people working as many hours as possible that make sense economically, because they'll have a better familiarity again with the store, the merchandise, the customer. And the other key initiative that we're focused on, which drives, in part, are changes on wages and benefits, as we're continuing to work on reducing turnover in our stores as well to have that more consistent knowledgeable sales force. Thanks.",

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Amie Preston, Chief Investor Relations Officer for L Brands. Please go ahead.",

As a matter of formality, I need to remind you that any forward-looking statements we may make today are subject to our safe harbor statement found in our SEC filings. Our first quarter earnings release, additional commentary and earnings presentation are available on our website, www.lb.com. ",

As you know, 2017 was a 53-week year. All of the sales dollars, margin and operating income results discussed on the call today are on a reported basis, which is the quarter ending May 5, '18, versus April 29, 2017. Comparable sales are on a comparable calendar period, so the quarter ending May 5 this year versus May 6, 2017. ",
            "Thanks. And now I'll turn the call over to Stuart.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter earnings per share of $0.17 were at the midpoint of our initial guidance of $0.15 to $0.20 per share and benefited from a favorable tax rate. Absent the impact of the lower-than-forecasted tax rate, we delivered an earnings per share result at the low end of our range. Operating income declined by 26%. Our performance was mixed. Growth in operating income at Bath & Body Works versus last year and our forecast was more than offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret. We're not satisfied with this result and are very focused on improving performance at Victoria's Secret. ",
            "In doing so, we have a number of assets to work with, as described in the commentary we released yesterday, including a strong brand, which continues to lead the lingerie category in market share; a large profitable store base, with nearly 400 million visits annually; a very profitable, rapidly growing direct channel; a large and growing customer file; speed and agility in our supply chain; and a talented leadership team. The 2016 strategic changes we made in Victoria's were significant, and we're still dealing with the impacts, particularly in negative store traffic trends and the resulting increase in promotional activity as we work to build the customer file. ",
            "We are confident in the strength of the brand and our ability to improve performance. But given the current trend of the business, we believe it is appropriate to take a more conservative view of the timing of the turnaround and have decreased our full year 2018 earnings guidance by $0.25 a share. ",
            "With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Denise.",
            "Denise Landman",
            "Thanks, Stuart. I'm going to share a brief overview of PINK's Q1 results and my thoughts about our outlook leading into Q2. Overall, PINK's Q1 comps were down low-single digits, driven by the early portion of the quarter, with performance improving late in the quarter due to strong customer acceptance of our go-forward assortment. Decline in swims, which is a non-go-forward category, had a distorted impact on our soft performance in the quarter. Bras and panties were about flat to last year. Bra performance was dominated by Wear Everywhere, sport and our Date bra relaunch. Panties were strong across all silhouettes and collections, driven by fashion and newness. ",
            "Apparel had areas of success and disappointment. Our sport apparel assortment was strong throughout the quarter, while early in the quarter, portions of our lounge top and bottom business mixed -- missed expectations. Despite the soft quarter, recent performance against our go-forward strategies give us confidence. We're encouraged by our most recent apparel floor set and our Date relaunch. In June, we will relaunch a new and improved Wear Everywhere bra. And the brand continues to focus on growing our customer file and operating our business with speed and agility. ",
            "Thank you very much, and I will turn it over to Jan.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Thanks, Denise. As you know and have read in the script, VSL had a record year in '15 and, in '16, made significant changes across the business. Those changes resulted in challenging performance and a loss of high-value dual-channel customers. And while we have made progress, we have much more work to do to deliver VSL growth and profitability. The plan to do that remains consistent and is centered around three things: knowing her, solving her choices of sexy through making great product; and serving her where she wants and when she wants.",
            "In terms of knowing her, we continue to put her at the center by engaging with millions of women in person in store as well as online through our social channels and in our customer care center. The insights we capture will help us empower making great product and serving her. In the product side, we said we would reset the business starting at the core with bras, and we have begun that work and are seeing some success with newness. We launched the Illusion bra, which is a significant incremental collection and has met or beat its plans since launch.",
            "It's the highest-AUR constructed bra, and it's margin accretive. We reset T-Shirt Bra by reducing the frame choices by half, improving the fit, and continue to see sales almost double from the original collection. We have taken price up twice since the launch due to demand and continue to watch that franchise closely. ",
            "In addition to bringing innovation, we've delivered fashion through new product introductions in Dream Angels, which is up double digits for the quarter with positive margin dollar contribution. All of these bras answer her desire for choice of lining levels, choice of fashion and a high focus on fit. These bras are bringing in new and younger customers, and we are already seeing her repeat purchase. ",
            "We're encouraged by this progress on bras. But again, we recognize it's not sufficient. We have a full pipeline in play, and we'll continue to evolve the business of bras, creating long-term profitable growth and new loyals. In panties, the total panty sales for the quarter are up mid-single-digit for the second consecutive quarter. The largest book of business in the 5 for panty has been reset, as we discussed last call. We reduced the number of fits by 50%, have delivered two quarters of double-digit top line and bottom line growth. And we're using the five for learnings to reset now the 3 for business using speed and agility as our offense. ",
            "In addition, adjacent categories are continuing to drive the momentum. Key adjacent categories are critical to deepening her experience and are creating new loyals to drive growth. Sleep and lounge is now a 12-month business, with casual sleep up high double digits for the quarter in sales and margin. Sport apparel has been reset and continues to grow mid-single digits and continues to bring new customers. Sport bra sales were softer in this quarter. We are now balancing the innovation of those bras with more fashion choices go forward. ",
            "Again, while I'm encouraged by the progress on product, I recognize there is more work to do to close the gap in top line, bottom line and customer file growth. In terms of serving her, we've continued to deepen the digital integration and investment into the brand for a seamless shopping experience, and the results have been proven positive. We're testing and evolving in-store experiences through the assortment and using a navigation that inspires and educates. We're reaching new customers through brand-accretive promotions and opportunities that connect with our girl. And we're increasing our reach and have tested and rolled a new magalog to existing, new and lapsed customers. We have seen a higher response rate to this piece, to the vehicle itself than our traditional CRM efforts. ",
            "We've increased our Angel Card acquisition in the quarter single digits and continue to build back high-value dual-channel customers. Our new leadership team is in place. It's a balanced team that's always on the offense every day, every week, every month and leveraging our agility, speed of decision-making. Again, I'm confident in our approach, our process and progress in resetting the brand. More work to do, and I expect process to deepen and our progress to continue as we move forward.",
            "Greg Unis",
            "Good morning. As you read in our prepared remarks, the Beauty business saw strong growth in Q1 with a positive double-digit sales comp. Q1 marks our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comps, which is an exciting trend for the Beauty business. Throughout the quarter, we saw strong growth from our declared priorities. In fragrance, our best set, we achieved double-digit growth fueled by the Bombshell franchise and fashion in our Mist Collection category. Specifically, we drove significant double-digit growth in the Bombshell franchise with the successful launches of Bombshell Seduction and our limited-edition fan favorite, Bombshell Summer. At the same time, core Bombshell, our #1 scent and one of the top fragrances in the country, had positive growth, growing the Bombshell franchise in total. ",
            "Fashion continues to resonate with our customers, driving significant growth in our Mist Collection category and also in our on-trend accessories. At the beginning of February, we relaunched the PINK beauty business. We are pleased with the initial results, which drove significant growth. We are chasing back into bestsellers and continue to stay close to the PINK customer as we plan for what's next. ",
            "Looking forward, we have an exciting lineup planned for Q2. In the spirit of continuing to focus on our best set, we will be relaunching one of our top scents with a new on-trend look and feel. We will continue to drive fashion and newness through Mist Collection, lip and accessories. We will bring the back-to-school season to life with new and exciting PINK beauty offerings. We are confident in our business model, our team and our continued growth and look forward to the quarter ahead. ",

            "Nicholas Coe",
            "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Just a few comments to build on the prepared remarks that we shared as part of the earnings release. I'm really encouraged that we continue to deliver solid results in the first quarter following a solid performance in Q4 2017. Sales grew 12%, and operating income grew by 21% in the period. We should also acknowledge that we were lapping a softer compare as sales were difficult in Q1 of last year. As described previously, we have seen sales momentum build by leveraging our read and react capabilities to chase into more of the seasonally relevant collections that our customers expect from us on a year-round basis. We applied some really important learnings from last year that have really helped our body care and our soap business get up to a strong start, and we continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of our home fragrance business. ",
            "Sales aside, the investment in wages announced in Q4 earnings release are only partially affecting our Q1 results, while a full impact to SG&A expenses will occur in Q2 and the balance of the year. Also, earnings in the first quarter did benefit from the timing shift in store remodels and new store openings, which was less impactful in Q1 but will put more pressure on buying and occupancy expense in Q2. As you all are aware, our online channel continues to experience very strong growth. And in support, we'll be making more significant investments in Q2 and the balance of the year. ",
            "Looking forward to the second quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic that we can continue to drive strong sales while also investing in long-term health and relevance of our brand. It goes without saying, we will continue to diligently manage inventory, expenses and our investments into the business as well as launching new and innovative products and ensuring our customers have a great experience in both the stores and the digital platforms.

            "Martin Waters",
            "Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everybody. As I look back on our international business performance for the first quarter at a high level, I'd make three observations. Firstly, the partner-based businesses are doing well, with good sales and operating income growth. Secondly, we continue to invest in China, which we believe will be a very significant market for us. VSBA stores and e-commerce are doing well. And the 7 full-assortment stores, 5 of which opened in the fourth quarter, are progressing about in line with our initial expectations. And thirdly, the U.K. business continues to be very challenged, and we have a lot of work to do there to fix it. ",
            "And overall, comps in all of our brands in the international segment were broadly in line with the patterns that we saw in North America. ",
            "In the balance of 2018, our priorities continue to be, firstly, continuing to scale in China, where we'll open another 10 full-assortment stores later this year; secondly, improving our performance in the U.K.; and finally, continuing to build on the success of our partner-owned stores around the world.

Well, we'll be selling down the remaining swim assortment this spring, exiting the spring season clean, and at this time, don't intend to continue in the swim category at PINK. So we'll have the most significant impact as we lap the spring '18 result in spring of '19. And our focus is -- just to be clear on that, is we believe that there is more significant growth in other categories in the business: bras, panties, loungewear, sport, beauty. And so that's really what drove the decision for the lingerie business back in 2016, and it's the underlying thought process as it relates to the PINK business as well. Thanks.",

With that said, is there ongoing dialogue from time to time out about the potential of bringing swim back per se? Yes, there is from time to time. But again, our energy is placed on growing our core categories and other adjacent categories, including lingerie, the loungewear business, sport in PINK and the beauty business as well. Thanks.",

Obviously, the brand is struggling to drive traffic to the stores, and you seemed to be basically leaning on promotions in order to stabilize that traffic number. So maybe you could just share your philosophy, would you rather promote and drive traffic, new customers into the brand and then ease off later on? Or what is the philosophical trade-off between driving traffic and margin erosion?",

And when we do that, we're seeing that build on our new customer acquisition. And our job now is to keep engaged with her, build a loyal and mover her up the funnel. So it's done at moments in time against certain books of business when we launch certain things, and it's done at moments in time that we know that she's shopping. So there is a strategy against it. It's related to her shopping patterns in addition to our product launches.",

When you think about the 500 and I think what you say 50 basis points of EBIT margin erosion since 2015 at Vicky's. How much of that has been merchandise margins, and how much has been deleveraging on the negative sales as you sort of think about where the cost savings are going to come from?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So Brian, both components, margin rate erosion and deleveraging the P&L, have been the drivers, and just both are significant. Don't need to get into the details of how much is one versus the other, but both are very significant. With respect to the first part of your question, we are looking at all costs and expenses. We've reduced our CapEx forecast to start with that. We're looking at our marketing programs. We're looking at our supply chain to drive efficiency in all elements of the supply chain. We're looking at other opportunities to improve operating income through expense reductions in other areas of the business that can benefit operating income. In terms of going through the specific details of all of that, the key message would be, we're looking at everything, and there are substantial plans in place to contribute to the operating income result. And I would highlight in particular efficiencies we're driving in the supply chain. Thanks.",

            "In the prepared remarks, you discussed building back into the high-spend customer segment at VS. Could you just expand on that a bit? I mean, I guess if you hindsight the last couple of years, how much of the pressure that you've seen at VS has been a result of lost customers versus lower spend per customer due to the exit of certain categories? And just any other insights you can share just regarding the changes in customer behavior at VS?",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Mark. We'll go to Jan.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Well, I think it's a combination of things as it always is when there are complex decisions that were taken. One of which is that we have customers that were involved in certain categories that we either exited or slowed down. And our job right now is to reconnect with her with the new merchandise that we have and also build in a new customer. The books of business that I mentioned in bras, for instance, the Illusion bra, Dream Angels and even the T-Shirt Bra, 50% of the time, that customer that's coming in is under 35 years old and is new to the box. When she comes in as new to the box is under 35. So we're encouraged by that because that builds our file back. And the job now is making sure that we move those customers up the funnel. We know that our loyals have a high propensity to visit us more often than those that are new. So it's in our best interest to keep that file, especially at the high-value dual channel, full and healthy. We have hired recently a new CMO who's very involved in transactional marketing and CRM and making sure that we have a more deep relationship with who she is, we share with her newness in the box, and we serve her. So we feel good about building that back.",

So in addition to the aggregate VS file, PINK has the opportunity to get a unique glimpse into its high-value customers through the lens of PINK Nation, where we are able to measure her affinity, number one, very important; and number two, spend level longitudinally. We have found great stability in that segment of our business. Therefore, little to no erosion seen. As recent changes have been made and reflected on by the exec team, these do not appear to be impacting PINK Nation population at the present time. Thank you.",

            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. Thanks, Paul. With respect to the margin rate, we would expect some further erosion in the second quarter and then a relatively flattish margin rate for both the third and the fourth quarter. So a little bit more pressure in Q2 and then a pretty steady result versus the prior year in the fall season. I'm speaking for the company in total. And that's a function of we're lapping softer numbers obviously, and some of the supply chain-related benefit that I discussed is assumed within that overall view.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks. And Martin?",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Yes. So as it relates to the U.K., the decline has been significant. As a reminder, it's in 3 areas. Firstly, the same pattern as we see in the domestic business. Secondly, I think you will have read about the very poor market that there is in the U.K., and we've certainly been exposed to that with reductions in traffic all across the U.K. And thirdly, there's an element of our own execution where we need to do much better. So no hiding from the fact that it's a very significant reduction in the U.K. You also asked about China and preopening costs there. So with 10 stores opening that are large stores, there is a very significant part of our investment that's related to that preopening. Our expectation is that it will reduce as we go forward into 2019, but that's largely dependent on the decision that we make about how many stores we'll open in 2019, 2020. And we won't be giving guidance on that until later in the year when we've got a better read on the business.",

            "Jan, I wanted to ask you a follow-up and maybe if you could elaborate a little bit more on your comments around losing that high-value dual-channel customer, I want to make sure I understand what specifically you mean. I think you're talking about an older customer, but maybe you could tell us some of your thoughts and insights on why you lost them and where they went and how you're going to get them back.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Thanks, Omar. There's a combination of things as there always is. I mean, the high-value dual channel customer, we look at age. And yes, some of them have been with us, and some of them have just left the brand by natural attrition. Some folks have left the brand due to the categories that we exited and the categories that we slowed down. And so we want to make sure that we bring in a new customer. And we're doing that quite aggressively, as you're seeing in some of our books that are working and the data I mentioned a second ago. So we're not slowing down in terms of reaching her, making sure we have products for her and bringing her in. And I am excited about the newness in bras like Illusion, which is our highest-AUR bra, and seeing new business come in through that, both younger customers, much younger, younger than we anticipated, and then seeing her come back in and shop the box or bringing in customers almost twice as many through our T-Shirt Bra but seeing her move up to Dream Angels. So we're already seeing that funnel start to fill and grow. It's really important that we engage her. And those things take time because having somebody return visit takes time. So I'm pretty excited about the beating of green shoots that are happening, but I recognize that we have a gap that we have to fill in that -- what I'd call file of our consumer file.",

So maybe talk about your confidence level in the recovery there. And how are you guys approaching the holiday compared to last year? Any color by brand would be very helpful.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So the fourth quarter assumption is between a low- and mid-single percentage increase in operating income, and that's now lapping several soft years in the fourth quarter. As you appreciate, it's the biggest quarter of the year by far. Our sales and margin assumptions, we believe, are reasonable. Certainly, the tax rate reduction does not have kind of an equal effect by quarter. And so we believe based on what we know at this time that the full year view is a reasonable view obviously. That's why we've put it out, and we think it reflects a reasonable pace of turnaround and trajectory of turnaround in the Victoria's Secret segment and the balance of the business. And again, it doesn't imply a heroic assumption with respect to sales and margins. So -- but we've got work to do, and it certainly reflects a change in trend but not a dramatic change in trend.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Stuart. And I mean, it's a little early to be talking about holiday in any great detail, but at a high level, we'll ask the CEOs to give a few thoughts about that. And I'll start with Nick.",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "I think if I think about last year, the biggest changes we made last year were really retooling an awful lot of the business from a product perspective. And the biggest impact from our learnings really came in Q4, and that manifested itself in our need to really chase back into some of the seasonal stuff that we weren't prepared to be in. So the opportunity this year obviously is we are prepared to be in those seasonal stories. And we literally saw the trajectory of our business change in the third or fourth week of October last year into a very positive arena. And that was driven by our ability to chase back into those things. So being able to plan for that ahead of time and know that that's something the customer really wants and very much demanded from us, we'll be in a much better position to service that particular piece of the business, which is extremely important to that time of year.",

            "Denise Landman",
            "Sure. In PINK, with respect to holiday, we typically experience a fairly significant distortion into our loungewear segment. As you followed brands reporting in recent earnings calls, you've heard commentary with respect to some softness in that sector. As we begin to regain momentum in the lounge sector, this is truly the accelerant that propels us forward into holiday, hopefully with increasing confidence. In addition, I have commented with respect to last holiday on the brand's ability to sustain performance in box, gifting and sleepwear, which is encouraging. So as the loungewear business finds its turnaround or inflection point, we're hoping to see a happier result in Q4. Thank you.",

            "Thanks, Amie. I would say in holiday, we have a lot of great hindsight from last year. We actually came into the season pretty strong, and we had some opportunity that we all know about in December. That has given us a great learning agenda that we've put into play for spring, particularly around the adjacent categories of sleep, lounge, sports and bras that are glamor bras. So we are a bit smarter on how to use our agility and our speed muscle. We're actually testing through that in the beginning of the year. Though you can never replicate Christmas, we know what levers we want to pull. And the other news that came up for us off-holiday in combination with Greg's business was around gifting. And I think continuing to distort gifting in the final weeks of holiday sounds obvious, but it's an effort for us to come together. And we're going to do it, and we're going to take that one to a new level this holiday as well. I'm encouraged by both earnings.",

Our penetration to the total box increases significantly, and so we're really focused on winning there. It's all about gifting and -- important there.

But around profitability in China, I think you lost around $50 million, $55 million last year. Can -- I know you don't know future years because it's dependent on store openings. But for this year, are you expecting those losses to widen or stabilize or come in a little bit better? And then, Stuart, real quick, in the remarks, you mentioned the BBW margins benefited from a timing shift of real estate costs into Q2. Can you just quantify that for us so we know how much of the margin to think about for Q2 when we model that out?",

That's about all I can tell you at this stage.",

We're happy about that. The tone and manner of that channel is evolving. And I make it my personal business at 4 a.m. to be reading each one of them, so I stay pretty close to social as the world is, and I feel good about the direction it's going in. In terms of segmentation, yes, high-fidelity segmentation, awareness of who she is, what she's buying, she's in our store, she's on our sites, we have that data, and then returning the conversation with her with content that will resonate. So it isn't a one-size-fits-all. It's not everybody gets everything all the time. But the high-fidelity nature of segmentation and conversation is the key for us to get into an engagement model that we know translates into loyalty.

I think it's beholden on the brand, to tell you the truth, in order to inappropriately service this age cohort to understand her social migration patterns as she brails the social landscape. There are distinctive differences between this generation and the generation that preceded it. And I would say we would be beholden to understand that. With respect to the e-com nuance associated with this generational shift, we are as well influencing our e-com experience in order to appropriately engage her with the speed and efficiency that she expects in order to have a satisfying brand experience.

The second bucket I would say is with pretty aggressive testing agenda to understand what, from a product perspective, that we haven't normally been in has attractive -- can we attract the younger customer with that. And then thirdly, with our remodels, we're genuinely seeing not only higher traffic but also a really healthy mix of younger traffic coming to the stores. And so not only do we get a nice return on our investment for those remodels, but we're also seeing a nice pattern in terms of traffic. And that's a nice mix of younger customers as well as our loyal customers. So that's really in those 3 buckets, how we're approaching it and making nice headway.",

And I'm just wondering sort of how to reconcile where you are in that process and if you think that there's an opportunity to pull back on some of that promotion or at what point you would be willing to pull back on promotion and let revenue decline.",

And that allows us over time to reduce the amount of promotion in the business. We're always going to end seasons clean with respect to inventory, so that's another balancing factor in all of it. But it's an equation -- not a literal equation. It's a balancing of 4 or 5 main factors, ultimately driving visits into the store, margin dollars and ensuring that we're driving trial in new items. And now over time, as we improve the merchandise or if we've got a key item that's doing really well, Jan mentioned a number of price-ups, we take price-ups where we can in any of the main parts of the business, whether it's Bath & Body, PINK, Beauty, Lingerie. So it's balancing a number of factors, again, I think as you recognize, ultimately looking to drive margin dollars in the business.",

            "Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro of The Retail Tracker.",
            "Marni Shapiro",
            "So rather than focus on VS like everyone, I thought I'd dog Nick a little bit. You guys have launched a lot of new products again. You did the same thing last spring. So I'm curious if you can talk a little bit about what you are seeing, as she comes into the store, what's working best because it feels like the launches this year are very distinct. You have some very strong fashion products that are driven by the look and -- look of the packaging. You have some cool modern packaging, and then you have a whole push on naturals and organics. So without giving away trade secrets, if you can just give us a little insight as to what your customer is leaning towards and what's working for BBW.",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "Thanks for the question. Let me see, where shall I start with this? I think at the core of our business, what we're seeing is a very nice trajectory in terms of comp. And that's really being driven by a healthy mix of, what is the loyal customer that knows us and knows us well, what is she looking for? And we stayed very close to her from that perspective, and I would say the core of the business is quite healthy. The other part of the comp or other part of the growth has really come from what you've just articulated, the newness that we've dropped that has certainly fallen into the healthy, good-for-you wellness bucket as well as some of the fashion ideas that we've launched that obviously drive traffic because at the end of the day, we do think of ourselves as a fashion brand, and we do try to make sure the front of the store reflects that. So to summarize that, I'd say a really healthy mix between, what is the core loyal customer looking for us that she knows and loves us for, and what have we been able to do with new introductions that have gained a healthy element of traction in the store? So I think the way you're seeing it is probably a fair indication of -- or a fair summary of what's happened.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.",
            "Dana Telsey",
            "Can you talk about of the magalog a little bit, the cost, the return on investment for the return to a magalog and how you're thinking about the magalog in terms of the overall marketing mix? And just lastly, on these store operations at Victoria's Secret, how is the progress on that going?",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Dana. We'll go to Jan.",
            "Jan Singer",
            "Thanks, Dana. I'm not going to get into the financial network and matrix of the magalog business model, but I'll tell you that what we did recognize is that we have a lot of great content, and we want to share that with a lot more people. So we're investing in the opportunity to develop a piece that she actually, we're finding, keeps around the house a little bit longer, has longer engagement, has had a higher response for us than the traditional CRM. So as the product continues to evolve and we have stories to tell and we have connections and information to share, we want to make sure that we're getting that information out to her as an existing customer as well as a new customer as well as a lapsed customer. So we feel really strong about the test that's happening. We're going to watch it, and we're going to calendar how many and how often go forward. Your second question was about store operations. I'm sorry, Dana, can you repeat it?",
            "Dana Telsey",
            "Yes. It's about the store operations of Victoria's Secret and how the changes are progressing.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Dana, I'll take a crack at it, and then Denise or Greg or Jan may want to add to it or -- the focus at Victoria's Secret is the same as it is, frankly, at Bath & Body Works. And first and foremost, it's to -- through effective engagement with store associates to deliver great experiences in stores. As you know, we increased our wage levels and enhanced our benefit programs, the purpose of which was to make sure that we were very competitive on that front to drive a more stable, lower-churning workforce. And so our primary focus is on ensuring that we've got the absolute best workforce in retail at Bath & Body, at Victoria's Secret, all aspects of the business with a particular focus on wages and benefits. And then apart from that, in terms of fundamentals around technology and scheduling and all kinds of things, we continue to do various things to improve the execution of our business. But it really starts and ends with the quality of our associates, their training, their capability and the stability of that workforce. And the whole business is focused on that. Thanks.",

            "Thanks, Stuart.",

            "Your next question comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities.",
            "Robert Drbul",
            "Just if I could do two quickly, I'm sorry. The first one is on the remodels for Bath & Body Works, where do you see that going in terms of how many stores do you feel like you need to touch at this point and over the longer-term time frame? And just a question on the Victoria's Secret brand in China is, with the fashion show, I guess can you just give us an update where you think the brand is from a marketing perspective in China at this point?",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Sure. We'll start with Nick.",
            "Nicholas Coe",
            "So I would say over the course of the next 3, 4 years, there's probably another 500 to 700 stores that we could get to, which would get us a total of about somewhere between 1,100, 1,200 stores in totality. And that's obviously dependent upon when were stores touched previous to the remodel that we've got, where are we on existing leases as we continue to have good flexibility with our real estate. So that's probably where we're headed. And we -- as I said earlier, we continue to be happy with the results that we're getting, but we also continue to monitor them very, very closely to make sure that they still make sense and that they're still working the way that we want them to work.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Nick. And Martin?",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Yes. So certainly, the fashion show is very good for our awareness building in China. We think that something in the order of 300 million people saw the fashion show last year either through TV or digital media or some other way. So we think we have a pretty high recognition of the brand, but what's less well understood is what the brand stands for and what role the brand can play in our customers' lives. So we certainly have work to do there. And the way that we're getting it there is principally through digital connections, so building our digital file, building the e-com channel rapidly. And as we start to open these additional stores in new cities, we'll be announcing the brand in a very important and aspirational way, not leave with the launch of a flagship store in Hong Kong, which will be the third of 3, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, as really important beacons for the brand. So certainly, high awareness and work to do on getting the equity of the brand in the marketplace.",

That said, we have not met our own expectations for overall performance and we are intensely focused on improving results. We have set guidance for 2019 that is pretty well-balanced for external purposes, that reflects current trends early in the year and assume improvement as we move through the year at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK.",
            "In addition to the ongoing owning of the business, I would want to highlight important decisions and events including the closure of Henri Bendel; the sale of La Senza; reducing our regular dividend by half to normalize the payout and free up funds to reduce our near-term debt levels; the appointment of Amy Hauk to run PINK and the hiring of John Mehas to lead Victoria's Secret Lingerie; the continued proactive and disciplined management of inventory expenses, real estate and capital structure; a heightened focus on the customer and our merchandise assortment at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK; and finally, an ongoing mindset of everything is on the table for review and change. Thanks.",

            "Susan Anderson",
            "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe just give some thoughts on the industry. Obviously, in terms of the intimate category, it's obviously been tough for some time not only in your business but we've seen the department stores struggled with their intimates departments.",
            "I guess I'm more curious on, are you seeing pricing pressure with new players popping up and I think being more price competitive? And then also we've seen -- and a lot of online players pop up and maybe not individually, are they taking market share? But when you kind of add them all up is it kind of making an impact on the industry and making it more difficult, I guess, to gain market share and maybe adding some pricing pressure?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks for the question, Susan. Our thoughts on the intimate apparel category are that it's a great category. I think the one observation reflection I would have on others entering the category is they're doing so because it's an attractive category. It's got the opportunity for differentiation. It inherently -- when it's intimate apparel versus underwear has emotional content. And from that a lot of economic value can be created for companies participants in the category. So we think it's a great category.",
            "In terms of recent developments, pricing pressure, commoditization, I mean, at the end of the day it comes back to the merchandise. If the merchandise is special, unique, reflects fashion, has newness, has technical benefit, there are terrific opportunities in the category. So we feel very good about the category. And, again, I would characterize the entrance of new participants frankly as a sign of that and that it's an attractive category. So with that said, are we meeting our expectations right now in the category? We're not. And we're obviously very focused on improving the trend of our business and John Mehas and Amie, particularly, most focused on improving the merchandise. So, overall, we think it's a great category. Thank you.",
            "Susan Anderson",
            "Thank you.",

            "Mark Altschwager",
            "Good morning. Thank you. Stuart, last quarter in the prepared remarks, it really discussed everything that you're looking at everything at VS. And today you've announced the plan, the 3% reduction in VS square footage, speaking up to basically about the improved assortments later in the year. Just curious if there's any additional actions being contemplated or bigger-picture changes on the brand positioning, marketing, plans, cost structure, that you can speak to today, just to give us a bit more perspective on the change that's happening within the brand.",
            "And then as a follow-up, specifically on the assortment, I'm wondering if you can help us contextualize what will be changing later in the year.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Well, in terms of the changed agenda at Victoria's Secret, as you I think are recognizing in the form of your question in our prepared remarks, the most important thing in our view is the merchandise. And, again, that's where John and Amie are spending and Greg, the substantial majority of their time as they should, the merchandise and that deep understanding of the customer. With that said, we have and will continue to review all significant aspects of the Victoria's Secret business whether that's how we market, how we sell online and in stores, the experience customers have in stores and online, the cost structure of the business, the real estate footprint and format of the business.",
            "And we've embarked on detailed review of all those things. Specifically on real estate, our store closure plans are heightened in 2018. And we pulled back on investing in new and remodeling -- new stores and the remodeling of stores substantially over the last several years. But truly everything is on the table. Amie has been in seat just since October and John's just a couple of weeks in. So you can appreciate that they want to make sure that they have a full appreciation of the situation before they make major changes.",
            "But with that said, they're very intensely engaged in the business and, again, most focused on the merchandise. But truly everything is on the table. And, for example, we did a deep review of all of our real estate in the fourth quarter, which solidified and gave rise to our plans about capital activity spending activity in 2019, and again, a more active closure plan for 2019 than we've seen in prior years. But truly everything is on the table with the dominant focus on the customer and on the merchandise. Thanks.",

            "Lauren Frasch",
            "Good morning. This is Lauren Frasch on for Ike. Wanting to ask how you're thinking about promotions this year. What's the plan as of today? And how you're thinking about AUR versus last year? And how should we think about your inventory positioning in 2019 at VS versus 12 months ago? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. Well, I'll start with a discussion of promotions at Bath & Body Works. So, -- that's a nice business. It's part of L Brands as you know, I'm sorry I tend to have a little bit of humor here. But that important part of our business was actually able to reduce promotional activity in 2018 and particularly, in the fourth quarter.",
            "So what really drives that promotional level in these businesses is the quality of the merchandise and the quality of running the business in a disciplined manner. And when we get that right compelling, fresh, merchandise promotional levels come down, AURs go up, margins are healthy, inventory turns are strong. And Bath & Body has a strong record of that and had incremental progress in 2018 in terms of reducing promotion.",
            "With respect to Victoria's Secret, the mindset or the thinking is the same which is when you get the merchandise more right than wrong; you're able to reduce promotion. As you can appreciate, substantial change in the assortment will occur more in the back half of 2019 than in the front half of 2019. So, we have been more promotional than we would like over the last several years through improvement in the merchandise assortment.",
            "With ongoing disciplined management of inventory, we would expect that we'll be able to reduce promotional levels as we move forward. But it's going to take a little bit of time. Hopefully, that answers your questions. Thanks.",
            "Lauren Frasch",
            "Great. Thank you, Stuart.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thank you. Next question.",

            "Your next question is from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.",
            "Kimberly Greenberger",
            "Great. Thank you so much. Good morning. My question's on Lingerie. I'm wondering if you can sort of look back over the last year and a half, Lingerie seemed to be gaining some momentum from new launches in the back half of 2017. And other than lapping the bralette business in the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018, it seemed like it had a little bit of momentum, driven largely by some of those new product introductions.",
            "And then in the back half of 2018, it seemed to backslide a little bit. Now, I'm wondering - Stuart, if you can correct my understanding if I'm not recapping it correctly. And I'm wondering if you've had time to look back and dig a little deeper into exactly what happened so that you can have at least some starting points for how to repair that business. Thank you so much.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. Thanks Kimberly. Thanks for the question. I think the thing that I would add to your framing of what occurred and you're asking for more insight, obviously, is some of our core franchises and particularly Body by Victoria had a deceleration in front, year-on-year pressure that got more significant as we moved through 2018, Kimberly.",
            "And that pressure in those core franchises again not limited to, but principally Body by Victoria is really what drove the further pressure as we moved through 2018. And what that comes back to is innovation. Everything's got a life cycle. And as one gets later in life cycles you got to innovate and update and create differentiation.",
            "And we got a bit behind on that in some of these core bra franchises. And you can be sure that, John and the team there are intensely focused on that very question and that big opportunity, frankly. And that's going to be a big -- is a big priority as we move to 2019.",
            "But in terms of what drove the change in performance, it is that deceleration and some big books of business that were, what I'd call, core sub-brands that have existed for a long time that weren't sufficiently updated with fashion or innovation to continue their strength.",
            "Kimberly Greenberger",
            "Thanks so much.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Kimberly. Next question please.",

            "Kate Fitzsimmons",
            "Yes, hi. Good morning. I was wondering if we can dig in a bit more into the marketing side of the equation at VS. Could you just speak to any of the work you were doing to reexamine how you're communicating with the customer on the brand position?",
            "What were some of the learnings last year as you have evolved the positioning to more of a self-empowerment me-day versus V-day angle for example? And what's the view on how that's evolving this year? And how do you see the fashion show fitting into all of that? Thank you. ",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. Well as we've tried to be clear about, we are taking a fresh hard look at everything in the business. So that would be the first point to register. The second thing, I would just articulate is that the dominant focus is understanding the customer and making significant improvement to the merchandise assortment.",
            "And we've taken a fresh look at all of the marketing. We don't have any specific announcements about the fashion show. We don't typically make announcements about the fashion show at this time of year, but we're looking at all aspects of the marketing of the business.",
            "And John's heavily involved in that as our other leaders in the business. And we're spending a lot of time taking a fresh hard look at all those things. And there'll be more to report as we move through 2019, but we don't normally comment on the fashion show at this time of year. But we're taking a fresh hard look at everything.",
            "Kate Fitzsimmons",
            "Great. And then if I could just follow up with one quick question on the first quarter guidance negative low-single digits. Could you speak to February trends thus far? And I guess how should we contextualize that with the thought that swim is launching next month and also inventories are clean?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So February has been a little choppy because of what we believe to be some effect from tax refund timing. I think that's well understood and being written about otherwise. But we're not going to comment specifically on February as -- beyond that.",
            "As we highlighted in our circulated commentary, we are going to move to a quarterly reporting of sales and results based on feedback from shareholders trying to minimize the noise and often misinterpretation of results based on calendar shifts and holidays and year-on-year promotional changes. And we've -- we laid out the key assumptions for our Q1 results. So -- but February has been a little choppy, because of the timing of tax refunds. Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks. Next question, please.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from the line of Jamie Merriman with Bernstein.",
            "Jamie Merriman",
            "Thanks. Thanks very much. Just two quick ones from me. The first one is, can you just talk a little bit about your process for identifying the stores to close? What do you expect the financial impact of those closures to be? And is this just the first wave in terms of what you would expect over the next few years? And then second is, I think, in the past you talked about re-launching digital for Victoria's Secret this year. Is that still on track? And when would that happen? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "What's the last part of your question?",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Re-launching digital.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. Okay. So on store closures, like, how do we go about it and so on. You asked is this the first wave and I'd -- I'm saying this was a little bit of intended humor. It's an important subject you're asking about. I actually would assert that this is about our 50th wave. And what I mean by that is, we close stores every year. So that's an ongoing part of running the business.",
            "How we go about it is we look at current and projected performance, sales, profit, cash flow. We look at trade area dynamics and how store openings and closings affect nearby stores and to a lesser extent, our online business. And based on those historic and projected results, not just for the store in question, but for nearby stores, we make judgments about what the projected sales profit cash flow results would be, also in relation to what it may cost to exit a store. And based on those criteria, we close stores. And in fact, we close stores every year, at Bath & Body Works and at Victoria's. And we also open stores every year.",
            "We are closing more stores in -- we did in 2018 and expected in 2019, based on the overall performance of the Victoria's Secret business, not meeting our expectations or having year-on-year declines. But that's how we go about it. It's detailed. It's rigorous. It's fact-based. And again, the result is, we're closing more stores at Victoria's than we have over the last few years.",
            "But again, I wouldn't want you to think that we do it in waves. It's an ongoing part of a good multi-unit business. Whether it's a restaurant business or a retail business, it's a good ongoing part of the running of the business.",
            "We have a lot of flexibility in our real estate terms. So for those malls that are the most vulnerable malls, we have a lot of opportunity to exit those situations with no -- at no cost or with very little cost. So we've got a lot of flexibility. And on an overall basis, our real estate portfolio is in pretty good shape.",
            "Do we have some opportunities? We do. We recognized an impairment cost in our results this year. But on an overall basis, our real estate's in good shape. And that's because it is very actively managed as an ongoing part of the running of the business.",
            "With respect to re-launching the Victoria's website, I think, that was your question. We have been working on that over the last several years. The project is in good shape. We are currently doing testing of the new online platform, a live testing, and expect to go live broadly on that conversion in probably April. But again, it will be a function of testing, which, at this point, is going well, but likely to do the cutover roundly in the April timeframe. And we will have the ability to revert back to the legacy system, if we have any challenges as we cutover.",
            "But that project's in good shape and will create capability for us -- capabilities for us to do a lot of things that we're very enthused about doing over the next year or two in terms of consumer-facing customer-facing things that many others do today that -- than we will be able to do. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Guys, just a reminder, one question, please. We've got a lot of folks in the queue. So next question.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi Research.",
            "Paul Lejuez",
            "Hey, thanks, guys. Just regarding everything being on the table, I'm curious, if we've already seen the big changes whether swim store closures that we're talking about today. Are there still bigger things to come related to the Victoria's Secret brand in your view? And I'm curious, what are some of the big things that have already been considered and maybe shut down or shot down? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. It will be dynamic Paul, as it should be. So we'll learn more as time goes by, but we're not constrained in our thinking or in the options that could be considered or should be considered. And we're trying to make the best decisions possible in the running of the business starting with the customer mindset.",
            "Obviously a mindset about producing the appropriate financial results for the business and for the shareholders of the business. But we aren't constrained and we're trying to use our best judgment which certainly isn't perfect, there's no such thing, but pretty reasonable judgment.",
            "And our dominant focus has been clear through my remarks already this morning and through the script, the dominant focus is on the merchandise. With that said, we have and we will continue to take a hard look at everything. And we'll report along the way. But there are no constraints. We're not financially constrained.",
            "And we've got a lot of different things that we have and can consider. But I think it's also important to be very clear that our dominant focus; John's, Amie's, Greg's is on the customer and on the merchandise because that's what matters most. Thanks.",
            "Paul Lejuez",
            "All right. And you're considering how to change. But have you thought about how you're definitely not going to change in any way? Like -- or you said things that have been already maybe shot down?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "There are truly, Paul. And it -- we know each other pretty well. Those who are not listening to the call may not know that, but we've worked together for a while. I mean there are no constraints, Paul. None. The only constraint is, what's the right thing? There are the constraints of law, right? What's legal or not right? But apart from what's legal or not, we're not constrained. What's relevant to a customer, that's an important consideration, obviously? But otherwise we're not constrained.",
            "Paul Lejuez",
            "Thank you. Good luck.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Paul. Next question.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from the line of Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs.",
            "Alexandra Walvis",
            "Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Our question is on the comp guide for the business, the comps of low single digits. I wonder if you could give us some color on how you're expecting that to parse out between the two businesses. In particular we're interested in Bath & Body Works and what's giving you the confidence that that business can continue to comp against what are some slightly tougher compares as we go into next year.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. The most important thing in the guidance is the assumed progress for Victoria's as we move through the year. That's the most important judgment or the most important assumption in the 2019 guidance. And this is summarizing, but in terms of trying to headline it in the early part of the year, we're assuming comps and margin dollar results for Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, particularly that are generally in line with the most recent trends and then we're assuming improvement as we move through the year. That's the most important assumption.",
            "Separately, you're asking about can Bath & Body lap tough numbers and to what extent. Bath & Body is a very well-led business. It's in a very strong category of retailing in terms of Personal Care and Beauty. And we believe it's reasonable that they can continue their success.",
            "Are we expecting the same degree fully ultimately in our operating income, the same degree of success in 2019 in OI dollars as they produced in 2018? No, there's a little bit of moderation in the OI dollar results. But we have confidence that that business can continue to perform well. It's very well-led. It's in a very good category of retailing. They've got good current results.",
            "So, we think we've made reasonable assumptions with respect to Bath & Body Works. It won't be easy by any stretch, but it's a very well-led business and a great category retailing. And the recent results have been very good. The more fundamental assumption is the degree and rate of improvement for Lingerie and PINK. And we've tried to deal with that appropriately. But as you can appreciate that's a hard judgment to make. Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Alex. Next question.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.",
            "Dana Telsey",
            "Good morning everyone. As you think about the international business, how are you planning investments in international and expectations for international in 2019 as compared to 2018? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So, Dana, good morning. First of all there are multiple components of the international business as you can appreciate. So, in terms of how we think about investment and I would describe this first through the combination of our own company-owned businesses and then also the franchise and partner-owned businesses, we expect to grow the store count meaningfully in the international business in 2019 roundly opening between company-owned and partner-owned stores between 100 and say 120 stores. So, that's good growth.",
            "We'll also -- as we do in our company-owned business in North America, we'll continue to close stores either based on lease expiration or as we open full assortment stores in nearby geography.",
            "But good growth in terms of store count for international. It is skewed towards the partner-owned businesses because we're moderating our growth at this stage for China and we're not adding stores in the U.K. But good strong store base growth for the international business in total again roundly between 100 and 120 stores and an ongoing growth in the digital part of that business as well the online part of that business.",
            "So, we think a good growth profile overall with an adjustment in growth in China as we learn more about the appropriate store size and format there, but strong growth online in China as well in 2019. In the U.K., right now the opportunity is to drive more sales through the existing store footprint that we have. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Dana. Next question.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from the line of Roxanne Meyer with MKM Partners.",
            "Roxanne Meyer",
            "Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on Victoria's Secret Beauty. It had a pretty strong comp in the fourth quarter mid-single digits. But you did call out that it didn't meet expectations and perhaps it was more promotional. So just looking for some hindsighting on Beauty and how you're thinking about it in 2019. Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. Beauty had a -- as you mentioned Roxanne in your question, Beauty had a solid 2018 and was somewhat stronger in the first part of the year than in the fourth quarter. And the opportunity for further improvement in that business is particularly focused on the prestige fragrance part of that business.",
            "And Greg is very focused on that. He and his team are very capable. And the differential growth opportunity or the hindsight from 2018 that's particularly shaping the agenda for 2019 is to really -- to have more success in the pursuit of the prestige business.",
            "With that said, I think, by last count, we've got four of the top 20 fragrances -- perfume fragrances sold, either globally or in the United States. So we're starting from a strong base. And probably most people don't know that we have four of the top 20. So it's a good strong business with good margin profile. But in terms of growth opportunity, we see the opportunity to accelerate growth in -- particularly in that part of the business. Thanks.",
            "Roxanne Meyer",
            "Great. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",

            "Your next question is from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.",
            "Marni Shapiro",
            "Hey, everybody. Just dovetailing actually a little bit on what Roxanne asked, a different segment, though. Could you give as an update on Victoria's Secret Sport? It's been a little up and down and you've used it as a promotional vehicle to drive traffic. I guess, what's the thinking there today? And what should we expect going forward from that part of the brand?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. Thanks, Marni. So in the spirit of everything is on the table, John is taking a fresh -- fresh look at that part of the business, obviously, at leisure. And sport is a key category of apparel retail. And intimate apparent sport bras are an important part of that segment. But what I'm confident about is that John will take a fresh hard look at it. We don't have anything further to announce about it today, but it's an important segment. And I know John will be taking a fresh hard look at it.",
            "Marni Shapiro",
            "All right. Great.",

            "Paul Trussell",
            "Good morning and thank you. I wanted to just maybe get a few more details around the puts and takes on margins. Stuart, you mentioned that -- continue to have incremental promotions at VS to maybe start the year at least that's the expectation in the 1Q guide.",
            "Just help us maybe understand what you see as the opportunity to get some stabilization there or any other initiatives that will improve the rate of gross margin as the year progresses. And at the same on SG&A, what are the puts and takes here that are leading to the guidance of just an increase of low single digits? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks Paul. So the opportunity in margin rate at Victoria's Lingerie PINK and Beauty is a very substantial one. And we won't get all of that opportunity in 2019, but we would expect to make progress as we go through the year.",
            "But just to mention the opportunity versus the record year of 2015, we're in the order of five or six percentage points versus 2015. So there's a very substantial opportunity. Am I from that comment suggesting we're going to get all of that in 2019? I am not.",
            "But through the focus on the customer and the focus on merchandise with ongoing disciplined management of inventories, there is a very substantial opportunity for margin in this business. And it starts and ends with that customer understanding and that strong management on the merchandise assortment.",
            "So that's the big-picture answer to your question or in my view the most important answer to your question. As we improve the merchandise assortment, as we move through 2019 we would expect to see some improvement in year-on-year result on margin rate. But really that's how I would address the question, very substantial opportunity. Thanks Paul.",

            "Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter earnings per share of $0.14 were above our initial guidance of about breakeven, principally driven by a strong performance at Bath & Body Works and some favorability in income taxes. Performance at Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, PINK, Victoria’s Secret Beauty, and International were largely in line with our forecast.",
            "Our performance continues to be mixed. Substantial growth in operating income at Bath & Body Works and an improvement in the other segment as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henri Bendel was offset by a decline at Victoria’s Secret.",
            "Turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2019. At Bath & Body Works and aligned, experienced leadership team, and strong customer response to our merchandise assortments are contributing to another solid year. We also remain highly focused on improving performance in the Victoria's Secret and PINK businesses. John Mehas and Amy Hauk, CEOs at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK respectively are focused on getting closer to our customers and improving our merchandise assortments.",
            "We look forward to our assortments benefiting from their input beginning in the fall season and our earnings guidance assumes gradual improvement in the Victoria's Secret segment performance as we move through the remainder of 2019. You'll hear more from John and Amy as well as other business leaders at our Investor Day which is scheduled for September 10.",

            "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.",
            "Paul Trussell",
            "Hey, good morning. Could we just touch on Victoria's Secret in terms of kind of maybe where you saw some green shoots in the first quarter, and just give us a better sense of what you expect in the second quarter, and clearly the guidance does still suggest some real improvement in the second half?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure Paul. So in terms of where we see strong consumer response and what we're focused on is where we're delivering significant fashion and elevation in the assortment, and it's a big focus for us, and that's where we're seeing the strongest consumer response. The Incredible Bra launch did well, but as a general theme it's where we have fashion that resonates with the consumer and again John is particularly focused on that and jumped right in. Frankly, he has been with our business now 13 weeks and hit the ground running in a very good and intense way in the business and is very busy at work to impact fall assortments.",
            "But again, for lingerie, it's about delivering compelling fashion in the major categories of bras, panties, and sleep and loungewear. In the PINK business, strong performance in intimates and a good volume result in sport bras, particularly in again the intimate side of the business with very strong value for the consumer, and that business PINK is focused on really continuing to advance the assortment in bras and panties and is doing important work to reposition the apparel assortments as well but has a real advantage in the bra and panties side of the business.",
            "And then for Victoria's Secret Beauty, this business continues to do well and where the business had good fashion in the better priced, higher priced fragrance business got strong consumer response. So as has been the case for us for a long, long time and the same idea applies to Bath & Body Works and in our history, when we're delivering strong fashion, differentiated merchandise with emotional content, the consumer responds in a good way and we get healthy margins, we get unit volume, we get AUR opportunity, and we get the results.",
            "So that's what the Victoria's leaders, John, Amy, and Greg are focused on, and frankly the same for the team at Bath & Body Works. When we do it well, we get paid and when we're after market or off the mark or our assortments get too basic that's when we tend to have trouble. Thanks Paul.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks Paul. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.",
            "Ike Boruchow",
            "Hey, good morning everyone. Congrats on the stability. I guess, Stuart, just a high level question for you, there was some news that kind of came out, I think a week or two ago about potentially re-evaluating fashion show and being on TV. I guess when you think about VS right now, how much of the changes should be more strategic in terms of merchandising versus kind of more substantial changes meaning changing the marketing approach, evolving the brand, may be looking at the international business and owned versus partner businesses in your flagship stores? I'm just trying to understand what could be - your Analyst Day has been announced for September, what could we possibly looking forward to hear from you guys then?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, so thanks Ike for the question and your research on the business. We've said pretty consistently now for probably around six or nine months, certainly six months that everything is on the table with respect to the valuation of the Victoria's Secret business, and that wasn't just a throwaway phrase that was [indiscernible]. We are taking a fresh hard look at all aspects of the business and that's not a one-time exercise. It will be an ongoing exercise and starts from the place that - the ultimate profit results, economic results of the business is not consistent with our expectations or the potential of the business, and thus you get into a mindset, we're in a mindset of truly looking at everything, and again not a one-time exercise.",
            "As Amy and John, particularly have come into the business, but Greg's done the same thing. It really does start, and it's not limited to, but it starts with fundamentally the merchandise that you're selling. And as I mentioned in the quick comment on the first question on this call, Amy is very intensely focused on understanding that target customer and reworking the assortments at PINK and John again now 13 weeks in has truly hit the ground running and is bringing to our situation a lot of great experience that he had in his prior retail life.",
            "And so, we're very focused obviously on the merchandise, and as registered in our pre-circulated comments that impact showing up in the most clear way beginning in the fall season and it will get more significant as we move through the fall season, but that is tangible and real. From that, we're taking a hard look at lots of other stuff. We closed more stores or announced plans to close more stores, have closed more stores to rightsize square footage in 2019 than we had historically as an example of taking up a hard, fresh look at things. And by the way the business also continues to invest in real estate and open stores where it makes sense, particularly at Bath & Body Works, but also internationally.",
            "As it relates to marketing, Ike in the fashion show at the end of the day as part of that fresh hard review of everything we're taking a hard look at the best ways to reinforce the equities and the strengths of the Victoria's business and make appropriate adjustment to the positioning of the business and then in concert with the changes in merchandise how do we most effectively market those changes. And that work as you would appreciate is in process. When we have specific things to share publicly, we will, in some cases we'll do that right as consumers are experiencing it, competitive reasons that you would understand, but there's active work going on with respect to how the business is marketed, as indicated by our announcement recently about reevaluation of the fashion show.",
            "So everything is on the table. Certainly you mentioned international and how we're looking at that business. There are no constraints, only time frame. You would understand that in that evaluation, one has to think about lease terms and lease flexibility and those kinds of things, but we're in a position where everything is on the table. Les Wexner has always led with that mindset, that it is always about looking forward and about change, and on an overall basis, certainly he's navigated and led that well over a long, long time in specialty retail, and we're very focused on it as a management team. Thanks Ike.",

            "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could maybe give some more color on the gross margin as we go throughout the year, I know you are expecting growth in merch down for the year, but I guess are you expecting any improvement at all as we go into the back half and some of the new product flows in and then just the drivers?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Hi Susan, good morning. Thanks for the question. The simplest way to answer your question is we are expecting improvement in merchandise margin. You will remember as we report, gross margin includes buying and occupancy costs, but we would expect, I trust you are asking about the Victoria's business, but for Lingerie, PINK, and Beauty, we would expect an improvement in merchandise margin, rate, and a dollar result as we move through the year sequentially. That was our view going into the year, it remains our view, and it's a function of the work that John, Amy, and Greg continue to do on the merchandise assortment. So, that is our expectation that we’ll see sequential improvement as we move through the quarter. Thanks.",

            "Mark Altschwager",
            "Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If I could just follow-up there Stuart on the margin front, so there was a comment in the prepared remarks about the VS Q1 operating margin still benefiting from last year's credit and sourcing actions. So, and then you're going to begin to lap that I think going through the remainder of the year. So, a number of crosscurrents here, you mentioned you would expect merchandise margin to improve throughout the year, but as we lap some of those other benefits, and then it sounds like maybe we're baking in some incremental tariff headwinds, just how should we think about the EBIT margin rate progression through the year for Victoria's Secret relative to that 300 basis point decline in Q1?",
            "And then kind of as a follow-up clearly some greater divergence this year with the investment plans at Victoria's Secret versus BBW. I was hoping you could help us understand the run rate of buying and occupancy growth at each of these concepts so we can have a better understanding of the leverage points today?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, so thanks Mark. On the progression of margin rates and EBIT rates as we move through the year, while there are puts and takes including some benefit that we got from our proprietary credit card and some sourcing related benefits that we got last year and into the first quarter this year, despite those puts and takes, we would expect progression and improvement sequentially in margin rates and the operating income result in the Victoria's business as we move through the year. Again, even despite the callouts that we had in the prepared remarks and including the pressure from the list three tariff move from 10% to 25%.",
            "With respect to buying and occupancy, dollar increases or percent growth and sales growth needed to drive leverage in the Bath & Body business driven by the ongoing and we think a very healthy and appropriate investment in store remodels and some pressure related to continued mix shift towards direct, again Bath & Body is having the great outcome of growing sales in stores and online, but online is growing at a faster rate in the P&L architecture that penetration growth for direct in BBW in addition to the pressure related to real estate, results in a sales growth to leverage P&L in the high single or low double range depending upon the time period, again driven by the two factors I just mentioned.",
            "The direct business as an aside is a very healthy profit business for BBW and VS for that matter, but that growth rate outstripping the total growth rate drives some geography change in that P&L. And then for Victoria's driven by the lack of growth in square footage and our pull back on investment, the breakpoint or the leverage point for sales at VS is flat or even a little less than flat in 2019. Thanks.",

            "Thanks. Next question please?",
            "Operator",
            "Your question comes from the line of Jamie Merriman with Bernstein.",
            "Jamie Merriman",
            "Thanks, very much. The first question is just on digital at Victoria's Secret, I think and you talked in the past and in the release today about the set up investment and I think there's still a relaunch coming this year, can you just confirm that and talk about what that will encompass and when it is coming, that will be great?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, so we went live in the first quarter with a new technology platform for VictoriasSecret.com and that was a result of more than a year's work and a substantial IT project to re-platform that website. So that is a new base platform and was a very significant technology project and I'm knocking on wood or hard surface anyway, but it is up and running and there hasn't been any significant adverse sort of startup issues related to that and that's a big deal. And that new platform will enable us to do a lot of things now.",
            "We need to make further investment to do those things, such as buy online pick up in store, but another key input to achieving that consumer outcome will be the RFID project that's underway for Victoria's Secret, and it's critical that we have very good information about our specific inventories and we have broad assortments at Victoria's particularly in the bra category and so we want to make sure that we have accurate information and are at this RFID project and mentioning will help enable a buy online pick up in store project that will likely get out in 2020 after we do the RFID work this year.",
            "We are making further investments in the digital business beyond the platform including rolling that new platform to the international side of our business and continue to enhance the consumer experience. And then we are also making significant investment in digital fulfillment capacity for Victoria's and while outsourced we're adding a lot of capacity for the Bath & Body side of the business as well given the growth and further potential in that business. So a lot going on, a lot of investment happening related to the online business, which again as you know, is now running at 2.4 billion to 2.5 billion for L Brands growing at a very healthy rate on an overall basis and highly profitable. Thank you.",

            "Jay Sole",
            "Great, thanks so much. Stuart, you know what, just asking another question just about margins at Victoria's Secret, from a big picture perspective, the company has done a great job cutting costs, imagine sends a heavy bundle, but you know the Victoria's Secret North America is still doing over 7 billion in sales like but the obviously the margins have come down, what's the opportunity if you want to look at more cost cuts, not necessarily closing stores, but just more efficiencies to overall improve the margin, what might those be?",
            "And then also can you just talk about the path to profitability in China? You made some comments in the prepared remarks about that business getting a little bit better, can you just tell us where it stands today and what you see going forward?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, so with respect to the Victoria's business and managing the expense side of the business, just working down the P&L and talking about the biggest categories of expense, again beyond getting margin rates where they had been, again the biggest cause of decline, profit rate and profit dollar decline at Victoria's has been erosion of margin rates, merchandise margin rates to be specific, and that's about pricing and promotion, and having merchandise with emotional content.",
            "But that wasn't your question, you are asking about expense side of the business, so moving down the P&L the biggest variable expense we have is store payroll and we believe that it's important to have appropriate coverage of square footage and of traffic volumes to drive the selling opportunity that exists in our stores. We also believe it's important to pay our associates, we have upstanding teams at a competitive level to ensure that we can attract and retain appropriately skilled store associates and we've gotten a lot of them, given the selling opportunity in the business, but so, with respect to store payroll, not a lot of opportunity on a rate basis for reduction.",
            "With respect to occupancy costs, obviously the action that one can take there are two major things that one can do beyond driving sales volume. One is to adjust investment in remodel activity or new stores and we've done that. We’ve dramatically reduced almost to nil the investment levels at Victoria's Secret given the current state of performance. And as leases roll off or where there's opportunity to close stores and again we closed more stores this year than we had and probably the factor of between 2x and 3 x we had done previously, so that’s the other action that one can take.",
            "And then there are two other big categories of expense to consider and we have, one is the marketing investment in the business to drive sales. Generally people invest in marketing because they believe it does drive topline growth which is obviously important to any business. But we have heavily scrutinized the marketing spend at Victoria's and over the last 9 to 12 months particularly, we’ve taken meaningful dollars out of the marketing spend at Victoria's.",
            "And then lastly is the home office spending in the business and in connection with all the changes that were made in the business in 2016, the business let go in round numbers about 300 people and made a substantial reduction in the home office workforce at that time. And we've tried to manage any growth since that time. But all the expenses are being evaluated, they have been evaluated, and we’ve taken significant action on those expenses at Victoria’s. But the biggest opportunity is about topline growth at a healthy margin rate and then we would get reasonable leverage on the expense lines.",
            "With respect to China, in terms of improving the profitability there, it will be volume in existing stores, volume related to new store activity which we have planned in 2019, and then a continued focus on consistent with your earlier question a continued focus on the expense levels in that business to make sure that we’re getting appropriate return on the various forms of expense structure in the China business. But it is largely a volume story in China to get to the profit we expect. Thanks.",

            "Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.",
            "Kimberly Greenberger",
            "Great, thank you so much. Good morning. Stuart, my question is on PINK. I'm wondering if you could just remind us what the mix is between intimate apparel and loungewear at PINK, is it 50-50, 60-40? And then, are there any initial thoughts that you can share from Amy about what is not working in apparel? And then with regard to the swim elimination, I think there was a 5% hit here in the first quarter, how should we think about the elimination of when in the peak business that a reintroduction at the Victoria’s Secret Lingerie business and is there any thought to bring swim back ? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, thanks Kimberly. So, the first question was about the mix - merchandise mix between intimates and apparel and at present it’s about 50-50, so bras and panties together are about 50% and the balance of the business largely apparel about 50%.",
            "As I mentioned in an earlier comment, we believe we have our greatest competitive advantage and strong attributes around customer or consumer loyalty in the intimate apparel business and so it's our intention Amy's intention, Les' intention, the team's intention to grow the intimate business faster than the apparel business. So I would expect that that mix of about 50-50 will skew to intimates being obviously greater than 50% over the next year or two, that's our focus for the reasons I mentioned.",
            "With respect to the apparel part of the business and Amy will comment on all of this on September 10, when we have our time together. She's relooking at all of it, in terms of price points, good-better-best opportunities, fabric and fabrication, surface design, various logo treatments, et cetera, she's looking at all of it, testing a lot of things, seeing some positive consumer reaction to some of the things that have been tested and as we've mentioned consistently and Kimberly you are familiar with one of the additional advantages that PINK has in its operating model it’s business model are short lead times and a mindset around speed and agility so they are chasing hard.",
            "I’m not going to sit here and tell you that she's got all the answers because she doesn’t, but she’s working and seeing some working very actively and applying the BBW and other retail playbook to this business. And we’re encouraged based on what we’re seeing, but the result of her work will show up most in the fall season. You know that we've got campus reps, that we have very active dialogue with, and she’s certainly making good use of that resource and ensuring that that resource is truly telling us what we need to hear, and I think they are. So, a lot going on and we’re optimistic that certainly as we move through the year and particularly in the fall season that it will stabilize and then get back to positive growth sales and margin in PINK.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Swim?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Oh, thank you. Swim, you mentioned that we’ve gotten back into that category in large part due to third-party brands and with respect to PINK, I would say anything's possible Kimberly. There is some what we call Gym-to-Swim offering in the assortment now, where at leisure tops and bottoms that would be suitable in terms of their style and so on would be suitable for use in that occasion or as part of her life in that way. They are offered today, it's a small offering, but there's an open-mindedness to it, but it won't be a key thing for the balance of this year but we'll see how it progresses as we move into the following year. Thanks.",

            "Your question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.",
            "Oliver Chen",
            "Hi, thank you. We had questions related to the innovation that you see ahead at VS. Some of the survey work we've done around customers does point to fit as well as comfort being issues of the customer segmentation across the store, I would love your thoughts on that and what you think may happen as you continue to evolve the brand and add more emotional content?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Well the first thought I have Oliver and thanks for the question, and I read your report with interest. The first thing I would say is that the subjects that you researched and wrote about are, - is what John and his team are most focused on, which is how to evolve the assortment to ensure that the merchandise offering best addresses her needs. As you know from all the consumer work you do, sometimes she's able to clearly express what she’s looking for and there other times where you know, a leading consumer brand and we have are examples of this is able to drive the market through our own innovation and again that's what you're asking about.",
            "We believe that there is a very significant opportunity with respect to fashion, with respect to an elevation of the merchandise, with respect to not selling as much what we would call commodity or commonly available merchandise in the bra, panty and sleep and loungewear categories and based on early work, but substantial work, John is on it and has a very strong point of view that makes a lot of intuitive sense.",
            "We've done a lot of consumer research over the years as you would expect us to. It’s inherent in running a business and certainly the attributes around comfort and other things that you mentioned in your report we understand well, and believe that we have leadership positions in many of those attributes or those characteristics that consumers are looking for. But John is on it, he brings good experience, his team is on it with him, he's leading, he’s got a clear point of view and substantial changes to the assortment are coming. You'll see that beginning in August, John will be with investors, with the balance of the team on the 10 September to more fully articulate his assessment and his game plan. And we've got strong reasons for optimism about the progression in 2019 for the Lingerie business. Thank you, Oliver.",
            "Oliver Chen",
            "Thank you. Stuart, there was one other follow-up on the store and customer feedback about customer service as well as thinking about navigation in the store. I know you've done a lot of work in the past with conversion as well as testing, optimizing service in the past, but if you could brief us on that opportunity it seems like an important opportunity going forward as well. Thanks, best regards.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thank you, Oliver. So, we agree that there is opportunity to make the store more easily understood and navigated, and to further strengthen the interactions between our associates and customers. And as part of what John and the team and Amy and her team are focused on it includes, Oliver, more easily understood and navigated store and continued work in terms of the interactions between our sales associates and our customers. Thank you.",

            "Your question comes from the line of Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs.",
            "Alexandra Walvis",
            "Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I know we had brief comments earlier on the swim business in response to Kimberly’s question. I wonder if you could reflect on the swim launch at Victoria's Secret, I’d love to hear your thoughts on that, you know, what's the impacts it's having on the business on e-commerce traffic, what’s the customer response team and how are you feeling about the level of fashion price points and so forth, I mean should we expect any changes there going forward?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure, thanks. So, as we have communicated, the reentry into swim was an initial test. The decision was made to do that late last year. The financial outcome today and expected for the balance of the season is in line with our expectations, so it’s doing well and meeting our expectation. It's not having a material impact on the overall business because it was a reentry and a test.",
            "What we have learned despite, you know, what may be out there on the Internet is that there has been strong positive reaction to the assortment generally including at higher price points and I realized there's chatter out there with commentary about the good-better-best pricing, but what I’m conveying in response to your question is we've had a strong positive reaction to all of the price points we've offered in a good way.",
            "Certainly, there’s some learning that that we’re achieving with the test, but again, overall, it's gone well. It’s meeting our expectations. The business will get substantially larger a year from now. It remains focused as an online business, but one of the very positive aspects of the test has been the positive consumer response to the swim offering at higher price points in addition to the more moderate price points that we had historically been in. So that's where we stand on it and we’re encouraged about the test and we’ll be expanding our business there over the next several years. Thank you.",

            "Janet Kloppenburg",
            "Good morning Amie, good morning Stuart. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about John Mehas’ feelings about the legacy bra platforms of Victoria’s Secret. They seemed that that older products seems to be holding back a rebound in the lingerie category and I'm focused on what you said about fashion newness and when it's right they’ll go for it, and I'm wondering if we’ll see an evolution in the legacy platforms or if they'll fade away and be replaced with greater fashion platforms? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes, Thank you, Janet, thanks for the question. And you’ve followed retail a long, long time, I've been involved in it for a while, our company's been involved in it for a long, long time. This business fundamentally is about fashion. We’re not about selling basic commodity product year after, year after, year after year, that's not the business that we’re in. Others are in that business and that’s fine and they have operating models and all kinds of things that make that work for them. But that's not what our company has done for more than 55 years. We’re about fashion and when we lack fashion, lack of newness, lack innovation where it’s not interesting the result becomes apparent.",
            "And so, in answer to your question about, is John focused on that or what's his assessment, again he’ll more, he’ll, for himself, articulate all that in early September. But our observation, his observation is that there is a substantial opportunity to remix the assortment and that's not just words on a PowerPoint charter, my comment on an earnings call, but he’s doing real work on that with the team and it’s substantial work, and he’s working with our sourcing partners and our vendor partners which we have strong relationship and good capability and there's a lot happening.",
            "Will it all be perfect and all work right out of the box? I'm sure it won't, but he's making substantial change, we believe it's positive change that makes sense and that the specifics of that will become apparent as we move through the fall season and again he'll share his thinking in September with you and in the investment community. So, but no substantial changes of substantial opportunity for more fashion in the business. Thank you.",

            "Your question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi Research.",
            "Kelly Crago",
            "Hi, this is Kelly Crago on for Paul. You’ve talked about substantial changes coming in August on the product side of VS and it sounds like John has already made some progress, does that include any changes on the marketing side as well? And then in swim you also mentioned that you’ve got some successful third-party brands in swimwear, is there any opportunity to expand partnerships with the third-party brands within the lingerie and assortment? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So, cutting to the chase, Kelly will there be any changes in marketing related in concert with the change in the merchandise assortment and the very simple answer to that question is, yes. And are we going to get specific about that right now? No. Do we have it all figured out at this very moment? No. Is it being worked on? Yes, very actively, by the right folks and there will be a change coming. So that's, you know, we’re encouraged by that and excited about that. And so, you know, there’s real opportunity not only in changing the merchandise assortments themselves but how we communicate those changes and the nature of those items to our consumer. So we’re enthused about that and there is active work happening in that space.",
            "With respect to the potential for additional or different third-party brands in the swim business, absolutely. We've been pleased, as I mentioned in the prior commentary, been pleased with the overall result, but will continue to look at our offering in swim including the offerings from various third-party brands and I'm confident that there’ll be a change there and that's not a negative comment about who we’re doing business with today. We’ve been again pleased on an overall basis, but again like with anything you want to continue to evolve it, advance it, change it and I'm sure it will be ongoing change in the lineup if you will of third-party brands.",
            "With respect to third-party lingerie also we've done some tests. We believe there’s some potential there in our business through collaborations of various types and we’re actively working in that space as well, with respect to third-party lingerie active work happening there as well. Thank you.",

            "Kate Fitzsimons",
            "Yes, hi. Good morning and thanks for sneaking me in. I guess my question is on BBW. What are some trends in the business that is getting the team excited that they can maintain the momentum for the remainder of 2019 and saw that the inventory investment is coming for the back half, just what’s the view on balancing the top and bottom line as you guys start introducing more units into the system? Thanks very much.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "What’s got the Bath & Body Works team the most excited is that they probably three or four things. One, they've got strong growth at healthy margins in all of their major books of business. So that's really good, you know, the metaphor of firing on all cylinders, they are in terms of the home fragrance business, the hand soap business and the body care business. So that's got them excited.",
            "What leads to that is the regular introduction of newness and fashion in those categories. If we take some examples, recent example, the launch of Gangnam [ph] in their body care business, in fragrance categories has had a very strong positive consumer response. It's sophisticated. It's elevated. And their customer and new customers both have responded very well to it.",
            "So what's got them excited is and they don't – they are not – they don’t bat a 1000%, they don’t get it right every time. But their major books of business are performing well and where they've introduced compelling new fashion and newness in their key items, key categories they've gotten a strong consumer response. So that's got them excited and they leverage very fast supply chain to manage the risk of that. They do a good job of it.",
            "With respect to inventory and we commented about inventories - some inventory investment at Bath & Body Works, obviously the topline trend in the business is very good, but we missed some business in 2018 because we got very lean on inventory, and so the last thing you want to do is literally not be able to fulfill your sales potential because you got too lean. So learning from that and doing it in a balanced way we're making a little bit more investment ahead of key holiday periods to ensure that we've got the appropriate in-stock positions to maximize the business. So that's what's going on.",
            "That team has managed inventory in an extraordinary way over the last 10 years, improving churn to beyond four times a year and driving strong sales and margin result consumer experience as part of that. And so, our confidence level in that team working with our vendor partners to manage the supply chain inventory flow all of that is very, very high based on a lot of strong results over the years, so not concerned about them. Thank you.",

The operating income increase at Bath & Body Works, an improvement in the international business and in the other segment as a result of the sale of La Senza and the closure of Henri Bendel was offset by a decline at Victoria’s Secret.",
            "Looking to the second half of our year, our number one priority continues to be improving performance at Victoria’s Secret. As we noted in the commentary that we released last night, John Mehas and Amy Hauk, CEOs at Victoria’s Secret Lingerie and PINK respectively, have made significant changes to our fall assortments. The significant amount of change in our fall merchandise assortments and promotional plans, as well as the current trade environment and tariff uncertainty, inherently result in a greater level of uncertainty in forecasting our results for the third and fourth quarters than is typical.

And therefore, as we said consistently, we have assumed in our guidance that Victoria's Secret trends will improve versus recent performance, and that Bath & Body Works will continue to deliver strong results.

            "Thanks, Stuart. That concludes our prepared comments. At this time, we'll be happy to take any questions you might have. In the interest of time and consideration to others, please limit yourself to one question. Thanks, and I'll turn it back over to Heidi. ",
            "Question-and-Answer Session",
            "Operator",
            "[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line is Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. ",
            "Kimberly Greenberger",
            "My question is on the VS Lingerie business. I think you said initial indications in the first part of August have been favorable. I was just -- I'm curious what you mean by that? And do you think that the lingerie piece, the new fall assortment is enough to replace the lost volume in core bras? I'm just wondering, if we don't see an improvement from the first 2.5 weeks of August, it sounds like Victoria’s Secret will not be on track to deliver the expected third quarter numbers. So I'm just trying to understand what the puts and takes are? ",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So as it relates to the new lingerie assortment, modern lingerie, as we refer to it and initial results, as we’ve provided commentary in our pre-released remarks, the consumer reaction, Kimberly, to the new assortment and the new items in the assortment has been favorable and positive. And consumer is reacting well. But as you point out in your question, and all I can report to you is what we've observed so far and how things will progress as we see it based on what we believe for fall, the reaction to the new stuff has been very good. ",
            "With that said, it hasn't been to-date sufficient to overcome weakness in the balance of the lingerie assortment, including the effect of heavy promotions from a year ago that will continue through the fall season. ",
            "Importantly, there will be additional new merchandise flowing through the fall season. So the full fall assortment was not in stores in the first few weeks of August. So we're reading a partial result. ",
            "Additionally, we're very optimistic about our offering and the potential for growth in the sleep and lounge business. That as you appreciate, skews in terms of its proportion to the total to a greater percentage of that total as we move through the fall season, given its giftability and just general seasonality for sleep and lounge. We've got more work that we're doing on marketing, and we believe that our marketing effectiveness will improve as we move through the fall season. ",
            "So qualitatively that's -- that would be the additional perspective that we have in answer to your question. So consumer reaction, again strong and favorable to the new offerings, yet not sufficient to deliver an overall result that changes the trend so far, more new merchandise flowing through the balance of fall, and a lot of work going on in marketing to more effectively market the changes and drive traffic into stores. Thanks. ",

            "Your next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Please go ahead. ",
            "Paul Lejuez",
            "Stuart, can you may just talk about how swim performed during the spring season as a whole, now that you kind of brought that category back to some extent. Any update on what that category might look like in spring of '20? And then just going back to Victoria's Secret for a second. I just want to understand a little bit about the inventory pickup of Victoria's Secret, where are you investing? And I just want to tie that back to, I believe you said you've got some hopes to be less promotional in some of the prepared materials that were sent around, just maybe square that away for us? Thanks. ",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "So Paul, as you're asking that we reentered the swim business this year. We made that decision relatively late in 2018, into early 2019. So our reentry into that business happened in the latter part of March, as I recall it. So we missed a little bit of natural season for swim. It generated in round numbers about $30 million of volume, $40 million of volume versus what it had been in the past. We do believe that there is substantial additional growth opportunity in swim. ",
            "Our focus, as we've conveyed previously, is to pursue that business online and generally with more elevated assortment than what we had offered in the past and consumer reaction to that -- while there was a little bit of commentary out there about price points, overall the reaction to what we put in front of customers was positive. So it was a good start, particularly given the timing of our decision. There is meaningful additional growth opportunity in that category. Again, I'm repeating, but trying to make sure I'm being clear, we intend to pursue that at this time online and not in stores. ",
            "With respect to lingerie inventory, the first thing Paul, I want to register and you know this having followed us for a long, long time is that we're working very hard to maintain a lot -- as much flexibility as possible particularly for the fourth quarter and through our focus on reducing lead times and ordering frequently and adjusting regularly. ",
            "John Mehas and his team are working the assortment literally almost every week in terms of adjusting the on-order. We are making important investments in the new parts of the assortment. And with that said, we've got a lot of flexibility, in particular for the fourth quarter to read and react to the overall trend. And to adjust the on-order obviously to maximize our chase and pursuit of the items that are doing best and to cancel or adjust out of items that aren’t doing as well. So we're making important investments. Again optimistic in terms of the reaction to the new offering certainly in total and we got a lot of flexibility. Was there a third part of Paul’s question?",
            "Paul Lejuez ",
            "Yes, clear. Thanks. ",

            "Alex Walvis",
            "I wanted to pick up on some comments you made in response to a prior question on marketing and you mentioned in the prepared materials that marketing at Victoria's Secret business was down year-over-year. Could you give us a sense of where marketing as a percentage of sales in that business? And then you also talked to some changes planned for the back half of the year. Can you talk a little bit more about what you mean by that? Is it an increase in the level of marketing, is there any change planned to the tone or nature of the marketing message? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "You're welcome. As to the numerical questions in rough ground sense, Victoria's marketing as a percent of its sales is about 5% historically and that’s an all-in definition, including GWPs and all forms of marketing. The most important thing I would want to register about marketing and we’ve been pretty consistent in this mindset now for as long as may be 12 months, certainly six to nine months, is that everything is on the table. And what's meant by that is we’re taking a fresh hard look at almost every material aspect of our business. And the reason you're asking about marketing for Victoria is it's an important part of that business. So in terms of the messaging, the imagery, the photography, the words, the pricing promotional aspects of it, the medium of communication, the integration of marketing between stores and digital and social channels, John is getting more and more involved in it. He spent his initial focus on the merchandise because that is the longest lead time item in the business and he has done substantial work in that space and frankly extraordinary amounts of work in terms of change in a short period of time since he joined us. And he is now shifting his time, not to the exclusion of merchandising, that’s a core ongoing responsibility obviously but he is getting more and more involved in marketing. ",
            "You’ve read that we’ve had changes in senior leadership in marketing and I expect that there will be meaningful and hopefully a thoughtful change in our marketing approach as we move through fall and into 2020. John will comment further on that, I would expect when we're together in September.",

            "Mark Altschwager",
            "I wanted to ask about BBW. Just first, with the 4% store comp, can you give us a sense of how the -- what the traffic footfalls are that you are seeing and what is the back-half outlook for BBW and that’s from a traffic perspective? Then more broadly with the remodel program, I think 840 stores in the new concept are planned year end. Can you give us a sense for what percent of those you would say are in A malls or off-mall locations? And then looking forward given the continued pressure on mall traffic, has the number of BBW stores that would meet an ROI threshold changed much just with respect to the remodel. Just wondering how that refresh program evolves as we look to the second half the fleet? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure, so a number of questions in there, if I didn’t catch them all, Amie will remind me of what I missed. So in terms of the traffic at Bath and Body Works in the second quarter, it was about flat, store level traffic flat year-on-year. And the growth in the business came through transaction increases driven by conversion. ",
            "With respect to the refresh program, as we commented on consistently and updated in our script, we’re very pleased with the results of it. The refresh activity has not been limited to A malls, but it’s also happened in other mall tiers. We are seeing strong results in almost every situation whether it’s in A or B mall or a C mall or an outlet center, we’re seeing strong results broad-based, very, very few exceptions to that. And we’ll keep pursuing the program. Obviously as we move down into the fleet, we’ll continue to watch the ROIs. But again they’ve been good so far and we’re very optimistic about continuing to pursue this program over the next several years. ",
            "With respect to the ROI on the program and just the unit level economics for Bath & Body Works, frankly they’re just outstanding, they’re very solid. That said, as you can see in our information that we shared externally, the fleet is actively managed. So even at Bath & Body Works we close a few stores every year and we’re also opening stores as well. We’re expanding square footage modestly, I think carefully. But the fleet is in great shape. ",
            "And the most important thing about that remodel program is, in addition to the financial profile almost immediately being strong, it really sets the business up very well for the next seven to 10 years with a very current store design that consumers respond well to. So we won’t be in what some retailers can get into which is kind of a deferred CapEx situation. So it’s a very good outcome for the business.",

            "I wanted to follow up on the strategy at PINK to rebalance the good, better, best. Can you just talk a little bit about the go-forward implications on sales and margin that you expect from this strategy?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. We’re just -- we’re trying to add good balance among price tiers as in any business, you’ve got to balance unit, volume, growth and transaction volume, growth with pricing. As Amie came into the business and she will comment on this further, when we’re together in September. She assessed a lot of things as you would expect that she would. And based on that assessment she believed that there was opportunity to drive engagement in terms of transactions and unit volume in lower price points. She’s been careful to not go -- working hard to not to go ditch to ditch on that, but she’s just trying to make sure that she’s got what we would call a balanced assortment pyramid or assortment architecture between good, better and best and felt that the business had gotten a little tilted towards a higher price point. So she’s made adjustment there, including in areas like the bra business where she’s delivering a lot of volume growth, and getting to a margin profile now that’s starting to look very solid. So that's the mindset.",

            "Good morning, Amie and Stuart. Two quick ones. On the marketing, I know you can't go into it much now. And hopefully we'll hear more at the Analyst Day. But I guess the quick question is, will there be time to change the marketing message in a meaningful way ahead of holiday, meaning should there be some benefits or potential impacts on your Q4 performance at VS from changing the marketing strategy? And then, on the international business, it sounds like based on the commentary that the operating losses in China are getting a little bit better, can you kind of give us an update on where we stand from an operating income or loss perspective in China and what the thought process is into next year and beyond in terms of when that business can potentially turn -- return to profit?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So, Ike on the first question, with respect to, is there the opportunity to make meaningful change in the marketing approach and message for the fourth quarter, I believe that there is. John is engaged in it. The -- while marketing is complex and needs to be migrated in a careful way, the inherent lead times as I commented on earlier, not nearly as long as, will be the case to design and develop and have manufactured new product into the assortment. So simple answer to question, is there an opportunity to make meaningful change in our marketing message and approach for the fourth quarter? The answer is yes. ",
            "With respect to China, it's a multi-year situation. We do have some flagship stores there that play an important role in marketing the business. But they are generating some losses. And our view at this point would be, it's a three or four year journey in China to get to the near to a profit profile in that business, three or four year journey.",

            "Your next question is from Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. ",
            "Susan Anderson",
            "I was wondering, if you could maybe give us an update -- from what you're doing on a digital perspective, it looks like online continues to outperform stores. So maybe if you could provide some color on what you're doing from a technology perspective to continue to drive that online business and improve the omni-channel aspect for VS and PINK mainly?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. Thanks, Susan. So I think as you would know, but it's important just to reiterate, the most important thing we've done in the digital business is a project that we went live with, in the last few months, which was a replatforming, a full replatforming of victoriassecret.com. It had been running on systems and hardware that were more than 25 years old. And it served that legacy system, homegrown system, by the way it served the business very, very well for a long time. But it was time to upgrade that platform, which is a big deal, obviously, in terms of getting that right and doing it well. And again, the business -- the domestic business has been running on that new platform now for a couple of months. So that's the most important thing. It will enable us to pursue a number of customer-facing benefits that we're now moving forward to. And those would be things like buy online pick up in store. ",
            "Another foundational element that we're working on now before we roll with buy online pick up in store and other similar things is we want to make sure that we have appropriate accuracy in our inventory. And obviously, we have that for financial statement purposes, but I'm talking about at the item level at a specific location on a particular day. And with a very broad assortment with so many choices in the broad business, particularly at Victoria’s, that inventory accuracy is critical, which is why we're in 2019 pursuing an RFID initiative and rolling out an RFID initiative for Victoria’s Secret. So with the foundation of the new domestic -- what we call a domestic order management system and accurate inventories that are sufficient to make reasonable promises to customers, we will be able to do a lot of things that many other retailers can do today. ",
            "One of the other things that the new system allows us to do is to have a broader distribution network for Victoria's in the United States, which will allow us to add capacity and have more flexibility with capacity. So that's another benefit that we're getting now. So that's the biggest thing -- that those are the biggest things I should say that we've been working on. Bath & Body as you know, it wasn't implicit in your question, has a terrific online business in addition to Victoria’s growing at a very healthy rate. And they are regularly looking at ways to upgrade the customer experience in that part of the business as well. ",

            "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the List 4 tariffs at 10%. I think most of your products were included on List 4 A, but what the impacts of this would be on dollar basis for 2019 or how we should think about it on an annual basis going forward? ",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So the List 4 effect is included in our guidance. We’ve considered it in our guidance. We are working to offset some of that impact through various migration of productions at different countries and discussions with our supplier partners. We haven't given out a number. But again, it's included in our guidance. Importantly, its materiality -- this situation’s materiality to our company is not as great as many other retailers. The United States is our number one country of production given the importance of personal care and beauty in our business. And in terms of our total sourcing activity, China represents less than 20% of our total sourcing activity and has moved down almost 10 percentage points over the last three or four years based on very deliberate efforts by the sourcing production teams in our business to make sure that we have a -- continue to have a well diversified base of supplies. So we've got it covered in the guidance. And again, importantly not as material to us as it is to many other retailers. Thanks. ",

            "I’ve questions on BBW. It’s been a healthy and consistent source of comp and operating income growth for you. I’m just wondering from a rate perspective how you think about BBW over the next few years, as you think about the various puts and takes to the business whether it’s the impact of supply chain and sourcing costs, a shift to direct, which is growing at a very healthy rate but then on the flipside the benefits from scale and expense leverage that you may be getting?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So I understand the importance of your question. But as you would imagine the first thing that that we’re focused on is dollar growth. As we say around here, you take dollars to the bank, you don’t take percentages to the bank. With that said, your question is a serious question and Bath & Body has demonstrated over a very long period of time to its ability to effectively balance dollar growth in long-term health of the business with profit rate. All that said, do I see that there is a little bit of downside risk, a little bit of downside risk to the business or downside pressure to the business due to the factors that you mentioned? There is some. But again we believe that the growth potential in that business remains very high, and its ability to deliver very healthy growth in profit dollars, EBIT or operating income dollars, we’re very confident in its ability to do that, given the categories that’s in, the very strong and capable leadership team that runs that business, the assets that it has including very strong store design compelling merchandise assortments, short lead times, highly capable, highly enthused, dedicated, loyal selling force in stores, a very strong online business, just a lot of assets that, that business has. So is there a little bit of downside on the rate? Yes. Is there lots of opportunity on dollar growth? Absolutely. And I think the business has well demonstrated that or demonstrated that well for a long period of time. Thanks.",

And then on the breakdown of CapEx, I believe the store investments is going to 55% of CapEx from 75%. How do you see that moving forward in the business? And is technology investment or direct investment making up what's being removed from store investment? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks, Dana. So Victoria's Secret Beauty remains a very good business. As you know, Dana, they're in the fine fragrance business, as we would refer to it, and then they got a significant fragrance mist business. Over the last year, year and a half, as a general point they've had very strong results in the mist business. And just -- I'm again speaking about the last year, year and a half and okay results in the fine fragrance business. As we -- with that said, as we look at very recent results and they just had their most successful what they would call, sister launch in fine fragrance over the last few weeks. So, Greg and his team recognized the opportunity in the fine fragrance business as you followed us a long time. As you know, we've got three or four of the top 20 fine fragrances literally in the industry, which is a terrific place to be. ",
            "In addition to continued work on the assortment itself, Greg is very focused and team very focused on improving the selling within our stores. And so, we've got a number of things going on that we think will move the business in a favorable way and should represent a lot of upside in what is already a very sound business.",
            "With respect to the CapEx, you recognized that in the formation of your question, we have pulled back on CapEx for store-related CapEx, real estate-related CapEx for Victoria's Secret and international. And as was mentioned in earlier question, we continue to invest in technology, particularly pointed towards the online or digital part of our business and we are also investing some in distribution and fulfillment assets as well. And so that's tilting the mix a bit from what it had typically been, again representing some pullback in store-related driven by Victoria's and international just based on current trend, results, performance. But we're trying to maintain, if not increase our investment in the online digital part of our business and again some work in distribution logistics as well. Thanks.",

            "My question is on sourcing. Just with more volatility in the wake of the trade tensions, and it sounds like you're making some changes on the supplier side. Can you speak to how your ability to chase product on the PINK and VS side is evolving into the back half? Is this furthering your need for air freight or just how should we think about the flexibility there? Also just looking ahead to the fourth quarter, can you just speak to your open to buy for holiday? Thank you.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure. So the last part of that question we're essentially almost fully open for the fourth quarter, in terms of open to buy. So take that part of it, first. And then with respect to speed and agility in the supply chain, it's been -- it's a legacy part of our business in a positive way. It's something that less focused on, as long ago as the late '70s and early '80s. And we renewed our work in that area, beginning now seven years or eight years ago, both on the apparel -- the intimate apparel side of the business and in the personal care and beauty side of the business. So it's something we have renewed our capabilities in and today we would judge our capabilities in that area in terms of speed and agility in our supply chain as among the best in retailing based on what we know.",
            "With respect to the use of airfreight frankly, substantially everything that we have produced outside the United States is on an airplane, other than some gift and accessory business and it's because the value in our judgment of speed and agility to question you're asking about the economic value of that far outstrips the incremental cost of moving stuff on a boat, and as we like to say around here you can't sell it, if it's on a boat by the way. So our agility is good and our standard model if you will, with respect to things that are produced outside of the United States is in fact to move the buyer. So the speed part of the businesses is a fundamental as we see it and we're in good shape.",

            "Thanks for taking my question. Stuart, I wanted to ask you about the more targeted promos at VS this fall holiday. I feel like you guys maybe did some of that a couple of years ago with mixed results, maybe talk about the strategy there. And is it important to kind of getting to that point we have less promos in the back half, but stronger comps, is the targeted promos a key part of that? And then did you mention the trends through the quarter, I don't know, if there was a big difference between the months and the VS comp? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So in terms of the targeted versus broad-based promos, Omar, we continued to pursue the right balance between those two things. And the considerations in that is, if you have a very broad-based promo, then you're essentially discounting the whole assortment, if you will, if it's very broad-based. I'm exaggerating a little bit to make a point. Whereas if you have targeted promos, obviously you're not discounting large portions of the entire assortment and you can get more full price selling on the particularly strong choices within the assortment. And the balance point, which you recognized in the question is, that it tends to be that the broader-based promotions drive more consumer response and more traffic in an overall sense. So we're trying to strike that balance. The variable that is different from a year or two ago, and this is what makes the business interesting and fun, particularly when you largely figure it out, is that the assortment is different. So you could look at our promotional strategy in isolation and say, hey, didn't they try this a few years ago, and it didn't work. So like, what are they thinking, right? I am again trying to make a point. But the dynamic has to include in evaluation of the strength of the assortment. It all starts with that. ",
            "And with the work that Amie and John have been doing, we're optimistic that we can get reasonable result without having to do a substantial number of broad-based promotions. All that said, we've got a lot of flexibility there. And we will continue to test and learn and make trade-offs and we'll be reevaluating the promotional strategy as we move through the fall season, to get to the, the right customer response, get the right traffic, get the right margin dollars to work hard to deliver the results that are embedded in the forecast.",
            "The second part of the question was about trends within the month. So June was the strongest of the months, as I recall, and July was the weakest of the months, Omar, in the quarter, second quarter.",
            "Omar Saad",
            "Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "For Victoria's. Yes.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks. So I think we have time for a couple more questions. Next question, please.",
            "Operator",
            "Your next question is from the line of Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Please go ahead.",
            "Jamie Merriman",
            "Thanks very much. You talked earlier about the rebalancing of the price points that Amie is doing within PINK. And I was wondering, if there is any similar plans for Victoria's Secret Lingerie, as John looked at the assortment there? And then second one is just as you've sort of put everything on the table, are there any cost opportunities that you've identified that could help drive an improvement in profitability apart from the assortment and revenue initiatives that you're pursuing? Thanks.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So with respect to an evaluation of good, better, best pricing and opportunities in the lingerie part of Victoria's, it's one of the most fundamental things that any merchant leader and any retail leadership team would evaluate. And so John has made that assessment for Victoria's Secret Lingerie and the number of offerings at the better and best price points for Victoria's Secret Lingerie is up meaningfully versus what it had been. And that's based on, if you've seen the merchandise online or in stores, you would see more sophisticated merchandise -- merchandise was a lot more we believe emotional content and as we talked about at the start of the call, initial response from consumers to those new offerings has been good.",
            "The other aspect of what John and Amie have done is to have a clear demarcation between the Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK businesses. Again PINK is targeted toward a college-aged customer. And Lingerie more typically -- somebody that would be post-college and at higher price points and with a greater degree of sophistication. So that's another aspect of the good, better, best pricing work that both leaders have done to properly segment and position the respective businesses.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Cost opportunities.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "There are always in a big business like ours cost opportunities. With that said, they come with trade-offs, and the company has worked hard to be efficient over its long history and including at our -- in our record results for 2015, when we had an overall company 18% operating income rate, that, that one of the contributors to that was the highly efficient business. With that said, we've had a lot of sales pressure and margin rate pressure in the business. We have taken, what I'd call targeted actions to reduce expenses in connection with a lot of the change at Victoria's Secret. In 2016 and 2017, we have -- we took substantial home office cost reductions. And in more recent periods over the last year to 18 months, we've taken a lot of expense out of the business in terms of variable expenses and selling certain selling areas and in marketing as examples. But there is always more that you can do, but it comes with trade-offs. And you've got to be thoughtful about not getting into an ongoing cost cutting exercise that can hurt the near-term and longer-term prospects for the business. So we're trying to strike the right balance. And we'll continue to monitor that as time progresses. If retail selling trends don't improve, margin trends don't improve at Victoria's Secret, you would expect us to take another hard fundamental look at expenses and what we're focused on to the greatest extent right now is getting the results at retail in terms of sales and margin. But there are other things that we could look at, but they again come with trade-offs. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Jamie. Heidi, I think this will be our last question.",
            "Operator",
            "Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.",
            "Michael Binetti",
            "Stuart, could you, I guess, two questions quickly. Could you -- I know you've talked about the outlook for promotions and how you're working on the mix of targeted versus more broad-based. Could you tell us how you thought about the expectation for the promotional environment outside of your business as we head into the fourth quarter? I'm trying to reconcile the guidance for inventories to be up in the mid-teens with the comp items that you baked in for fourth quarter and, I guess merch margins planned to be down a little bit, but since I know a lot of the year, a lot of the annual earnings happens in the fourth quarter. I'm trying to think about how much room you might have left yourself given what we've heard so far in second quarter is a fairly volatile outlook for the rest of the year as far as where the peer group thinks promotional levels would be for the holiday?",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. So a couple of thoughts in reaction to your question, in response to your question. The first is in the lingerie part of Victoria's particularly the -- what we would call the initial markup or the inherent markup in the goods is substantially greater than what it had been. And so that provides the opportunity for higher margin rate results and more flexibility or room if needed to promote the business. Again, that's not our going-in plan, but as we talked about, we needed to balance volume with rate. And again the point I'm trying to register is there is higher markup in the goods in terms of their initial retails and their costs. So that gives us more flexibility than we've had over the last few years.",
            "With respect to the promotional environment, there are others in the industry and in our company that have been doing this longer than I have, and I've been doing it for a while. And going into every holiday there's commentary about how it's going to be more promotional than ever. I'm aware that we're in our 10th year of an economic recovery and there is greater discussion understandably about the potential for a recession. But the truth is, absent a dramatic change in the environment like we saw in '08 and '09, we sell relatively affordable things. They are discretionary but they're relatively affordable. And I would say, as a close-to-home data point, we look at Bath & Body's results and what folks might say as a promotional retail environment and they're very strong results. And again what those come from is a compelling brand position, a compelling merchandise assortment, well executed in the most complete sense. And we think that Victoria's has that opportunity. So there is nothing about the promotional environment per se that I would say is uniquely different versus most typical years and it's really in our hands to deliver compelling assortments, again, well delivered in stores and online to get to a good result and we have higher inherent markup to work with. Thanks.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Michael.",
            "Michael Binetti",
            "Can I ask one follow-up on PINK, if it …",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Go ahead, Michael.",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Sure.",
            "Michael Binetti",
            "Okay. Thanks. I know you're up on time. But on PINK, Stuart, it seems -- you seem to think some of the issues at the comp there were excluding swim, I guess, were isolated to single-category product issues. And I think there has been some variability on some of the product categories quarter-to-quarter as I look back over the last year. With the knowledge you have of where Vicky's has been over the last few years and looking at PINK, how do you isolate that this is contained to single products that we can always try to get right next season versus any metrics that you look at to gauge the longer-term health of the brand, whether there could be a longer-term issue that let you feel like, “This is okay. This really is just category-to-category issue. We’ll fix it up and we're not seeing issues with the brand that should cause a little bit more urgency here?”",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Well, it's hard for me to not react to clearly on the last part of your question. The urgency -- there couldn't be greater urgency on management. So if you don't feel urgency, then we're not communicating well. Okay. So we're about as urgent as we …",
            "Michael Binetti",
            "I shouldn't have said urgency maybe …. ",
            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Yes. We're about as urgent as we could be. And what the merchant leaders are focused on, John and Amie, is improving the merchandise offerings, and then, again executing those well in terms of all the aspects of delivering that well to consumers in stores and online. We're aware of the time frame under which the Victoria's segment has had year-on-year declines in sales, it started in 2016. So this has been a multi-year situation.",
            "With that said, we think that the assets that the business has in terms of brand awareness, brand regard, footfall in stores, visits online, sourcing and logistics capabilities strong management certainly on an overall basis that there is a lot of assets that this business has that went well lead and executed, we believe we're going to make substantial progress this fall and that there's a lot of opportunity for this business over the next several years. So -- and we're pursuing all that, trust me with a lot of urgency. Thanks.",

After our prepared comments, we’ll be available to take your questions for as long as time permits. Please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many of you as possible.",

            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Thanks Amie, and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results were at the high end of our guidance. Total sales increased 6%, comps increased 3% on top of a 2% increase last year, and operating income dollars increased 5%. Earnings per share were $0.63 versus $0.61 last year. ",
            "We continued to reduce inventories, ending the quarter at down 9% per square foot after beginning the quarter at up 6%. The gross margin rate declined by 30 basis points to 39%, driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate primarily at La Senza and Victoria’s Secret Direct. Strong assortments and the effective management of pricing and promotions resulted in healthy merchandise margin rates in our two biggest businesses, Victoria’s Secret stores and Bath & Body Works.",
            "The SG&A rate improved by 10 basis points to 25%. As we reported in our July sales release, SG&A expense included severance charges of about $0.02 per share. These charges, which were not part of our original guidance, resulted from home office headcount reductions in the quarter related to our ongoing commitment to increase efficiency and simplify the business in non-customer facing functions.",
            "Operating income dollars increased by 5%, driven by growth in all three of our major business segments, and our operating income rate declined by 10 basis points to 14.1%. Earnings per share increased 3% to $0.63. ",
            "Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8, retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 9% versus last year, and we’re very comfortable with our inventory positions. They are clean and in good shape.",
            "Turning to Page 11 of the presentation, we feel very good about our assortments and the momentum in our business going into fall. Our forecast includes a negative impact of about $0.10 to $0.12 from the previously announced exit of certain apparel merchandise and make-up, and about $0.05 of incremental non-operating expense, primarily interest, for a total of $0.15 to $0.17 of pressure, about $0.06 in the third quarter. ",
            "For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share of between $0.26 and $0.31 against last year’s $0.31 result. Our third quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect the third quarter gross margin in SG&A rates to be about flat to last year. We expect to end the third quarter with inventory per square foot down in the mid to high single digit range to last year. ",
            "For the full year, we are projecting positive low single digit comps. Total sales growth will be about two points higher than comps due to growth in square footage in our international business. We expect our full-year gross margin rate and the SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. Non-operating expenses for the year are projected to be about $315 million, consisting principally of interest expense. Before any discrete items, our tax rate will be approximately 38%. We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 298 million in the third quarter and 297 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect earnings per share for the full year of 2014 to be between $3.03 and $3.18 per share. We are projecting 2014 capital spending of about $750 million – 2014 capex of $750 million. As you know, about 70% of our capex budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. ",
            "As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, Victoria’s Secret square footage in North America will increase by just over 5% this year, driven by expansions of existing VS stores and the opening of 33 new Pink stores and 20 new VS stores. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%. ",
            "Turning to liquidity, we expect 2014 operating cash flow of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion and free of cash flow of about $600 million to $700 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and any other foreseeable needs.",
            "Thanks, and now I’ll turn the discussion over to Sharen.",
            "Sharen Turney",
            "Thank you Stuart, and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results are detailed on Page 14 of your presentation materials. The Victoria’s Secret segment grew both sales and operating income on top of a record performance last year. Total sales increased 5% and comp sales increased 3%, with operating income increasing $17.6 million or 6%. Merchandise margin dollars and rate for the segment increased in the second quarter with the strength in the store channel offsetting the impact of non-go forward apparel merchandise in the direct channel. We also finished the quarter with inventories in great shape, down double digit to last year.",
            "Now I’m going to give you a recap of each channel, starting with the stores. In the stores channel, second quarter sales increased 6% and comps were up 3%. Operating income increased 12%. Sales growth was driven across all businesses and customers responded well to our assortments. We were very focused in our core categories and therefore drove growth in bras and panties in both lingerie, Pink and sport, as well as growth in Pink loungewear and fragrance. Merchandise margin rates increased during the quarter, reflecting the strength of our assortment. ",
            "We continue to focus on the fundamentals of expense management and well controlled inventory. As a result, SG&A leverage and inventory is down double digits year-over-year. Operating income dollars and rate increased during the quarter as higher merchandise margin and leverage in SG&A more than offset growth in buying and occupancy from our investments in real estate.",
            "Now turning to the direct channel, second quarter sales were flat to last year. Go-forward core category sales increased in the mid-single digit range, driven by the same merchandise categories that drove the strength in the store channel offset by the exit of non-go forward apparel merchandise. The merchandise margin rate and dollars were down to last year primarily due to the impact of exiting non-go forward apparel. Operating income dollars and rate declined due primarily to the decline in the merchandise margin. ",
            "As we transition to the third quarter, we will continue to focus on newness and are excited about our upcoming bra launches. We have momentum in our core shared categories of bras, panties, fragrance and Pink loungewear and entering the season with lean inventory positioning us to be agile and respond with speed. We also continue to be pleased with the results of our real estate and other investments that are improving the customer experience both in stores and on our website.",
            "In summary, while the results in spring were good, we recognize we can get better and therefore we are now focused on what’s in front of us and delivering the back half of the year.",
            "Thanks, and now I’ll turn the discussion over to Nick.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Thanks Sharen, and good morning everyone. At Bath & Body Works, we were able to grow sales and earnings versus our record performance last year. We were pleased with the results and remain committed and focused on the fundamentals we do well. We recognize that we must keep getting better in order to win.",
            "Comps increased 3% on top of 3% last year. The overall assortment and shop activity was able to drive sales growth in a highly promotional retail environment. Traffic levels were down slightly during the period, but we were able to increase conversion rates above record levels last year while also growing average transaction size. We continue to be pleased with the customer acceptance of product newness across our three key businesses, our signature collection product line, our soap and sanitizer business, and our home fragrance assortment.",
            "Performance was below our expectations during June, driven by semi-annual sales performance; however, we leveraged our read-and-react capabilities and rebounded with our July floor set, delivering strong growth. Total sales for the quarter were $705 million, up 6% or $37 million to last year. Operating income was $115 million, up 8% from last year. Operating margin was 16% in the quarter and was up 40 basis points to last year, driven by expense leverage. We finished the quarter with inventory levels about flat to last year and in line with our expectations. We were pleased with the performance of our BBW direct channel during the quarter. Total sales were up 17% and operating income grew significantly versus last year. ",
            "Looking ahead to the third quarter, we continue to flow newness across the three key businesses and will maintain our robust testing agenda. We began July in our first summer theme and in August transitioned into our (indiscernible) theme, featuring new and seasonal fragrances. We are excited about our assortment but also recognize we are competing in a challenging retail environment.",
            "We remain focused on improving performance by leveraging our read-and-react capabilities and by providing customers with world-class in-store experience. Our inventories are well positioned heading into fall and flexible enough to read and react to customers’ preferences. Expenses are well managed, but we will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business. ",
            "With that, I’ll turn the discussion over to Martin Waters.",
            "Martin Waters",
            "Thanks Nick, and good morning everyone. Turning to our international segments, we continued to be very pleased with our results and progress. Sales increased by 71% to $79.3 million and operating income more than doubled to $16.9 million. The operating income rate increased to 21.3%. You will recall that results in this segment include both our wholly owned U.K. business and our franchise models in other geographies.",
            "Sales and operating income growth was achieved across all of our formats. At Victoria’s Secret International, we continued to be pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. In the U.K., our London flagship store on Bond Street continues its exceptional performance, and we’ve begun construction to expand this store. Our six mall locations are also doing well and we’ll be opening another three stores this calendar year in the U.K., with one store having slipped from our prior forecast to spring 2015. ",
            "Elsewhere in the world, we opened another two stores in the quarter under our partnership with Alshaya, bringing the total to eight. These stores continue to do very well and we’ll be opening another five to seven this year across the Middle East and Turkey.",
            "Our Victoria’s Secret beauty and accessories business continues to progress well, and we ended the quarter with 230 stores open and we are on schedule for around 300 stores by the end of the year. We are on track to open nine VSBA stores in China at the end of this year. As a reminder, all of our VSBA stores are franchised.",
            "In Bath & Body Works International, we opened seven stores in the quarter and are now up to 66 stores outside of North America, again all franchised. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business and will open another 10 to 20 stores this year.",

            "Internationally, the fleet is also steady with one exception, which you’re probably picking up in the numbers, which is the U.K. business. You might recall that we acquired the brand rights to La Senza in the U.K. and western Europe about two years ago. Alshaya stepped in to try and rescue that business that was in a distressed state, and we came to the conclusion earlier this year that it would be better to retire that business. So what you’re seeing in the store closures is the impact of that single activity in the U.K, which while disappointing for the people involved, we think is the right thing for the business.",
            "So pretty much steady as you go in La Senza. We continue to be optimistic about the brand. We enter the fall season with our inventories clean and in good shape, and we think there’s significant global potential for this brand going forward.",

            "No, not connected at all. What we see in malls around the world, and we have several geographies where we have La Senza and Victoria in the same mall, is that both brands compete well.

Thanks.",

I regularly look at the data cut by vintage of opening, size of opening, geography – every which way you can cut it, and I would tell you that all of the indications are positive. That business grows from its core. It’s growing both in terms of new stores and growth in existing portfolio as well, so pretty exciting business. We’ll get to 300 stores by the end of this year and we’ll keep growing it into next year.",

If you could talk a little bit at Victoria’s Secret Direct, as you’ve unwound some of the non-profitable apparel, have you seen the balance of the business pick up or has there been any kind of impact to the rest of the assortment there, and have you seen some of that business—like swim, for instance, you have it in a bigger assortment in stores. Have you seen some of the shift into the stores?",
            "Sharen Turney",
            "Hi Marni, it’s Sharen. Basically our goal is, and we are seeing the fruits of our labor, is that as we focused on more of the shared product, whether it’s your core bra business, your Pink bra business, your sport bra business, we’re seeing very high growth in those categories. The future of what we believe will happen in direct is that we will offset that volume because we are more focused within these shared categories. We have not seen a deterioration of swim by expanding it into the store, and in fact it’s really been a one-plus-one-equals-two, or two and a half, being able to use the direct channel as advertising. We don’t have a lot of real estate in our stores, so that cannot carry the full assortment, being able to service the customer through our direct channel, so I think our strategy is—I don’t think, I know our strategy is going to pay off for us in terms of exiting these non-core apparel categories and really focusing on the share categories, which I think will benefit the customer as well as the simplicity as we go forward with our strategy.",

As you know, speed is something that we have continued to focus on, and it’s really paying off for us as we’ve kind of honed in on that muscle. ",
            "As I think about holiday this year, there’s nothing indicating to me that it’s going to be any different than any of the years that we’ve had in the past, and I think that what Victoria’s Secret and Pink have done is really focused on what are all the different scenarios that could happen, so that we could be prepared for anything. I think the most important is that if we have to turn on the promotional game, we’re really being much more focused and to make big bigger versus peanut butter spreading in terms of some of the promotional activity that we did last year. So I think this year, we are being very thoughtful about it and that we’re prepared hopefully to win this holiday.",

We’ve also run an awful lot of tests earlier this year on some very big ideas that were differentiators and feel very different to the customer that she hasn’t experienced before, so we’re focused on those and really those.

Beauty, it feels like that business is firming up, and I’d love to hear you discuss some of the drivers of that; and also on sport, could you talk about the penetration across the store base and what we should look forward to as holiday approaches in terms of wider distribution. And for Nick, I was just wondering if you could talk about ideas for the semi-annual sale in January and how you might create some newness around that. Thank you.",

Okay, so first thing for beauty, we’ve been very encouraged by all of our new fragrance launches, and as you know, what I’m really excited about this fall season is we’ve always had a strategy to really tie our fragrance launches into our bra launches because the power of those two together is very strong. So our next two launches that are going to be coming up, whether it’s Fearless and Scandalous, all are tied together – same names of bra, same names of fragrance, which really puts power on power.",
            "The third piece, the third leg of the stool for us in beauty that we are really seeing emerging is the accessory business, and we were always underpenetrated compared to our sisters in the VSBA space and so that is a category that we’re also going after as we go into the holiday time frame. So putting fragrances with the power of the bra launches as well as growing the accessory category, I think will position us well for beauty as we go into holiday.",
            "The sport, I’m very excited about sport. I don’t know if you all have been able to have a chance to see the new sport book that just came out. Sport in all stores. The full assortment will be in—go from 118 to, I believe, about 180 stores this year, so we are very excited. As you know, this week we’re launching our incredible zip-front bra – it was our number one bra in back closure. We actually put it into front closure. We have come off of another strong introduction of the knock-out bra, which is a zip and click which is patented, and so then all of the technology that we have going into our sport bras are very, very important. We are performance-based. Everything we do is performance-based and in all the innovation as we go forward as well, really looking at owning that from a patent perspective. Excited about the growth opportunity that we have in sport, both in the store and the direct channel.",

Yeah, really interesting – so we had a tough sale, and if I look at the background behind that, as we’ve flowed more newness and more fashion on a more regular basis, I think the customer has just begun to expect that and is now expecting that in sale as well. As we had that in sale, we just didn’t have it deep enough, so obviously we’ll fix that as we go forward. I think what really happened as we transitioned into July was as we flowed significant newness, we saw our business really jump back, so our opportunity is a big opportunity as we go into next year, and then obviously as we begin to fix this as we look at the holiday sale as well. So it’s just a real case of meeting her expectations during a sale period as we’re not really a markdown brand – we don’t have a lot of markdowns on the floor, so I think she just wants to see the newness as we go into the sale period.",

So again, rather than look at other geographies, I’d rather build out where we are right now. The same would be true in the U.K. where we own the stores.",

I think that bodes well for full assortment in ’15 or ’16, and similarly in western Europe this year, we’ll open our first off-airport VSBA stores in western Europe, and that could well be a lead indicator for the full assortment business in the future.",

I know it’s still small and growing rapidly, but it’s very challenging to model, and I’m wondering if you could possibly break out how much—you know, roughly what percent is coming from company-owned stores, what percent royalties, and what percent wholesale. Thanks.",

One thing I’d want to register is that when we have our annual update meeting later this year, we’ll provide some additional visibility into the key growth drivers over the next several years in international, but the revenue growth is really coming from all the portions or models of the business that you described. We don’t get into the specific guidance, if you will, in those different channels, but if you think about the company-owned business in the U.K. and then the royalties that are coming off of the VSBA business and full assortment business, again each of those models are significant and are driving revenue growth, but we really haven’t gotten into the detail of the composition of each of those three. As we look to provide an update in October, we’ll try to give more visibility to that on a multi-year basis.",

            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "It’s not significant at this point, Jeff, but over time, as you point out, as our business becomes more international over time, there certainly are opportunities for the tax rate to come down; but I wouldn’t describe it as a significant effect certainly in ’14 or likely in ’15.",

And then on Pink, I know it struggled last year in the second half. Can you maybe talk about what the opportunities are relative to intimates, apparel or licensed, and how you’re planning it versus your inventory comments I think that Stuart made? Thanks very much.

Just a couple of things – where we have needed real estate and we have actually pushed Pink into a freestanding space and expanded the Victoria’s Secret, one-plus-one is equaling three. They are highly productive and we would continue to see this as a great investment for Victoria’s Secret, and as you know, we still have a large number of stores that still do not have the full assortment, whether it’s Pink or it’s Victoria’s Secret.",
            "The highlights of what’s happening in those full real estate stores is that when you have the opportunity to have a dominant bra presentation and add your adjacent categories of sport and swim with Pink as a side-by-side, it’s very, very powerful for every single category of growth. So good strategy, excited about the opportunity, and performing well for us.",
            "Pink did have some missteps last year in their assortments and were a little too promotional. This year in the all-important back-to-school time frame, we did a lot of work in terms of course correcting the fashion and getting out of the NFL and the pro sport business and really focusing on the collegiate business, and we’ve actually added about 100 new schools in that collegiate business which we think will more than offset the pro sport business.

We worked very hard, whether it’s your raw materials partners or your manufacturing partners, to really set up something which I think is a very unique proposition. We probably have cut all of our manufacturing and lead times in half and continue to see opportunities. Panties is obviously our fastest category of growth – we’ve been able to get bras anywhere, if it’s a basic bra, fashion bra, down anywhere from three to seven weeks. So there’s always more and more opportunity as we look at supply base because we really try to think about it, as Charlie McGuigan likes to say, is that as they were manufacturing right next door to us. It takes a lot of coordination between all of our merchants, planners and our supply base to be able to do this, and we really believe it is a competitive advantage for us.",

On the VSBA side, you’ve been opening about 100 a year the last couple years. I’m just curious about your appetite, given what you’re seeing, to maybe start to accelerate that – maybe 150, 200. And then also, any optionality or any thought process on potentially down the road taking some of those VSBA franchises in-house, and what’s the thinking there? Thanks so much.",

I would like to think that we could get that a little faster, so I’m challenging the business to up the pace for 2015. That said, the most important thing is the quality of the real estate, so I’d rather go slower and get the right real estate than faster and be in secondary locations, so there’s a constant healthy tension with our partners who see that this business is very productive. They want to go quicker too, but I’m only prepared to do it in the right places, so it’s that constant pull-push. I think if we can keep 100 to 125 stores a year going for the next few years, that will give us pretty good rate to grow.",
            "As far as the option to bring those stores in-house, I don’t want to go there. Our model is a capital-light model. It’s a very high control model, and we think that if we control the IP, we control everything that the customer sees from how the assortment is built, how the stores are created, how our associates sell, and we just leave three things to our partners – they bring capital, they bring real estate, and they bring responsibility for local operations and leading people. We think that’s a good trade-off and a good share, and for as long as that model works, I don’t see the need to change it and bring it in-house, so I wouldn’t expect to see anything from us in that regard going forward.",

I think the difference that we’re looking at is really distorting into things that we’ve either got an early read on, things that did well last year that we really want to get behind from a distorted perspective. In terms of what will we repeat, the two big things that were important to us last year we’ll repeat again were four traditions and holiday traditions. Especially in holiday traditions, we saw very big growth in that category as we reinvented it last year, and we’ve done the same again this year and really tried to emphasize in that particular area the notion of the importance of Christmas, the importance of holiday, and making it as festive as possible and really using that as a critical driver as we go into it. So I’d say in summary, about the same level of newness but really distorted towards where do we think the big hits are, and then two big ideas that will come back again from a traditions perspective.",

            "Great, thanks so much, and congrats guys on a strong quarter. A question to Sharen – maybe talk about some of the technology you’re seeing in the bra category right now. It just looks like you guys are benefiting from a lot of newness at Victoria’s Secret. And a question to Stuart – maybe talk about the fourth quarter opportunity you guys have ahead. Your inventories are in very good shape and guidance really assumes very modest gross margin expansion on top of deterioration last year. Thanks so much.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks. Sharen, do you want to start?",
            "Sharen Turney",
            "Well, we just have a philosophy for us that innovation and new technologies are really endless, and what we always try to start with is we start with the customer. What can we solve for the customer to have a better fitting or more comfortable fashion bra? So as we think about some of the new technologies that we have, whether it’s in the sport bras or as we have done our t-shirt bra or the Incredible bras, we continue to look at that first and foremost from the customer perspective.",
            "As we go forward for the holiday time frame, I will tell you we’ll be re-launching – a little inside – one of our biggest categories of bra, which is Dream Angels. So Dream Angels will have a brand-new facelift as we go into holiday, and that’s going to be very, very important for us. So it’s something that we continue to focus on. We want to be the best in the world at bras, but it’s not just technology for technology’s sake but for basically solving issues or enhancing opportunities for our customer.",

            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Anna, with respect to the fourth quarter, for the reasons you mentioned, we’re optimistic about having a good fourth quarter. So we’ve got momentum in the business, inventories are in good shape, a lot of positive things going on which Nick and Sharen are describing. I would remind you that the impact of the apparel exist at VSD is significant in the fourth quarter, so that will be a drag going the other way, but we’re optimistic that we’re set up to have good holiday and we’re going to work hard to get to the best result.",

            "Good morning everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. I was wondering if, Sharen and Nick, you could talk a little bit about AUR or transaction or conversion opportunities for your respective businesses, whether for the holiday season or looking longer term into 2015. Thank you.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Great. Sharen?",
            "Sharen Turney",
            "Betty, thank you. We are always looking at opportunities in terms of driving conversion, and one of the things that we continue to think about, our selling organization, is how do we make sure that we’re giving them the appropriate training, how do we make sure that they have the opportunity to experience the product. So we’ve put a lot of initiatives in place to help with training and with them really being able to experience the product, so I think they’re going to hopefully pay off for us. We continue to see conversions go up, and I think that’s a great opportunity for us as we go into the holiday season.",
            "Amie Preston",
            "Thanks, Sharen. Nick?",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Hi Betty. I think a lot of this will really come down to what will traffic be like and how hard will we have to fight to make sure we get our fair share of it, and obviously that fighting will take in some cases a promotional side. So I could see the season is starting well and AUR is pretty healthy. Is there upside? Potentially, but then that would be offset with any promotional activity, which could also come back in terms of how we manage speed and are we able to get back into the collections that she’s liked.",
            "We took some ticket increases last year. I don’t anticipate us doing that again in holiday now. I think we’ve got ourselves to a healthy place, and then I think it’s really just a case of reading, reacting and really understanding the customers’ preference and seeing if we can make sure we get the assortment in that area.",

And then Stuart, can you just expand on this severance charge that was taken in the quarter? What does that actually relate to, and might there be an impact from the severance charge in the operating expenses go forward, either in the second half or in 2015? Thank you.",

            "Stuart Burgdoerfer",
            "Tom, on the severance charge, as we’ve talked about pretty consistently and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are on an ongoing basis looking to minimize the home office overhead, particularly in areas that are non-customer facing. So we did take some actions in the quarter to adjust our cost structure, again in home office non-customer facing functions. In terms of the benefit of that, it is included in the guidance ranges for the back half of the year. We’ll get a little bit more benefit next year, but it’s really part of an ongoing effort, Tom, to make sure that we’re putting our money into those areas that are most important to the customer. Thanks.",

            "Thanks guys. Congrats on an awesome performance. Sharen, at VS we’ve been noticing some really compelling price increases on a year-over-year basis, which have been pretty awesome to achieve. Could you just articulate the opportunity there and what you might expect for holiday? And Nick, just a quick one on gifting – what should we know about gifting this year versus last year and your pursuit of how you’ll think about timing and what might be important to customers? Thank you.",
            "Sharen Turney",
            "We haven’t taken a lot of price increases. What you might be referring to, and correct me if I’m wrong, is that what we have done is we’ve actually added two layers of fashion. We have layered in the designer collection, which is at the top tier of the price point, and then we have another, I’d say, aspirational layer as well. So we continue to carry our good-better-best, but we’re actually layering on in terms of the reach price point to designer and aspirational piece of the business.",

            "Thank you.",
            "Nick Coe",
            "Hi – good question. So first of all, I’d say one of the ways we’re looking at gifting as we go into holiday is that the brand is inherently a very giftable brand, so how do we take the most important pieces that we have, whether that’s a three-wick candle or whether it’s certain fragrances, and find ways to merchandise, market and sell those for that ultimate purpose, which is in many cases as a giftable item, so we’ve put a bigger emphasis against that side of it.",
            "Then secondly as we think about merchandising the store and trying to make it fundamentally as giftable and Christmas-like and holiday-like as possible, we’ll continue to take the gifting ideas, smatter them through the store so that it creates that ambience, and then we’ve got an awful lot of learnings both in terms of timing that we don’t have to be too early, as well as things we’ve done in the first half of this year that she’s reacted well to. So I’m optimistic in terms of how do we leverage the core equity of the brand, which is very, very giftable in any case, and then how do we merchandise the rest of gifting in a way that makes it pretty compelling for her as she comes in at holiday.",
