At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow, if you would like to ask a question. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning for the Safe Harbor statement. Sir, you may begin.","Thomas E. Hamlin - Vice President, Financial Planning and Investor Relations","Good morning. Welcome to the third quarter 2015 earnings conference call for Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations page on our website, register for email alerts and view our third quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including the most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast, estimates and expectations.","Also, on this call, we will discuss the measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the earnings release kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO Tom Farrell, our CFO Mark McGettrick and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the third quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we've made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $1.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015, which was in the middle of our guidance range of $0.95 to $1.10 per share. Lower operating expenses and high margins from our merchant generated plants accounted for the slightly better than expected performance.","GAAP earnings were $1 per share for the third quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were out of the period tax-related items for our electric operations. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the third quarter was $388 million, which was just below its guidance range. Kilowatt hour sales were modestly below expectations. Excluding weather, year-to-date sales growth was about 1%, which is consistent with our expectations for the year. A delay in commission approval of our strategic undergrounding program also impacted EBITDA for the quarter.","Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $796 million in the third quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and higher merchant generation margins were contributing factors to the strong results.","Third quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $332 million, which was near the top of its guidance range. Positive drivers were lower operating expenses and higher gas distribution margins. On a consolidated basis, interest expenses were in line with our expectations, while income taxes were in the upper end of our guidance range. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.","For the third quarter of 2015, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $20.3 million and distributable cash flow of $19.8 million, all consistent with management's expectations. On October 23, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.20 per unit payable on November 13 to unitholders of record on November 3. This distribution represents a 7% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.","In September, Dominion Midstream acquired a 25.9% interest in the Iroquois Pipeline for the issuance of 8.6 million limited partnership units to National Grid and New Jersey Resources. The freeze action will be accretive to DM's distributable cash flows and enable it to meet its targeted 22% distribution growth rate for 2016 without having to access the capital markets to fund an additional drop.","On September 24, Dominion's board authorized the company to invest up to $50 million over a 12-month period to purchase LP units of Dominion Midstream Partners in the open market. As of last week, the company had acquired a little over 550,000 units at a cost of about $15.4 million. As we have now passed the one-year anniversary of the IPO, we expect to file a registration statement with the SEC later today. However, as noted, this filing does not relate to any planned issuances prior to 2017.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion, funds from operations were $3.4 billion for the first nine months of the year. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $2.6 billion. We have $4.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash and short-term investments, we ended the quarter with liquidity of $2 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the earnings release kit.","In the financing area, we announced in September that based on our current plans, we'll not need to access the capital markets for new common equity throughout the remainder of the decade. We did access the debt market in September with a $650 million 10-year note offering from Dominion. We plan to come to market with another issue for Dominion Gas Holdings of $550 million to $700 million later this year. We're also pleased that Fitch Investor Services recently reaffirmed its ratings for Dominion and its subsidiaries in the report issued last month.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.85 to $0.95 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.84 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are higher revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity payments to non-utility generators and higher merchant generating margins.","Negative drivers for the quarter were lower farm-out revenues and share dilution. Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.50 to $3.85 per share. As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 27 of the earnings release kit. As of mid-October, we've hedged 99% of our expected 2015 production at Millstone and 83% of our expected 2016 production.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.03 per share for the third quarter of 2015, which was in the middle of our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015 is $0.85 to $0.95 per share and our operating earnings guidance for the full-year remains $3.50 to $3.85 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued in the third quarter. Year-to-date, OSHA recordables for each business unit are ahead of or are consistent with their respective targets for the year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our six units was 95.9% for the first nine months of the year. Our Power Generation group also performed well with record net generation during the third quarter.","In early October, the citizens of South Carolina, home to our Dominion Carolina Gas subsidiary, were victims of unprecedented floods. Fortunately, the operations of Dominion Carolina Gas were not significantly impacted by the floods. There were no safety incidents, no service interruptions, and no significant damage to our facilities.","Working with local officials, Dominion has been able to assist in the recovery, providing 100,000 bottles of safe drinking water as well as safe kits, hot meals, food and other essential supplies. Company also assisted in aerial transportation for damage assessment, in response made additional contributions to the Red Cross Disaster Relief.","Now, for an update on the biennial review. Hearings on the Virginia State Corporation Commission's review on Virginia Power's earnings for 2013 and 2014 were held in September. A final order is expected late this month. You will recall that neither our base rates, nor the allowed rate of return are subject to change in this proceeding. Biennial review process will resume in 2022, covering earnings for the calendar years 2020 and 2021.","Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,358-megawatt combined-cycle facility in Brunswick County was about 90% complete through the third quarter. There are approximately 1,050 workers on site. All major equipments have been installed, and first fire of the initial combustion turbine is targeted for later this month. The facility is on time and on budget with an expected mid-2016 commercial operation date.","The hearing on our request for CPCN and Rate Rider for the proposed 1,588-megawatt Greensville Country project is scheduled for January 12. Major contracts for this project have been executed, including the combustion turbine supply agreement MH Power Systems and EPC agreement with Fluor. This three-on-one combined-cycle facility is expected to achieve commercial operation in December 2018. It will provide approximately $2 billion in customer benefits over its life.","We've continued our merchant contracted renewable acquisition efforts with the September acquisition of a 50% interest in the 210-megawatt Three Cedars Solar Project in Utah, scheduled for operations next year. The acquisition brings our contracted solar portfolio to 690 megawatts, exceeding 645-megawatt target we had announced earlier in the year.","On September 4, Dominion signed an agreement for the sale of a 33% interest in 425 megawatts to this portfolio with SunEdison for approximately $300 million. We plan to monetize the remaining two-thirds interest after the ICC holding period was economically advantageous.","Our solar strategy is transitioning from the merchant business to our regulated business in Virginia, where we plan to invest $700 million this decade to construct 400 megawatts of utility-scale projects in this space. Based on RFPs conducted in August, the company selected three projects totaling 56 megawatts and submitted an application with State Corporation Commission for CPCN and Rate Rider on October 1. If approved, the solar site will be in service by late 2016.","Also during the quarter, we were awarded a 10-year energy sales agreement The United States Navy to supply the Norfolk Naval Station. The Navy has the option to extend the agreement for an additional 10 years. The energy will be generated by 20-megawatt solar facility located in North Carolina, which we agreed to acquire from the solar developer on September 4.","We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the third quarter, a $146 million of transmission assets were placed into service, bringing the year-to-date total to $660 million. We estimate another $290 million of replacement service in the fourth quarter for a full-year total of $950 million. Electric transmissions capital budget for growth projects, including NERC, RTEP, maintenance, as well as security-related investments will average over $700 million per year through at least the remainder of the decade.","Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. We closed on the first farm-out of our Utica acreage in September with the transaction covering approximately 16,000 acres. We still have over 160,000 acres in the Utica formation available to serve as farm-out transactions. Interest in the Utica continues to be strong.","We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. We made the formal FERC filings for these projects in September. On Friday we made a supplemental filing to address specific routing solutions for avoidance of threatened and endangered species.","The company is committed to constructing a project that is environmentally sound. Surveying is now over 85% complete, and engineering is about 75% complete. We awarded the small diameter pipe contracts to AMERICAN Cast Iron Pipe in August. Construction bids were received in May and we expect to execute contracts by the end of the year. We plan to begin construction on both projects in the fourth quarter of next year and begin operations in November 2018.","With last week's announcement that Duke Energy has agreed to acquire Piedmont Natural Gas, we have received several questions as to how the combination of two of the partners in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline will impact the project. Dominion will remain the operator, and there will be no changes in the management or operation of the project. It's provided for in our existing agreement that upon closing of the transaction, the ownership structure will be recalibrated with Dominion retaining its leading ownership percentage, assuming the Southern AGL transaction also occurs. The ownership interest will be Dominion 48%, Duke 47% and Southern 5%.","Now, I'll update on our Cove Point Liquefaction project. Overall, it is approximately 47% complete, and there are about 1,300 workers onsite. Engineering is 95% complete and approximately 95% of the engineering equipment has been procured as of the end of the third quarter. All 34 of the construction projects have been approved by FERC. Also, the cryogenic heat exchanger was delivered by barge to the site last week. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date.","In addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header, we have 13 energy growth projects underway with $1.2 billion of investments to move more than 2 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018.","The Edgemoor project in South Carolina and The Western Access Project in Ohio are under construction and proceeding on time and on budget. Since our last call, we received FERC approval for three pipeline expansion projects and received the environmental assessment for a fourth. We have four other projects filed with FERC, and one project in Charleston, South Carolina, we expect to file very shortly. This quarter, we also announced two new demand-driven projects to serve LDC and power generation customers.","There has been a fair amount of press and investor attention recently regarding the large number of gas infrastructure projects that are under development, particularly in the Northeast, and how much of this new capacity may be underutilized because of the low gas price environment does not support enough our production to fill these pipes. The vast majority of these new projects is supported by contracted producers, whose finances are under stress due to low commodity prices leading some to be concerned with the long-term financial viability of the projects.","I want to highlight the significant difference of Dominion's infrastructure growth projects from those of others. With the exception of a couple of smaller producer outlet projects that are well underway to completion, all of Dominion's major expansion projects are secure with firm commitments from consumers of natural gas, not the producers. These demand-driven projects include Cove Point Export, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the Supply Header Project, the NewMarket project, CPV and Keys in Maryland, Edgemoor in South Carolina and several others. All are with sound counterparties that are meeting customer demand or fueling electric power production.","So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. The Brunswick County construction project is proceeding on time and on budget. We continue to work for a FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project, and construction at the Cove Point Liquefaction Project is continuing on time and on budget.","Thank you. And we are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. At this time, our first question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. Tom, it's been a pretty tough quarter, quarters for the MLP space probably and kind of the gas infrastructure assets. Are you guys seeing opportunities of things coming up for sale looking interesting and certainly interest enough for you to go out and issue some more equity capital to get deals done? Are you more content to sit on what you have for the time being and stay out of the equity markets?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's certainly been a tough quarter, really for like maybe four months for the sector, although, I think, objectively that Dominion Midstream Partners has done relatively well compared to some of the rest of the sector. I think that's largely due to the long dropdown schedule we have for organic growth projects. We have looked for things like the Carolina gas transmission, the Iriquois assets, where we were able to place the LP units directly with the sellers. That's the kind of thing we're looking for. We have plenty of projects. We recognize the volatility of the markets right now and we're inclined to just focus on our own projects.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And I guess, kind of in that spirit, obviously some pretty big M&A transactions this quarter. Can you remind us on how you guys think about M&A and how you prioritize it against the internal growth opportunities you see?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","I think we've been fairly consistent for quite a long time. I hope we have, we think, we don't talk about M&A at all. In case somebody decides slightly, we've got a different nuance in the way we say we don't talk about it. So we try not to talk about it. With the exception, we have said since we created Dominion Midstream Partners that we would be looking for assets to contribute to the MLP and we are. But like I said, we have anything that we look at that we're going to judge against our own projects and what issuing LP units, how we've prepared through just organically growing. We like what we have.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. I guess, the last one on solar, you were able to get the SunEdison deal put together this quarter. What do you think about doing with the rest of the megawatts that haven't been committed to the SunEdison thus far? And is there appetite in the market to monetize that next chunk?","Unknown Speaker","Hey, Dan, this is Norris (22:57). We're happy with the sell-down arrangement that we have with SunEd. As you are aware, we can't monetize a fourth those until after the sunset of the ICC period. So you shouldn't look for us to be back in the market anytime soon for that. Those transactions took us through the end of 2015. So we do have some 2016 projects that will be developed next year. We'll see what the market bears at that point in terms of those projects. But, again, don't look for us to access the market for additional sell-down for a bit while.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Hi, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Hey, quick questions. One, have you guys talked at all about the benefits that you expect to have from capacity performance at PJM?","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Michael, this is Mark. We haven't talked about that. There have been a lot of questions about it. I guess, what the way I would summarize that is, we were very happy with the outcome of those auctions and expect to be a beneficiary.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And with the growth of solar estimates at some of your peers, including Southern and Con Ed, just wondering if you guys plan on increasing your targets yourselves at some point?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","In terms of incremental of new solar?","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Yes.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We have a pretty good line of sight through the 30% ITC window through next year. I guess, the only caveat I give you on that is, we expect some projects in 2016 become available due to some distress with YieldCos that have a time commitment to build, may need some assistance in financing those. We'll very selectively look at that as we go out, and we will definitely look at Virginia projects for us to build in Virginia to support our future needs in terms of our carbon compliance, so again merchant wise, I'd say, very selective, but our focus really being on the Virginia service territory.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","And one question about dividends. How are you thinking about dividend growth going forward considering the buybacks of DM shares? And I guess looking forward, spin-off of the GP of the MLP also little less interesting these days than it used to.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we've never talked about doing anything with our GP, just to answer a statement rather than a question. We see no reason to change our distribution growth rate which is 22%, which is \u2013 we think is best-in-class at the MLP and we stated in February that it's our anticipation, subject to board approval, to increase our dividend at Dominion about 8% a year through the balance of the decade.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Right. And one last question, about cost savings, if you could just make a comment on that going forward at the utility and also at the merchant generation company? And then, that's it.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Michael, on the cost side, you should think about our operating budgets growing at about a rate at CPI that we roll out. The only major fluctuations would be the timing of Millstone outages, where one year you might have two and next year you might have three. But we're focused on CPI type growth going ahead.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Just wanted to confirm that the long-term growth rates that you've highlighted, earnings dividends, those are all still good.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, on the issues with the \u2013 all the things we've heard in terms of lower oil prices, gas prices liquids prices, maybe slowing production, et cetera. If you look at not just your new projects, but also the existing fleet of assets, could you maybe just characterize your exposure, if anything? I assume it's pretty small, but just if it's \u2013 is it enough, is there anything that we should worry about in terms of numbers over the next year or two due to these issues?","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Steve, I'm going to let Paul to answer that question, but I'd also take you back to the script where Tom differentiated our projects versus a lot of others that are in the marketplace. Almost all of ours are demand pull projects with regulated utilities or counterparties, hence we feel real good about that. But let me have Paul to give you more color.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah.","Paul D. Koonce - Chief Executive Officer, Energy Infrastructure Group and President, Dominion Virginia Power","Yeah. Good morning, Steve. Yeah, the producer outlet projects that we have announced and put into service are really reworks of existing assets. So there really is no credit exposure to speak of for those projects. And we've been very focused on our growth projects. And I think if you kind of check around the market, you'll see that our credit requirements are probably as strict as anybody's and I think that's reflective of our projects. So I don't see anything really that should concern you.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. A quick question on merchants, on the merchant side. With all the retirements happening in New York, New England, how do you see that impacting your fleet of gas assets in New York and New England?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Praful, while of course we only have two gas assets, last one in New England in Manchester and one in CGM outside Philadelphia, Fairless. We do see pressure particularly on capacity, ultimately on energy and NEPOOL with some recent announcements. And I think the New York announcement this morning will also put pressure on Northeast prices, particular on capacity as you go out. Since the infrastructure there on gas is not going to be able to significantly, expand gas at least for the next many years, I think continued shutdown on NEPOOL's side in the Northeast will support both higher energy and capacity.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you. And then in terms of, sorry, in terms of taxes. You talked about ITC expiration post 2016 and moving away from solar, merchant solar to more utility scale. I just wanted to understand from a tax perspective, both book and cash taxes, how do you expect the ITC expiration post 2016 to impact your book and cash taxes?","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think it's going to depend on, one, what ITC is available. Right now, it's just 10% and on the projects we'll be focused on, they'll be regulated projects. So they will flow through regulated rates through riders to customers in Virginia. So that benefit will flow through back to them.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If we can go to the farm-outs and you mentioned that there is about 160,000 acres left. Just, I guess springboarding a little bit more specifically off Steve's earlier question, given where gas prices are at right now and commodity prices overall, are you seeing a change in the market place out there with regards to farm-out interest and can you just comment on the updated sort of industry outlook for farm-outs here?","Paul D. Koonce - Chief Executive Officer, Energy Infrastructure Group and President, Dominion Virginia Power","Brian, this is Paul Koonce. It's interesting, there is certainly a lot of stress among the producer community, but there is also real interest in getting a secure acreage position in this basin. And what our acreage offers is really a lot of acreage that's blocked up, that's contiguous and because this production is held by production, there's no time limit on when the lease will expire. So from that standpoint, there continues to be a lot of real interest, especially when you look at some of these Utica initial production rates. So we've seen a real strong interest and have seen no let up.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And then one last question. Historically, you guys have not done analyst days in consecutive years. You've generally done it every other year or so. Generally, this year it seems to me at least that you guys have just been executing on what you talked about on the Analyst Day earlier this year. Should we go under the assumption that you guys won't need to do any Analyst Day for next year or do you think one might be merited given just the change in the commodity price environment?","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Brian, this is Mark. I think, we'll have to evaluate that if we get closer and give guidance for next year. We had a lot of a significant change to talk about it in February this year. I think an Analyst Day will be driven by how much the plan changes long-term, if at all. And if it stays pretty much on course with what we have, we probably will wait another year for an Analyst Day, but again, we'll talk about that in the first quarter call based on what events are at that time.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to touch on the solar procurement process in Virginia, given some of the recent regulatory activity in the state. At a high level, could you talk about how you think about procuring solar on the utility side within Virginia?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Well. First, I think you're probably referring to the order, I guess, with last week on the \u2013 or the week before on the Remington Solar Project. Steve, to distinguish between that project and the projects for example that we just filed, the projects we filed \u2013 I guess, we filed Remington in January or February. We had done a lot of work around RFPs and market conditions in solar in the region, when we filed that and believe that we adequately demonstrated that. We went through a much more rigorous or I shouldn't say a more rigorous -different process, which \u2013 over the summer, for these new projects, which we think are more than compliant with what it was the Commission was looking for in the Remington Project.","So we do RFPs, test the market, look at what we get back in return and then we'll file them. The projects are going to be required \u2013 are going to be required to meet the Clean Power Plan and they are \u2013 the General Assembly said and it's built those path early this year that they believe these are in the public interest. So we'll work our way through this process with the commission. Projects are going to get built and I think they'll look like the ones we just passed.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thanks and shifting over to, I'm sorry, can I ask this?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry, shifting over to nuclear. I wanted to just, at a high level, get your thoughts on the O&M environment for nuclear. Any trends that you're seeing there just as we think into the future? I know your nuclear operations are very different from some of these smaller units that are retiring. But I'm just curious, any trends you see in terms of nuclear operations' cost requirement going forward, things of that nature?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Let me just give a high level response to that, and then I'll turn it over to Dave Christian. Steve, I assume you're referring of course to the announcement today of Entergy and FitzPatrick. We've seen other single merchant power plant, nuclear plants under stress from other companies. We had this happen here, we had this happen with Kewaunee. When I say here, I mean at Dominion. I guess it's happened three years ago, it was very, very difficult decision for us to make. We tried very, very hard to keep that unit operating, but we just couldn't see with the way the market structure we set up at Millstone in particular, that we could make it work without seeing it drain on the balance of our nuclear fleet.","Wasn't a happy day to announce that closing. So everybody is in the different environment. We are all at different plant economics, but it's a structural issue. I think more macro than micro at least it was for us. But today, particularly on O&M and nuclear, well, I think Mark characterized it pretty well. We've had a cap to expected O&M growth at CPIs and that we are also try and work to culture a continuous improvement, we're always scrutinizing costs. We happened to be blessed with some very low cost units and some very large units. So Millstone in particular is largest unit in New England, dual-unit site. It doesn't have a lot of those same characteristics that Pilgrim, BY and Kewaunee, right.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just, I'm sorry if I missed this, but could you elaborate a little bit on the merchant performance that drove earnings this quarter?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We had higher hedge prices than \u2013 versus last year and I'm assuming you're referencing to quarter-by-quarter or versus ...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yeah. Just quarter-by-quarter.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","So we had higher hedge prices than we had in quarter last year and we also had additional one at all of our units at Mills \u2013 at Manchester and at Fairless. So it really was a pricing and volume issue for us.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then would we talk to the hedging at Millstone? I didn't see any information or any hedging information for 2017. Any thoughts about that? What we're looking at in terms of the hedging for Millstone?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Paul. A couple of years ago, I'm changed our view on hedging based on the forward curves really being depressed. And as you know, at Millstone, what moves that market is winter weather. So as you saw from the hedge tables today, we have hedged out most of 2016 production hour from 60% to 83%. And as we go into any calendar year, we've always and we'll continue to hedge Millstone between 80% and 90% going into a calendar year. So we're right on schedule for 2016. For 2017, we have not hedged 2017 as of yet. We will see what winder curves look like as we go through, but as we sit here at this time next year, we will be in a very similar hit position for 2017 at Millstone. Then we have historically or just a little more opportunistic about it than we have been in the past.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then just on the \u2013 just a follow-up on the farm-out question, you guys are still pretty comfortable, it sounds like with the $450 million to $500 million 2015 through 2020 pre-tax opportunities there, is that still the case?","Thomas F.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. Instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow, if you would like to ask a question.","I would like to now turn the call over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning for the Safe Harbor Statement.","Tom Hamlin","Good morning and welcome to the first quarter 2018 earnings conference call for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our websites, register for email alerts, and view our fourth quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dominionenergy.com and dominionenergymidstream.com. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language; the earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates, and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our Company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures that we are able to calculate and report are contained in the earnings release kit and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners\u2019 press release.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results, financial plans and Dominion Energy's earnings guidance. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we\u2019ve made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the first quarter of 2018 which was at the top of our guidance range. The positive factors for the quarter relative to our guidance include higher margins from our merchant generation business, farmout transactions, growth in our electric transmission and gas distribution businesses, lower operating expenses and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated.","The principal negative factor for the quarter relative to guidance was about a one-month delay in the in-service date for Cove Point. GAAP earnings were $0.77 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were a $215 million pretax charge for future rate credits to our electric customers in Virginia, pursuant to recently enacted legislation; and a market loss of $43 million pretax on our nuclear decommissioning trust. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.","Moving to results by business segment. Our Power Delivery group produced EBITDA of $423 million in the first quarter, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Lower-than-expected operating expenses and better results from our electric transmission business drove the positive results. EBITDA for our Power Generation group was $748 million in the first quarter, which exceeded the top end of its guidance range.","Higher margins at our Merchant Generation business, reflecting colder weather; and excellent unit availability was the principal positive factor. The group also had lower-than-expected operating and maintenance expenses. Our Gas Infrastructure group produced EBITDA of $612 million in the first quarter, which was in the lower half of its guidance range.","As mentioned earlier, Cove Point exports in-service date was about one-month later than was expected at the time we issued guidance and therefore, made no contribution to earnings in the first quarter and was the primary factor in the underperformance. Partially offsetting the impact were the execution of two farm-out agreements as well as strong results from our gas distribution operations. Overall, we are pleased with the very strong results from our operating groups.","Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $79.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $75.4 million produced in the first quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $52.1 million, which was 18% above last year's first quarter. During the first quarter, we secured a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream to replace their prior credit line with the parent company.","On April 20, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.3340 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represented 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.23 times. On March 15, FERC made an unexpected announcement that reversed our long-held policy with regard to ratemaking for natural gas pipelines owned by master limited partnerships. The decision cost a selloff of MLPs, whereby $30 billion of market value was lost over the 10 trading days that followed the announcement.","We and others have filed for expedited rehearing of this issue with FERC. We believe it will take years before FERC's policy change has any impact on Dominion Energy Midstream Partners distributable cash flow, and any change will be immaterial to earnings at Dominion Energy.","We hope that the MLP market conditions will sufficiently improve to enable us to utilize DM to recycle capital investments in Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both of which remain MLP eligible and are not directly impacted by FERC's actions. As long as this issue at FERC is unresolved and pipeline MLPs continue to trade at such depressed levels, we do not believe we can access the capital markets for new equity at DM on reasonable terms. Therefore, absent a material improvement in the MLP capital markets and Dominion Energy Midstream's market price, we will not be making the previously planned drop-down of a portion of our investment in Cove Point this year.","Furthermore, we plan to restructure the incentive distribution rights at DM prior to returning to the market for new equity. In the meantime, we will continue to recommend 5% quarterly increases in distributions to the Board of Directors as long as our coverage remains above 1 times, supported by strong, stable cash flows from the current assets in the partnership.","Moving to Treasury activities at Dominion Energy. On our last call, we outlined a number of initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our aftermarket program in January. Second, we reduced our planned capital expenditures by $1 billion over the next two years. Third, we upsized Dominion's credit facilities to a total of $6 billion and added a $500 million line of credit for Dominion Midstream.","In light of the disruption in the capital markets for MLPs following FERC's policy changes, we have made a number of changes to our financing plans in order to achieve our financial objectives. Recall we were planning to use the MLP markets to upstream between $7 billion and $8 billion of cash to the parent between 2016 and 2020. A comparison of that original plan and our alternative plan is shown on Slide 8.","In the alternative plan, financing at MLP is being replaced with debt financing at Cove Point. Both proposals are primarily secured by the same cash flows, which are stable 20-year payments from our Cove Point export customers. We expect to complete the debt financings this year.","Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to issue an incremental $1.5 billion of common stock later this year, bringing our total for the year to $2 billion. With the exception of about $300 million per year that we plan to issue under our normal DRIP program, this completes our planned marketed equity issuance through 2020.","Finally, we have targeted some non-core assets for potential sale, including our share of the Blue Racer joint venture. These actions will enable us to achieve our parent company level debt reduction targets two years earlier than planned while still achieving our earnings growth targets.","Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy, operating earnings for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.70 and $0.80 per share, compared to $0.67 per share earned in last year's second quarter.","The positive factors for this year relative to the second quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, the absence of a refueling outage at Millstone, lower tax expense due to tax reform and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower solar-related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher share count.","Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first quarter, we now expect to produce results that are above the midpoint of our guidance range for the year. Our earnings growth rate estimate also remains 6% to 8% of 2017 through 2020.","So let me summarize by financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share landing at the top of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance in each of our businesses and a higher benefit than expected from tax reform.","We are taking aggressive steps to response to depressed MLP financial markets in light of FERC's unexpected policy change. 2018 operating earnings are still expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with our previous guidance. Our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rates remains 6% to 8% despite the changes made to our financing plans.","Finally, with regard to our dividend growth rate, we reiterate our intention to increase our dividend 10% in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to between 6% and 10% depending on the viability of the MLP market at that time.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning. Our employees\u2019 record-setting safety performance continued through the first quarter of 2018. An all-time loan OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 was reached in 2016 then last year that record was exceeded by an additional 10% improvement to a new record low of 0.60.","For the first quarter of this year, each of our business segments are meaningfully ahead of last year's record-setting pace. I'm very proud of our company-wide commitment to industry-leading safety performance.","Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our six units for the first quarter was 98.5%. On March 31, Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet achieved a new company record, operating for 538 days and counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. Previous record was 339 days set in 2012.","Weather-normalized electric sales for the first quarter were up 1.7% over the first quarter of 2017, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. During the quarter, six new data center campuses were connected, three more than last year's first quarter. Over the last 12 months, we've added over 400 megawatts of demand across 16 data centers and expect to continue to see strong growth.","Now for an update on our growth plans. Cove Point Liquefaction project was declared commercial on April 9. Cove Point is the first export facility to operate on East Coast of the United States and only the second new LNG facility to be constructed nationwide. Construction began on October 2014 following more than three years of federal, state local reviews and approvals.","At a cost of $4 billion, it is the largest construction project to date for Dominion Energy and is actually the largest project ever constructed in the State of Maryland. It has involved more than 10,000 craft workers with a payroll of more than $580 million. Liquefaction facility has nameplate capacity of 5.25 million tons per annum of LNG, equivalent to about 8.3 million gallons per day. All of the export output from Cove Point is fully contracted for 20 years, with a joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation and Tokyo Gas and an affiliate of Gale.","Cove Point will generate about $700 million of annual EBITDA to Dominion Energy. Also during the first quarter, the Charleston expansion project for Dominion Energy Carolina gas was complete and placed into service. The $125 million project included 60 miles of new natural gas pipeline and a new compressor station to deliver 80,000 dekatherms per day to customers in South Carolina. This is the largest expansion project investment in Carolina gas history and the third growth project completed since 2015 when Dominion Energy began operations in South Carolina.","In January 19, we began cutting trees along the pipeline route to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. Despite the late start, we were able to complete tree felling on more than 200 miles of the 600 mile project, which is about three quarters of our planned miles this year. We've also begun to receive approvals to begin full construction in numerous areas, including several compressor stations and other facilities.","Just this week, FERC granted our progress to begin full construction on a section of pipeline in the Supply Header project. We have filed with FERC to request full pipeline construction to begin in West Virginia and planned to make a similar filing for North Carolina in the near future. A prompt approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia DEQ, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file for a notice to proceed for mainline construction in Virginia as well.","The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 84% complete. All major equipment is set, and flushing of the combustion turbines is nearly complete. The primary natural gas line and metering and regulation stations are complete and awaiting final commissioning.","Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire this quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year. We are pleased that Connecticut's procurement for clean energy, including nuclear power, continues to progress. On February 1, Connecticut regulators determined that they will proceed with the solicitation for bids for new and existing carbon-free resources, which includes Millstone Power Station, to meet its public policy goals. Connecticut RFP will be issued by May 1, and responses are expected to be due in September.","Simultaneously, Millstone has the opportunity to participate in a proceeding determining that it is an at-risk resource. That designation would mean that Millstone's bid will be judged on price and non-price attributes such as carbon reduction, fuel diversity, economic impacts et cetera. Dominion plans to request at-risk designation, and looks forward to submitting a competitive bid to help Connecticut meet its energy and environmental goals while also stabilizing Millstone's revenue.","Finally, I want to make a few comments on our operative merger with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a proposal for upfront payments and ongoing bill reductions, which would substantially reduce the cost to customers in the abandoned nuclear development project.","We have received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission. We expect the SCANA shareholder approval this summer and still needs approval from the state utility commissions in North Carolina and South Carolina. We have participated in legislative hearings to explain our proposal to lawmakers who are considering temporary changes to the South Carolina Base Load Review Act.","Recent polling indicates very strong support for our proposal within the state, and a recent study by one of South Carolina's leading economists indicated that the state could see more than $18.7 billion in increased economic output as a result of our merger. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by regulators, and we can complete the transaction later this year.","So to summarize, our business has delivered record-setting operating and safety performance through the first quarter. Cove Point is in commercial operations. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header project and anticipate full construction throughout the entire project later this spring.","We are on track to be in service late next year. We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. And with our alternative financing plan, we expect to meet our earnings per share growth targets and credit objectives. Finally, we have reviewed our dividend growth assumptions with our board and reconfirm our policy to increase its dividend 10% annually in 2018 and 2019. The growth rate in 2020 is expected to between 6% and 10% depending upon the viability of the MLP market at that time.","With that, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shar Pourreza","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning.","Shar Pourreza","So just on the updated dividend language, it's good to see that you've maintained your support through 2019. The 2020 growth rate is somewhat of a wideband. Obviously, the book end just stimulated by whether the MLP markets might broken or not. So what sort of drives the dividend within the band? And more importantly, even at the bottom end at 6%, it\u2019s about $100 million in cash flow savings, so why even have this sort of change in language in the outer years especially since you should be able to maintain it beyond 2019?","Mark McGettrick","Sure. This is Mark. We can maintain it beyond 2019, but we have to be confident that the MLP markets going to be open to us long-term. And right now as we said in our prepared remarks that we're not quite sure where that's going to be. So we wanted to put a range out in 2020 that would be kind of with and without the MLP market. If we cannot access MLP market for those cash flows then it will drift into lower end of that range, we came it'll be back at the high end of that range.","Now why do we keep it at 10% for 2018 and 2019? Because we have plenty of cash flow in the current assets that are in our MLP without any further drops to support an elevated dividend for the next two years. After that if you say it's about $100 million, it's not a big number to us, but we would be cautious that payout ratio we would want to get higher if we can access our MLP equity on the long-term basis.","Shar Pourreza","Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly, you clearly highlight the FERC ruling has no material impact in your earnings, but you have sort of an updated plan that includes keeping Cove Point at the D level leverage at Cove Point, which should be more back levering opportunities. And at the end, if some equity issuances and asset sales, so there is some like sort of pushes and takes here, and you clearly \u2013 you do have some very stronger incremental growth opportunities like Atlantic Coast Pipeline 2 or 3, renewables. So just sort think about your long-term earnings CAGR. Are you comfortable continuing to sort of guide at your midpoint even beyond 2018? And what would actually drive you to the bottom end of this given what seems to be somewhat of a good runway?","Mark McGettrick","Shar, I think we are comfortable guiding to the midpoint. We always put a range out, but we always as we get the question to say we always target the midpoint. I think what could drive us to the bottom end; we're weather-sensitive company. And that could well take us to the lower end or the upper end depending on where we are. But you raise a good point, which we haven\u2019t heard from investors yet, and that is we were going to utilize and may still utilize the MLP structure to optimize cash flows back to the parent.","But if the markets don't open, and we do not do that, all of Cove Point's EBITDA that would have been in the MLP by the end of the decade will be at the parent. That's an incremental $350 million. So again, we have a lot of levers that we're going to evaluate. We feel very comfortable with the middle, and we'll work toward meeting that as we look like we're able to do this year as well.","Shar Pourreza","Terrific guys, and congrats on a result today.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Great quarter, I agree, really good performance. What do you think a reasonable timeframe of expectations is for getting to a point where you feel like you can come to a conclusion on whether you've achieved the right total cumulative outcomes in the asset sales? Are we looking at a process that takes six months, a year? When do you think we should be expecting us \u2013 when should we be expecting you to come back to us with proceeds and next steps?","Mark McGettrick","I think, Greg, by the end of the year, we'll have a real clear view on that. We may have a few things that we can clear up before that, but I would target fourth quarter for us to get some clarity around that. If you look at the bar chart, it's really not that big a number that we're targeting in asset sales. In terms of what's left to be done in the alternative financing plan, the majority of it is debt at the asset at Cove Point.","We expect to put that asset between $2.5 billion and $3 billion this year, probably towards a high end of that. That would keep it strongly investment-grade range. And that only leaves us $1 billion to maybe $1.5 billion on asset sales. So we think it's a very reasonable, conservative number. And we have a number of assets we're evaluating. And the one we specifically had mentioned is Blue Racer.","Now, I will say, although we are screening a number of assets, we don't believe we can get their value in the market. We\u2019re not going to sell the assets. But based on what we've heard so far, there'll be a lot of interest in the type of assets we have out there.","Greg Gordon","Great, so when I look at the bar chart, it's actually very helpful, thank you. There's two things that you have to achieve to meet your credit targets. One is there are certain percentage of holdco debt as a percentage of parent debt, which you clearly and quickly achieved through the Cove Point debt transaction, and that's fairly elegant and simple.","But then you're saying that to get your FFO-to-debt metric, you need just an incremental $1.5 billion of asset sale proceeds. So the $1.5 billion of equity that you did through the forward sale plus the 500 that you did at the beginning of the year plus the CapEx cuts you announced at the beginning of the year plus the $1.5 billion for asset sales that total of financing activity you're saying gets you to an FFO-to-debt metric that achieves your credit goal from that perspective? Is that \u2013 I know that was a lot, but is that fair?","Mark McGettrick","Yes, I think the only caveat I'd put on that is I wouldn't hang on $1.5 billion. I'll give you a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. But yes, we need to execute that over a period of time. Doesn't have to be done this year, but we need to execute it certainly in the period to meet our credit targets.","Greg Gordon","And then I know I\u2019m jumping the gun here, and time is definitively on your side in terms of trying to be deliberate in the way you think about DM, but if the MLP market not recover, is there a consolidation transaction that you could contemplate here because by my math, at least with DM in this valuation, that would not necessarily be a bad outcome for both shareholders.","Thomas Farrell","Greg, this is Tom. We're going to just see how this plays itself out. There's a variety of options with DM. You mentioned one that would be an option, and others are pursuing that. But we're in no rush. We think what FERC did was unreasonable outcome. There's been a lot of pushback on them about that. We'll just see how it plays itself out. We have plenty of cash available at DM to meet our distribution goals at least of the \u2013 for now, and so we'll see. We're going to give it time to play out, and then we'll consider options as we go along.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you, guys very much. Have a good day.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Hi, good morning. The kind of asset sale timing for Cove Point by year-end, is that actually getting outcomes of assets sales, so we'll know the money is coming in? Or is that kind of what the plan is by then?","Mark McGettrick","I think depending what assets we decide to move ahead with, Steve, you'll probably have some outcomes, and you may have some that might spill over into early 2019.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then what would it take to get the credit agencies to stabilize the rating or go off negative outlook, I guess? Do you need to complete that stuff? Or any sense of that?","Mark McGettrick","I don't really want to speak for the agencies, but I will say, Steve, we've been very transparent with the agencies. We've met with them a number of times along the process. They know exactly what our plan is, and I think in our opinion, and again you have your own, others would, but as we looked at other companies that have been impacted by tax reform on credit to the extent we have, we believe we have one of the most aggressive plans out there to address the shortfall in credit due to taxes.","And in my opinion, what agencies are looking at is execution on plans that have been announced and to work into the ranges that they've put out there on various metrics. So Moody, S&P, Fitch, they all have their own comments, I'm sure, on that. But again, I think if you look at what we've done, what we've announced, it's probably the most aggressive plan in terms of not only of speed but in amount, whether it be equity or asset sales or CapEx reduction of any company out there.","Steve Fleishman","Okay and then one other clarification on the 6% to 8% growth rate. Is there now like a base case that you're using? Or you're kind of taking these different scenarios of asset sales, keep DM, not DM and you are saying that all those scenarios you are in 6% to 8%, is that make sense the question?","Mark McGettrick","Yes, we have run multiple scenarios on it. We have assumptions on asset sales in terms of valuation. And that's why we want to put out this alternative plan bar chart to kind of give everybody the range that we were expecting in the area. We have built ourselves a lot of flexibility on the MLP by quickly addressing the financing needs to replace the $7 billion to $8 billion. But we do have an alternative plan that includes the MLP. It also gets us in the same range down the road. So again I think we have a lot of options but we are not going wait for the MLP market open up. We are going to address that immediately, and that's why we wanted to come out with the alternative plan and with a fair amount of detail around it.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Good morning. Just wanted to turn to the DM strategy a bit more here. With regards to kind of increasing the distribution till covers going to hit 1.0, can we kind of read into that, that any eventual impact in FERC you think would not be very material and pressure coverage at that point? Or is it matter of there's drop-downs that you could offset any holes at that point? Just trying to see if what we should be thinking about here?","Mark McGettrick","Well, as we said in our prepared remarks, we're going ahead and recommend to the board, of course, it's the board's decision, to go ahead and continue distribution increases at 5% quarterly level. As long as we coverage is above one-time. We do not anticipate, right now, dropping anything else into DM in 2018 with the current market conditions. And I think it'll take FERC a bit of time to evaluate all the requests and rehearing.","I don't want to put time frame on that. But that's \u2013 we have made decision to move ahead an alternate financing for this year. And so I think the earliest we might see a recovery in MLP market and DM share price where we would like to be open to drop something in it at a fair valuation will probably next year.","I would say that it's not just the reversal or clarification of the FERC opinion, but DM's market price is going to have to reach a level that makes sense for the parent to go ahead and drop with a lower cost of capital, which has been design of DM from day-one. And so our approach on this is to be patient, to pay the distribution as long as we can and hope that that this market opens back up as some clarity comes out of FERC.","Jeremy Tonet","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just one last one if I could. I was curious as far as \u2013 it's a very difficult question, but if there's just no resolution from FERC if things don't change, I guess how long until you feel like you want to take affect some new strategy at DM? Any thoughts you can provide as far as timeline there?","Thomas Farrell","Not at this time. We're just going to see what happens here, next few months at least. I\u2019m not going to put a timeframe on it.","Jeremy Tonet","That makes sense. Thank you very much.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So continuing on DM, just so that I understand. So if you add the debt to Cove Point, the project debt, how would it impact potential ability of you to drop this asset into DM? I mean, is it simply that cash flow \u2013 distributable cash flow from this asset would drop because you added a debt that would be amortizing? Is this the only issue that would be limiting your ability to drop it into the MLP assuming that the MLP market recovers?","Mark McGettrick","Angie, I\u2019ll give you a quick answer on that and that is it won't limit our ability to drop at DM. But Jim Chapman is here today, and let me have him go ahead and expand on the financing around Cove and how we would go ahead and drop that.","James Chapman","Hey, Angie. Good morning. It\u2019s Jim. Just try to clarify a little bit, I think from a traditional true project for net finance perspective, there's just very significant debt capacity at Cove. And if we had a need for that kind of capacity, we could end up with the financing structure that might have limitations like you seem to be suggesting in its terms. But our need right now is much more modest, as Mark mentioned, $2.5 billion to $3 billion Cove for the near-term. And with that kind of debt quantum, we expect a great deal of flexibility in the terms of that financing when it comes to things like prepay ability or transferability or amortization or not. So we just don\u2019t see the current financing plan being a constraint in any way on potential future drops into DM. Lots of flexibility in our plan.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. My other question is you are so convinced that the EBITDA or cash flow determents to these pipeline that DM currently holds is not going to be material following the FERC actions in the future. Why not just swap these assets? Why don't just take these assets into \u2013 and give DM a portion of either Cove Point or some other assets that doesn\u2019t have this issue. And once housed, you would state a reduction in the rates, don't need to your level of taxation versus zero? ","Mark McGettrick","Angie, that\u2019s a good question. I guess what we want to really get clarified not only for D and DM is, but for what was the intent of their policy change. It seems to be fairly broad brushed, and there is some incentives. If they don't change that, you could have a gross up of 21% as C Corp versus other assets that will be a pure MLP and that's something we obviously have to look at. But our whole approach on this is going to be \u2013 there\u2019s been a lot of interest and requested FERC to go ahead and provide clarity. We like to do that. We think that will springboard the market. If they do that and are supported by the MLP structure long-term, and we are going to be patient and wait for that.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And my last question, the 6% to 8% CAGR, what is the starting point? And is the Connecticut uplift included in the midpoint of that range?","Mark McGettrick","The starting point of that is middle of the range in 2017 through 2020. Millstone, I think, as I said maybe a year or so ago when we put that out there. We used the market curve when we put the new range out in Millstone that did have some growth in it between 2017 and 2020. But currently, it does not include any auction impacts or benefits that we might accrue in the Millstone option.","Angie Storozynski","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein","Good morning. How long do you think the \u2013 at DM or remain above the one-time metric and as you grow it 5% per quarter, is that going to be go \u2013 is that \u2013 are you saying it'll go through 2020 at that point then we have to make the decision?","Mark McGettrick","Michael, this is Mark. No, it's not going to go through 2020. It could certainly go through several quarters with current performance. We are evaluating how to extend it longer through changes in maintenance CapEx timing, et cetera. But it's a much shorter window than that we will be able to support 5%. But I think it's a window that gives for a reasonable time to address the request in front of them and takes us through, as I say, at least several quarters maybe longer.","Michael Weinstein","Gotcha, and then also I think you mentioned that the equity could be more of a range between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. Is that driven primarily by the asset sale proceeds that you might get or is there some other factor?","Mark McGettrick","Okay, that\u2019s not an equity comment. I'm sorry if I said it. I misspoke. Our equity is done besides DRIP with that referenced was to cash value from asset sales \u2013 $1 billion and $1.5 billion that we would bring back and reduce debt with sometime throughout this year and into next year potentially.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","Hi, guys.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning.","Praful Mehta","Good morning. So I guess the question on DM. Again going with the same thing, but just trying to understand from a flexibility perspective, it looks like you're paying up a little bit to keep the flexibility around DM and waiting for the market to recover. So, for example, obviously, for project financing to keep the flexibility around some of the options that Jim brought up would cost a little bit in terms of the project financing cost.","So first thing, wanted to understand what are the different elements that would cost D right now to kind of keep the flexibility around DM and if it is going to cost this much, is it worth keeping that flexibility or like an earlier question brought up, why not just buy back DM sooner?","Mark McGettrick","Well, Praful, this is Mark. I mean we see great value in financing flexibility of the MLP bringing cash back to the parent always have. I think shareholders of Dominion Energy are starting to appreciate that over the years. So it's worth something to us to keep that moving.","We also owe it to unitholders and Dominion Midstream to stay with the structure as long as we can if there's a reasonable chance that the market will rebound and that we can place equity at a reasonable level here and at a reasonable DM price.","Now the cost of D in terms of financing is going to be very minimal, we believe, because the cash flows are the same. You may well get better financing by putting it to asset within C Corp. initially before you were to let it travel. So we don't see that cost as being material at all, and it just allows us incremental flexibility to wait on DM until we see what's going to happen there.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha, fair enough. Just switching quickly to SCANA, how do you see it playing out from here? Do you concessions needed, you've kind of held the strong line and we don\u2019t think concessions are needed and this is kind of our offer? Do you see any change to that or do you see any room for flexibility around that at all?","Mark McGettrick","No. No flexibility. We made our offer, and they can \u2013 that\u2019s going through the political process now and that will \u2013 political, big, they adjourn next Friday \u2013 two Fridays from now. They're finished there for the year, the political sphere that has been in so far, but it's also going through the regulatory sphere, lots of questions going back and forth with typical regulatory process. We're having hearing scheduled in November. We'll have a result by December. So that's what we're going to proceed that way. We made our offer.","Praful Mehta","That\u2019s pretty clear. And the finally just on Millstone, it sounds like progress is pretty constructive in terms of the reports at least around Millstone. Any path forward you see, I guess what\u2019s the timing to kind of get all that done and get financial benefits from Millstone?","Thomas Farrell","Paul Koonce is here and he will answer that for you.","Paul Koonce","Good morning. Thanks for the question. The schedule that has been laid out by DEEP and PURA is that the RFPs will be issued in May. They will accept bids through September. And concurrent with that, if you determine if you're an at risk resource then you can \u2013 then as Tom mentioned in his comments you can pursue that designation which we plan to do, which means that you can also include into your bid non-price factors like zero carbon, fuel diversity, grid reliability.","They have a report DEEP and PURA. They have a report that [Leviton] produced that showed what it would cost consumers if Millstone were to retire. So I think there is some recognition to the value of Millstone. So really that is all supposed to play out between now and September with bids been approved by year end.","Praful Mehta","Great. Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Hi, good morning.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Byrd","Congratulations on Cove Point. Just actually following up on the last question on the Connecticut process. Could you remind us just on the at-risk designation, what that process looks like in terms of information to be submitted and the criteria used to get that designation?","Thomas Farrell","Sure. They have determined that it will be a confidential proceeding that made up a state agencies and Dominion and have agreed to provide validated cost information, so it will really be between the applicants, in that case us and the state agencies DEEP and PURA. They have invited a consumer advocate also participate in that proceeding. But it will be a confidential proceeding and it will be their determination whether they conclude the asset of that risk. And once they conclude that and then the other non-price factors will be taken into account.","Stephen Byrd","That\u2019s\u2019 helpful. And then just shifting to Virginia, just given legislation and just given the needs in the state, I\u2019m curious just if you wouldn't mind giving me your thoughts in terms of the potential for further capital expenditures in the state additional plans just as we think about growth in your core state of Virginia?","Thomas Farrell","Well, we've announced plans last fall about moving from our large projects to more programmatic programs. And I think the legislation that was enacted by the General Assembly this session supports that program. So I don't \u2013 there's no real changes to that program. I think we said $3.5 billion a year on average in growth capital in Virginia through the next for at least a decade. We don\u2019t see any changes to that. We think the legislation is supportive of it.","Stephen Byrd","Understood, so in other words, just familiar with the plan that you had laid out. There is not incremental capital over and above, whether it be for generation or any other sort of tax resource that could be additive in the near to medium term over and above the plans that you've already laid out?","Mark McGettrick","It\u2019s possible, but we have more planning to go along as we see.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, very good. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Mark McGettrick","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning guys.","Mark McGettrick","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","Could I ask just on the dividend comments about Dominion and the range on the growth rate? Do you have a specific payout ratio in mind you would want to be at in the longer term and sort of with and without DM capital raising scenarios?","Mark McGettrick","Hey Jonathan. As we laid out DM before we were in the mid 80s or so with DM as we win forward. We\u2019re pretty comfortable with that. I think over the next couple years, 2018, 2019 will be in a low to mid 80s. We\u2019re comfortable with that with cash flows coming out of DM. I don't think we want to get much higher than that, and over time, we probably bring that down to more reasonable utility like level if we don't access the MLP market, 74 of that this dividend rate was premised on we would not burden our regulated entities with anything more than 75% payout ratio.","In any thing incremental to that would have to come from non-regulated assets or the MLP, and we still have that view. But again, I think the math would tell you the next couple of years that, that payout will be in the low to mid-80s. And depending what happens with MLP long-term. We will start to bring that down.","Jonathan Arnold","Great, thank you. And then just secondly, on the last call, you talked the $1 billion that was coming out of sort of non-growth CapEx, 2018 and 2019. Have you made progress on identifying this specifically where that\u2019s going be in the back now and can you give us some inside into what types of things are there?","Mark McGettrick","We pretty much done identifying and we\u2019ve already started to execute a portion of it for 2018 looks like it make somewhat 50, 55 maybe 40 -60 between 18 and 19 as we looked at it. It will come out of maintenance capital. It will come out of a reprioritization of capital and reduction in areas that don\u2019t provide near-term earning support for us.","It will come of what we call general capital, which are building funds, things like that. So it\u2019s across the board, it something I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with. Our facility is in are good shape and our service liabilities in good shape and our service reliabilities in a very good shape, and our service reliabilities in a very good shape. So I think we can have a short-term pause in some of this maintenance capital and be fine for two years.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you, Mark.","Mark McGettrick","Thank you, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning's conference. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy the rest of your day."],"6799":["Dominion Resources, Inc.

On the call today we have Tom Farrell, CEO; Mark McGettrick, CFO and other members of senior management. At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation we will open the floor for questions. At that time instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning for the Safe Harbor statement.","Thomas Hamlin","Good morning and welcome to Dominion\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. During this call we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning\u2019s earnings release and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you have not done so I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for email alerts and view our second quarter earnings documents. Our website address is www.dom.com. In addition to the earnings release kit we have included a slide presentation on our website that will guide this morning\u2019s discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language, the earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management\u2019s projections, forecasts, estimates, and expectations.","Also on this call we will discuss some measures of our Company\u2019s performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our second quarter operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2014, as well as operating earnings before interest and tax commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained on Schedules 2 and 3 and Pages 8 and 9 in our earnings release kit.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick, and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the second quarter and our earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2014. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we have made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion reported operating earnings of $0.62 per share for the second quarter of 2014, which was in the upper half of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Excluding the $0.02 per share impact of mild or the normal weather second quarter operating earnings would have been at the top of our guidance range. Positive factors during the quarter were lower than expected operating and maintenance expenses, lower than expected interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate. Offsetting these positives were lower kilowatt hour sales due to mind weather and the impact of our unplanned outage at our Millstone nuclear plant.","On the year-to-date basis our 2014 operating earnings are $0.22 per share better than the first-half of 2013. GAAP earnings were $0.27 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a $191 million charge associated with Virginia legislation signed into law in April that permits Virginia Power to recover through base rates 70% of the cost previously deferred or capitalized through the end of last year relating to the development of third nuclear unit at North Anna and the development of offshore wind facilities.","A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to results by operating segment; at Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the second quarter was $243 million, which was below the midpoint of its guidance range. Kilowatt hour sales were below expectations largely due to milder than normal weather. Excluding weather, sales were up about 1% year-to-date, somewhat below expectations. Second quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $215 million, which was near the top of its guidance range. Higher transportation and storage revenues and lower operating expenses drove the strong results.","Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $306 million in the second quarter, which was below the midpoint of its guidance range. EBIT from utility generation was below expectations due to lower than expected kilowatt hour sales reflecting mild weather. EBIT from merchant generation was impacted by an unplanned outage at Millstone. A loss of offsite power caused both units to shut down automatically as designed. Millstone unit 2 was unavailable for three days and unit 3 was unavailable for nine days.","On a consolidated basis, our effective tax rate was 31% for the quarter, which was below our guidance of 33%. Interest expenses were also a little lower than our expectations. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date operating results.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities, funds from operations were $1.7 billion for the first half of the year. Regarding liquidity; we had $4.5 billion of credit facilities at the end of the second quarter. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $3.2 billion. And taking into account cash and short-term investments we ended the quarter with liquidity of $1.6 billion.","During the second quarter we executed final agreements with our existing credit providers to increase our credit lines by $1 billion from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, the terms of which will run for five years. Gas Holdings was also added as a potential borrower under these facilities. For statements of cash flow and liquidity please see pages 14 and 25 of their earnings release kit.","Now moving to our financing plans, earlier this month we issued $1 billion of mandatory convertible securities. The issue was very well received by the market and we thank those of who participated. During the second quarter, we also filed the Dominion Gas Holding\u2019s S4 registration statement with the SEC. This quarter\u2019s 10-Q filing will include financials for Dominion Gas for the first time. The $1.2 billion of 144A bonds issued last fall are expected to be exchanged for registered securities next week.","We\u2019ve also filed a combined Shelf registration for future debt issuances including expectations for debt issue of approximately $1 billion for Dominion Gas in the fourth quarter. On March 28th we filed an S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for initial public offering of common units representing limited partner interest in Dominion Midstream Partners LP, a master limited partnership whose initial asset will be a preferred equity interest in Cove Point. We expect to commence the offering later this quarter after receiving work approval to begin construction of the Cove Point export project.","Now to earnings guidance. Our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2014 is $0.90 to $1.05 per share compared to $1 per share for the third quarter of 2013. Mild weather impacted last year\u2019s third quarter earnings by $0.04 per share. Last year\u2019s results also included $0.07 per share from the contribution of the TL 388 pipeline to Blue Racer.","The midpoint of this year\u2019s third quarter guidance range is flat to last year\u2019s results when normalized for weather and the asset drop. Positive factors for the quarter included returns in normal weather, higher revenues from our Rider projects and higher merchant generation margins. Offsetting factors include higher interest expenses and higher operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the year remains at $3.35 to $3.65 per share. Through the first half of the year we are up $0.22 per share or 15% over last year.","As to hedging you can find our hedge positions on page 27 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call we have made no changes to our hedges at Millstone.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.62 per share for the second quarter of 2014, in the upper half our guidance range. Excluding the impact of mild weather, earnings would have been at the top of our range. Lower than expected operating expenses, interest and taxes offset mild weather and the impact of the unplanned outage at Millstone. Year-to-date operating earnings were $0.22 per share or 15% higher than a comparable period in 2013.","Our financing plans for the remainder of 2014 include a debt offering for Dominion Gas Holdings and the initial offering of Dominion Midstream Partners. And finally our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2014 is $0.90 to $1.05 per share. Our operating earnings guidance for the full year remains $3.35 to $3.65 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning. Our business units delivered strong operational and safety performance in the second quarter. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well completing two refueling outages last quarter. As Mark mentioned a loss of offsite power triggered an automatic shutdown at Millstone power station on May 25. The loss was due to a problem with the local utilities of substations not the generating facility and backup emergency diesel generator maintained both units in a safe and stable condition until offsite power was restored.","We continue to make progress on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,329 megawatt Warren County combined-cycle plant is progressing on schedule and on budget. Start-up and commissioning activities are underway and one of the combustion turbines completed first fire last week. The project is about 90% complete and is expected to be in service during the fourth quarter.","Last August we began construction of the 1,358 megawatt combined-cycle facility in Brunswick County Virginia and expect that plant to be in service by mid-2016. Currently there are about 680 workers on the site. Procurement is 92% complete and all major equipment has been delivered. Overall construction is about 20% complete and is on time and on budget.","The conversion of Bremo Units 3 and 4 from coal to natural gas was completed during the second quarter on time and on budget. Construction is also on schedule for six solar projects totaling 139 megawatts purchased earlier this year from Recurrent Energy. Long term power purchase, interconnection, engineering, procurement and construction as well as operation and maintenance agreements have been executed for each of the projects. All these facilities are expected to reach commercial operation later this year.","In the second quarter Dominion acquired two solar development projects in Tennessee and announced plans to acquire [seven] projects in California latter this year. These acquisitions will bring our total solar generating portfolio to 232 megawatts. Once constructed, all of these projects are expected to qualify for the federal investment tax credit. We\u2019re working on identifying and acquiring additional solar projects to support our plan to grow the company\u2019s solar portfolio by up to 250 megawatts this year.","At Dominion Virginia Power we have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the second quarter $394 million of transmission assets were placed into service, including the Mt. Storm to Doubs 500 KV rebuilt project which was finished a year early. Year-to-date in service total is over $500 million. Electric transmission\u2019s capital budget for growth projects, including [inaudible] maintenance and security related investments continues to remain strong through the remainder of the decade. Progress on our growth plans for Dominion Energy continues as well. Construction is underway on the Allegheny Storage Project and we have begun to accept injections.","Construction is also underway on our Natrium-to-Market project. Both of these are on budget and on schedule to commence full service by November. We\u2019ve had continued success in providing incremental transportation service as a result of the growing production within our region. We described these as producer outlet projects taking advantage of the flexibility of Dominion Energy\u2019s pipeline network to provide incremental services with shorter lead times and relatively small capital investment.","Dominion Energy signed agreements for two new expansion projects during the second quarter; the [inaudible] project and Western Access 2. Since last year we have announced nine such projects totaling just under 2 billion cubic feet per day by 2016. Two of the projects [Whitey Receipts] and Lebanon II were replaced into service in June both on time and on budget.","On our last call we announced that Dominion Southeast reliability project, a non-binding open season for firm transportation services through a new pipeline expanding from the Marcellus and Utica production regions to markets in Virginia and North Carolina. This proposed 42 inch pipeline would extend approximately 550 miles.","The Southeast project is designed to provide initial service of up to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. The response has been very strong. We\u2019re in negotiations with multiple parties and hope to secure necessary agreements to solidify our project plan within the next 60 days.","Subject to the conclusion on negotiations we expect to submit a FERC pre-filing in the fourth quarter with firm transportation service available as early as November 2018. The Utica region continues to be very active. Through the middle of July a total of 1,386 horizontal Utica permits have been issued and 942 wells have been drilled, an increase of 33% in wells permit and 39% in wells drilled so far this year. The number of producing wells has increased by 75% from 270 to 472 also in just the past six months. A second, 200 million cubic feet per day processing plant at Blue Racer\u2019s Natrium facility became operational in the second quarter and based on new wells coming online should be at full capacity soon.","Fractionation capacity at Natrium will be expanded from 46,000 barrels per day to 126,000 barrels by March of next year. In addition a 2 million cubic per day processing plant at Burn, Ohio is presently under construction and is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter.","Now an update on our Cove Point project, in May the Maryland Public Service Commission approved the CPCM an air permit. Last week we received approval from the State Board of Public Works to construct a temporary pier. On May 15, FERC issued its environmental assessment. We expect to receive FERC order approving the project in the next few weeks and begin construction shortly thereafter. The Cove Point Liquefaction is expected to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2017.","Before I answer questions I want to comment on the recent Greenhouse Gas emission goals introduced by the environmental protection agency. As you know EPAs proposed guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce tier two emissions from existing power plants. We like other utilities are evaluating the guidelines and the proposed state reduction targets. We certainly believe it will increase the industry\u2019s utilization of natural gas current production which in turn should increase the need for pipelines and other related infrastructure.","As the states develop and the EPA approves their respective compliant plans we will continue to evaluate the challenges and the many opportunities these changes will bring. So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter. The Warren county and Brunswick construction projects are proceeding on time and on budget. Our Blue Racer joint venture Dominion East, Ohio and Dominion Transmission continue to capitalize some of the growth opportunities in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.","We look forward to receiving our remaining regulatory approval, to begin construction of our Cove Point Liquefaction project. And finally we look forward to our initial public offering by Dominion midstream partners later this quarter. Thank you and we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. At this time we\u2019ll open the floor for questions. (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Can you hear me?","Thomas Farrell","We can hear you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Excellent so first just a little bit of clarity on the Southeast project if we could, can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics obviously you talked about a pretty expedited timeline here to get the details. Could you just frame it little bit, where you\u2019re thinking about those customers and how you\u2019re seeing competitors frame up, I mean it seems like you\u2019re down at the end of the fairway here in terms of getting the project off the ground now?","Thomas Farrell","Good morning. We are, as I said in negotiations with a number of parties. We expect to assuming they are successful conclude all that within the next 60 days. It\u2019s a big pipe, it\u2019s 550 miles, 42 inches is a big pipe, initial sizing would contemplate $1.5 billion or 1.5 billion a day of capacity. That necessarily means we\u2019re concentrating on end users rather than producers. There\u2019s two ways to go about that, one is to get demand from producers. But producers got to sell to somebody. So our concentration is on developing a pipe that would be useful for end users. But it all we\u2019ll have to see how it goes but we expect to conclude all of that within about 60 days.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Excellent, can you just clarify quickly when it comes to in next few weeks what exactly is your expectation for approval. This is in theory outside of the context of an open meeting for Cove Point?","Thomas Farrell","The next meeting your point Julien of course has assumed incorrectly that FERC does not have a public meeting in August, their next public meeting is in September. So the answer to your question is yes. FERC actually does most of its orders these days Julien outside the public meetings. The commentary had closed in June. All the comments have been posted and they are going through their work. They work very diligently at FERC year around. So we\u2019re hopeful that we would get what we would call a notational approval in next few weeks. If not that would take us through the public meeting in September.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Excellent and then the last detail do you almost had the solar mile marker you set for yourself here, why 250 in terms of total megawatts, I mean is there a potential of scale of the renewables business little bit more is that really kind of what the tax have to take cost for?","Thomas Farrell","It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the tax upside. We saw 250 was a number that would allow us to get really experience with a variety of different technologies in different places to see how they work and we\u2019re continuing to evaluate our solar strategy as we go through the balance of the year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Excellent thank you very much.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks good afternoon Julien covered a couple of my questions, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of whether normal demand sorry if I missed you earlier in the presentation I hopped on a little late but in particular it looks like industrial sales were up quite substantially in the quarter, and have you seen your business get back on track after the setbacks we saw last year because of the government issues?","Mark McGettrick","Greg this is Mark. Actually we\u2019re little disappointed with sales year-to-date. We had hoped to be on a weather normalized basis about 1.5% sales growth this year over last and we\u2019re lagging that down around 1%. We had seen very strong industrial sales growth, although again industrial processes are pretty small piece of the pie. We\u2019ve also seen extremely strong datacenter growth but at the same time our residential and smaller commercial growth has lagged what we would have expected to be the growth rate.","So right now we\u2019re looking at about 1% and we hope these other two areas recover as we ramp up throughout the year and to just remind you of the sensitivity a 1% change in sales for us depending on customer class is between $0.04 and $0.05, so manageable number for us but we like to see a little stronger.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay so you\u2019re talking about a $0.02 or $0.03 issue if you are 50 basis points behind?","Mark McGettrick","If we finish at on 1% versus 1.5% that\u2019s right.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay do you have any sense of what\u2019s driving the shortfall in residential, was it just slower than expected growth in housing, is it higher than expected conservation, is it distributed DG or is it too difficult an analysis to nail that down?","Mark McGettrick","No, I think we lean much more toward \u2013 housing is not recovering quite as quickly as we thought. Although we have growth in new connects year-over-year it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve had historically so we\u2019re going to need to have more new housing starts to be able to achieve the residential growth rate that we want.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Great, can I ask one follow up question on the pipeline project here, your body language is pretty strong on being able to get to the finish line on a rather large project, there are competing projects in the region, what gives you the confidence that you have the competitive advantage on this pipe to bring the commercial viability?","Thomas Farrell","Well Greg, first good morning, there are a lot of gas; there is a lot of infrastructure even to get out of the basin. So that would necessarily conclude that only one pipe lever be built out of the basin. And you have to draw your conclusions, we had a very successful open season and we are working hard to conclude it within the next 60 days.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks guys, take care.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah hi good morning just first, I know every fall you guys give your kind of five year CapEx update and I\u2019m sure now not the time to go through the details of that but maybe at a high level you can talk a little bit about thematically where things are headed there?","Thomas Farrell","Steve you\u2019re correct. We typically give an update on five year capital outlook in the fall and we would expect to continue that trend this fall. I think by way of comparison as we commented quickly we had another year or two but we expect our capital expenditures actually be up over the five year period from what you saw last year. We\u2019ve announced a lot of new projects particularly in our energy business, we\u2019ve announced the solar projects this year and so we would expect CapEx to be up as we present this fall.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just one technical issue, you mentioned normal weather in terms of your guidance for Q3 and the rest of the year and seems like it\u2019s been anything but that. So just as you are thinking about kind of the weather issues for the rest of the year do you have ability to offset if things are a lot below normal this summer or should we assume it just is what it is and you will just update us when we get to the end of the quarter?","Thomas Farrell","Yeah, I think it\u2019s also really Steve, it is true in July you know weather cost us about $0.03 for the month but you know August is a strong month for us and September can be an unusually strong month depending on what the pattern is. So it\u2019s not being conceivable that would be made up just in weather as we go through the rest of the summer or the rest of the year.","So I think you know we\u2019ll hold for an update on that until we see a larger piece of what the quarter is going to look like and what the forecast for the fourth quarter is going to look like.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hi, Good morning guys.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Just following-up on the pipeline question, with your end user demand kind being the driver for contracting. Is that customer base picking this up because they are trying to get to a cheaper form of gas or is this incremental demand that they are trying to service with new gas generation and that sort of stuff?","Thomas Farrell","Dan I don\u2019t think that we should talk to what our customer are contemplating but as we have said when we have talked about the Southeast pipe and as we have gone around and spoken, not only to the customer but to the communities involved in the political establishments that will be affected. It\u2019s important the Southeast needs a little more, as there is no question that greenhouse gas law is going to move people to more gas. It\u2019s just going to happen. Southeast does not have an pipeline infrastructure to deal with that situation and one single pipe can get challenged for operational issues and you just can\u2019t that\u2019s not going to be tolerable for folks as we go through the next few decades.","So I think the reliability is very part of it and having access to a different basin and that basis potential differentials between what the folks have been use to for all these years with Gulf of Mexico et cetera having Southeast access to the Marcellus and Utica makes it very attractive that\u2019s why you have all these competing projects.","So let\u2019s see how it goes but I think that\u2019s a combination of reliability, concern about expansion potential for various fleets and having access to a different basin. And like I said there as you all have noted there is a lots of projects, maybe ours won\u2019t come to fruition. We feel good about where we are and there are maybe others.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, thank you for that. And then Tom the Artificial Island transmission project was kind of the first test of [order 1000s] going to work. Given that it went to an incumbent for the right of ways, how do you guys think about kind of these transmission opportunities outside of our footprint, is that affecting maybe some capital allocation decisions?","Paul Koonce","Dan good morning this is Paul Koonce. Yes know the initial decision went to the incumbent but last week the PJM Board sent a notice to the four finalists, Dominion being the one that they would like to take a second look at the PJM manager\u2019s decision. So we are still very much engaged on the opportunity presented by Artificial Island. We have in the past challenged PJM manager\u2019s decision and prevailed. We can\u2019t say for certain that we will do so again but that decision, about who builds Artificial Island is still an open question.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, thank you and then I guess just last question on guidance for the quarter with the $0.03 negative in July, does that kind of calibrate us to a little bit below the midpoint from starting-point today or did the range already take into account this recent drag in July?","Mark McGettrick","Dan, it\u2019s Mark. We always put ranges out based on normal weather just been our practice. So if that $0.03 holds and if there is no offsets in other areas that would guide you to below the midpoint. But let\u2019s see what the rest of the quarter present to us in terms of weather and other earnings drivers.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Very good, thank you guys.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you very much. I guess my first question relates to the 250 in solar. Can you give us an idea of what that would do to your effective tax rate next year because this year I think you are like at a 32% projected tax rate?","Thomas Farrell","Well our assumption on that Paul is that firstly all those projects will be completed in 2014. So for the effective tax rate for next year that wouldn\u2019t be an impact.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","What I\u2019m saying with the production tax credits wouldn\u2019t that \u2013 that would presumably lower your effective tax rate next year?","Thomas Farrell","Most of the tax credits associated with these projects are one time credits, investment tax credits that we would take in 2014.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, and then can you just give us a sense of what is driving the decision to either stay at 250 megawatts or potentially move to a higher level in terms of solar program?","Thomas Farrell","We have been looking across all of our \u2013 as we do constantly, we go into a process looking all of our capital allocation, what all of our opportunities re. Solar we think is going to be \u2013 is going to an increasing part of the energy infrastructure mix, being able to do it at utility scale we think is going to important particularly with this \u2013 and we thought that a couple of years ago which is why we started down this path but in particular because of the proposed greenhouse gas rules, and the four pillar or cornerstones, whatever you want to call them that EPA has set out as guide posts for states, we think solar could be useful across our service territories, not like it is in many other parts of the country. But we ought to be able to do some advances there.","So we are learning, we are learning about installation and maintenance et cetera as we continue to look at whether we will deploy it elsewhere. So I think the short answer is to say, we are going to continue to evaluate. We may decide to stay at 250 and we may decide to expand it. But we will know more about that later in the year.","Mark McGettrick","Hi, Paul this is Mark. Just to give you a data point on that. This is not new for us do you recall eight or nine years we built several wind projects earlier in the development period for the same reason that Tom just outlined on solar. But we elected not to expand the wind program because it didn\u2019t fit our business profile going forward. So the solar development scale here is at about the same level as we started wind. We\u2019ll just see what happens to it going forward.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","And then my last question is with respect to the construction of Cole Point do you have any provisions with the contractor\u2019s sort of guaranteeing that will be competed in 2017?","Paul Koonce","Paul, this is Paul Koonce, we have a good EPC contract we have a certain amount of time built into the schedule to provide for certain permitting delays and none of that has been impacted to-date.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. So there is nothing that is sort of ironclad in your contract that it needs to be completed by the end of \u201817 but right now everything look as if it will be completed by \u201817?","Thomas Farrell","Everything is right on schedule.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. Just another question on the timing of Cole Point and the MLP IPO, you mentioned you\u2019d move forward the IPO after receiving FERC approval, you of course still need the final DOE on FDA approval to move forward with the project. So just curious how you are thinking about that and what would give you the comfort to move forward with just the FERC approval on hand?","Thomas Farrell","No, we have the DOE approval, we got it a year ago.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, I was under the impression that was a big conditional approval and you still need a final approval after receiving the FERC approval.","Thomas Farrell","No, I can understand your confusion but the word that word appears in all of these final approvals because there is a law that it can be suspended if something you know \u2013 a variety of things happen. DOE has said it\u2019s never going to do that. So I think that\u2019s a technical term they use in the DEO permits but we have final approvals which we got last September so, once we get the FERC final order which is construction permit in effect, we will proceed.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Got it, thanks. And then on the Southeast reliability project, I just wanted to clarity 1.5 billion is both expected volume and the CapEx?","Thomas Farrell","No, it\u2019s just the volume I said capital and I\u2019m correcting myself, I hope quickly and I appreciate your pointing it out. The $1.5 billion a day in demand in throughput the capital will be more than half and we will talk about that \u2013 assuming we conclude these negotiations which we hope in the 60days we will have more details about the capital and how it will all play up.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","And when should we expect to hear more on that, where you make an announcement, when you have the agreements or should we just look for the pre-filing to single that?","Thomas Farrell","Well, we just have to let that sit. I don\u2019t \u2013 we are assuming we conclude the negotiations as part of the negotiations we would be talking to the customers et cetera about how they want to go about announcing. We don\u2019t \u2013 we try not \u2013 we don\u2019t do things unilaterally in complex projects like this.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, and would you say that this project is contemplated in your long-term earnings guidance consistent with it or could it present upside?","Thomas Farrell","No, included in our present plans.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Got it, thanks. And just one last question and follow-up on the Artificial Island project. I believe part of the reason PGM is kind of going back to the final four was because one of your competitors there offered to kind of backstop the project. Is that something you\u2019re going to do and do you think that will be necessary to win the project?","Paul Koonce","This is Paul again. We did notice that Alice Power did offer a cap. That sort of brings to bear sort of a philosophical question as to the quality of the construction is such important part of the energy infrastructure, the electric grid, how the commission deals with that is an open question and they also want to revisit, we believe an alternative solution which we put forward which will be less costly, technically more interesting. So I wouldn\u2019t base the PGM board\u2019s decision totally on the price for power offered. I think there is a number of elements that they want to review.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks a lot guys, very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy your day."],"7156":["Dominion Energy, Inc.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steven Ridge, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Steven Ridge","Good morning and welcome to the first quarter 2019 earnings conference call for Dominion Energy. I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website to view the earnings press release, a slide presentation that will follow this morning's prepared remarks and additional quarterly disclosures. Schedules and the earnings release kit are intended to answer detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting and the Investor Relations team will be available immediately after the call to answer additional questions.","The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which we are able to calculate and report, are contained in the earnings release kit.","Joining today's call are Tom Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Chapman, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and other members of the management team. I will now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Chapman","Thanks, Steve. Good morning. Dominion Energy reported first quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.10 per share compared to our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. Otherwise strong performance across our businesses was impacted by unusually mild weather in Virginia and South Carolina, which reduced utility earnings by about $0.06 per share. As a general indicator, heating degree days were 5% and 19% below normal in Virginia and South Carolina respectively. Various initiatives, primarily in power delivery and power generation were successful in offsetting some of this headwind and when adjusted for utility weather of $0.06, operating earnings for the quarter were $1.16 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range.","Operating segment performance for the first quarter is shown on slide 4. GAAP earnings for the quarter are negative $0.86 per share, which were driven primarily by the expected charges related to SCANA merger commitments and the early retirement of certain cold reserve Virginia utility-generating units.","Slide 5 highlights the pretax drivers of adjustments to reported earnings. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on schedule two of the earnings release kit. On March 25, we held two sessions for investors that provided updates on capital investment, earnings and dividend growth outlook, financing plans, expense control initiatives, as well as the first-of-its-kind sustainability and ESG-focused sessions, highlights of which are shown on slide 6. It is worth noting that we continue to have full confidence in the earnings growth and other targets we've highlighted during those meetings.","We are very happy with the in-person and online attendance and thank all of those who were able to participate and provided feedback following the event. Please note that the meeting materials including the webcast replay continue to be available on our website, which we encourage all to review thoroughly. Also during this quarter, we continue to be engaged across a number of important though less public initiatives as follows: First, as announced at our Investor Day, we are preparing to restructure our reporting segments, a meaningful change to the way we manage our businesses and report their financial performance.","We continue to forecast that this transition will take until late 2019 to complete. The Alternate Breakdown Structure or ABS, provides a preliminary view of our future intended reporting segment results and will be posted shortly after this call to our Investor Relations website. The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our business, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures. Second, progress is being made on our flat O&M and voluntary retirement program initiatives discussed at the end of March. We're very intentionally combing through each of our segments, all of our assets in every location to identify opportunities to embrace technology, increase efficiency, improve business processes, and enhance the customer experience. Results of the voluntary retirement program discussed at our Investor Day, including response rates from eligible employees an assessment of backfill needs and financial impacts are still being quantified although I would note that preliminary response rate was robust. We expect to be able to quantify these results on the next quarter's call.","Moving now to operating earnings guidance on slide 7. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these guidance ranges. For the second quarter, we are initiating guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs as well as a contribution from the Southeast Energy Group.","Negative factors as compared to last year include Millstone refueling outage timing, the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. We're also affirming our expectation for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40.","Positive 2019 full year drivers relative to last year, include the growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from the Southeast Energy Group, a full year of Cove Point Liquefaction operations at run-rate production levels and expense control initiatives.","Negative drivers relative to last year are expected to include the impact of the 2018 non-core assets sales, share issuances and a return to normal weather. Finally, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% per year through 2020 and 5% plus thereafter.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Farrell","Thank you Jim, and good morning. On April 10, we were tragically reminded of the everyday risks our colleagues face when a fellow employee was fatally injured as a result of a gas line rupture caused by an unrelated third-party contractor installing fiber in Durham, North Carolina. We are deeply saddened by the loss of this dedicated employee. Our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to all who were impacted, including the family of the store owner who also perished in the incident.","Turning to business updates. We've provided a comprehensive update at our recent Investor Day meetings, so my remarks are brief. First, a reminder that safety is our core value. It is at the heart of our corporate culture and we will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic, zero injuries.","Turning now to slide 8. As highlighted at our Investor Day, we operate premium state-regulated utilities that center around five key states, which account for 65% to 70% Dominion Energy's projected operating income. During the first quarter, we saw a continued development of positive utility fundamentals across each jurisdiction.","In Virginia, we set a company record for new data center connects and had the most total new customer connections in the first quarter since 2012. In South Carolina, our quarter-over-quarter customer growth was 1.7% for electric operations, which is the highest quarterly growth rate since 2008.","Gas customer growth was 3.1% which is in line with pre-recession levels of growth. Gas distribution utilities in Utah and North Carolina reported strong customer growth of around 2.5% each. And in Ohio, we saw 1.3% growth in throughput levels driven in part by the lowest unemployment rate in Ohio in the last 18 years.","These summary metric highlights -- the summary metrics highlight the opportunities we have to deploy capital in regulated programs that allow us to provide best-in-class customer service across our regulated footprint.","I will now review recent developments across the company. Last month, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved rider recovery under our US-3 application, which represents 240 megawatts cost of service sold with a $410 million capital investment through 2020. We also announced a partnership with Facebook that includes six solar projects, totaling 350 megawatts and approximately $600 million of investment also through 2020.","In coming weeks, we will begin construction on the $300 million Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, which was approved by the Commission last November. These developments support the commitment we have made to have 3000 megawatts solar or wind resource in operation or under development in the state of Virginia by 2022.","On April 9, we celebrated the one-year anniversary for commercial service of the Cove Point liquefaction facility. In its first year, the plant liquefied over 200 billion cubic feet of natural gas and met over 90% of customer nominations. That success rate improved to 100% during the first quarter of this year. In addition to an extra quarter of operation, Cove Point's record of sustained strong operational performance will contribute to our 2019 financial results relative to last year.","With regard to Millstone, two weeks ago we hosted Governor Lamont and his team at the plant to celebrate the 10-year agreement, signed on March 15 to provide critical zero-carbon power to the state and region.","We expect regulatory approval of the agreement later this year and the contract to become effective shortly thereafter. We will resume the practice of providing hedging information for Millstone once the contract is approved and effective.","We are entering our fifth month of integrating the Southeast Energy Group. Our team members are working diligently across geographies to socialize best practices and introduce common systems where needed. While these integrations are major undertakings, we are advantaged by lessons learned from our Questar integration. We remain focused on ensuring that throughout the process we provide a safe and reliable customer experience.","Turning now to slide 10. At our investor meeting in March, we announced that we are permanently retiring several generating units, most of which have been placed into cold reserve. Many of these units were designed to consume coal and this step will help us achieve our recently updated company-wide emissions targets shown here.","Our new targets include a 55% and 80% reduction in gross carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by 2030 and 2050, respectively. We also have an ambitious methane reduction goal that calls for a 50% reduction in gross emissions from our gas infrastructure business by 2030. These represent meaningful progress beyond our company's already impressive achievements over the last decade.","On a related note we're pleased that earlier this week the SCC approved all 11 of our proposed demand-side management programs citing the Grid Transformation & Security Act support for those programs. As a reminder these program costs including a margin are recoverable. Additional ESG information is included in the appendix for your review.","And finally, with regard to Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header. As shown on slide 11 an appeal to the Supreme Court with regard to the Appalachian Trail crossing will be filed before the end of the second quarter. We believe that the Solicitor General of the United States will join that appeal.","We continue to pursue legislative and administrative options as well. Oral arguments on the biological opinion case are scheduled for next week with a decision expected within 90 days. We expect to recommence construction on the project in the third quarter. There has not been any change to expect the time line or costs since our last earnings call or Investor Day meeting.","In summary, we achieved weather normalized operating earnings per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance. We continue to see strong growth fundamentals in our state regulated utility footprints.","We continue to make progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit our customers and we have a strong environmental social and governance story. And we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics.","With that, we will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Greg Gordon Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning.","Tom Farrell","Good morning.","Greg Gordon","Two questions. One -- and I appreciate if you're limited in how much you can answer this. But as it pertains to options for ACP, it's probably as if not more frustrating for investors as it is for you to watch this political process delay what is obviously a necessary piece of infrastructure. But the way that this -- that you're going to face construction here, is it possible that the portion of the pipeline that's impacted by the biological permit, assuming that that's resolved and you complete construction, could still become a functioning infrastructure asset by backhauling gas off Transco and still serve your customers should you have an extensive period of uncertainty with regard to resolving the Appalachian Trail issue?","Tom Farrell","Greg, I'll start the answer. And Diane, can fill in any details. The Transco backhaul solution is not a solution, does not meet our customers' needs on any kind of long-term basis. Our customers need infrastructure from a different supply basin. For example, the state of North Carolina has exactly one pipeline that serves the entire state, Transco. That's why the policy-makers in North Carolina ask for additional gas infrastructure to be built into North Carolina that is not Transco. It's in addition to Transco's lines. We have full confidence in the biological opinion case. The Forest Service follow the guidelines that were given to them by the court and completed that reissuing of the biological opinion. And so we'll see what happens, but we believe we'll be under construction in the third quarter. Diane you can answer additional points on the timing.","Diane Leopold","No. We are talking with the customers and we have looked at phased-in service and we will -- we're in active negotiations with them. They have reaffirmed the need for a permanent solution to be able to have the independent infrastructure and supply to meet their needs.","Greg Gordon","Great. And just as a follow-up to that the -- you're very clear in your presentation that that Supreme Court path is the primary path here to hopefully get a solution. You continually allude to these other potential administrative options, but haven't wanted to \"negotiate against yourselves\" in public by articulating what they might be. Is there anything at this point that you can articulate with regard to those solutions? Or are you still not feeling like that's appropriate to discuss?","Tom Farrell","Greg, there are several. But at this point we think it's better to stand where we are.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thanks. And then finally, I know it's extremely early in the year, but do you still feel comfortable that the guidance range -- the midpoint of the guidance range reflects a good baseline for the year?","Jim Chapman","Hey Greg. It's Jim. Yes we do.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Chris Turnure, JP Morgan.","Chris Turnure","Good morning. Jim, I think you made it very clear that you're working hard on the cost-cutting effort here and that you'll have the quantitative details for us next quarter. But I'm wondering if you can help us understand by segment kind of where those cost cuts might be able to fall through to your bottom line or benefit you and if there would be a material amount of upfront cash costs that would be excluded from adjusted EPS?","Jim Chapman","Good morning. Yes. Thanks for that. We do look forward to providing more update on the second quarter in particular as it relates to our voluntary retirement program which we announced at our Investor Day on March 25. But there really are two parts of this. One is a continuation that what we've been talking about since the last call, which is a flat O&M initiative and which is across our business segments. And that really relates to a large number of small improvements across as I mentioned in my prepared remarks every segment, every location, every asset: leaning in on technology opportunities finding better business processes et cetera.","That flat O&M is on a normalized basis. And by that I mean that some of the savings will fall to the bottom line. And some of that in particular as it relates to the rider O&M, for example, accretes to the benefit of the customer. But we do expect flat O&M to be a driver for the foreseeable future on a bottom-line basis for our earnings per share growth.","For the voluntary retirement plan, there are a lot of moving parts there. As I mentioned, we had a robust response from our employees to the option we provided them. I mentioned at Analyst Day that in the last iteration of this kind of program at Dominion which was long ago 2010, we had roughly a 10% acceptance rate from all of our employees.","So, what we've done this time is we've offered the same type of program to union and non-union employees where they have the ability to retire and receive their accrued retirement benefits whatever they may be in addition to severance which is in line with policy which could be in various cases up to 12 months of severance.","So, the way that will work is the severance payment will likely be treated as a one-time item, but the resulting savings in lower O&M cost from the VRP will begin to be recognized in our operating earnings starting soon after the second quarter.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, great. And is it fair to say that even though you've had kind of preliminary positive indications on acceptance and the success rate here this is all kind of in line with the plan that you laid out just a month ago now?","Jim Chapman","Yes. The VRP which we started to talk about in public a month ago or so that is additive to the flat O&M initiative. But it is within our earnings guidance and stands ready to overcome any unexpected headwinds or things like $0.06 of weather that we incurred in the first quarter. It is a positive, but it's within the guidance range for the year.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein, Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my call. A quick question on the solar. For the solar -- for the contracted solar that you get the ITC for are you planning to Safe Harbor anything this year for that program? Would you benefit from safe harboring the ITC at a 30% level going forward?","Jim Chapman","Morning. Michael I don't believe the safe harboring really applies in our case. I mean we're pretty quick to transact on these construction projects in Virginia as they arrive. So, safe harboring is not really a factor in our case in Virginia.","Michael Weinstein","Do those benefits get passed to the customer -- to your customers? Or you do get to keep them in effect? Or does it -- are the contracts basically earning the same ROE regardless?","Paul Koonce","Yes. Michael this is Paul Koonce. The earnings impact I mean when we think about Safe Harbor -- as Jim said I mean we're bringing these contracts to market. We're not really sort of in a position to build a backlog of contracts because the need is immediate.","Tom announced the Facebook transaction. We have a number of others that are in the pipeline. And as soon as we can get those contracts finalized then we'll be announcing and bringing those contracts to service.","Jim Chapman","And Michael just to reiterate what we outlined at the Analyst Day was a run rate ITC recognition of about of 10% to 15% -- $0.10 to $0.15, I'm sorry, per year which is not really a significant increase from where we were last year. And really 100% of that is related to what Paul just discussed. This kind of investment on behalf non-jurisdictional customers in Virginia that PPA structure that helps us in part achieve the 3000-megawatt commitment we've made in Virginia by 2022.","Michael Weinstein","All right. Got you. It's a very limited program. It's very structured so doesn't really pay I guess to try to get ahead of the market with the safe harbored ITC.","Jim Chapman","I agree.","Michael Weinstein","Thank you. That's it for now. Thanks.","Jim Chapman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Shar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners.","Shar Pourreza","Hey guys. How are you doing?","Tom Farrell","Morning.","Jim Chapman","Morning.","Shar Pourreza","Just a real quick update or just to follow-up on ACP. And obviously fully understand why you don't want to negotiate with yourself as far as administrative or legislative. But as investors are sort of thinking about the timing, are you sort of waiting for a SCOTUS affirmation that they would take on the case, before coming out with something \u2013 before disclosing what the administrative fix is? Or are they \u2013 so I guess how are we thinking about the timing and versus what SCOTUS' decision is?","Tom Farrell","It's a very perceptive question. I think we need to just stand pat with what we've said about Atlantic Coast Pipeline Supply Header for now. We're working through the process. As Greg Gordon mentioned a few minutes ago, it's been a very frustrating process. But we are winding our way through it. Calendar is slipping and we're making progress. We believe that the Solicitor General will join us in this appeal no guarantee of that. We believe that he will that has a very high percentage of acceptance by the Supreme Court. When that occurs \u2013 and that'll take some additional time and there are other avenues that we just feel it's better not to talk about right at the moment.","Shahriar Pourreza","So just to follow-up there was \u2013 is MVP sort of a read-through on the timing for ACP? And are you collaborating working with sort of the MPC owners when you think about an administrative fix?","Tom Farrell","I don't think MVP's a read-through to ACP.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, around the coal impairments and how we should sort of think about the upcoming rate review in Virginia?","Tom Farrell","You mean, are they -- will they be expense of that write-off be included and counted against earnings? Is that the question?","Paul Koonce","Yes. Perfect.","Tom Farrell","The answer is yes.","Shahriar Pourreza ","All right. Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys. Just curious a handful of things. First of all, when you think about kind of the next three or four years roughly how much incremental solar capacity? Can you remind me of this? Do you expect to own in Virginia versus having PPA?","Paul Koonce","Yes. Michael, this is Paul Koonce. We committed to the Governor last year to develop 3,000 megawatts to have that either in service or in development by 2022. The Grid Transformation & Security Act also calls on us to purchase 25% of that amount from third parties. So the way we think about it, 75% of the 3000 megawatts that we've committed will be Dominion-owned.","Now that will be a combination of both rate-based solar like US-3 that was just approved by the Commission and it will include bilateral agreements with customers such as Facebook or others. So it'll be a combination of those two. I would expect that, you would see somewhere on the order of 250 to 500 megawatts, a year for the developed and that will allow us to achieve our commitment to the Governor.","Michael Lapides","How should we think about the economics of the different types meaning the type that kind of go traditionally in the rate base versus the type that are PPA? Does one have a very different economic impact on Virginia Power's earnings relative to the other?","Paul Koonce","Well, they do. Those that are in rate base obviously have a earnings profile over the life of the agreement. So in that regard, I think it's good for our customers and it's good for our shareholders. The bilateral agreements that we enter into as you know bring with it ITC income, which tends to kind of weight the income to the early part of the period so different earnings profile, different customer needs. But we are engaged to doing both.","Michael Lapides","Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Angie Storozynski, Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","I wanted to ask about coal ash. So North Carolina seems to be mimicking what Virginia has proposed as far as remediation of coal ash ponds. Duke is pushing really hard against it. You guys seem to be okay with, what Virginia has decided. So talk us through why that is and why you don't actually have an issue with spending this CapEx","Paul Koonce","Angie, this is Paul Koonce. So we work collaboratively with all the local communities as well as the legislative and executive leadership on the solution. Cap and close in place was something that did not seem to be -- while it was federally approved by the Obama administration, it was not something that our local communities wanted.","So the solution that we came up with was on-site landfilling. Now, one reason we think it is probably more supported in Virginia than North Carolina is Dominion relatively has a small coal ash issue to deal with. Our 27 million metric tons is small compared to Duke and small compared to others.","So we believe that we have a good solution for the local communities. It's something that is supported by the legislation and supported by the executive branch. So we look forward to getting that work started as soon as the bill takes effect on July 1. We already have the land, so it will be a matter of basically moving the ash into a landfill on the existing site.","Jim Chapman","Paul, if I could add. Angie, it's Jim. You mentioned in your question the CapEx, which this program primarily is O&M expense very little of it is actually capital costs, so it's not a major earnings driver for us. And most of the activity and accounting space related to this new legislation is just in the balance sheet not impacting the income statement recognition of an ARO and a regulatory asset.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Thank you. And just one follow-up on ACP. So again, I understand that there are few comparisons between MVP and ACP. But MVP seems to be suggesting that rerouting the pipe through private lands was a potential alternative. And so could you comment if that's a possibility for ACP like last resort? And if it is, why didn't you consider that to start with? I'm talking about the crossing of the Appalachian Trail?","Tom Farrell ","No I understand. There are a lot of possibilities, Angie. That is one. And what we may or may not have considered some years ago I'll just -- I'll leave for after we have finished our court arguments for -- after we finish with the courts on all these issues and\/or get our solutions. We'll be happy to talk through with folks all the process we went through over these last few years.","There -- as I've said, there are lots of alternatives. And we just don't think it's useful at this time to talk about them. I appreciate the frustration level. Believe me. One thing Greg said about how he thinks the investor community is as frustrated as we are, I'm not sure that that's a possibility.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Abe Azar, Deutsche Bank.","Abe Azar","Thank you. Good morning.","Tom Farrell","Good morning.","Abe Azar","Is there any update on your 2019 financing plans and specifically on the size and timing of the convert refinancing?","Jim Chapman","Hey. That's -- I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.","Abe Azar","And then relatedly when do you expect to put permanent financing on for Cove Point? Might you take on a minority partner there?","Jim Chapman","Got it. Abe, it's Jim. Sorry for the interruption. Yes there's no material change to our plans for our financing for the year. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we do plan to replace the maturing -- converting existing $1.4 billion mandatory convert that we'll issue in 2016. Those plans are on track for the year and we're going to be opportunistic based on market conditions kind of through the summer period. Based on that knowing the exact timing of that, but also the exact size what we've said is around the size of the one that's converting, which is $1.4 billion, which is still is our expectation again depending on market conditions.","On Cove, we have lots of time there. So as you know late last year, we put in place $3 billion of basically plain-vanilla non-recourse bank debt. So the cost of that is attractive. It's below 4% right now. It's non-amortizing. It's prepayable at any time and there are two-and-a-half years roughly left on the tenure. So we have lots of options on how to refinance that, but we also have lots of time. So no specific guidance on that activity, but plenty of flexibility based on what we did late last year.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to clarify. You've affirmed the 2019 guidance. But on the Drivers slide, it looks like you've added expense control initiatives as a positive driver and removed pension expense as a negative. Can you just give a little more detail as to what caused those changes? And is that the same stuff you talked about at the Analyst Day? Or does this maybe suggest you're leaning toward the higher end of the range? Maybe just some thoughts on that tweak.","Jim Chapman","Yes, let me address that. Good morning. It's Jim. Let me address that and then more generally, the sculpting of our expected earnings through the year. We do expect positive impacts -- again we haven't baked the numbers yet on the VRP element, but some positive impact this year to our operating earnings from our O&M initiatives, including our voluntary retirement program.","The pension headwind was really something we highlighted as a short-term change between basically EEI on first of the year, but that modest impact which was about $0.04 change based on market activity in that short time period. That has been baked into our expectations for the year and is unchanged.","Those pension assumptions that drive the accounting are revisited, as you know, basically every December 31. So no change before the clock turns at the end of this year. But let me give a little more guidance on -- a little more granular detail on the sculpting of our earnings through the year and I gave Greg a somewhat curt response that we do still target and expect the midpoint of our range for the year.","But admittedly our earnings profile is back-end dated. And that's not something new to us. I know, we've just released our second quarter earnings guidance this morning, but this is, as we expected, other than the impact of the $0.06 of the weather headwind in the first quarter.","So just to walk you through that, it's a little more than you asked. But Q1 $1.10, the midpoint of our Q2 guidance range $0.70 to $0.80 is $0.75, so $1.85, add in $0.06 of weather you get to $1.91. So comparing it to last year $1.91 is $0.09 less than $2, which is where we were during the first two quarters of last year.","So, clearly, the earnings growth for the year, even aside from the weather headwind, is in the second half. And there are few reasons for that. Actually, there a number of reasons for that this year. One is the timing of the Millstone outage, which last year was in 3Q. This year's in 2Q. That's one thing that kind of pushes up on our second half contribution this year versus last.","There's a full year of Cove Point contribution at run rate production levels, which means without some of the ramp-up costs that last year we had budgeted and experienced in the last three quarters. There's still some improvement there, this year versus last, not only in the first quarter.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's growth in regulated investment across electric and gas utilities, through the year which it accretes. There some timing of ITC and farm-outs to the year, this year versus last. And then, the last thing is, if we're -- there's more to come and we'll provide some more guidance on the second quarter call.","As what, you mentioned, the operating expense initiatives: the continuation of flat O&M, but also the impact to operating earnings of our voluntary retirement program. So, overall, we're on track, but certainly are heavier in the second half of this year versus the first half, in particular, as compared to 2018.","Andrew Weisel","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this does conclude this morning's conference call. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy your day. Thank you."],"7155":["Dominion Energy, Inc.

Morgan","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to the Dominion Energy Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Ridge, the Director of Investor Relations for the Safe Harbor Statements.","Stephen Ridge","Good morning, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call for Dominion Energy. I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website to view the earnings press releases and accompanying materials as well as the slide presentation that will follow this morning's prepared remarks. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting, and the Investor Relations team will be available immediately after the call to answer additional questions.","The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our Company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which are \u2013 we are able to calculate and report are contained in the earnings release kit. ","Joining today\u2019s call are, Tom Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Chapman, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and other members of the executive management team. ","I will now turn the call over to Jim.","James Chapman","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.89 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.95 per share. GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.97 per share which includes gains on the sales of non-core assets. ","For the full year, we reported operating earnings of $4.05 per share which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share. Drivers relative to our guidance include lower O&M, income tax, depreciation expense, as well as favorable weather, partially offset by a longer commissioning process for the Cove Point liquefaction project during the first quarter and higher storm restoration expense in the third and fourth quarters. ","We are pleased that despite a challenging year, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of 12.5%. Operating segment performance for the fourth quarter and the full year are shown on Slide 4. GAAP earnings for the year were $3.74 per share. ","Differences between operating and reported earnings included gain on sale of non-core assets, unrealized losses on nuclear decommissioning trust bonds, and one-time rate credits issued to customers under Virginia legislation passed in March. ","A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. ","Before we turn the page completely on 2018, we want to briefly highlight some of the important initiatives that we successfully executed during the year and that we believe will position us for success in 2019. As we mentioned, we achieved annual operating earnings per share growth of more than 10% despite a number of headwinds including a dramatically altered financing plan. ","We grew the dividend per share by 10% year-over-year consistent with the commitment we had previously made to shareholders and slightly lower than annual operating earnings per share growth. We sold non-core merchant assets at attractive valuation, improving our business risk profile and generating over $2.5 billion of sale proceeds which we used to retire parent-level debt.","We placed both the Cove Point liquefaction projects and Greenville power station into commercial service collectively representing over $5 billion of invested capital. ","I am pleased to report that Cove Point continues to operate at or above design capacity and successfully completed the same day loading of an export cargo and unloading of an import cargo during the fourth quarter, which we believe maybe a first for the domestic LNG industry. Greensville is also operating as designed.","We took meaningful steps to improve our credit profile including reducing parent level debt by about $8 billion through proceeds from equity issuance, non-core asset sales and a Cove Point asset level financing. As a result of these efforts, we achieved our parent level leverage targets two years ahead of schedule. We also materially improved our cash flow coverage metric as measured by Moody\u2019s. ","These achievements in combination with the improved business risk profile due to asset sale and the addition of SCANA\u2019s high-quality regulated businesses resulted in the affirmation of our existing credit ratings and the lowering of our credit metric thresholds. ","In Virginia, we work with legislators, the Governor, customer groups and other important stakeholders to support the grid transformation and security act, a bipartisan law that provides a path to a sustainable and reliable energy future in the commonwealth. ","And finally, we obtained all required regulatory approval and subsequently closed our merger with SCANA, which we expect to provide near-term earnings of approximately $0.10 per share per year. ","Tom will speak more about this a little later but we are pleased that we were able to offer significant value to SCANA customers, protection of the SCANA employees, and preserve the transaction economics that our shareholders and credit providers expected. ","Moving on to 2019 earnings guidance. Operating earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be between $4.05 and $4.40 per share. This guidance range of $0.35 is narrower than in recent years reflecting the increasingly regulated nature of our operation. The midpoint of this range represents 5.6% growth relative to 2018\u2019s weather-normalized results. ","As usual, our guidance assumes normal weather, variations from which could cause results to swing toward or the bottom of this narrower guidance range. Positive factors as compared to last year included an additional quarter of commercial operations of the Cove Point liquefaction project, the addition of the Southeast Energy Group operating segment which includes all former SCANA operations and growth from regulated investment.","Negative factors as compared to last year include the loss of earnings from 2018 asset sales, a higher share count, higher pension expense and a return to normal weather. The midpoint of our 2019 guidance range assumes that ACP Constructions recommences during the third quarter of this year which Tom will address momentarily. ","It excludes any contribution associated with the Blue Racer earn out which could be zero, as well as any contribution associated with the resolution of the outstanding zero carbon energy procurement process in Connecticut, which Tom will also address. Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of this year is $1.05 to $1.25 per share, compared to $1.14 per share in this first quarter of 2018.","Positive factors relative to Q1 2018 included the contribution from the Cove Point liquefaction project and the addition of the Southeast Energy Group. Negative factors include timing of contributions are formed, the loss of earnings from asset sale, and a higher share count. ","While we are not providing formal 2020 operating earnings guidance on today\u2019s call, we do expect approximately 5% growth from 2019 to 2020 which aligns with achieving our most recent guidance regarding our 2017 to 2020, 6% to 8% compounded annual growth rate. This 2020 expectation also excludes the impact of any Blue Racer earn out and the contribution from a resolution in Connecticut.","Finally, we expect dividend per share growth in 2019 of 10%. Please note that all dividend declarations are subject to Board approval. ","Major elements of our 2019 financial plan are included on Slide 8 in addition to a fairly standard debt financing program, we intend to replace and possibly increase the size of the mandatory convertible security that\u2019s issued three years ago and which converts in the third quarter. Despite a firm ratings and lower credit metric downgrade thresholds, we will continue to take steps to support our credit profile. ","Turning to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The merger of DM into Dominion Energy was completed earlier this week. We issued approximately 22 million shares in exchange for all outstanding Dominion Midstream common and preferred units. The merged asset now resides the subsidiary of our parent company, but we intend for certain assets to migrate to Dominion Energy Gas Holdings during the year. ","Finally, we plan to make two distinct presentations for investors on March 25th. The first presentation targeting the general investor community will include a number of informational updates such as asset profiles, asset profile updates including for the newly added Southeast Energy Group, capital investment programs, opportunities under the Grid Transformation and Security Act in Virginia, O&M initiatives and long-term dividend growth and capital structure objectives. ","We believe that this brief presentation will provide reference information and insights that will help investors to better understand Dominion Energy\u2019s expanded operational footprint, as well as drivers behind our expectation for 5% plus growth in operating earnings per share beyond 2020. ","We are pleased to announce that in a second a super presentation on that day, we will provide an update that will focus exclusively on our accomplishments and efforts about environmental, social and governance matters and how those efforts underpin our long-term strategy and position us to become an industry leader in sustainability. ","To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a major company from the energy infrastructure industry or otherwise to host an investor session dedicated exclusively to these matters. The target audience for the second presentation is members of the financial community with special focus on ESG topics. ","Both of these presentations will be webcast live on our investor relations website with an opportunity to submit questions electronically, so that in the event of capacity constraints at our New York City venue, all investors will be able to participate. We will be providing additional information regarding these investor updates in the near future. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom. ","Thomas Farrell","Thank you, Jim and good morning. For the second straight year, we have a set a company record for the lowest OSHA recordable incident rate in our history, 0.55, which is an 8% improvement over what was a record-setting performance in 2017. This achievement is equally impressive when compared to a peer average that is nearly twice as high. ","Safety does not just happen. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns home in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We are going to continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic zero injuries. ","Now to our business updates. I will begin by addressing our merger with SCANA which closed at the beginning of this year. Our new operating segment, the Southeast Energy Group comprises all of the former SCANA operations. Rodney Blevins, one of our most experienced utility operators now lead the segment. He is working among the over 5000 able and dedicated colleagues that now comprise the Southeast Energy Group.","The Group\u2019s high-quality businesses and our colleagues who operate them enhance Dominion\u2019s best-in-class portfolio of state regulated utility operations. For example, customer growth at SEG\u2019s electric and gas utilities were 1.7% and 2.8% respectively during 2018. ","North and South Carolina despite the challenges related to new nuclear development in the latter are considered to be among the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions in the country. ","In 2020, we will file a rate case in South Carolina that\u2019s subject to commission approval will reflect recovery of traditional electric utility capital investment that is not currently being recovered in rates. ","Those new rates subject to approval will become effective on January 1, 2021. Over the coming months, we will continue to build trust with customers, employees, regulators and policy makers by keeping our commitments and being a transparent and responsible corporate citizen. We look forward to discuss in the Southeast Energy Group in greater detail in our Investor Meeting in March. ","Next I\u2019ll turn to updates related to the Grid Transformation and Security Act adopted last year in Virginia. In less than a year, we have filed for and received Virginia State Corporation Commission approval for projects representing over $1 billion of capital investment. ","We expect that number to grow significantly over the next several years as we continue to invest to make our system increasingly sustainable and reliable for our customers. ","First, we received approval from the SEC for our approximately $300 million offshore wind projects which will be completed under a fixed cost construction agreement. This pilot has to support Governor Northam in Virginia\u2019s General Assembly and will provide important early learnings that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia\u2019s clean energy future. ","Construction of the project is expected to begin this second quarter with a commercial in-service date in late 2020. Second, we received approval from the SEC for phases 2 and 3 of our strategic undergrounding program representing a capital investment of about $240 million. This effort improves the reliability of our systems and substantially reduces the duration of restoration times following severe weather events. ","Third, we received an order granting our certificate of public necessity and convenience for our U.S. 3 Utility-Scale solar farms representing 240 megawatts at a capital cost of around $410 million. We remain committed to advancing our goal of having 3000 megawatts of additional renewable generating capacity in service or under development by 2022 and we expect to make regular filings under the GTSA with the commission for additional projects in the future. ","Next, we received partial approval from the SEC for our initial grid transformation application. The commission approved nearly $100 million of capital over three years associated with important physical and cyber security investments. ","The commission asked for more information to support capital investment associated with other aspects of our Grid Mod strategy including smart meters, intelligence grid devices and an enhanced customer information platform that allows more sophisticated and convenient customer experience. We will provide that data when we refile our application later this summer. A decision on the refiled application would be expected six months after.","I want to offer a few remarks related to recently proposed legislation supported by Governor Northam and bipartisan legislative leadership that establishes a path for addressing our coal ash ponds. We support the policy makers\u2019 desire to resolve this issue permanently through annual rider recovery. ","The legislation will provide for full cost recovery of operating expense and capital investment associated with the recycling of coal ash for beneficial use and the construction of on-site lined landfills for disposal of the residual coal ash. ","We believe the BET legislation provides a fair balance between Dominion Energy\u2019s customers and its shareholders and allocates the cost of this program equitably among large and small users of electricity.","I\u2019ll now address the Millstone and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. With regard to Millstone, it is important to recognize the extent of the progress that has been made today on ensuring the long-term viability of this critically important resource to Connecticut. We began engaging in the legislative process for years ago. ","We have diligently followed the law and requirements established by both DEEP and PURA and each agency has determined Millstone is an at-risk resource.","Former Governor Malloy made an announcement in late December awarding Millstone a ten year agreement for 9 million megawatt hours per year. The awarded price for the first three years of the contract is approximately equal to the New England wholesale power price. ","That is not an acceptable result for the company and our 1500 Millstone colleagues who work safely every day to provide half of the power and 90% of zero carbon power to the State of Connecticut.","In order to ensure the plant\u2019s viability, we must have pricing that recognizes energy security, environmental and economic benefits. We have and we will continue to engage constructively with Governor Lamont\u2019s team seeking the solution that works for the state, the region, our company and our employees. ","We are confident that these issues will be resolved in a manner that provides long-term financial assurance required for Millstone\u2019s continued operation.","As for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply header projects we remain highly confident in the successful and timely resolution of all outstanding permit issues, as well as the ultimate completion of the entire project for the following reasons. ","First, our customers critically need this project to heat and electrify homes, businesses and industries, assist in the transition away from coal-fired power generation, support economic and renewable energy development and reduce reliance on a single source of gas to liquid. ","Our customers, state regulatory commissions and FERC have all attested independently to the need for this project. Second, we have followed the established rules with regard to permitting environmental protection, years of painstaking surveying, data collection and scientific analysis needed by all of our permit applications. ","In fact, most of our permits are setting new national standards in minimizing environmental impacts. Without speaking for the permitting agencies, these professionals have followed the letter and the spirit of the rules, regulations and established precedence that guided their action on our permit applications. Third, we are actively pursuing multiple paths to resolve all outstanding permit issues including judicial, legislative and administrative advocates.","We are not alone in these positions. We have the support of the agencies, our customers, and varied industry interests. Our current expectation is that full construction to restart in the third quarter. This reflects our belief that the biological opinion issue in any impediments with the cross in the Appalachian Trail should be resolved no later than this fall. ","Based on the scheduled key segments of the project including from Buckingham County located in Central Virginia to the presently planned terminus in Hampton Roads in Eastern Virginia and in Lumberton in Southeastern North Carolina would enter commercial service by the end of 2020 with the balance of the project being delivered in early 2021.","The cost of the project based on this schedule is expected to be $7 billion to $7.5 billion excluding financing cost, an increase of approximately $500 million since the update we provided in November. Similarly, we expect that this supply header project would enter commercial service in late 2020 with a project cost of $650 million to $700 million. ","While we believe that the Appalachian Trail crossing issue should be resolved in time to recommence construction along the entire route during the third quarter, we intend to continue to build key segments that will deliver partial service to our customers by the end of 2020. The completion of the remaining section which could involve an appeal in spring quarter would complement the first phase of service by the end of 2021.","Under this alternative, total project cost would increase an additional $250 million resulting in total project cost of $7.25 billion to $7.75 billion excluding financing costs. In either case, we are currently working with customers to set rates that balance customer needs with preserving a fair project return. ","It\u2019s important to understand that the average base is differential, over the last five years has been $1.79 per decatherm which significantly exceeds the rates of this project and of course cost is not the only factor driving our customers\u2019 demand.","Additional and diversified supply is critical, given that they are forced to turn away new customers due to the lack of infrastructure. When extreme weather occurs, such as the existing polar vortex in the Midwest, or the bitter colds that affected the Mid-Atlantic in both 2016 and 2018, the concept of reliable and redundant energy supply assumes a new and much more serious meaning. ","Policymakers understand the gravity of the situation. Disruptions for the region\u2019s limited supply of existing gas delivery infrastructure and weather-driven demand spikes have and will continue to resolve in higher prices, forced curtailments and lower reliability for customers until the project is complete.","To be clear, we believe that there are multiple paths that will allow us to complete the entire 600 mile project. As was the case regarding the challenges we faced in the developments of the Cove Point liquefaction project, and the closing of our merger with SCANA, large projects require transparency and determination. We have in abundance of both.","We will continue to accrue AFUDC equity earnings and expect ACP to contribute to our operating earnings in 2019, 2020 and for decades to come. ","In summary, during 2018, we set a new company record for safety performance for the second consecutive year. We delivered 2018 operating earnings per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range and initiated 2019 guidance that implies over 5% annual growth to 2018 weather-normalized results. ","Our 2019 dividends per share are expected to grow 10% subject to Board approval. We successfully executed several major initiatives including merchant asset sales, $8 billion of parent level debt reduction, the buy-in of Dominion Energy Midstream Partners and the commercial in-service of the Cove Point liquefaction project and Greensville Power Station that support our earnings and credit objectives and position the business to continue to deliver visible, diversified and regulated growth in the future. ","We completed the SCANA merger adding exciting new businesses to our best-in-class regulated portfolio. We continued progress towards successful resolution for both Millstone and ACP and we\u2019ve advanced capital programs that will help to support 5% plus earnings growth for the next decade. ","With that, we are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. ","Shahriar Pourreza ","Hey, good morning guys. ","James Chapman","Good morning.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning. ","Shahriar Pourreza ","So, couple questions here. First on sort of Millstone, obviously you are excluding the zero carbon procurement in your outlook. Is this a pricing issue given what\u2019s currently proposed, i.e. it\u2019s not very accretive to your growth or are you kind of implying that a closure is still in the mix if you get the pricing as currently proposed. So, just trying to figure out why it\u2019s been excluded?","James Chapman","Hey, Shahriar, it\u2019s Jim, good questions.","Shahriar Pourreza ","Hey, Jim.","James Chapman","So, the way we think about that is that, looking the table right now, as you know within this ten year contract for the first three years, basically, roughly equivalent to market pricing. So, no need for us to have a contract for that. So, we are hopeful that there will be a contract for that period and value of these other attributes we\u2019ve talked about for Millstone. ","So if that comes into play, the contribution from such a contract for the relative period would be an adder to our guidance \u2013 earnings guidance. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we change our growth rate but will be an adder to the existing guidance. So that\u2019s what we mean by that that\u2019s excluded. There will be a potential for an adder for the time period in which an acceptable contract comes into play.","Shahriar Pourreza ","Okay. Is it tellable for you as currently proposed or is there \u2013 or is sort of a shutdown still something that\u2019s in the potential given what you assume?","James Chapman","Sure, we have a new administration in place. We have been working very constructively with them. So, I am not going to \u2013 we are not here to do any stable rattling today. Our position hasn\u2019t changed. We have to have a clear financial path for Millstone that proposals from Governor Malloy\u2019s outgoing proposal does not meet that standard.","Shahriar Pourreza ","Got it, okay good. And then, Tom, let me just ask you and you touched on in your prepared remarks around the economics of sort of the pipe Atlantic Coast especially with the second delay and cost increase. ","Can you just be a little bit more specific on how the conversations are going but more importantly what sort of the impact this sort of legislation, I think it\u2019s bill number 17, 18 that\u2019s advancing to the General Assembly. Is there viability to this thing into and just what are your thoughts there?","Thomas Farrell","Well, so, I think that\u2019s two different questions in that. As I understand, the first one is about, are you talking about conversation with customers?","Shahriar Pourreza ","Correct, correct. ","Thomas Farrell","Okay, I\u2019ll let Diane answer that question just a second, Diane Leopold. With respect to the legislation, I would just say, I think the simplest answer to say that legislation has a long way to go in the general assembly. ","Diane Leopold","And, good morning, this is Diane Leopold. With respect to the contract, there are provisions in the contract to discuss both rates and terms and as Tom discussed, given the latest schedule and pause that we talked about today, we are already working with customers to set these rates and terms, partial in-service options, the actual rates for the service et cetera. ","And we are confident we are going to be able to balance the customer needs and provide them with their critical need for this project in both cost and non-cost items while preserving a fair return for the project, but we really don\u2019t want to go into anymore details on that.","James Chapman","And let me add just one thought also on the legislation. I think it\u2019s also fair to say that, in this present \u2013 it\u2019s not likely to come through the general assembly process in its present form. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. ","Steven Fleishman ","Yes, hi, good morning. Thanks. So, just to follow-up on the ACP contracts, Tom, you mentioned the $1.79 decatherm last five years, just could you give us a sense of where the contract pricing of ACP is now versus that?","Thomas Farrell","Nom, Steve, we can\u2019t. That\u2019s all through confidential agreements with the customers. But I...","Steven Fleishman ","But it\u2019s a lot better, yes.","Thomas Farrell","It\u2019s significantly lower than $1.79.","Steven Fleishman ","Yes, okay. And then, what is pricing more like now as opposed to the last five years is it in that ballpark too?","Diane Leopold","Yes, I mean, the last few days when it was cold, it wasn\u2019t just cold on the East Coast, obviously as it was on the Midwest. But I believe it was somewhere $5, $6 versus the Henry Hub, it certainly has value there. But that five year average actually is summer and winter time. It is average through the entire year, not just the price spikes of the winter.","Steven Fleishman ","Right, okay. ","Diane Leopold","So, it continues to show value and increase that you see in these cold times.","Steven Fleishman ","Okay. And then, just in terms of going back to \u2013 there was a question - I just want to clarify the comments on the convert, so that your intention is to issue a new convert when that one is done or just re-market the debt?","James Chapman","Yes, good question. We are required based on the terms of existing units remarketed to debt. That doesn\u2019t represent the increase in debt. It\u2019s just remarketing which will be this year. But this is our last outstanding mandatory convertible securities. The equity converts into common equity, that going about in August and we view that as an attractive security to us and we think there is demand for us and the capital market is our perception. ","So we do plan to replace it. It will be exactly the same as the securities we have issued in the past, it could be slightly different. But some form of that hybrid capital, mandatory convertible otherwise we plan to use to replace the $1.4 billion that effectively goes away in the middle of this year in August. ","Steven Fleishman ","And then, one last question just back to ACP. So, I think there has been some concern that it\u2019s often hard to get an en banc hearing, but obviously this is obviously a pretty important case. So just, maybe you could give some color on why this \u2013 it might be different this time and your ability to get that hearing in this case?","Thomas Farrell","Well, I would say, this is Tom, you are quite right, en banc proceedings are, they don\u2019t happen every day of the week, they don\u2019t happen every month. This case, I don\u2019t know if you had a chance to read the brief that was filed on behalf of ACP last week. ","And I think it sets the story out pretty well that there is a fifty pipelines that go on and meet the Appalachian Trail today, or it\u2019s about 50 that are now all in question. We have significant support from a variety of folks. I think you will see ten or more friends of the court file a brief or briefs sometime late next week. ","The Department of Justice will weigh in before February 11 on the importance of this. But that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll see what happens. There is other avenues, as I mentioned, there is you can always appeal the Supreme Court, obviously. ","Again, there is legislative efforts underway and there are other potential administrative avenues we are looking at that we haven\u2019t been able to pursue very thoroughly, because of the government shutdown. But the en banc is important milestone. But it\u2019s not by any stretch the only avenue to make sure we finish this pipe in which we are highly confident. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rose-Lynn Armstrong with UBS. Mr. Armstrong, if your line is muted, you\u2019ll need to unmute to ask your question.","Rose-Lynn Armstrong ","Hello. You talked about discussing long-term dividend growth. ","Thomas Farrell","I am sorry, was that a question? I am sorry, I didn\u2019t hear the whole thing.","Operator","I am sorry. It looks like she accidentally disconnected her line. ","Thomas Farrell","Okay.","Operator","We will go to our next questioner, Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon ","Good morning guys. So, thanks for the updated guidance range. I know that you had given sort of an interim guidance update in early January. And the illustrative guidance range at the time for 2020 it was 4.35 to 4.47. Now if I did take the current guidance for 2019 and I just extrapolate 5% growth around, should I be extrapolating 5% growth just from the low and high-end to come up with? ","Would you guys believe your current 2020 implied guidance range should be to get the low-end or the high-end? I just want to be clear on that.","James Chapman","Yes, Greg. It\u2019s actually, Jim. We are not really talking about a guidance range for 2020 yet. We have given this indicative 5%. So we think about it more in terms of midpoint. So, midpoint 2019 to 2020 that\u2019s where our minds are right now. We will get more granular with the guidance range as we go through time. ","Greg Gordon ","Okay. I just wanted to make sure that I was translating that 2020 statement properly. So, thank you. I appreciate it. In terms of other questions, I think, most of mine have been answered. So, I\u2019ll give you back the time. Thank you.","Thomas Farrell","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with J.P. Morgan.","Christopher Turnure ","Good morning, guys. Tom, you mentioned the alternative plan for ACP and the slightly higher cost estimate and longer timeframe for that. Could you just expand upon the exact permit scenario that would underpin that plan?","Thomas Farrell","We have all of our permits. So, let\u2019s \u2013 we didn\u2019t mention in the script, for example, we did get our last real permits, significant permit which is the air permit for the Buckingham compressor station. So, what now is in front of us is these court challenges on variety of pieces. ","No challenge for what\u2019s between Buckingham County and Lumberton North Carolina. That\u2019s with these issues in the mountains and the national parks et cetera. So, all those different timeframes and the different amounts are based on different scenarios on when we finish the court challenges. ","Christopher Turnure ","Okay, so there is not one particular path there. So, it will be alternative if not if you fail at the en banc, then you do that. ","Thomas Farrell","Correct. There are other \u2013 there are multiple paths here. And I know, people are focused understandably and justifiably on the en banc. But that\u2019s not the only path here. There are \u2013 there is the potential if we don\u2019t get the en banc or we lose the en banc, there is the \u2013 we have the judicial path to Supreme Court. ","There is legislative path that we are working on quite vigorously and there are, as I mentioned, administrative path that we have identified, but haven\u2019t been able to fully pursue because of the government shutdown. But the primary focus right now for us is our en banc proceeding. We face that decision as erroneous and a bench almost 50 years of agency precedent. ","Christopher Turnure ","Okay. And then, just following up on the strategy here with ACP, the biological opinion is, I guess, technically, what\u2019s caused the temporary stop in construction right now? What I am wondering, given the gravity of the forest service opinion and the en banc process, were do not succeed on the forest service side, call it, in the second quarter or mid-year. ","Does it make sense to continue construction at that time or hold off on construction until you get more clarity there? I think last time I checked you had drawn around $1 billion of the project level debt so far where you\u2019ve spent a good amount but you are not, maybe, fully committed at this point in terms of spending in my opinion.","Thomas Farrell","Well, I\u2019ll let Jim give you the numbers on what has been spent. I just \u2013 there is so many variables in that question. I just think it\u2019s hard for us to really to answer it. We\u2019d have to see \u2013 I think we are going to win on the biological opinion issue quite \u2013 but I have high confidence in that. This is the second time around they followed the dictates of the court and what the court was interested in and reissued it. ","So, we would have to see we assume it\u2019s going to get affirmed and if it\u2019s not, we will have to see what the court said and then we\u2019ll have to make a decision around that. But we think all of that is taken into account in these different timeframes given here, because we can proceed from Buckingham which is sort of almost middle of the pipeline, all the way down to Lumberton and up into Hampton Roads. ","James Chapman","Hey, Chris, let me just add, you mentioned correctly that back in October, when we published our third quarter Q, we noted that the amount of capital drawn on this project level construction facility was a little over 1, 1.5 I think it was really on a 100% basis. I am sure that number as of 12\/31 is about 1.4 not drastically different. ","That\u2019s on a 100% basis, so, that would imply total spend, that\u2019s of course 50% of the cash capital is represented and drawn on the project level facility. So it double to get on a 100% basis the total amount spent which will be about approaching 2.8 as of 12\/31. And those numbers will be more so in the case. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rose-Lynn Armstrong with UBS. ","Thomas Farrell","Here you are.","Rose-Lynn Armstrong ","Hi, I will try again.","Thomas Farrell","I think you got cut-off in the middle of the question. I am sorry. ","Rose-Lynn Armstrong ","I did. I apologize. So, getting to the indication earlier that you would discuss long-term dividend growth at the Analyst Meeting, can you just give us a little preview of that today? I believe previous comments regarding 2020 were that the policy was predicated on the MLP market and now of course with the rollout, how are you thinking about dividend policy going forward?","Thomas Farrell","Thanks Rose-Lynn. Let me just refresh everybody on the background here. So, we announced that expected dividend policy \u2013 of course they are all subject to, as you all know, each quarter to Board approval. But we said in 2017 that looking forward we had a very robust MLP market. We had Cove Point expectations coming online et cetera. ","Because of the unique nature of the take or pay contracts with Cove Point, very significant cash flows flowing out of that with the recapture of the capital cost that we would see through drops into the MLP that we would grow the dividend 10% a year in 2018, 2019 and 2020. And then, when we got to 2021, we have to see what the landscape looks like at that time. ","After the FERC ruling, in March of last year that destroyed the viability of the MLP market. Over time, we said not too long after that date I don\u2019t remember the exact date, Rose, and we said something along the lines that we are going to keep 10% in 2018. We expect to keep 10% in 2019. And depending upon what happened people are going to ask FERC to reconsider. ","We didn\u2019t know what exactly was going to happen that it could go from 6% to 10% depending upon what happened with MLP. I think we had since said that the expectation obviously the MLP market is no longer there. ","So you are already at the bottom of that. But, we recognized that it\u2019s not going to be 10% in 2020, highly unlikely and over time, we will bring the dividend growth rate, not going to be a cut in our dividend, that\u2019s not even in contemplations, the notions will bring our growth rate of our dividends more in line with our peers after this year. ","So starting in 2020, some \u2013 and I will talk more about that in March, but there will be some effort to bring them more in line with our peer group. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, I hope it does. ","Rose-Lynn Armstrong ","Okay. And you think \u2013 what\u2019s your \u2013 I guess, if we look at it from a payout ratio perspective, can you talk about where you would hope to see the payout ratio will return?","James Chapman","Hey, Rose, it\u2019s Jim. We will talk about that at the end of March. But we will be setting the dividend growth rate to reach a target payout ratio that\u2019s more in line with peers.","Rose-Lynn Armstrong ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. ","Jonathan Arnold ","I think you just answered one of our questions which, Jim, it\u2019s the payout that you\u2019d bring in line with peers and not the growth rates. I just want to be clear that that if we are understanding you correctly on that?","James Chapman","That\u2019s exactly right. That\u2019s exactly right.","Jonathan Arnold ","Okay. And peers, you\u2019ll, so share with us what you view the right grid to be in the March meeting presumably.","James Chapman","Exactly.","Jonathan Arnold ","Okay. And then, just on ACP, when you guys are talking about customers, are you \u2013 does that include the anchored kind of utility customers? Your facility of customers and does whatever you have negotiated with them needs to be approved by the state regulatory bodies, I am just curious on that.","Diane Leopold","The discussions are with \u2013 sorry, this is Diane Leopold. The discussions are with all of the customers and every customer has something different with respect what they will need to finalize the deal. But we are in active discussions with all the customers now. ","Jonathan Arnold ","And then, to the question of, is it subject to SEC approval outside or normal?","Thomas Farrell","You are talking about \u2013 when you say, SEC you are referring to, in Virginia?","Jonathan Arnold ","Yes. ","Thomas Farrell","In Virginia, it\u2019s just a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s like any other part of fuel cost. So that will be part of the fuel cost case in whenever 2021 or 2022 along with all the other ins and outs of our fuel cost. ","Jonathan Arnold ","Perfect, okay. Thank you, Tom.","Thomas Farrell","You are welcome. ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude this morning's conference call.

Positive factors versus guidance for the quarter were lower interest expenses, income taxes, and operating expenses. Negative drivers include lower merchant power margins and continued mild weather. In fact, the negative earnings impact of mild weather across our electric and gas operations during the first three quarters of the year was $0.12 per share.","GAAP earnings were $1.03 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were charges related to our integration of Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Moving to results by operating segment, Power Delivery produced EBITDA of $441 million for the third quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of slightly mild weather was offset by lower operating expenses. EBITDA at Power Generation was $565 million (sic) [$865 million] (03:55) for the third quarter, which was below the middle of its guidance range.","Lower PG and merchant margins were the principal negative driver, along with slightly mild weather. Partially offsetting these factors were lower operating and maintenance expenses. Gas Infrastructure produced EBITDA of $471 million for the third quarter, which is near the high end of its guidance range, primarily due to lower operating expenses. Overall, we are very pleased with results from all of our operating segments.","For the third quarter of 2017, Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.2 million which was nearly three times the level produced in the third quarter of 2016. Distributable cash flow was $45.8 million, 90% higher than the level of last year's third quarter. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase.","On October 24, Dominion Energy Midstream board of directors declared a distribution of $0.3025 per common unit, payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains extremely strong at 1.28 times.","Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy, cash flow from operating activities was $3.7 billion through the third quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities and taking into account cash, short-term investments, and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion. For the status of our 2017 financings, please see slide 7; and for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the earnings release kit.","Earlier this month, the partners in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline closed on a construction financing facility designed to fund roughly half of the costs to construct the pipeline. The first funding of $570 million took place last week to cover a portion of the costs incurred to-date.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 27 of the earnings release kit. We have hedged 98% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone, and have started hedging 2018 production, principally for the first quarter. We plan to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of legislation in Connecticut.","Now, to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.80 and $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Positive factors compared to last year's fourth quarter are earnings from our growth projects and the benefit from recently announced agreement between Dominion Products and Services and HomeServe USA. Negative factors for the fourth quarter compared to last year include a refueling outage at Millstone, lower import revenues from Cove Point, lower investment tax credits from solar projects, and higher PJM electric capacity expenses.","Dominion Energy's operating earnings guidance for the full year of 2017 remains $3.40 to $3.90 per share. We remain confident that operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over the $3.65 per share midpoint of this year's earnings guidance range, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility which will be in service later this year. We also reiterate our expectation of a 6% to 8% EPS growth rate from 2017 through 2020, an EPS growth of at least 5% per year thereafter.","So, let me summarize my financial review; third quarter operating earnings were $1.04 per share, landing in the middle of our guidance range despite continued mild weather. Fourth quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.80 to $1 per share, and 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals through the first nine months of the year. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time low OSHA Recordable Rate of 0.66 last year and are on track to improve on that record this year.","Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our six units through the end of the third quarter was over 96%. Weather-normalized electric sales for the first three quarters of the year were up 1.7% over the same period last year, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Year-to-date total new customer connects are in line with our expectations, and strong growth in commercial connections have offset slightly lower than expected growth in residential new connects.","Through the third quarter, we have connected 11 new data centers compared to 7 for the first nine months of last year. Also during the quarter, our Gas Infrastructure group executed an amendment to an existing Marcellus farm-out agreement, locking in the remaining value under the agreement and securing payments totaling $130 million in 2017 and 2018.","You will recall that in 2015 when we began discussing our farm-out program, we anticipated generating between $450 million and $500 million in earnings from farm-out transactions from 2015 through 2020. We are halfway through that timeline, and despite less than ideal commodity market conditions, we have already achieved nearly three-quarters of our objective.","Last week, the Connecticut General Assembly approved legislation that will allow our Millstone nuclear plant the opportunity to compete with other non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for zero-carbon electricity. On behalf of the 1,500 women and men working at Millstone Power Station, Dominion Energy thanks the General Assembly for giving Millstone this opportunity and is grateful to the Malloy administration for his work in negotiating the current form of the legislation. It provides a path forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs and Millstone's substantial environmental, energy, and economic benefits to Connecticut.","Now, for an update on our growth plans; construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on-time and on-budget. As of September 30, the $1.3 billion project was 60% complete. The air-cooled condenser is over 80% complete. All pipe rack modules have been set and pipe welding continues at a steady rate. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first fire in the second quarter of next year, and is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.","We have a number of solar projects under development, and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers. Year-to-date, six solar facilities totaling approximately 169 megawatts have achieved commercial operation. For all remaining 2017 projects, panel deliveries have been secured and the projects are on schedule for completion this quarter. In total, we have announced 457 megawatts that will go into service this year, and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, increasing our gross operating portfolio from 1,660 megawatts to over 1,800 megawatts, of which 700 will be in Virginia and North Carolina.","Earlier this month, we announced we will add solar generation to serve a new data center Facebook plans to build in Central Virginia. Pending State Corporation Commission approval, this need will be met with a new rate option, Schedule RF, which will allow large energy users to meet their needs through the addition of renewable energy resources.","We are currently evaluating the potential for pump storage project in the coalfield region of Virginia. A preliminary permanent application has been filed with FERC, identifying a potential project site in Tazewell County, Virginia. We've also contracted with Virginia Tech to study the feasibility of using an abandoned coal mine in Wise County to construct a pump storage facility. The General Assembly has enacted legislation stating that construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest with costs recoverable through a rate rider.","In July, we announced that we had signed an agreement with \u00d8rsted, formerly DONG Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind development, to build two turbines off the coast of Virginia Beach. The two companies are now refining agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction. Dominion Energy will remain the sole owner of the project, which is targeted for completion in 2020. We plan to seek wider recovery for the project during the first half of next year.","We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Through the end of the third quarter, $419 million of assets have been placed into service. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year and every year thereafter for at least the next decade.","Progress on our growth plan for Gas Infrastructure continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction Project is now 97% complete and remains on-time and on-budget. Construction is essentially complete. All processes have been turned over for site commissioning and we have entered the final phase of start-up. We have completed the initial operating run on auxiliary reboilers, steam turbine generators, Frame 7EA combustion turbine, and numerous motors, pumps, and compressors that are part of the liquefaction process.","FERC has approved the introduction of all hydrocarbons necessary to generate LNG. The operation's formal training is complete. We are fully staffed with trained and qualified operators. We will begin generating LNG next month, then conclude commissioning in December, and expect to be in service by the end of the year.","We're continuing the work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. On October 13, FERC issued its Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, and we filed our acceptance of the certificate the following week. The project has achieved several additional permitting milestones over the last few weeks, including the Biological Opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, approval of the Virginia Outdoor Foundation easements, and approval from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.","ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contracts, and completed 90% of materials procurement. We expect to commence construction late this year and to complete both the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.","We've also made progress on nine Gas Infrastructure growth projects representing over $1 billion of investment. Three of these projects have been completed this year, and we expect two more to be completed by year-end. In addition to these incremental projects, we plan to invest $325 million to $350 million per year in our three gas utilities as part of our ongoing pipeline replacement programs. These costs are recoverable through rate rider programs in all three jurisdictions.","And in September, we announced a long-term investment program to modernize our Dominion Energy Transmission's pipeline and storage infrastructure. These investments will deliver operating reliability, security, safety, and environmental benefits, and are expected to total about $250 million per year. To support this investment program, we plan to file a rate case in the first half of next year, the first for this pipeline in over 20 years, in which we will request updated rates and establish a tracker for recovery of the modernization investments.","Finally, earlier this month, Dominion Energy's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.77 per share for the fourth quarter of this year, an increase of 10% above the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase reflects the board's confidence in Dominion Energy's execution of its growth plan, and the enhanced cash flows made possible by our master limited partnership. Our plan is to share these benefits with our shareholders by growing our dividend at a 10% rate through at least 2020.","So, to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on-time and on-budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction Project is essentially complete, and commissioning is well underway to be in service late this year, on-time and on-budget. We received the FERC Certificate for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Project and will commence construction soon.","And we expect earnings of at least 10% in 2018, driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction Project, and 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020. We further expect earnings per share growth of at least 5% per year thereafter, supported by a diverse set of growth programs. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020.","With that, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to follow-up on the progress in Connecticut. It's very good to see the legislative progress. I was reading, I guess, the budget that's available for renewable solicitations was reduced under the budget that the legislature has established. Can you speak to the implications? Is there \u2013 do you believe the Governor is likely to support this lower budget for renewables? How does that potentially impact the ability to get the needed dollars here to support the plant?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Stephen, first, we're not going to comment any further on what's going on in Connecticut. The Governor has the budget and the Millstone legislation, and until we've gotten through that process, we're just going to remain \u2013 we'll see what happens. We'll have further comments after that has taken its course.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Very much understood. And then just shifting over to the new $250 million a year of modernization. Would you mind just speaking a little bit further to the approval process, just the timeline? You mentioned when you'd be filing, but could you help us just understand how this might play out procedurally?","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Hi. This is Diane Leopold. So, we're looking to file probably towards the middle of next year and a typical process with FERC, we would expect to hear back in the course of anywhere in 6- to 12-month timeframe with the initial feedback from them, and we will begin to negotiate with the customers during that timeframe. In addition to the actual base rate, the rates for the base, we are filing for a modernization program and that will be going on simultaneously with the base rate.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And so, that customer negotiation process will essentially occur in tandem with the FERC process, is that fair to say?","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Yes.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you very much.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So, first, about the 2017 guidance. Did I hear right that you said that you expect to be at least at the midpoint, yet the weather has been a pretty meaningful drag year-to-date? So, what's the offset here to get to the midpoint of the guidance range?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Angie, I think what we said in the script \u2013 this is Mark \u2013 is that we expect to be at least 10% off the midpoint of the range for 2018.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And nothing about where within the 2017 EPS guidance range you will end up?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Well, what we showed in terms of the guidance on our slide is a range of $0.80 to $1. And if you take that, coupled with what our actual earnings were for the first three quarters, that would put you about at the $3.60 range which says that, if we can achieve that, we've made up $0.07 of the $0.12 worth of weather headwind that we're \u2013 have projected. And if we can get a little help with the weather the rest of this year or operating expenses, we may be able to make up more. But right now, we've guided to about $3.60 on the midpoint of the fourth quarter range.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Very good. Secondly, can you comment, any updated thoughts on the impact of the proposed tax reform on Dominion, especially given the more clarity on the deductibility of interest expense?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Angie, this is Mark. We want to see the House bill come out. We've been saying since first of the year, we think right now, everybody should assume we're net neutral. But if the interest deductibility is handled appropriately, we can certainly be a net positive on that, depending what the actual tax rate would be for corporations at the end of the day. But there's so many moving parts and we'd really like to hold off until we see the House bill, which I think is scheduled to come out November 1, and then we'll be able to talk more about that.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Very good. And my last question on Cove Point and DM. I understand that you don't need any drop downs into the MLP in order to get to the 22% growth in distribution. But the stock has been really strong DM, and the asset is \u2013 I mean, she's (25:06) starting operations probably within weeks. You have, in the past, done opportunistic drop downs. Would you consider it as well this time?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","We would consider an early drop if DM continues to perform well and the unit performs well, which we fully expect. So, we will take advantage of the market conditions out there. We've only given the reference that we don't need a drop and actually we need very small drop until late 2018. But again, if market conditions continue to be good, we can drop at any time after the Cove Point comes online.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Morning.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Hey. How much of the surprise is the Connecticut legislation to you? Like, what do you think their chances of success are in getting it signed by the Governor, especially since I guess he was involved in the process of negotiating its final form?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Well, there's two parts to that question. First part, how surprised are we? We weren't surprised. We've been working on it for two years and been deeply involved in it for that period of time. And as far as how the Governor is going to react to it, we're going to make no further comments on what goes on in Connecticut until we get on the other side of that process.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","What kind of \u2013 what would you be looking for in terms of trying \u2013 length of contract there and what kinds of factors would you be looking to see in advance before you decide how long a contract you would want to have from Millstone?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","We're just going to have to hold off on giving any further information on what the future of Millstone Power Station is and how it will play through under this auction until we get through this legislative process.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Fair enough. All right. Thank you very much.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta from Citigroup.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So, I thought your growth story laid out through 2020 was pretty clear in terms of all these projects. I just wanted to understand the 5% that you've talked about post 2020, and you said a balanced mix. Could you just give some color on what are the factors driving the post-2020 growth? Any big projects you're considering or is there M&A involved in that as well?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","There's no M&A involved in that, and there aren't any big projects. I think if you look at the presentations we've made through these fall conferences, we lay out a more programmatic method of achieving that growth post 2020 in all aspects \u2013 all parts of the business. There's a lot of slides available on our website. I think they can take you through all that. Mark, do you want to add anything?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Praful, we purposely wanted to get investors refocused on the core strength of Dominion's many businesses. And so, we have two great, large projects, obviously moving along with ACP and Cove Point. But the post 2020, I think if you look at the presentations we've made in conferences, you see very strong organic growth in all of our business lines which we think strongly support at least 5% growth going forward. And again, I would just encourage you to go ahead and take a look at that.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. Thanks, guys. Will do.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sorry, just a second follow-up question on \u2013 I won't get into the Millstone side with Connecticut, but just on the DOE legislation, do you think \u2013 is there any impact of that on the process or how are you looking at the DOE support for base load? Do you think anything comes off that at all?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Are you talking about the DOE letter to FERC initiating the rule-making?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. That's right.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","It's going to be very interesting to see but \u2013 what happens, I mean we still only have three FERC commissioners and two more coming. So, I don't think we really have an idea. And I've read some comments by at least one of them who doesn't think we should \u2013 as he had put it, should be putting their finger on the scales of fuel sources. But they've reacted quickly. I don't want to predict how that's going to come out, but it certainly \u2013 Connecticut certainly hasn't been willing to depend on it.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Back in September, in one of your slide decks, you laid out a CapEx plan of $3.7 billion to $4.2 billion per year. I wanted to confirm that that applies to the 2018 to 2020 period, and get a little bit of a better sense on timing of that CapEx, I guess, excluding Atlantic Coast. I think it's probably a fair assumption to say that the Power Delivery and Gas Infrastructure parts of that are pretty visible and pretty stable for the most of part, and that the Power Generation would be the lumpier part of it. Is that fair, and can you give us more detail on timing?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Chris, it's Mark. I'm not sure that's exactly fair. I think on the Power Gen side for the next three years, they have a pretty clear plan on what they're going to do between solar, the license extension work for the two \u2013 for the nuclear plants in Virginia. And I would \u2013 if I had to model right now \u2013 because I know we owe you some exposure on this, but if I had to model it, I would just model it evenly over the three years, be pretty consistent, I think, and would be pretty consistent by business line.","We also have highlighted a project on the pump storage side that we'll also be spending CapEx on in that period of time as well as well into the next decade in potentially offshore wind, certainly a smaller project with two turbines. So, we've highlighted that we'll be going through the approval process and we've highlighted some dollar figures around that. So, we've given quite a bit of disclosure, but we'll need to give a little more granularity, I think, by business line as we move into 2018, 2019, and 2020.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess shifting to the balance sheet side of it, if we use that range of CapEx or maybe a midpoint as one part of the equation, add in your kind of known dividend growth through the end of this decade and drop down financing as well, at what point do you get comfortable with your balance sheet as having enough excess capacity to buy back shares?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Well, I think that'll depend on the size of drops we make into Dominion Midstream from Cove Point. We've made a commitment to agencies and investors and bondholders that we know we have too much leverage at the Holdco. We've done that by design, and we're going to use the DM drop down structure to delever the Holdco between now and the end of the decade down into 30% to 40% of the family of Dominion debt.","And I think we can do that comfortably with drop downs into DM for the period with Cove Point and has the potential to buy back shares if that's the best use of those proceeds. We could buy back shares, we could also just invest in future growth that may come up that we kind of identified already. So, again, I think we have a lot of flexibility and we feel real comfortable about being able to execute on both sides between now and 2020.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Tom, you indicated you were more than three-quarters of the way in the farm-outs. Is there upside to that ultimate number?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","I wouldn't think so. I think we do expect to land on that $450 million to $500 million. It's just, I think, more will be more timing of when the farm-outs come in. But I wouldn't \u2013 I'd love to say yes, but I don't think that would be reasonable at this time, unless you see dramatic increase in commodity prices.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And you said you've hedged into 1Q of 2018 at Millstone. Can you tell us how much you've hedged?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","We haven't disclosed how much we've hedged but we're working hard on hedging the first quarter. We will go into the year very highly hedged again based on our expectation of the timing of the Connecticut auction. But because that's certainly won't be, we don't believe, in the first quarter of next year, we elected to go ahead and starting hedging and have for some time the first quarter. Also, we will not be, Paul, disclosing hedged prices at Millstone because we will be in competitive auction for some load at Millstone, we certainly hope. And so, we historically have put a hedge price out, but going forward, for competitive reasons, we will not put a hedge price out.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you for that. And what do you expect your solar tax credits to be for the full year?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Our solar tax credit is going to be about half what they were last year, about $0.26 a share.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I thought we had a $0.31 pickup this quarter. Is there a timing issue there?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Those ITCs revolve around but I think the $0.26, we feel really good for year-end. And if you recall, I'll remind everybody, not only have we backed it down to half this year but on a going forward basis that you should think about a $0.10 range, plus or minus for ITCs going forward. So, we're kind of out the ITC business except for some unusual projects that might come up in Virginia and North Carolina.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Would you have a sense of the capital at the pump storage, or is it too early for that?","Paul D. Koonce - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Paul, this is Paul Koonce. It's really too early for that. I think we've said publicly, could be up to $2 billion, but it really is a site-specific number and we're just really not there yet.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just wanted to follow-up on some of the projects that you laid out there, in particular Atlanta Coast Pipe, congrats on getting the FERC Certificate there. Was just wondering if you could provide a bit more color on the state-level side, as far as getting the permits and how you see that process progressing. It seems like there's been some noise out there, so want to see any thoughts that you could share.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","I'll give you a general answer and Diane can fill in any specific questions. We really, there's \u2013 we need water permits in West Virginia and North Carolina and Virginia. We expect all those by the middle part of December, as we're going through the process. It's a very typical process, lots of questions come from the regulators. We provide answers that makes them ask more questions, and we provide more answers. But we're coming to the end of that process, and we expect to have all those permits by the middle part of December and be underway. Diane, anything to add to that?","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","No. That's right.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Okay.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And just thinking about the assets that sit at DM right now, I was wondering if you could provide any update as far as how the existing growth projects are progressing. I think there's some small ones there. And any thoughts for the MLP kind of taking on more organic growth initiatives at that level going forward?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Jeremy, this is Mark. The growth projects at DM right now are mainly focused on Carolina Gas Transmission. And they're the same as we've highlighted when we actually IPO-ed, they've been executed very well. We're going to bring the third one on this year \u2013 at the end of this year. We'll spend CapEx of about a little bit over $100 million on it, fully contracted. We look for really good future growth out of the Carolina business.","We also look for very good future growth out of the Questar Pipeline for this calendar year. Most of the growth out of Questar that's been executed is really based on synergies of the merger, and we've been able to execute that at a very high level and, actually, we'll be able to produce at a higher level for the Questar Pipe than we anticipated early in the year for DM. So again, our goal over time is to get more assets into DM that can grow organically. But quite honestly, for the next three years, that will be dwarfed by the Cove Point drop down.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That makes sense. Turning to Cove a bit more here. It seems like there's a bit of open capacity, if I have my numbers right, with regards to how much you contracted out and what the full capacity of the facility could be. And just wondering how you think about the extra capacity; if everything hits kind of nameplate or exceeds, would you look to contract that out? How do you think about the value there and the state of the LNG market? And how might that play into the MLP drop down economics?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good question. But the way that \u2013 our shippers get to take up whatever excess capacity there is.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's all from me. Thanks.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Thank you. I'm talking about our existing shippers obviously.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","It's been some time since I dealt with a pipeline rate case. Could you guys give a little bit of feeling about what the ROE that you guys are earning at DETI and what you might be asking for in terms of the ROE and what have you?","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Hi. This Diane Leopold. You can really look to the last filed rate cases that are out there for any kind of guidance on that. We're not going to talk about the actual ROE that we earn right now. But we are very comfortable that we've been investing in the system and now is the right time to be going in for a rate case.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. What's the actual asset value that we're talking about, the rate base, I guess, that we're talking about?","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","It's about $2 billion.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And you're not going to give us right now a sense as to what you guys are earning or we'll just have to wait for the filing, I guess, is that right?","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","That is correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the Dominion Products and Services agreement with HomeServe, could you give us a sense as to \u2013 just elaborate a little bit on that in terms of what's the earnings impact associated with that and what's actually going on?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Hey, Paul. This is Mark. This structure with HomeServe, very similar to other utilities that you'd be familiar with. They are partnered with Duke. They're partnered with NextEra. They're partnered with AEP. They're partnered with FirstEnergy. And the structure essentially is that you jointly market to customers that \u2013 using a joint marketing of Dominion Energy and HomeServe. And so it's a pretty common structure.","The way it'll work for us is, over time, starting in the fourth quarter of this year, the existing business we have, which only contributes for us about $0.01 or $0.02 a year, but it's been a very stable good growth business for us, but yeah a small level, we will start transitioning that Product and Service customer base to HomeServe, for them to service and grow from there. That'll take some time to do. And from then on, we will get a commission-based fee as they grow that business going forward.","They are the major player in this market. And so, they were very interested in acquiring our customer base there for Products and Services. It was a good deal for us, but in terms of the earnings component, I'm going to hint a little bit on that only because it hasn't closed yet and there will be some movement year-to-year from this year to next year based on the closing and consents but it is in our guidance for the fourth quarter, and we'll be able to talk more about that because we'll have closed the transaction by the next call.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So, it's transactional-related and it's probably pretty much just a fourth quarter event? Can you give us the...","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","No. It'll be more than just a fourth quarter event.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So, it's an ongoing event?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","That's right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But you're not going to tell us the full amount? But it's significant enough for you to call it out for the fourth quarter? Is that the right way to think about it?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's the right way to think about it. I mean, we announced it publicly, and we wanted to make sure everybody knew what's in our guidance, but it won't be just a fourth quarter event; it'll be a multi-year event and then some with commissions.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes this morning's conference call. You may now disconnect your line and enjoy your day. Have a great day."],"6797":["Dominion Resources, Inc.

On the call today, we have Tom Farrell, CEO; Mark McGettrick, CFO; and other members of senior management. At this time each of your lines is in listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation, we will open the floor for questions. (Operator Instructions)","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tom Harlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning, for the Safe Harbor statement.","Tom Harlin","Good morning, and welcome to Dominion\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning\u2019s earnings release and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the investor relations page on our website, register for e-mail alerts, and view our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings documents. Our website address is www.dom.com. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will guide this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language, the earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.","Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our fourth quarter and full year 2013 operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2014, as well as operating earnings before interest and tax commonly referred to as EBIT.","Reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained on Schedules 2 and 3 and pages eight and nine in our earnings release kit.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick, and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for 2013 and our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2014. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities for the year and review the progress we\u2019ve made on our growth plan.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion faced a number of challenges in 2013 and we overcame nearly all of them to produce operating earnings of $3.25 per share which were well within our guidance range of $3.20 to $3.50 per share.","Excluding the impact of mild weather, operating earnings would have been at the midpoint of our guidance range and supportive of our growth targets. The principal drivers of the differences between actual results and the midpoint of our guidance range are highlighted on slide three.","Let\u2019s walk through the pluses and minuses. For the year, weather normalized sales at Dominion Virginia Power were up 1.3% over 2012, which compares favorably with other utilities but below our original growth estimate of 2%.","Earnings from our merchant generation business were below our expectations, primarily due to power basis movement both in the Mid-Atlantic region which affects margins from our Fairless Works plant in New England that impacts our margins at Millstone. The mild weather also reduced ancillary service revenue below our estimates.","Earnings from our Blue Racer joint venture beside from the benefits of the contribution of the TL-388 pipeline were below expectation due to the in-service stately delay at Natrium, as well as the fire-related outage at that facility.","Other negative factors included the absence of earnings from producer services, as well as lower margins from our retail business. Offsetting these challenges were earnings from the contribution of the TL-388 pipeline to the Blue Racer joint venture, lower income taxes and over $100 million in reduced O&M expenses.","With normal weather, our operating earnings for 2013 would have been $3.35 per share, which was the midpoint of our guidance range. However, weather was much milder than normal equivalent to $0.10 per share for the year.","GAAP earnings were $2.93 per share for 2013. The difference between GAAP and operating earnings is primarily driven by charges associated with the sale of the breaking point in Kincaid power plant and charges related to the ongoing exit of our producer services business. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Before I discuss specifics segment results, let me mentioned that we have shifted our unregulated retail unit to our generation segment for reporting purposes, so as I go over annual results, retail will not be in Dominion Virginia Power but in generation. Please note, all disclosures remain the same, the change just mirrors our management reporting change.","Now moving to results by operating segment, at Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for 2013 was $945 million, which was below the midpoint of its guidance range. Kilowatt hour sales were below expectations largely due to milder than normal weather. Excluding weather, sales were up 1.3% for the year. ","EBIT from electric transmission exceeded its guidance range due to our ability to accelerate the in-service dates of some projects. This business unit added about $700 million in net plant in service in 2013. 2013 EBIT for Dominion Energy was $1.08 billion, which was above the top of this guidance range. The contribution of the TL-388 pipeline to Blue Racer in the third quarter added about $75 million to EBIT. ","Other positive factors contributing to the strong results of Dominion Energy were lower operating and maintenance expenses, lower fuel costs, and the first year\u2019s contribution from the farmout of the Marcellus acreage in West Virginia. Partially offsetting these positives were the start-up delay and fire-related outage at Natrium and the absence of earnings from the activities of our Producer Services businesses that are being closed out and exited. ","Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $1.7 billion in 2013, which was below this guidance range. EBIT from utility generation was below the guidance range because of lower kilowatt hour sales, winter [ph] mild weather and lower than expected weather normalized sales growth. Also, revenues from ancillary services were below expectations due to mild weather. These negatives were partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expenses and higher rider related revenues. ","EBIT for Dominion Generation was below its guidance range because of lower gross margins. Power basis movements in both PJM and NEPOOL impacted margins from our Fairless Works plant and Millstone respectively. EBIT for Dominion Retail was below its guidance range in 2013 due to weaker margins. ","On a consolidated basis, our effective tax rate was 33.3% for the year compared to a 35.5% rate for the midpoint of our guidance range. Interest expenses were in line with our expectations. Overall we are pleased with our 2013 operating results, which were nearly 7% higher than 2012. ","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $3.6 billion for 2013. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.9 billion. And taking into account cash and short-term investments, we ended the year with liquidity of $1.8 billion. ","During the year, we extended the terms of all of our credit facilities through September 2018. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 24 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to our financing plans. In September, we announced the formation of Dominion Gas Holdings, a first tier subsidiary holding company for most of our rate regulated natural gas businesses. Dominion Gas Holdings provides greater visibility of the capital structure and earnings from these businesses and allows us to raise capital on better terms.","In October, Dominion Gas raised $1.2 billion through a 144A senior notes offering, consisting of 3, 10 and 30-year notes, which are expected to be registered with the SEC this year. We plan to issue another $1 billion in debt for Dominion Gas Holdings in 2014. ","Our total debt needs are shown on Slide 5. We plan to issue about $750 million in debt for Virginia Power and about $400 million in Dominion parent company debt this year. ","Yesterday, Moody\u2019s raised its ratings on the debt of Virginia Power and Dominion Gas Holdings from \u2013 to A2 from A3. The rating action reflects Moody\u2019s more favorable view of the relative credit supportiveness of the U.S. regulatory environment. The Baa2 rating on Dominion\u2019s parent company was confirmed, along with the stable outlook for all three ratings. ","In September, we announced that we plan to form an MLP this year. Overtime the expected cash flows from Cove Point import and export and the Blue Racer Midstream joint venture will be used to fund distributions.","We still plan to file the S-1 by the end of the first quarter and come to market some time around the middle of the year. It is our intention to make the draft filings publicly available through the securities exchange commission. The MLP structure including the partnerships and incentive distribution rights is expected to create significant value to Dominion\u2019s shareholders.","Our equity issuance plans for 2014 will include another issue of mandatory convertibles, the proceeds from the MLP\u2019s initial public offering and our dividend reinvestment and other stock purchase plans. The specific amounts from each source including DRIP plan will utilize new shares or market purchases for 2014 but depend on market conditions in the size of the IPO, which we cannot disclose at this time.","Now to earnings guidance, our operating earnings guidance for 2014 is $3.35 to $3.65 per share. This range supports our 5% to 6% growth expectations. We have highlighted the principal drivers for 2014 on Slide 6.","Positive factors relative to 2013 include our return to normal weather, higher revenues from a capital projects subject to rider treatment, sales growth at Virginia Power and a lower effective income tax rate. Partially offsetting these positive drivers are higher operating and maintenance expenses, the essence of earnings from our electric retail business, higher interest expenses and higher depreciation.","Regarding sales growth at Virginia Power, our guidance incorporates 1.5% increase in weather normalized kilowatt hour sales. As I mentioned earlier, sales growth in 2013 is 1.3% weather normalized. We sold good growth in fourth quarter of last year as continued through the first month of this year.","Our operating earnings guidance for first quarter of 2014 is $0.85 to $1 per share compared to $0.83 per share for the first quarter of 2013. The midpoint of this range produces an 11% increase over last year\u2019s first quarter.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 28 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call, we\u2019ve increased our Millstone hedge position from 83% to 92% for 2014, from 71% to 81% for 2015, and from 11% to 23% in 2016.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $3.25 per share for 2013, which were within our guidance range. Lower O&M expenses, lower taxes and incremental asset dropped Blue Racer offsetting number of unplanned challenges during the year.","However, mild weather reduced earnings by $0.10 per share. Excluding the mild weather, operating earnings would have been at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our financing plan for 2014 include debt offerings for Virginia Power, Dominion Resources and Dominion Gas Holdings and offering of mandatory convertible securities and initial public offering of our master limited partnership. And finally, our operating earnings guidance for 2014 is $3.35 to $3.65 per share. Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter is $0.85 to $1 per share.","Before I turn the call over to Tom Farrell, let me mention two strategic initiatives we are currently pursuing. First, we expect to grow our fleet of contracted solar projects over the next 24 months by nearly 250 megawatts and are in active discussions with multiple parties to achieve this. We should expect the number of the projects to come in on line in both 2014 and 2015.","Finally, as we continue to fine tune our business model, we've elected to exit our unregulated electric retail business. The sales process is underway and we expect to have the transaction complete over the next several months. Both these strategic moves are factored into our 2014 earnings guidance. I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","","Tom Farrell","","Good morning. Our business units delivered outstanding operational and safety performance in 2013. Dominion Energy delivered its best safety year on record with Gas Distribution having its best safety year ever and Gas Transmission having its second best year. ","Dominion Virginia Power also delivered the second best safety year in its history. The nuclear business unit reported only five OSHA recordable and our Power Generation Unit also had a strong year with only 12. ","The nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor of 93.7%, the highest in its history, including a new record of 125 continuous days online for all seven units. We had four breaker-to-breaker runs, one each at North Anna Unit 1, Surry Unit 1, Millstone Unit 3 and Kewaunee whose employees ended 40 years of nuclear operation on a high note. Both Surry Units 1 and 2 have been running continuously since our last refueling and have gone over 1000 days without a trip. ","Our Power Generation Utility achieved a 2013 forced outage rate of just 2.4%, its best ever. Power generation\u2019s combined cycle fleet also had a best on record forced outage rate of just 1.2%. Dominion Energy also delivered strong operating performance in 2013 with record setting operations at our Hastings processing and fractionation plant. In Ohio, over 130 miles of bare-steel pipe were replaced as part of our Pipeline Infrastructure Replacement program. ","Additionally, new transport agreements were executed with producers to move over one billion cubic feet per day of Marcellus and Utica production. ","Our business units performed well during the recent record cold weather that has hit the Eastern United States. On January 7, Dominion zone set a new winter peak demand of 19,785 megawatts, an increase of almost 10% above the previous record set in 2007. On the same day, Gas Transmission also set a new peak with a one-hour send-out rate equal to 7.65 billion cubic feet per day. ","We continue to move forward on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,329 megawatt Warren County combined-cycle plant is progressing on schedule and on budget for a late 2014 commercial operation date. Overall, the project is about 75% complete and about 1,200 people are presently employed at the site. ","We have begun construction of a 1,358 megawatt three-on-one combined-cycle facility in Brunswick County and expect the plan to be in service by mid-2016. The gas and steam turbines have been procured and major equipment deliveries will commence this quarter. The gas transportation supplier Transco, received the FERC certificate authorizing construction of the natural gas pipeline connection to the plant. ","The conversions of the Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell plants from coal to biomass were all completed on time and on budget. Each of the plant was a coal-fired facility that operated at a very low capacity factor. With the low cost of fuel, these 50 megawatt wood-burning facilities should be dispatched on a regular basis. ","On September 10, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the company\u2019s CPCN application to modify the existing Bremo Power Station's Unit 3 and 4 to use natural gas instead of coal as the primary fuel. The EPC contractor is on schedule and Columbia Gas of Virginia has completed the gas line for the facility. The station should commence on schedule and on budget operations on natural gas this summer. ","We completed a number of small renewable projects in 2013. The 14.9 megawatt fuel cell project in Bridgeport, Connecticut, secured by long-term power purchase agreement, achieved commercial operation in December. In the fourth quarter, we completed three solar projects, also secured by long-term power purchase agreements in Georgia, Indiana and Connecticut. ","As Mark noted, we expect to grow our fleet of contracted solar projects over the next 24 months by nearly 250 megawatts and are in active discussions with multiple parties to achieve this. We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During 2013, $716 million of transmission assets were place into service.","Electric transmissions capital budget for growth projects in 2014 is over $750 million. This includes NERC, RTEP, as well as maintenance and security related investments. Moreover, our project pipeline continues to remain full through the remainder of the decade.","Progress in our growth plan for Dominion Energy also continues. Two projects with Dominion Transmission were completed and placed in the service during 2013. About the savings build and more so in the Tioga Area Expansion Projects were completed on time and under budget.","Construction continues on the Allegheny Storage Project. We expect injections this spring and be fully operational by November. When I turn to market projects, we received FERC certification in September. Construction will begin in the spring from an expected November 2014 in-service date.","We continue to pursue new gas infrastructure opportunities. Last call, we announced the Marcellus Farmout Initiatives, which involved nearly 100,000 acres that Marcellus provides below some of our West Virginia storage fields. We have retained all other mineral rights. We have reached agreements with multiple counterparties involving that acreage, which will involve series of new revenue streams over the next decade.","We expect these agreements to generate EBIT of approximately $20 million annually from ongoing lease and drilling activity payments. Additional revenues will accrue from drilling activity itself and also from royalty payments based on the volume of gas produced.","Last call, we announced several new pipeline expansion projects. Senior agreements were signed with Brooklyn Union and Niagara Mohawk for our new market project in New York State. Expanded service of 112,000 dekatherms per day for 15 years will begin in November 2016.","We\u2019ve also entered into multiple development agreements to provide transportation services to power plant developers along our Cove Point pipeline in Maryland. In addition to this pipeline expansion projects, we have had continued success in providing incremental transportation agreements as a result of the growing production within our region.","We have previously described some of these projects as producer outlet projects, taking advantage of the flexibility of Dominion Energy\u2019s pipeline network to provide incremental services to shorter lead times in minimal capital investment. These projects include the following, binding precedent agreements with the Dominion Transmission or Dominion East Ohio, the firm transportation service already begun or beginning later this year.","The 10-year agreement with Gulfport for 100,000 dekatherms per day, the 10-year agreement with NextEra Energy for 100,000 dekatherms per day, a 6-year agreement with J. Aaron for 150,000 dekatherms per day. The 21-year agreement with Gulfport Energy for 150,000 dekatherms per day, a 17-year agreement with American Energy-Utica LLC for 100,000 dekatherms per day and a Western Access project on the Dominion East Ohio system through 10-years for 300,000 dekatherms per day.","And for service beginning in 2016, a 15-year agreement with CNX Gas for 250,000 dekatherms per day in the Marcellus Farmout acreage to interconnects with Texas Eastern and Rockies Express. These projects were all outside of the Blue Racer joint venture and 100% owned by Dominion.","The Utica region continues to be very active. Through mid-January, a total of 1,042 horizontal wells permits have been issued and 679 wells have been drilled, an increase of 9% in wells permitted and 14% in wells drilled in the past three months, the number of producing wells increased by 60% from 169 to 270 during the same period.","Now, an update on Blue Racer, Blue Racer\u2019s Natrium I processing and fractionation plan was out of service since September 21 due to fire, the damage to the small area of the plant. I\u2019m happy to report the repairs are complete and the plant is running and fully available. ","As Mark mentioned earlier, the TL-388 pipeline was contributed to Blue Racer at the end of September. This will serve as a central frontline that provides further connectivity between Blue Racer\u2019s gathering lines and key producing acreage. Blue Racer has entered into long-term acreage dedication agreements with many of the Utica Shale\u2019s leading natural producers, including Eclipse Resources, Hess Corporation, Consol Energy, PDC Energy, Chesapeake Energy, Total, Rex Energy and EnerVest for gathering, processing and transportation services. ","The acreage covered in these agreements total more than 300,000 and will be more than enough at full production to support both the Natrium Phase II and Berne processing plants. Blue Racer is in various stages of discussion for additional acreage dedication. ","Natrium Phase II is expected to be commissioned in March bringing the nameplate processing capacity of the Natrium site to 400 million cubic feet per day, the first 200 mcf per day cariogenic processing plant at Berne is expected to be online by the end of the third quarter. The Berne site is designed to accommodate three of these plants. The current fractionation capacity at Natrium is 46,000 barrels and we will accommodate the volumes from both Natrium Phase I and II, as well, first processing plant at Berne. ","Fractionation capacity at Natrium will be expanded up to 126,000 barrels per day by march 2015, providing increased ethane recovery capabilities and accommodating future NGL volume growth from further expansion at the Berne site. A 30-mile, Y-grade pipeline will carry processed liquids from Berne to Natrium for fractionation. ","Takeaway capabilities at Natrium includes rail, truck, pipeline and soon, barging. Natrium is the only fractionation facility that offer barge services to Utica producers. Blue Racer\u2019s ethane pipeline provides direct access to Enterprise\u2019s ATEX pipeline. Additional pipeline access out of Natrium will provide connectivity to Sunoco\u2019s Mariner East and Mariner West pipelines and Enterprise\u2019s TEPPCO Pipeline. ","Blue Racer is actively pursuing interconnect to other long-haul NGL pipes that are waiting approval. In addition to its interconnections with the Dominion Transmission and Dominion East Ohio, Blue Racer is establishing new pipeline interconnections with Texas Eastern and is approved establishing inner connection with Rockies Express. We continue to make progress on our Cove Point Liquefaction Projects as well. ","As you know, the Department Of Energy approved our request for permit to export LNG to non-FTA countries in early September. We still need several permits including a FERC environmental permit and permits from the state of Maryland. ","Last week, the staff of the Maryland Public Service Commission recommended approval of the CPCN for Cove Point and we expect commission consideration and approval in May. Subject to this regulatory and other approvals, we expect to commence construction this year with commercial operation expected in late 2017. ","Finally, in late November, the Virginia State Corporation Commission issued an order in the 2013 biennial review confirming that earnings of Virginia Power for 2011 and 2012 do not exceed 11.4%. As a result, Virginia Power\u2019s base rates cannot be reduced until 2017 at the earliest. The base return on equity for the 2015 biennial review as well as interim updates for our router projects is set at 10%. ","So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in 2013. Construction of the Warren County Power Station is proceeding on time and on budget. Construction has begun on the Brunswick Power Station and is proceeding on time and on budget. Our Blue Race joint venture. Dominion East Ohio and Dominion Transmission are capitalized on the growth opportunities in Utica and Marcellus Shale regions. We look forward to receiving our remaining regulatory approvals to begin construction of our Cove Point Liquefaction Project. ","Also, similar to our earlier decision to exit most of our producer services activity, we continue to analyzed business opportunities and optimization of capital in support of our growth plan and have elected to exit our unregulated retail electric business and invest at a higher level in generation solar projects, which provide more stable long-term return.","And finally we plan to file a registration statement, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the initial public offering of the Master-Limited Partnership by the end of the first quarter. It is our intent to make the draft filing publicly available through the commission. We plan to come to market with the MLP sometime in the middle of the year.","Thank you. And we are ready to take the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Thank you. So my first question is about the retail business, you've decided to divest the business, how should we think about it? So is it already included in the discontinued operations for 2014 and as such if not, this in fact is not embedded in 2014 guidance or will it happen on the -- once the business is sold?","Mark McGettrick","Angie, this is Mark, you're referring to the electric retail business that we just talked about.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Yes.","Mark McGettrick","We will take that -- we will take that as an asset held for sale or discontinued ops in the first quarter. And we will net that with the proceeds of the sales, so those results will be available hopefully at the end of the first quarter. They've already been reflected in our guidance range that we put out and been removed from that guidance range.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Okay. So I shouldn't worry about potential weak results due to the deep freeze in the northeast?","Mark McGettrick","No. We have taken any anticipated results in 2014 out of our guidance range for the electric unregulated retail business.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Okay. My second questions is, you mentioned that the 2014 guidance supports a 5% to 6% earnings growth and I'm -- and granted that there's been a lot of volatility in your earnings due to weather over the last couple of years? But how can we think about it, I mean, is this a long-term CAGR, is this an annual 5% to 6% growth of the actual 2012th level, do we adjust the weather, because it seems like, that the -- even if we adjust the weather the results are coming a little bit softer about 5% to 6% on an annual basis?","Tom Farrell","Angie, this is the way we think about it, first of all, when we talk about 5% to 6%, we talk about the weather normal. So for example, let's use '13 results look into '14, we produced earnings of $3.25 in 2013, we had headwinds of $0.10 for weather.","So our baseline is $3.35 when discussing what the growth rate should be off that. We came out with a range of $3.35 to $3.65 per share for this year, 5% I think, the math is about $3.51, and 6% would be about $3.55, its right about in the middle of that range. We try to do $0.05 increments, so we're not penny accurate on this, but we feel very comfortable that with normal weather a 5% to 6% growth rate off of $3.35 is achievable.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Okay. My last question, we are seeing some sensitivity of earnings of energy MLPs to gas prices and usually that was actually in the negative earnings revision's expectations? Now with gas prices going up, at least for 2014, how is your business, how are the assets slated for the MLP drop-downs? How are they sensitive to changes in gas prices?","Tom Farrell","Angie, the two assets that we're considering to enter into an MLP with one would be Cove Point, that's a capacity-based contract it has no commodity sensitivity at all, actually both on imports and on the exports side.","The other assets are in Blue Racer, a vast majority of those assets are on fixed price contracts, there is some volume variability on portions of it, but again not very sensitive at all to commodity. So our MLP assets should have very stable visible earnings as we are able to disclose what assets we drop down first.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Good morning guys. Mark, can you just maybe walk a little bit through the process for when you guys go to file with the SEC for the S-1. What is the process for the draft coming out and then what you guys have to do in the timeline between the draft coming out and getting the MLP done? Are there milestones you guys are looking for? What's the process to get to completion? ","Mark McGettrick","Dan, the process is pretty straightforward and we want to make it as transparent as possible. A lot of people when they file their S1s for review, they file it confidentially. So that they can address any questions that might come out from the SEC. The approach we are taking is we are going to file it publically. So as soon as we put it on the shelf everyone will be able to see what is in it and make their own conclusions. But the process essentially is once you file it the SEC will go back and put [ph] on questions that they might have and we will have to resolve those anything that\u2019s not clear to them within the filing. And that process usually takes about three months or so. ","So again we believe ours will be straightforward with the assets that we targeted. We think there will not be much controversy around it, but I am sure will be some clarity of filing, because the filing will be as all of them are extensive. So that is pretty much administrative I guess the way I would describe it after you file it at the end of the first quarter. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","And so Mark, I guess, thinking about the timing when you guys file it, three months later kind of puts you around second-quarter earnings results time I guess or you are almost in a quiet period. Does that mean that we probably should think late summer for this to get done just from a logistical perspective? ","Mark McGettrick","I just target mid-year, because -- we can\u2019t really control the SEC approval process, [indiscernible] on there but certainly we think three months after filing is a reasonable period of time. And mid-summer is probably an extension if everything goes according to plan.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","And then I guess, just on Slide 12 you guys give the long list of all the producer agreements you guys have struck in the quarter. What does that mean for CapEx? And as you see more people signing up and these basis differentials getting pretty painful, are you guys seeing an acceleration in CapEx opportunities as the winter has pushed on? ","Paul Koonce","Right now what we have been able to do is really re-purpose, re-optimize lot of the gas flows on the systems. So lot of the transportation agreements that we have been doing to date has really required pretty minimal amounts of capital, bidirectional meters and things of that nature. And clearly the basin as in general and our systems specifically are running out of those opportunities. So I think what we will see is we will transition into higher CapEx projects but for now we are able to accomplish a lot just given the nature of our system. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","So, Paul, does that mean that -- if you think about the next wave of agreements that you guys signed, are we going to see new CapEx announcements coming in the first half of this year if you guys get more deals done just because you\u2019ve run out of the spare space? ","Paul Koonce","Well, certainly it\u2019s a very active period and yes, those targets become defined, we have a very rigorous process here where we take it through and get the board approval and then we incorporate those in our five year plans and update our capital budgets at year end. So yes, I think when we get to that point you will see some change there.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","And I guess one last question. Mark, I know that the books aren't fully done for the year, but what was the earned ROE at VEPCo in 2013 and then for the 2014 guidance, just to confirm that you guys have seen VEPCo just earned a lot of ROE this year? ","Mark McGettrick","Dan, we will address that question when we make our annual filing with the SEC here at the end of the first quarter. Those numbers are still being worked on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Two questions for you. First, can you tell us what the earnings contribution from the electric retail business was in 2012 and 2013? ","Tom Farrell","I don\u2019t have it \u2013 for 2012, we will see if we can get that here while we have you on the phone. 2013 it was about $0.12 a share.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","So obviously we will sell that business, we will lose that income and then we will net the proceeds against -- the use of proceeds against that? ","Tom Farrell","Craig, let me make sure, I\u2019m clear on that so there is not any misunderstanding. Were you referencing the total retail business or just the electric business?","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","If you can give me both, that will be great?","Tom Farrell","Okay, well pretty straight forward, for \u201813, again it\u2019s about $0.12 for the total, it\u2019s about $0.06 for electric. And you can see on the chart where we show guidance from 2013 and 2014 where we took out the $0.06 for the electric piece for that business. For 2012, Craig, that number looks like, it\u2019s about $0.21 in terms of earnings from the retail business.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","In total?","Tom Farrell","That\u2019s right.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Second question, there have been some speculation given other company\u2019s pursuit of FERC approval that there were sort of backups in the system at the FERC that were logistical in nature with regard to getting certain agencies to review things on a timely nature namely [FISMA]. Can you talk about the timeline for getting your FERC approval and for that matter getting your Maryland approval. Since these were the two remaining hurdles and how you are sequencing the IPO process with regard to the expectation of that timing?","Mark McGettrick","Good morning. First the two approval, Maryland has a system where they have a coordinating\/administrative law judge who coordinates all the various permits that have to be issued for any individual project. He has already issued -- he or she, whoever the judge is, has issued a order already which is I think the third week in May, 22nd or 23rd of May some -- it\u2019s a date like that, which all the decisions have to be made.","As I mentioned earlier, one of the permits is the CPCN permit, generation facility at the site which the Maryland Public Utility Commission staff has recommended approval on in their filings, a couple of weeks ago.","So we expect the Maryland, all the various pieces, the Maryland process to be finished third week in May. FERC process is moving along as we anticipated. I know there is lots of talk out in the markets about what\u2019s going on in various places in the process. We are fully engaged in it and we have no reason at all to change our expectation that we\u2019ll have a FERC permit before the -- during the first half of the year. Once we have those two permits that will clear the way for whatever else is necessary to do our IPO.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you gentlemen.","Mark McGettrick","Thank you ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Tom Farrell","Morning Steven.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Hi Tom. So just could you maybe give us a sense on the -- you mention a tax rate reduction again in \u201814. Is that -- and is that related to this new solar program where you\u2019re getting tax benefits or is it other issues that are temporary?","Mark McGettrick","I think Steve, its going to be two things, one it\u2019s going to be the number of solar projects that we actually land in \u201814 versus \u201815. And the second will be, as it was mentioned on the number of other calls, we\u2019re in the final stages of closing out the IRS audits, legacy audits, we\u2019ve been doing over the last couple of years. We are two years left to do that. We\u2019re going to finish those in 2014. So those are kind of one-time event and the risk, the other difference would be the solar.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Can you give us the rough, well I guess it was 33 in \u201813, what will be in \u201814?","Tom Farrell","I think the range is going to be around 32.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","So pretty close. Okay. And just on the decision on the retail electric business, is it something that was kind of more strategic as you\u2019re thinking about the business and the year is there is something that came up related to just dramatic volatility we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks?","Tom Farrell","Excuse me, so you got -- Steve are you finished?","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","No, I\u2019ve just -- yeah, I\u2019m done, sorry.","Tom Farrell","Okay. As you can say from the earlier question, Mark answered about the margins that we got from the electric business in 2012 and the margins we got in the electric business in 2013. And I think it\u2019s all you have seen from the lot of our colleagues in the industry that have these retail businesses. The margins in the electric side of business have been shrinking. And you see increased volatility happening. Once now, the economy is coming back and we have -- looks like maybe have a normal winter. ","At least early part of the winter has been pretty normal or cold depending upon where you are. The combination of those factors leads us to -- it\u2019s like our producer services business we exited earlier in 2013. It just doesn\u2019t fit our business model. We have seen that in the first \u2013 we have been doing this business for almost 14 years, and gas is a very different business. Our products and services is a very different business because of where we sell the electricity in those regular retail markets and where we have assets, you don\u2019t have a matching capability of any real significance. ","So with the combination of those things, we have been looking -- we look at all of our businesses all the time about what fits and what doesn\u2019t fit. And we have outstanding people that have been running our retail books for these years, our electricity retail book but it just doesn\u2019t fit our business profile as we go forward.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. And just maybe last question on just your perspectives on the price rise we\u2019ve seen in the market, I guess particularly the gas market in the last few weeks and thoughts on how that fits in with your business plan and maybe more opportunities related to that?","Tom Farrell","One of the impacts you are seeing is the recognition by ISOs that there is not enough capacity in these markets. In New England and PJM, you\u2019ve seen issues around demand side management in PJM. You\u2019ve seen the recent changes in the capacity markets in NEPOOL. That\u2019s a very significant positive development for us, particularly in NEPOOL. This is the 17th auction that\u2019s coming up. So that\u2019s a couple years out. But I think the biggest thing for us \u2013 because we\u2019re down to such few unregulated assets is finally getting the recognition we believe that these markets are underserved and that more capacity is needed and hopefully that will reflect itself in these markets over the next few years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Hi good morning, it\u2019s actually Julien. First quick question here actually following up from the last comment you made. I am curious given what\u2019s going on in New England, how are you thinking about getting out of these markets here? I mean at this point are you \u2013 do you think you can get adequate value for those assets in New England given what\u2019s going on and given at least the energy and capacity price recognition? Is there a date out there?","Tom Farrell","You\u2019re talking about the assets that are in our retail electric book?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Or rather on the emergent side for the generation?","Tom Farrell","Now we have \u2013 there is no prospect about selling any of our merchant power plant we have remaining. Manchester in Rhode Island and obviously Maelstrom, Connecticut are two extraordinarily valuable assets for us as is Fairless Works in Pennsylvania. So there\u2019s \u2013 if you\u2019re talking about our generating assets, there is no \u2013 we have no inclination whatsoever to sell those assets.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","And could you elaborate just briefly here. I know this matter is relevant today but what kind of impact did you see here in the first month of January on the retail side given the volatility?","Tom Farrell","It\u2019s a volatile market out there. We are not going to quantify it for you but it\u2019s extraordinary to watch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Got you. And perhaps just on the other side of the equation, I\u2019m curious obviously a big storage position, how are you seeing the value of that storage improved here and are you being opportunistic to capitalize on that?","Paul Koonce ","Yes. This is Paul with Dominion Energy. Our storage is fully contracted. I mean we\u2019re the second or third largest storage operator in the world, in North America. All of that storage is really under long-term straight fixed, variable rate design contract. I think what it has done is reminded local distribution companies and pipeline companies that are customers of ours why these assets are important and why it\u2019s important to keep them contracted. So with the mild weather and with all the lines associated with the Marcellus and Utica, I think there were some that we\u2019re thinking that perhaps these assets were needed but what we experience in January is reminded everyone that current transportation and current storage have real value.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And further clarification on the gas side. Dominion East Ohio here you've kind of included historically as partially eligible for dropdown. Could you talk a little bit more about how much of that company would be eligible to be dropdown, could you explain upon that?","Tom Farrell","Again that is, that\u2019s in our Gas Holdings business right now. We're looking at that and to see on eligibility down the road. But if you remember all we\u2019ve committed to you thus far is a billion dollar plus or minus EBITDA for MLP out of Cove Point and Blue Racer. So we'll have time to look at those other issues down the road.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","","Got you. And then lastly here on the Solar change in tax. I'm curious is this part of a larger initiative over the next few years and specifically, I presume this is mostly utility scale that you're looking at?","","Tom Farrell","Yeah. This is utility scale. We are -- we started last year, actually in the year before looking at utility scale Solar that is going to accelerate. We put -- we developed some land many years, it has been at least five years ago now maybe longer.","And to see how that would work and what the value was for our shareholders and our customers. And we think Solar depicts our model that, kinds of things we will be looking at, we'll have power purchase agreement with them, we're not going to be in the merchant solar business. But we're looking at that part and we see some method and profitability.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Then just to clarify there, just the cash versus earnings profile is asset based, they generate enough net income for your purposes, just to be clear?","Tom Farrell","Yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","You don\u2019t have any issue. Okay. All right. Great. well, thank you again.","Tom Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","Tom Farrell","Good morning ","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Just wanted to revisit the low growth expectations, given where things ended up in '13, if you could just talk little bit more about the outlook for low growth in your service territory. What you're seeing and expecting?","Tom Farrell","Stephen, we had a very good fourth quarter in terms of low growth and sales growth. And we finished the year quite strong across all the segments. And I think one reason we wanted and to clarify what we thought future growth looks like with the whole year, is we're really looking to see what was going to happen in terms of sequestration and the federal budget approval. Both of those issues were kind of resolved early in the fourth quarter.","We had very strong new connects last year, over 31,000, we expect higher. All reports that we see not only Northern Virginia but around the state, show a pretty strong residential market improving. And we think with the funded budget amount coming out of the government, commercial is going to be strong for us again next year and governmental is going to recover.","Data center growth -- let me give you a feel for the fourth quarter. Our data center growth quarter-over-quarter grew 17% in the fourth quarter. We see clear path in 2014 for it to grow another 13%. So that's going to provide half of our growth just by itself.","The other half of the growth would be spread across customer classes. So we are certainly optimistic that 1% is very achievable and we hope it's going to be better and get back to more of a norm of 2%, 2.5%, which is a historical growth figure in Virginia.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","That's very helpful. Thank you. And just a follow-up on gas and basis. Lots of questions I know on that. At the Fairless, could you just talked -- you mentioned briefly in your prepared remarks about the impact of gas basis. Could you just talk a little bit about sort of how the year played out, how that impacted the asset?","Tom Farrell","Sure. Happy to do that. And let me make sure I reference the right level for the previous question on sales growth. We're quite confident at 1.5%. I think that's for the sales, but just want to make sure I have the right number. In terms of gas basis, it has been an extraordinary merry-go-round here -- around PJM and also in the Northeast. ","And gas units, the dispatching of those units have gone for huge numbers in some days and other days, they don't even clear the market because gas has played so much. So the basis particularly in around Fairless has been huge. We're beneficiary on most days of that. We would like that long term, but I think what it really shows, Steven, is that the infrastructure or lack of infrastructure in lot of these regions is pretty extreme and is having a pretty unusual dispatched impact on lot of the efficient gas units around the system.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Okay, interesting. So that volatility like you said ton days [ph] has just resulted in no running at all. And on that I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I wasn\u2019t \u2013 sorry for my slowness on this, was this volatility a negative for the plant versus expectations, sorry?","Mark McGettrick","No, we think it\u2019ll be a net positive. The dynamics surround it day-to-day are hard to predict with these spiking gas prices.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy your day."],"6984":["Dominion Resources, Inc. (NYSE:D) Q4 2016 Earnings Call February  1, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Thomas E.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. Instructions would be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning for the Safe Harbor Statement.","Thomas E. Hamlin - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to the 2016 year-end earnings conference call for Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our websites, register for email alerts and view our year-end earnings documents. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also, on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for 2016 and Dominion's earnings guidance. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we have made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, finishing in the middle of our guidance range. EBITDA for each of our business segments was in line with their respective guidance ranges. As a result, operating earnings finished at $3.80 per share for the full year 2016, which was 10.5% above operating earnings for 2015. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments and our financial results for 2016.","GAAP earnings were $0.73 per share for the fourth quarter and $3.44 per share for 2016. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter and the full year were charges associated with coal ash remediation at several of our closed coal generating plants. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.","For the fourth quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $45.8 million, 94% higher than the level produced in the fourth quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 63% to $37.7 million.","On December 1, Dominion Midstream Partners completed the acquisition of Questar Pipeline from Dominion Resources. The acquisition more than doubled Dominion Midstream's ongoing adjusted EBITDA and is expected to cover our planned 22% distribution growth through mid to late 2018.","Finally, on January 25, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2605 per unit payable on February 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our distribution growth plans.","Moving to treasury activities and earnings guidance at Dominion, 2016 marked a peak in our capital growth plan, with over $5 billion in growth CapEx and $4.4 billion acquisition of Questar. During the year, we raised over $10 billion in capital to fund growth, make acquisitions, and repay maturing debt.","Cash flow from operating activities was $4.1 billion for 2016. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities; and taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.4 billion.","For our planned public debt financings in 2017, please see slide 7. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 13 and 24 of the Earnings Release Kit.","As we move into 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County power station and the startup construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the anticipated asset drop into Dominion Midstream Partners in 2018, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically beginning next year, moving from negative to significantly positive.","As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to generate about $7 billion of cash flow as Cove Point is dropped into Dominion Midstream Partners, which we used to reduce debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 26 of the Earnings Release Kit. We have hedged 85% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone and 100% of first quarter production. We also expect to limit our hedging of 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in the Northeast.","Before we move to earnings guidance, let me comment briefly about anticipated federal tax law changes. Our preliminary analysis shows a wide range of potential outcomes depending on what decisions are made around the actual tax rate, interest deductibility, day one expensing and normalization. We have highlighted some of the key issues on slide 8. Remember, different than many of our peers, we have a portfolio of non-regulated and long-term contracted cash flows that will be treated differently than our regulated portfolio. Based on our asset mix and public information to date, we would expect to be somewhat earnings neutral to any final tax package.","Now, to earnings guidance at Dominion. It has been evident for some time that 2017 will be a challenging year for Dominion to achieve its historical earnings growth rate. Now that we have hedged most of Millstone's 2017 expected output, we estimate a $10 to $12 per megawatt hour reduction and realized energy prices versus last year, impacting 2017 earnings by about $0.015 to $0.20 per share. Also, as we have said on previous calls, we expect to generate about $0.30 per share in solar investment tax credits, a year-over-year reduction of almost $0.20 per share.","As a result, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for 2017 is $3.40 per share to $3.90 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.15 per share or about 4% below operating earnings of $3.80 per share for 2016. Operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2017 is $0.90 per share to $1.10 per share.","Moving to 2018, we believe, operating earnings will increase by at least 10% over 2017. Cove Point export should provide between $0.40 per share and $0.45 per share of incremental earnings in 2018. Having one fuel refueling outage at Millstone, should add another $0.10 per share to year-over-year results.","Offsetting these growth drivers will be an expected further reduction in solar investment tax credits of $0.15 per share to $0.20 per share from 2017. We expect about $0.10 per share contributions from solar ITCs in 2018 and beyond, driven by customer needs in Virginia.","While we are not providing a specific guidance range for 2018 today, you can see that these factors alone can support at least a 10% increase in year-over-year operating earnings.","Looking to 2019 and beyond, we believe our growth opportunities continue to be one of the best in the energy industry. Some of the growth drivers to focus on are highlighted on slide 11. All of our business segments are well positioned to support strong growth in 2018 and beyond. In addition to these organic growth drivers, Dominion will benefit for the use of about $7 billion in cash flow generated by asset contributions to our MLP. A portion of this cash flow will significantly reduce parent level debt and allow for share repurchases, as well as support our growth capital needs.","For the growth we have highlighted, we expect 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year. Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the industry.","So, let me summarize my financial review. 2016 operating earnings were $3.80 per share. 2017 operating earnings guidance is $3.40 per share to $3.90 per share. 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%; and we anticipate dividend growth of more than 8% per year, beginning in 2018.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion \u2013 excuse me, in 2016. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time low, OSHA recordable rate of 0.66 last year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our six units was 93% for the year, the highest since 2013 and the second highest since Millstone joined the fleet 16 years ago.","Surry Unit 1 set a fleet record for the shortest refueling outage this fall, surpassing a record set at North Anna in 2015. Our Brunswick County Power Station, which began operating last April, has been honored with a number of industry awards including Best Overall Generation Project of the Year and Excellence in Safety Best Project.","Now, for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station continues on time and on budget. As of year-end 2016, the $1.3 billion project was 19% complete. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. Five solar projects were completed in the fourth quarter. The 80 megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore went into service in October. Three other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts went into service in December, along with the 60 megawatt solar facility in North Carolina.","For the full year 2016, 727 megawatts were added to our solar portfolio. We have a number of solar projects under development in the State of Virginia and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers including data centers, military installations and the state government.","In November, we announced a major expansion of our solar alliance with Amazon Web Services to add 180 megawatts of new solar generating capacity at sites in five Virginia counties, all of which should be in service this year.","In total, we have announced close to 300 megawatts that will go into service by year-end, bringing our operating portfolio to over 1,400 megawatts of solar generating capacity.","We have been working to secure a combined operating license for our third unit at our North Anna Nuclear Power Station since 2009. Last month, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission completed its final safety evaluation report, concluding that there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing a license for construction and operation of the proposed reactor.","Following a mandatory hearing later this year, the commission will vote on whether to authorize the staff to issue a license. Company has made no decision to construct North Anna 3, but with the combined operating license, will preserve its option to do so, should the Virginia State Corporation Commission believe it is in the best interest of our customers.","Company has included new nuclear in its Integrated Resource Plan as one option to meet future customer demand and comply with environmental regulations.","Dominion Virginia Power connected 11 new data centers in 2016, two more than planned and two more than in 2015. We anticipate a similar number of centers to come online this year and each year through the end of the decade. In fact, we have already connected one new data center already this year. In addition, anticipated increase in federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy, which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation.","We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approvals and construction. $784 million worth of these facilities were completed last year, including our new System Operations Center.","We're planning to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year. Our strategic undergrounding program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. In August of 2016, State Corporation Commission approved Phase 1 in the recovery of $139 million capital investment to convert 412 miles of overhead tap lines to underground. We will invest $110 million in capital and covert an additional 244 miles of overhead tap lines during Phase 2.","Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 84% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially done. All major equipment has been set, and steel and pipe installation continues. We completed pressure testing of the air cooled condenser, and commissioning is underway for electrical, compressed air and water treatment. We expect to achieve completion of 95% or more of structural steel by the end of this quarter. The project continues on time and on budget to be in service later this year.","We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. FERC issued its draft of environmental impact statement in December, in line with their permitting schedule. The report is favorable, and importantly concluded that environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and there would be no significant public safety impacts.","ACP has essentially completed its design, executed the construction contract, and completed over 80% of materials procurement. The project's budget has been updated for the construction plan, including the cost to reroute segments impacting U.S. Forest Service lands. And we now anticipate total development cost for the project, excluding financing cost, to $5 billion to $5.5 billion.","ACP expects to maintain the returns on the project through a combination of construction contingencies and negotiated rate adjustments, as allowed by the existing customer agreements. We expect completion of the Atlanta Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.","A record six major pipeline expansion projects were placed into service in 2016, adding 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of capacity for our customers. We have an additional six pipeline growth projects, underway with $700 million of investment to move 900 million cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018.","We are seeing continued appetite for new pipeline expansion projects, driven by new power, industrial and LDC load throughout our system. We believe a more open federal policy for infrastructure investments. We'll increase drilling in the basin and increase demand from industrials and other sectors.","Importantly, we'll also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure, which will in turn accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions. Based on these drivers, we expect to secure a number of new growth projects this year, and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian Basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint, which has direct access to the fast growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.","So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in 2016. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project. And we look forward to completion of these major projects, which will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year.","As Mark stated, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018; and a diverse set of positive drivers will support continued growth in years to come, supporting an earnings per share growth rate of 6% to 8% through 2020 off of our 2017 base year.","Finally, because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future.","With that, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will open the floor for questions. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. How are you?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So perhaps just a first quick question on the tax reform scenario you discussed in what you'd be, I think you said, neutral. Can you discuss some of the moving pieces that you would think about under that specific scenario, just to give us a little bit more detail?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Hi, Julien, this is Mark. And if we say neutral, we've run a number of different cases, some would be positive, some would be slightly negative. And I guess, we've taken the approach today that no one knows what's going to happen with taxes. And so instead of giving some range out in terms of probabilities, we took a neutral stance.","But the key drivers for us, and remember, our mix is different in a lot of truly regulated companies, but the tax rate obviously is a key component on where that lands. Interest deductibility is a very large component for us because of our unregulated fleet, and the amount of current interest that we deduct, normalization, practices and our regulated operations, we operate in many, many states and day-one expensing.","So, taking each one individually, they could have a positive or slightly negative impact, some greater than others, but because they \u2013 some of these may change or be offset, we think at this point, the best decision for us is to stay neutral until we get some additional clarity out of Congress.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Can you give us your latest expectations for proceeds just through the decade from the MLP drops? And breaking that down, if you can, between debt paydown targets, buybacks and any tax implications from the drop? And again, obviously, with some moving pieces there, just kind of what you see today is your expectation?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","I think, today, I would see a breakdown where debt repayment at the parent of between now and 2020 would probably fall in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, and the remainder of the $7 billion would go to either share repurchases, support growth, dividend support, but that's kind of the breakdown that I look at right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Is taxes not a material number within that, as best you espect?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","We have some tax strategies that we are planning to put in place. And remember as you think about this, the basis of Cove Point is going to be very high when it drops in. So, it's not like a traditional legacy pipeline asset. But we have factored taxes into our assumptions going forward and we're comfortable with the cash flows we quoted coming back to the parent.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Well, thank you very much, gentlemen.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning. So, you guys, when you talked about the guidance for 2017 over 2016, very, very clear; the 2018 over 2017 also very clear. But \u2013 and pointing to at least 10% growth, but how do we think about the other puts and takes. Obviously, Virginia Electric Power you laid out still a reasonably robust capital spending and rate base growth forecast. So, is there any reason I should be concerned or believe that the quantum of net income from VEPCO in 2018 over 2017 wouldn't be higher as well?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","No. No reason to be concerned about that.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then are there are any other \u2013 other than thinking about whether or not there is a drop in 2017 and recycling of cash flow, are there any other like major drivers for thinking about, so where we are in that 10% plus range?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","No. I think the drivers Greg, is more \u2013 the drivers are pretty straightforward 2017, 2018, Cove obviously is there, one fewer Millstone outage. We try to adjust these growth rates and guidance range to current commodity decks out there on power and also on gas. So I think the growth drivers should be pretty clear.","The other thing I'd emphasize, again, and we talked about it earlier. We've actually talked about for about year now. We are purposely stepping down our ITC reliance, so that we get to a very low normal run rate. We've used ITCs for a number of years here to help support earnings during a large capital spend program. And we are not going to be in that business any big way in 2018 and beyond.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And you also did not contemplate any change in regulatory scheme in Connecticut or Massachusetts, as it pertains to clean energy credits for Millstone, correct?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","The only thing we've factored into our growth rate and for 2018 is a very modest increase in power prices in the Northeast just because we think they're extraordinarily low right now. It was not a reflection of any legislative effort that would be out there, but just a \u2013 on a normal slow recovery in the Northeast on power.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And you guys raised \u2013 last raised the dividend in December. So when you say that you're \u2013 when you articulated the dividend growth target today, should I presume that the normal cadence of going to the board with a \u2013 to have a conversation on the dividend will be again next December?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Yes. We have \u2013 the board is fully aware of these statements we have been making since the fall that we expect to \u2013 starting in 2018, to have a dividend growth rate higher than 8%. So we would \u2013 our normal policy would be go back later in the year to talk to them about next year's dividend policy, but they are very aware and supportive of dividend growth rate higher than 8% starting next year.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks, gents.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, just a follow-up on Greg's questions. Can you elaborate a little more on why \u2013 why there is a 6% to 8% growth rate for the next two years instead of the old 7% to 9%, like why \u2013 you are already starting at a lower base. I'm just wondering what \u2013 what's the driver in 2019 and 2020 that forces you to reduce that by 1%? Is it the ACP delay or is it something else?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Michael, this is Mark. No, it's not really the ACP delay, although obviously ACP versus previous estimates were being lower 2019 as the build out occurs and be stronger or I guess equivalent, I should say, in 2020.","But there's a couple of things to think about there. And when I referenced to Greg earlier, that we kind of reset the commodity deck here, that is a reference to really two parts of our business, obviously the power vis-\u00e0-vis which everybody \u2013 there is real clarity on that. But the second is gas and oil prices that might impact our business, in particular at Blue Racer.","Blue Racer's contribution versus previous estimates are going to be down significantly based on current oil and gas outlook; that can change, it could go up, but we wanted to normalize that in this growth rate. Also the contributions at Hastings, our small processing plant that is housed within DTI, their contributions are also down from previous expectations based on the same liquids pricing events that are out there.","So, again to set up, taking a very bullish recovery in commodities, we pretty much looked at the strip, and if your outlook is that \u2013 that is conservative based on the recovery of economy, and E&P and others, that could well happen. But those are the two biggest drivers in the 2019 and 2020 timeframe than what we would have talked about previously.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got you. So you're being conservative and considering there \u2013 I mean, when I look at the frac spreads going forward in Marcellus, that \u2013 I mean, there has been improvement over the last six months, and I'm just wondering if you're seeing any more interest from your \u2013 from your customers?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","There has been improvements, certainly in the basin two between South Point and Henry, but we've seen a little bit of an incremental activity in Blue Racer. But it's going to be a slow recovery there, I think, to a more normal rate than we thought two years or so ago in the Southern Utica.","So we put out a growth \u2013 anticipated growth a couple of years ago for Blue Racer. I'd reference you to those numbers, but it's going to be significantly less than that based on what we're seeing currently over the next two or three years.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got you. And in terms of Connecticut legislation, and is there a possibility for Massachusetts legislation to support nuclear as well, is that something you're hearing?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","There is a \u2013 good morning. What we've heard is more through the regulatory process in Massachusetts, but yes.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, what \u2013 how \u2013 what form will that take?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Similar, as we understand it, I mean, all of this is in development, but it's similar \u2013 it would be a similar approach to what Connecticut is considering, which unlike some of the other states is not a \u2013 some people are describing the other states and subsidies, I'll leave that to others to discuss, but Connecticut is clearly not, it's up to the \u2013 it is a opportunity for us to fit into their clean energy program, and compete with other clean energy sources.","Connecticut \u2013 Millstone Power Station provides over half of Connecticut's power and it has \u2013 you can obviously see for the 20% lower prices we're getting for this year than we got last year, it's been under some pressure. And \u2013 but we're hopeful that things will improve there.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. A couple quickly. The \u2013 just on the 10%-plus for 2018. I mean you guys give pretty wide ranges when you do the years. So, is the 10% like the low-end of that wide range or is that being too specific?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","No I \u2013 the way I look at it, Steve is if you look typically, what those folks have done. The way, we look at it, if you look at the midpoint of our range. We see it of \u2013 2017 I should say, we would see at least 10% growth of the midpoint of 2017.","And you are right, we do give fairly wide ranges and that is mainly because we have been so weather sensitive the last five years that it can move in off a lot based on weather in Virginia and Ohio for us, but \u2013 but that's how I would do the math, midpoint-to-midpoint.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That makes sense. One clarification on something you've already said so, you talked about kind of updating to kind of roughly the current forwards but then also on the power side, and then also talked about, though, expecting, anticipating some recovery in the numbers. So I guess, I wasn't exactly clear, which is the answer to that?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Let me see, if I can help you a little bit on that. We look at the strip and we have a very small amount of growth annually off the current strip that's out there in the Northeast. So it's not material to our estimates, it's a few percent a year, the lift in power price. Again, we don't know if it would be more than that or less than that. But we've gone through this for two years now and power prices have not recovered to a level that were in expectations, and we were able to cover those other ways. What we've tried to do here is to say, we've taken a market look of what's out there and we've just taken a very conservative upside to that.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then last question is, Tom, mentioned more opportunities for growth off of the pipeline network both the East and the West. When we think about your 6% to 8% growth rate, is that something that would be kind of included there toward the end of the period or is that beyond the period when those new projects would hit? How should we think about that?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Steve, some of them, I think actually has been \u2013 a lot of interests starting really this \u2013 at the end of last year and this year throughout. We really think of it as three different areas. The West and our traditional Mid-Atlantic. I mean, Mid \u2013 Appalachian Basin area. And now it is more Southeastern situation with what we have in North \u2013 in South Carolina for example.","They will start layering in \u2013 for new projects we'll start layering in 1919, 1920 and 1921. So they're going to be spaced out. There will be some in 1918. There will be some in 1919, 1920 and 1921. It depends on what \u2013 how quickly we sign them up. Some will be longer, and more capital and some will be shorter and less capital. So I would \u2013 they will come out \u2013 they will \u2013 as you would traditionally see, we announced them as we sign them. And we will have projects that will come in in 2018, we already talked about those today, we have more in 2019, more in 2020, more in 2021, more in 2022. And by expanding our gas infrastructure footprint, we have expanded the opportunities.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Just a follow up question to Steve's question. So, again did you incorporate those pipeline growth projects, or any midstream growth projects in that 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2020?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","A modest amount.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. On Connecticut or New England, in general, I mean, can you give us any sense roughly what would be the benefit to earnings from this legislation, are we talking, I don't know, $0.05, are we talking $0.20, I mean, just a rough estimate?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Angie, this is Mark. We have no estimate to give you, the legislation is not even out of committee. And the exact structure is still evolving, I think, so we don't have any estimate or even a probability at this point whether there'll be success in Connecticut. We would hope there would be, but we don't have a number today at all.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And my last question, so you said, out of the $7 billion of cash that's going to be coming from Cove Point. $3 billion to $4 billion will be used for debt paydown, and then the rest split between buybacks, dividends and then growth. Can you give us a little bit more of a sense, I mean, you are giving us EPS growth target. So, just roughly what is the number embedded for buybacks, so that we actually can get a share count, and is there a way for instance you could shift some of the money to make, I don't know, accretive acquisitions that could boost that growth trajectory?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","We haven't specifically allocated in 2018, 2019 or 2020, which is when we think Cove Point will be dropped over the three-year period. The exact amount that would go between supporting organic growth, share repurchase and dividends. But, on the dividend side, the math is fairly straightforward. There will be a modest amount, but it'll be the amount that allows us to grow our dividend at a level that doesn't burden our regulated entities beyond the 65% to 70% payout ratio. So, that's a few hundred million dollars.","Beyond that, we'll have to see what the opportunities are, Angie, before I can tell you specifically how much the share repurchase versus organic. But, again, it will be a split between that, and as we get closer to the period, we'll go ahead and give clarity.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, guys. I have a few questions on Dominion Midstream related to the drop of Cove Point. So, the dropdown value that you guys talked about $7 billion, is that already been negotiated with the Conflicts Committee?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","It has not.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, what is the \u2013 I mean how are you going to drop this thing, are we going to stagger it over a few years or will it happen all at once?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Right now, we're anticipating staggering in over a few years. And, a lot of that will depend I think on a couple of things. One is there a need for cash at the parent in a particular period that might change that. Second, how are the other assets in DM performing, which we expect to perform quite well, could move that around a little bit. But what I would do for your modeling purposes is I would take the exact amount of EBITDA necessary to grow 22% in 2018, 2019, 2020 off the existing EBITDA stream that's currently there, and back into how the split will occur. And I think what you'll find is that we don't need but a very small drop in 2018 and probably an equal level between 2019 and 2020. So that's how we're thinking about it now, but that could change based on opportunity out there.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just the value of the drop $7 billion versus sort of, let's say, the book value after this is all said and done will be $4 billion. So I mean, is it fair to say that you'll take back a lot of units when you do this drop; simply because you want to mitigate the tax impact of that sort of gain on the book value of the asset?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","We will certainly take back some units as part of the drop. A lot of that will be determined by tax planning and market access but based on our last drop or I should say or \u2013 I guess our first drop of Questar Pipeline, we can access the market at a very high level and it looks like a very favorable rate. So we would expect only the minimum amount to anticipate any tax issues that may occur out there in terms of units back.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And what happens with the preferred equity at \u2013 in the Dominion Midstream from \u2013 in Cove Point, because that was related to the liquefaction asset. So, obviously you can't have two forms of equity in the partnership, would that just get sort of wiped out or sort of exchange for common equity in Cove Point?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Okay. I think realistically, once all Cove Point is dropped in, it's \u2013 there is no preferred value to it at all. So probably, it becomes common, but we haven't really talked about that. Until it's all dropped in, a differentiation is probably important, but and after it's all in, I'm not sure there is a need for that.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then did you guys discuss that commissioning is under way, so are you going to produce any commissioning cargos this quarter, in the first quarter?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","No.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. When would you \u2013 when would you envision producing the commissioning cargos, and assuming you sell those in the market, would that be used as a debit against your PP&E?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","No. Just to backup, we're \u2013 we expect the units to come online, be ready for commercial operations late this year. The capacity and outlook is all entirely \u2013 is owned by the shippers. We have capacity contracts, take-or-pay contracts on those. So once its operational, we will be receiving our payments for capacity, and that will be up to the shippers to \u2013 to take the cargos.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sure. No, I understand that. But I thought that in the commissioning stage, you'll produce cargos to test the facility, was my understanding. And then those commissioning cargos sort of belong to you...","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","That's...","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's my understanding.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","That will be later \u2013 late in the year.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. The last question....","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JP Morgan.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just want to follow-up on Atlantic Coast Pipeline a bit more. And if you could just comment on how the progress there and any thoughts as far as, where the FERC stands right now, or the new administration, any updated thoughts on the regulatory environment would be helpful?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","We're doing quite well with Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The draft environmental impact statement came out as scheduled under the scheduling order. It's quite positive, as I mentioned earlier. And it's obviously there for anybody to see. It had about 85 potential conditions in it, number like that, which I think is fewer than we had at Cove Point actually, for a much longer pipeline.","So, we were \u2013 FERC had done a very thorough analysis, but we had done a lot of \u2013 we had done a lot of very thorough work before filing everything, that any major reroutes were already all scoped out before the draft environmental impact statement came out. Comment period is underway. Public hearings will be heard starting at the end of this month. It will all be wrapped up in early March.","So we don't see any hurdles to getting our final EIS out in June as it's scheduled. There's an issue, I know, people may have with the going down the two FERC commissioners here over the next I guess about a week or a few days. We don't \u2013 need to have a full complement or a quorum at FERC until summer time to be on our schedule.","So I'm highly confident that the president will appoint folks by then, they will confirmed by the Senate and seated. So, we think, it's going extremely well, we've signed our construction contract. It's all taken into account all the changes that were necessary as a part of the rerouting through the mountains and the forests, the National Forest. So all in all, ACP is going extremely well.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's \u2013 that's all from me. That's helpful. Thank you.","Thomas F.

And then, on the nuke life extension, it sounded like there might be a considerable rate base opportunity there, from a \u2013 and also from a risk reward or from a risk perspective, a lower risk than new build. I'm just wondering, the bill seems to be moving to a legislature associated with that. And I'm just wondering when, assuming that that go, what's your outlook for that is and when it quantitatively might start showing up in rate base","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","I'll answer that part of that question and I will turn it over to Paul Koonce. So your reference is to, I think is the \u2013 there's a legislation progressing through the Virginia General Assembly that makes it clear that life extensions of our Surry and North Anna Power Stations, these additional life extensions \u2013 license extensions would be subject to rider treatment. It's progressing particularly through the General Assembly. General Assembly adjourns for the year at the end of this month. And all it's doing is ensuring rider treatment for all those capital expenditures.","With respect to new build, I think we said pretty consistently last few years, North Anna 3 is there as a possibility, an auction for us for Dominion, when and if, it becomes appropriate and is in the best interest of our customers to do so. I think it's quite clear that risk is less in doing life extensions than building new nuclear reactors as we've seen. But, I'll turn over the timing to Paul Koonce.","Paul D. Koonce - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning, Paul. Yeah, we \u2013 North Anna and Surry have operated terrifically over its life and we see the opportunity to spend probably in the order of $3 billion to $3.5 billion in just equipment upgrade. Right now, when we take an outage we perform a lot of maintenance. If we get the second license extension support then we might start replacing, not performing maintenance. So I think what you'll see is that beginning to take place in the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 timeframe and even out into the decade.","One of the things we'll have to look at is our traditional refueling outages, do we change the number of days to get more work done. So we're really looking at all of that now, but you should start to see that, provided the legislation, you should start to see that in our earnings in the 2019, 2020, 2021 timeframe.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally on the coal ash, are we pretty much finished with the impact of that given the last quarter, and is there any potential for recovery of these coal ash expenses?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Hey, Paul, I'm going to let Paul Koonce answer that one as well.","Paul D. Koonce - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Paul, you noticed we took $122 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter to revise our estimates, and really those estimate revisions were due to just additional water treatment at Bremo and Possum Point. Recall we have four sites that we are in the process of remediating Possum Point, Bremo, Chesterfield and Chesapeake. We are in the process of getting the solid waste permits, which will govern the final closure plan and the 30-year water monitoring requirements.","So I would expect, over time, as we get those solid waste permits, we buy \u2013 need to make revisions. But again, in a relative basis, our coal ash mitigation is pretty small relative to others.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, but we don't expect any recovery of these expenses?","Paul D. Koonce - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Well, we do have a rider recovery for active coal plants, and Chesterfield Power Station is an active coal plant, so we do expect the coal ash mitigation associated with Chesterfield will be recoverable.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning's conference call. You may disconnect your lines, and enjoy your day."],"7157":["Dominion Energy, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Steven Ridge, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Steven Ridge","Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter 2019 earnings conference call for Dominion Energy. I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website to view the earnings press release, a slide presentation that will follow this morning's prepared remarks and additional quarterly disclosures. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting, and the Investor Relations team will be available immediately after the call to answer additional questions. ","The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit. Joining today's call are Tom Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Chapman, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and other members of the Executive management team. I will now turn the call over to Jim.","James Chapman","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported second quarter 2019 operating earnings of $0.77 per share compared to our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. Performance across our businesses was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.02 per share. Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share, which is also the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating segment performance for the second quarter is shown on Slide 4. ","GAAP earnings for the quarter are $0.05 per share, which were driven primarily by charges related to the SCANA integration and the voluntary retirement program, which I will discuss in a moment. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit. I will now provide updates on several ongoing initiatives.","Turning to Slide 5. As announced at our Investor Day in March, we continue to work towards completing the restructuring of our reporting segments. During our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full year results as well as our 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more transparent to all stakeholders and will highlight the premium nature of each of our distinct businesses.","Similar to last quarter, the Alternate Breakdown Structure or ABS will be posted to our Investor Relations website shortly after this call. This document provides a preliminary view of our future intended reporting segment results. The ABS, which is not reflective of how we currently manage our businesses, is not intended to replace Dominion Energy's current operating segment disclosures.","Turning to Slide 6. We have concluded the previously announced voluntary retirement program or VRP. Though some retirements will become effective only in the coming months, most of our colleagues who elected to participate have already begun to enjoy their retirement. Roughly 12% of our total workforce elected to participate, which compares to an average annual retirement rate over the last 5 years of just over 3%. We, of course, wish them all the best in retirement and also thank them for their many years of dedicated service.","We expect this VRP to be impactful to our company and our workforce in a number of ways, in particular as we embark on industry-leading innovation initiatives highlighted by Tom and other members of our senior management team at our Investor Day in March. ","As it relates to thinking about the potential financial impact of the program, I would ask that you note the following: first, while the VRP's financial impacts are incremental to our previously announced Flat O&M initiative, I reiterate my comments from the first quarter call that these savings should not be considered passive to existing earnings guidance. Rather the savings from the VRP are available to overcome potential unexpected challenges and derisk the execution of our earnings growth plan. We view this approach as supportive of our objective to consistently and predictively deliver results in line with our guidance, which we expect would be a driver of premium equity valuation.","Second, the bottom line impact of this program will be influenced by near-term backfilling of up to 1\/3 of the vacated positions given operational and safety requirement. Further, O&M savings in our regulated businesses accrue to our customers immediately, in the case of rider programs and over longer time frames via rate proceedings. Finally, VRP savings in our Southeast Energy Group are supportive of the expected transaction accretion of approximately $0.10 per share in each of the first two years following merger closing.","Turning to financing. In June, we successfully placed approximately $1.6 billion in equity-linked units, consistent with our financing plan guidance. Due to a high-quality order book that was many times oversubscribed, we were able to achieve record pricing in terms of spread to common yield for security of this type. As a reminder, this transaction does not result in any near-term common stock issuance, and the financial impacts of this issuance were already contemplated in our existing earnings guidance. ","As discussed during our Investor Day, over the next several years, on average, we continue to expect nonmarketed equity issuance via DRIP of about $300 million per year and via our aftermarket program of some $300 million to $500 million per year to help prudently fund our sizable regulated capital investment program.","Moving now to operating earnings guidance on Slide 7. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather, variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. For the third quarter, we are initiating guidance of $1 to $1.20 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, the contribution from the Southeast Energy Group and the impact of O&M initiatives. Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sales, share issuances, timing of a farm-out and return to normal weather.","As you evaluate the cadence of our quarterly earnings as compared to last year, particularly as it relates to the second half of the year, please keep in mind the following factors, some of which have been quantified on the right-hand side of Slide 7: the timing of the Millstone refueling outage, which occurred in spring this year as compared to the fall last year; the favorable net impact of PJM capacity prices, including our new Greensville power station's participation in the capacity market for the first time since it's in service late last year; the contribution of the Southeast Energy Group; earnings growth from continued regulated investment across electric and gas businesses; higher realized prices at our Millstone Power Station driven primarily by an expected October 1 effective date for the 10-year, 9 million megawatt-hour, zero-carbon contract with Connecticut utilities; and finally, the continuation of our Flat O&M and other expense control initiatives.","We expect that savings from the VRP, net of the mitigants just discussed will be between $0.05 and $0.06 per share during the second half of this year. These savings are available to address unplanned challenges that may arise, for example, items like the $0.04 of negative weather experienced so far this year. We are also affirming our expectations for full year 2019 operating earnings per share between $4.05 and $4.40. Similarly, we also reiterate our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% per year through next year and 5%-plus thereafter.","I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. First, a reminder that safety is our first core value. It is at the heart of our corporate culture, and we will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistic, 0 injuries. Though 6 months remain, year-to-date safety results are consistent with the record-setting results we have achieved in the last few years. ","Of particular note, the Southeast Energy Group overall safety performance has improved from what was already solid results, overcoming a loss of a colleague in the tragic event in Durham on April 10 from a third-party contractor and avoiding distractions from merger activities. I want to commend the women and men of the Southeast Energy Group who have responded so positively, providing safe, reliable and efficient delivery of energy to customers who are experiencing lower bills and seeing increased community giving, just as we committed prior to completion of the merger.","Turning to Slide 9. Earlier this month, CNBC released their 2019 update to America's Top States for Business. We were pleased, though not surprised, to see 4 of our 5 primary state-regulated jurisdictions ranked in the top 10 of the list, including Virginia, which was recognized as the nation's #1 state for business. You might recall from our Investor Day that 65% to 70% of our company's expected 2020 operating earnings are from state-regulated operations centered around these 5 key states, including 40% to 45% attributable to our Virginia-phased utility. This is just one more validation of the theme we have highlighted regarding the differentiated nature of our high-quality regulated operations.","Another topic we regularly highlight to all Dominion Energy stakeholders is our ongoing ESG efforts. We're continuously enhancing our strategy in this area and increasing our communications regarding the progress we have made and will continue to make. For example, to our knowledge, we were the first utility company, and we believe the only U.S. company in any sector, to hold a dedicated ESG-focused Investor Day meeting. We created a new Board-level Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee that oversees our approach to these matters. We have updated our emissions reduction goals to be more aggressive. We have improved our disclosures across-the-board, including inclusion of comparable ESG metrics. They are included in the appendix of these earnings call materials.","We have directly engaged with our largest institutional investors outside of proxy season in discussions about Dominion's industry-leading positions on these issues. And we are only 1 of 3 utility companies that have implemented an environmental justice policy, which ensures that all stakeholders including local communities have a voice in decisions on infrastructure investments. We believe that as investors become increasingly discerning around ESG criteria, Dominion's industry-leading efforts will be rewarded with a differentiated positive investment outlook.","I will turn now to recent updates related to our major investment initiatives. Earlier this month, we began construction of our $300 million offshore wind pilot project. The project was approved by Virginia regulators in November of last year and is a critical initial step in what has the potential to become a multiyear, multibillion dollar capital deployment in zero-carbon offshore wind energy. Recall that our Virginia offshore lease should accommodate over 2 gigawatts of generation capacity based on expected technology advancements, which is significantly more than what we have accounted for over our 5-year planning horizon. We continue to make progress on the $2 billion to $3 billion new pump storage facility. It would be an excellent complement to the intermittency of the increased wind and solar resources across our system.","During the second quarter, we narrowed the search for a potential location, and we'll spend the remainder of this year and part of next conducting more extensive surveys. The Virginia General Assembly has found the construction of such a facility to be in the public interest.","Next, relicensing of our existing regulated nuclear units in Virginia is an up to $4 billion capital program that supports safe, reliable and affordable energy for customers and is an important source of zero-carbon electricity production. During the second quarter, our nuclear station in Surry County generated its 500 billionth kilowatt-hour of zero-carbon electricity. Put that into context, 500 billion kilowatt-hours would power the entire state of Virginia for 5.5 years in a carbon-free manner.","Later this week, we will file our first battery pilot program. We will pair batteries with solar facilities to begin the integration of peak shifting and clipping as well as test of reliability benefits of batteries on our distribution grid.","On Slide 12, we have charted positive trends across 2 significant growth drivers for our power delivery business. On the left side, you can see the growth in electric transmission rate base, which will continue as we execute on the 5-year, $4.3 billion capital plan we shared at our Investor Day in March. These transmission investments improve system reliability to the benefit of our customers. On the right side, you see the impressive growth in data center capacity, which we also expect to continue for years to come. Our capital planning calls for $1.7 billion of investment associated with customer growth, including data centers over the next 5 years.","And finally, with regard to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header. Our customers continue to meet this project's capacity to serve their existing customers, move toward a low-carbon future and enable new economic development. It is noteworthy that natural gas prices in the region that will be served by the project remain among the highest in the country. We are pleased that the Solicitor General filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Fourth Circuit Cowpasture decision as it relates to ACP's crossing underneath the Appalachian Trail. To date, 16 states, the AGA, INGA, the Chamber of Commerce, several unions, the National Association of Manufacturers, Mountain Valley Pipeline have all filed amicus briefs. ","History indicates cases appealed by the Solicitor General have an approximately 70% chance of being considered. We expect that in October or November, the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur in the spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We are confident that the Fourth Circuit's ruling will be overturned. And though at present, we are not publicly discussing potential administrative or legislative alternatives, the options that have been described by the developers of the Mountain Valley Pipeline should be expected to be applicable to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.","We are disappointed that last week, the Fourth Circuit vacated the project's biological opinion. Over recent months, we have been taking steps to bolster the official record of the case in the event the court ruled negatively. These steps include the additional surveying of the rusty patched bumble bee along the Project corridor, which has been underway since mid-June. There's nothing in the court's opinion on the poor species that we expect would prevent the biological opinion from being reissued in time to recommence construction by year-end and complete critical path tree filling during the November through March window.","We have included in the appendix a list of select outstanding regulatory reauthorizations, including resolution timing expectations. Based on the assumptions, our current project cost and in-service timing expectations remain consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year on our fourth quarter earnings call.","Before I complete my remarks, I would like to add my personal thanks and well wishes to our colleagues who have opted to retire on an accelerated timeline. Your legacy of living our core values will leave a lasting impression at Dominion Energy and you will be missed.","With that, I will summarize today's release as follows: we are on track to achieve full year safety results that are consistent with the record-setting performances of recent years. We are actively engaged throughout the company on initiatives that are focused on creating shareholder, customer and other stakeholder value by making Dominion Energy more efficient, sustainable and transparent. We achieved operating earnings per share above, or on a weather-normalized basis, at the midpoint of our guidance range. We are affirming our full year operating earnings per share guidance and our long-term growth rates. Our key regulated jurisdictions stand apart as premium locations in which to do business. We are making progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. And we have a strong environmental, social and governance track record and strategy, and we will continue to increase our engagement with customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on those topics.","We will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Gregory Gordon","So two questions, one numbers related question. Looking at the adjustments from GAAP to operating. On an operating basis, you obviously had a really great quarter, congrats on that. But pretty significant charges associated with merger integrated -- merger and integration costs, the retirements, et cetera. Are those numbers consistent with your expectations for the year on the delta between GAAP and operating? And are there any significant incremental charges we should expect as adjustments for the balance of the year and going into 2020?","James Chapman","Yes, Greg. It's Jim, good morning, thanks. The future nonoperating charges are, of course, difficult to predict so we don' know exactly what those will be, it\u2019s the nature of the beast. I would expect some continued charges related to our integration of SEG the former SCANA business mostly in terms of accounting systems and implementations and things along those lines. The major charges related to customer benefit, and VRP and related restructuring have been kind of tackled in the first half of this year. So some numbers would continue but they will be, we expect, more modest than what we've seen so far.","Gregory Gordon","My second question goes to your confidence in your ability to get the Fish and Wildlife Service to effectively mediate the concerns associated with this second certification of their permits from the Fourth Circuit. In reading that document, I've had varying opinions -- heard varying opinions on how high the hurdle is that the Fish and Wildlife Service needs to get over in order to issue a valid permit given some of the pretty strong language in that. While it was a detailed brief -- they gave very good detail as to why they felt that the decision was arbitrary and capricious. Some people's opinion that the standard that they've put the Fish and Wildlife Service to and the details of what they have problems with might be very difficult to meet. So could you just comment on why you think, based on your reading and your experts reading, that you can meet those hurdles with just more information on the three other species and adequately doing the survey on the bees. Sorry for such a long-winded question.","Thomas Farrell","Well, all right. Go ahead, Diane.","Diane Leopold","Okay. This is Diane Leopold. Really what I would say as we look at the 4 species is there was an enormous amount of information and analysis that went into the process to begin with while we were in formal consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service. And based on the amount of information that they have and the surveys that we have completed, we believe based on -- there's nothing surprising that's coming out of it that would make us think that they cannot resolve it with the enormous amount of analysis and information that they have.","Thomas Farrell","I will just add one thing. The surveys -- the one issue they had is they didn't think enough surveys were done around the bees, and we've been doing those surveys since mid-June. They'll be done this quarter and there will be more than sufficient facts, we believe, to just by issuing the BL.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Could you guys maybe just give a little color on how you'd characterize your natural gas midstream system in light of some of the concerns on Appalachia gas? I know it's mainly regulated and with long-term contracts. But just obviously, you saw Blue Racer very timely. Just maybe give some color and context of that.","Diane Leopold","Diane Leopold again. What I would do is say that part of the reason that we divested Blue Racer is that really wasn't core to us. When we look at our gas infrastructure, our high focus in both our existing customers and our growth project has been in end-use markets, and end-use markets actually benefit from the low gas prices that you see. So while we understand the Appalachian gas prices are quite low, what that's done is it's driven a higher industrial growth in that region and more end use and PowerGen customers. So as Tom talked about in the Analyst Day back in March, a lot of our focus is towards the end use rather than the producers.","Steven Fleishman","Okay, great. And then I guess, the other question would be just on the savings for the voluntary retirement and the benefits of that. So when you look at unexpected pressures, the only one that I could think of right now would be ACP-related. I guess since they're unexpected, there's not any other that you see right now that could be out there in terms of dealing with using these benefits or needing the benefits.","James Chapman","Well, that's right, Steve. I mean, unexpected is unexpected so hard to comment. I mean we think about -- let's put it in context. So we mentioned -- I mentioned, and we have on the slide there that the net impact, none of the mitigants I described, for this year in the $0.05 to $0.06 range for the second half of the year. So you could easily annualize that for a year in the coming years. Of course, over time, that's given back to our customers through to rates [indiscernible]. For 2020, fair enough, think about double that amount, so it\u2019s $0.10 to $0.12. So let's just put that in context. So $0.04 of weather hurt this year 6 months, we don't know what that will be the rest of the year. Or, of course, in 2020 that kind of thing stands ready to offset. ","When it comes to ACP, as a reminder, our guidance on the contribution from ACP in 2018 last year was $0.07. This year, it's $0.11. Next year, we have a little more visibility but not on a granular basis yet regarding the exact timing of recommencement and the sculpting of capital spend through 2020. So what the contribution in 2020 is, we don't yet know exactly but call it mid-teens to high teens, at best, contribution. So the $0.10 to $0.12 stands available to offset various unforeseen challenges, but that kind of puts it in context versus ACP, which you're asking about, smaller.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then one just clarification on that. The $0.10, $0.12, is that after any future kind of pass-through to customers through clauses and such? Is that -- that's just the net number that would not pass through?","James Chapman","Yes, that's right. I mean, over a number of years, that will go back to customers as mentioned. But for the near-term number, $0.05 to $0.06 is net of the amount that is immediately passed to customers through rider tax treatment. And that holds true for 2020 as well. After that, it tends to blend back to customers over time but for 2020, it is net of that factor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza","Real quick, Tom. You commented, Tom, a little bit on sort of briefly touched on the administrative path and potentially looking at like a land swap similar to what we've seen with MVP. Are there other sort of administrative solutions that you could be looking at outside of just the land swap?","Thomas Farrell","Yes, there are a number. And as we said before, we really don't want to get into a lengthy discussion about what all those options are. There has been some discussions from the developers of the MVP pipeline that as I've said a few minutes ago, we would expect all of those solutions to be available to us as well.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just from a timing perspective of when you're ready to discuss publicly the administrative or legislative path, is that sort of at a point when SCOTUS affirms whether they would hear this case or not?","Thomas Farrell","We're completely focused on that right now. This is -- the Fourth Circuit decision is a very poor precedent, we think, for energy policy in the United States, setting up a 2,000-mile-long barrier wall to bring energy resources from the Midwest and South, the western parts of the country into the East. Don't think that's what compressible intent was. So it's very important that the precedent not stand.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it, okay. And then just -- I don't know if you can comment on this but there's obviously been some headlines around the retail business and potentially looking at a transaction down there. Is there anything you can elaborate on that, how the process is going?","James Chapman","Yes. Sure. let me give some color on that point. And obviously, for the norm, we don't really comment on material M&A. But I'm using color on the way we think about this. So we're always considering ways to create shareholder value to derisk our plan, to take our exposure to regulated and regulated-like businesses which now 95%, take it up towards 100%. So last year in 2018, obviously we made a lot of progress in that respect, as you know. ","And this year, that continued but on a totally different scale. We're really focusing on that last 5%, for the most part, of things that are not core or not regulated or regulated-like. For example, we divested a 15-megawatt fuel cell asset we had in Connecticut in Bridgeport for $35 million this year. We also divested our stake in NedPower, the wind facility in West Virginia. The amount wasn't disclosed but is modest. ","We're also fielding and thinking about what to do with another wind asset we own in Indiana, which is Fowler Ridge, no decisions there yet, early days. So that kind of thing, we're always thinking about it but it's very modest. Now I say that to put in context for retail, which is your question. So there are press reports about potential sales of our retail gas and -- there also, we've been fielding inbound inquiries on all of it, on the part that is in Georgia that was formerly SCANA business, on the legacy Dominion business. And we're thinking through that. There's certainly no decision. ","But importantly, we're thinking about what to do generally, so it's not so focused on the process. Should we keep it as well? How can we grow it? Could there be ways to grow through JV, for example, or some other structure? So it's more thinking along the lines as opposed to, \"Let's sell this thing,\" because we're probably not going to do that. It's not accretive. So no decisions, lots of thought processes. But no, nothing to share and not sure there will be.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And then as we think about like redeployment of proceeds in case there is a process, is that strictly into delevering and strengthening the balance sheet?","James Chapman","I would call it yes, but I would put that in the kind of the general corporate when we're talking about not huge numbers in the scope of all of Dominion.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Just a couple of follow-up questions. The $0.10 to $0.12 of voluntary savings, the voluntary retirement savings, you said that you expect to eventually see it in a few years as the savings are shared with customers. How much do you think you'll retain though longer term once most of those savings have been shared?","James Chapman","Yes, Michael, we don't really have such a number. I mean it'll -- over the years, we don't have material rate cases with all that much frequency. So it will be chipped away over time, but we don't have a specific number to bifurcate between what's kept it long term and what's not.","Michael Weinstein","But just, I mean, roughly speaking, half, would you think, or below half or more than half maybe?","James Chapman","Half would be fair. We don't really have a number in mind.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And then on -- how much capital has been put into ACP to date at this point? And what is the assumption that is going into that mid-teens EPS number that I think that you mentioned earlier from AFUDC next year?","James Chapman","Yes. As of June 30, the total cash invested capital is $3.4 billion from all parties from all forms. Now half of that is funded, as you know, with the construction facilities at the project level, and you'll see that in our quarterly reports, that's $1.7 billion, so twice that. The other half is just the total and the other half comes pro rata from the equity contributions from the sponsors worth 48% of that. So $3.4 billion is the total. The -- as I mentioned, we don't have available, at this time, granular guidance on the capital spend for the end of this year or the sculpting of it through 2020, but it assumes recommencement of construction by the tree clearing season in the fourth quarter this year.","Michael Weinstein","So when you say mid-teens on the next two years, that's sort of an assumption that you are going to get most of this built up into the Supreme Court decision?","James Chapman","It's mid- to high teens so mid would be with less under construction during 2020 or later in 2020, and higher would be again most of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So perhaps just to follow up on some of the last questions here. Can you talk a little bit more about what else might be considered sort of not necessarily noncore but as you think about kind of fine-tuning the portfolio here within the regulated bees. And more specifically, I'd be curious, given some of the developments here around Millstone that have been achieved, is there any way to derisk some of the volatility ahead as well over time, for instance, within that example?","Thomas Farrell","Well, I'll talk about Millstone. We have derisked Millstone with the legislative and regulatory solution that's in its final weeks right now with a very significant portion of the output being sold to the utilities for a 10-year period. So we'd consider that to be more than sufficient derisking of the Millstone asset. I'll let Jim and others answer the rest of the questions.","James Chapman","I think that's a good answer. And going back to the way I've started my answer to Shar, I mean, we don't comment on material M&A. But the review of real material things, which are noncore, including Blue Racer, as we talked about last year, and our last remaining fossil merchant plant last year, I mean, for big items, that pretty much exhaust the list.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then just coming back to the question around VRP, I know it's been asked a few different ways. But as you look in the back of this year, could you think about like the pluses and minuses here? Clearly, it's a big plus. Any offsets in terms of execution? That it sounds like that's already been largely recognized in the first half to achieve this? And maybe the punchline is how do you think about this trending for the full year '19, given the 3Q guidance you've already issued and what that means for 4Q as well.","James Chapman","Okay. Let me talk about that a little bit. I know it's a little bit funny to talk about that savings as being kind of available for unforeseen headwinds, whether it's the most prevalent. We always talk about the potentially material impact of weather now in Virginia and South Carolina on our earnings guidance ranges and where we end up. So it's hard to point any one thing because we feel pretty good about where we are at this stage, given what's to come in the next 2 quarters. ","And let me address that a little more. So last year, as we sat here on our second quarter call and we looked at kind of what was remaining, what we needed to do after our first two quarters to get to the midpoint of our guidance range, we needed $2.03. So this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the cadence is different. We have a back-end loaded profile to our EPS accrual through the second half of the year. So last year was $2.03. This year, it's $2.36, so bigger company, more earnings, but we also need have a little bit of catch-up, it's back-end loaded. ","The reasons for that and the reasons we are comfortable with that are these things that are generally set out in that right-hand side of Page 7 in our deck. So the Millstone outage, $0.08 to $0.10. Last year was in fourth quarter, and for the most part, this year, done in spring. The net capacity expansion, PJM with Greensville in the next now starting in June, $0.06 to $0.08. The VRP also in the mix, $0.05 to $0.06. Southeast Energy Group didn't have it last year, $0.04 to $0.06. ","And then another basket of things are smaller but regulated investment across our utility business for the next 6 months: the Millstone PPA we mentioned, assuming that comes into place October 1; and then the continued impact of O&M to the next 6 months. So in our minds, we don't really have one thing that the VRP will offset. It's just there and available. So we anticipate Julien that a question, which was what if nothing comes up this year or next year? And there also, we're saying, I've said that it's not additive to our guidance. ","So if nothing comes up and we're in the lucky position of not having any headwinds that aren't expected or such event, what I would do is identify areas in O&M to advance spending in order to use that VRP savings to derisk our guidance, our earnings guidance for a longer period of time. So not a very direct answer to your question but that's the way we think about the VRP savings and what it will potentially help us with over the next period.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right. So maybe said differently, 2019, there's a lots of puts and takes. You feel very comfortable still. I don't want to put words directly in your mouth for '19. And then you've been a story for '20, again, this is going to be more about accelerating forward O&M that you might otherwise need, for instance, in '21 or something.","James Chapman","Yes, if no other headwinds pop up, that's right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Just had one follow-up on Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Assuming that a revised biological opinion and incidental take statement is issued but is stayed by the court yet again, what would the next process steps be at that point? Is there an appeal process or where would you go at that point if the unrevised is yet again stayed?","Thomas Farrell","Well, you can do a preliminary -- you can appeal a stay. You can -- need to tell, it will depend on what the stay was for if one was entered at all. Would it be the entire 600 miles or would it be a segment? Also it's kind of difficult to answer that question. There are a variety of remedies we can pursue but without a real detailed issue, it's hard to answer that question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","Moving a little bit away from ACP, wanted to touch on offshore wind. I know you talked about it and emphasized on the call the opportunity on offshore wind. Firstly, wanted to understand the economics that you're seeing and the benefits you're seeing on the technology side. And given the investment that you've talked about as a potential opportunity, is that going to put pressure on bills and would that constrain the opportunities? So just a little bit color on that will be helpful.","Paul Koonce","This is Paul Koonce. Of course, we're under construction on the two offshore wind turbines now, doing the onshore construction next summer will complete the two test turbines. In terms of the offshore wind economics, we've been watching very closely what's been happening throughout New England. I would say that the life cycle cost equivalent, LCOE, in those markets have been, call it, $85 and potentially higher. There's some speculation what may happen with production tax credits for offshore wind. Might they be renewed or not? We don't know. ","In Virginia, we're looking at the need to get the life cycle cost equivalent down closer to maybe the $80 range, which means we need to see about a 15% to 20% capital cost improvement. We think that those costs can move in that direction once we stand up the U.S. supply chain. That's been a real benefit that they've seen in Europe is being able to scale up the supply chain. ","And we also think that the development of larger turbines, 11 megawatt and greater, will drop those costs down closer to what we think we need in order to really see the build-out in Virginia. So we're watching all of that very closely. We think the time frame that we have in mind, which is '23, '24 and kind of beyond, we think that those cost reductions are achievable. So we're bullish but we're going to do what's right for our customers.","Praful Mehta","Got you. That's super helpful color. Just can you put in context what could be the size of the opportunity from an investment perspective post that 2022, '23 time frame?","Paul Koonce","Well, I think what we said at the March 25, really, we've only given sort of guidance out to 2023, which is $1.1 billion. Now $300 million of that $1.1 billion is the offshore wind pilot that we're doing. That leaves $800 million to go toward the first phase. But I think in round numbers, we've said in excess of 2,000 megawatts. The limiting factor becomes sort of the wake effect that you have with 1 turbine sort of stacked up behind the second. But we clearly see line of sight in excess of 2,000 megawatts. And I would pencil out maybe a $3,000 per kilowatt-hour installed. And if you do that, you come up with a sizable investment but that would be out over the entire decade.","Operator","This concludes our time for Q&A. I'll now turn it back to our speakers for closing comments.","Steven Ridge","Thank you for everyone's time this morning. We know it's a busy earnings day and the Investor Relations team is available, of course, to answer questions throughout the rest of the day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas E. Hamlin - Vice President, Financial Planning and Investor Relations","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today's call will cover this morning's announcement of Dominion's agreement to combine with Questar Corporation, as well as our earnings for 2015 and guidance for 2016. This combined call will replace the earnings call we had originally scheduled for this Thursday.","During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the investor relations page on our website, register for e-mail alerts and view our fourth quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are, dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this afternoon's discussion. And now for the usual cautionary language.","The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the earnings release kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.","Joining us on the call this afternoon are our Chairman and CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO Mark McGettrick, and other members of our management team. Tom will provide an overview of our agreement with Questar and the strategic rationale behind it. Mark will cover the combined company profile and our planned financing of the transaction. After that discussion, we will move on to our earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, plus Dominion's guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016 and progress on our growth plans. We will then take your questions.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. This morning Dominion Resources and Questar Corporation announced a definitive agreement to combine. Dominion will pay Questar's shareholder $25 per common share in cash plus the assumption of $1.6 billion in debt for total enterprise value of $6 billion. As soon the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, the companies expect to close the transaction by the end of this year.","We are very excited about adding Questar to the Dominion portfolio company. This agreement is a combination of premium, integrated asset profiles and is well-aligned with Dominion's existing strategic focus and core energy infrastructure operations. These high-performing regulated assets will provide enhanced scale and diversification into constructive regulatory jurisdictions.","Furthermore, the value to Dominion's investors from the transaction does not require a significant levering of our balance sheet. The permanent financing will feature an equity component from both Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners, and will be supportive of management's commitment to our existing credit ratings targets.","Transaction is consistent with our announced growth strategy, specifically the acquisition and development of reasonably valued regulated MLP qualifying assets with stable, long-term cash profiles. And in addition, in the case of Questar, a fast-growing, regulated gas distribution company in states that have a strong pro-business environment. We think it is an ideal combination for both Dominion shareholders, Dominion Midstream unitholders, and Questar's shareholders and all of our employees.","Questar has a long history of doing business with integrity and honesty, and a strong commitment to its employees and the communities they serve. It is a very well-managed company with strong commitment to safety, ethics and excellence, which are core values shared by the employees of Dominion. As part of the Dominion team, Questar's customers can also count on a continuation of the high quality service they have enjoyed.","Questar's operations feature an excellent business risk profile. Margins at its gas utility have been de-risked through constructive regulation, including revenue decoupling, weather normalization, an infrastructure replacement rider and gas cost pass-through, elements that we also share at Dominion East Ohio. Its pipeline operations feature long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties. Its regulated gas supply business has operated under Commission-approved cost-of-service model for 35 years. Utah is one of the fastest growing states in the country, and is annually ranked among the best states in which to do business. We have already committed approximately $1 billion in solar projects in Utah, which are under long-term contracts to electric utilities.","Questar provides enhanced geographic diversity to Dominion's natural gas operations. This is illustrated with a system map shown on slide eight. While our Dominion transmission system is known as the Hub of the Mid-Atlantic, the Questar system is called the Hub of the Rockies, and a principal source of gas supply to the Western states. We believe the value of the system will increase over time, as illustrated on slide nine. As Utah and the surrounding Western states seek to comply with the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan, as well as meet state-mandated renewable portfolio standards, compliance is highly likely to result in an increased reliance on low-emission gas-fired generation.","The transaction also provides significant benefits to Dominion's investors. It will be immediately accretive to earnings per share with limited impact on our balance sheet. It provides a significant addition to Dominion's inventory of top-quality, low-risk MLP eligible assets. We intend to finance a portion of the acquisition through a contribution of Questar Pipeline to Dominion Midstream Partners, taking advantage of the MLP's lower cost of capital, and diversifying our equity funding sources. DM investors will benefit significantly, as the acquisition will add over $425 million of EBITDA to Dominion's already extensive inventory of high-quality, MLP-eligible regulated assets.","We're very excited about this morning's announcement. I will be back in a few minutes to update you on our growth plans and take your questions but now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, and good afternoon. For those of you not familiar with Questar Corporation, we have summarized their business profile on slide 13. Questar is a regulated Rockies-based integrated natural gas company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Its operations consist of three primary business segments:","Questar Gas is a regulated local distribution company serving about 1 million customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho. Customer growth has averaged 2.5%, which is well above industry averages. Authorized ROEs are 9.5% to 9.85% on a $1.1 billion rate base, with a 52% equity component.","Questar Pipeline is a FERC-regulated transportation and storage system strategically located to deliver gas to the Western region of the country. Its operating assets consist of 2,700 miles of pipeline and 56 billion cubic feet of storage capacity operating under long-term fixed-fee contracts with creditworthy counterparties. Authorized ROEs range from 11.4% to 13% and rate base is about $950 million.","Their Regulated Gas Supply business has been operating under a regulated cost-of-service plus return model for 35 years. Its $600 million rate base is 100% equity capitalized, with a 2015 average realized return of 17%. Both the Pipeline Systems and the Regulated Gas Supply business are MLP eligible.","Slide 14 shows the pro forma business profile of the combined companies Regulated Gas Infrastructure businesses. The acquisition increases our LDC rate base by nearly half and the number of customers by more than 75%. It increases our pipeline rate base by approximately 25%, and our pipeline network by one-third.","The impact on Dominion's EBITDA mix is shown on slide 15. While remaining roughly 90% regulated, the Questar acquisition improves the balance between electric and gas operations. Questar Corporation will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Resources. Upon completion of the acquisition around the first of next year. Questar Pipeline will be contributing to Dominion Midstream Partners probably in two steps.","Slide 16 updates our planned drop schedule for DM from last year's analyst meeting. The first contribution of Questar Pipeline will provide sufficient coverage for Dominion Midstream to meet its 2017 distribution growth targets, which remain at 22% per year. The second drop will improve the remaining investment in Questar Pipeline, which along with a small portion of the Cove Point asset will fulfill our distribution growth for 2018.","Any future drop of regulated gas supply assets will only be done in consultation with State regulators. This will allow Dominion to keep its investment in the Blue Racer joint venture at the parent till 2020 or later, enhancing its value and the future contribution due to its strong organic growth, and reduce the Cove Point EBITDA drop into DM in 2018 while maintaining our 22% distribution growth. Questar Pipeline business is a perfect match with the stable, long-term regulated cash flow profile of Dominion Midstream Partners.","Slide 17 highlights our financing plan and the impact of Questar on our expected EPS growth rate. Value to Dominion from this acquisition does not depend on any significant levering of our balance sheet. We intend to prudently finance this transaction in line with our previously stated credit rating targets, using a combination of equity, mandatory convertibles, and debt at Dominion, in addition to equity at Dominion Midstream to finance the drop of the Pipeline business.","As a reminder, we still do not need or do not plan to need any equity at Dominion Midstream in 2016. The acquisition is immediately accretive to Dominion's earnings per share and will support a 2017 growth target, while allowing us to achieve or even exceed the top end of our growth target for 2018. As Tom Farrell mentioned earlier, we are excited about this transaction, the value it creates for our Dominion shareholders and Dominion Midstream unitholders, and the opportunity it provides to continue to grow our gas infrastructure business. We will take your questions in a few minutes, but first, I want to review our results for 2015 and our earnings guidance for 2016.","Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, which was below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. Extremely mild weather in December, the timing of a planned farmout restructuring, and a higher-than-expected effective tax rate due to bonus depreciation were the primary factors driving earnings below the range. While we have discussed our sensitivity to weather in prior calls, never had this the kind of impact that we saw in December.","Slide 20 shows the cumulative temperature deviation from normal for each December over the last 50 years. The value for December 2015 is highlighted in red in the upper right-hand corner. Not only was this the warmest December in the last 50 years, it was nearly twice this warm as the previous record experienced in 1984. Our analysis indicates that warm temperatures accounted for $0.08 to $0.10 per share during the fourth quarter. Bonus depreciation will be a significant positive to our long-term cash position, but unfortunately, since the new law was retroactive back to January 1, it did not allow us to take $0.03 per share primarily from tax deductions anticipated in fourth quarter guidance.","And finally, although we did not complete the planned farmout restructuring last quarter, we do anticipate completing a new farmout opportunity during calendar year 2016. The earnings shortfall in the fourth quarter also follows full year 2015 operating earnings per share to be below our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.85 per share. GAAP earnings were $3.20 for the year. The principle differences between GAAP and operating earnings were charges associated with the Virginia legislation enacted in February that required a write-off of Virginia Power prior period deferred fuel costs and charges associated with future ash pond closures. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","For the fourth quarter of 2015 Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 million and distributable cash flow of $24.7 million, all consistent with management's expectations. On January 21, Dominion Midstream's board of directors declared a distribution of $0.2135 per unit payable on February 15 to unitholders of record on February 5. This distribution represents a 7% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion, funds from operations were $4.5 billion in 2015. Net commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the year were $3.1 billion. We had $4.5 billion of credit facilities at the time, taking into account cash and short-term investments ended the year with liquidity of $1.4 billion. In January we have increased our primary credit facility by $1 billion, taking our total credit lines to $5.5 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 13 and 24 of the earnings release kit.","As I mentioned earlier, an extension of bonus depreciation was included in the recent federal spending authorization. Dominion expects to be a significant cash beneficiary of bonus depreciations because of our large capital program. We anticipate a $2.5 billion cash flow benefit over the next several years. And wrapping up our financing update, I would like to remind everyone that Dominion's Board of Directors authorized an 8.1% dividend increase in December for 2016. The new annual rate is $2.80 per share.","Now, for earnings guidance for 2016. Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $3.60 to $4.00 per share for 2016. The midpoint of this range is 10% above the $3.44 earned in 2015. Positive drivers for this increase are revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity expenses, higher capacity performance revenues and investment tax credits from our solar facilities. Offsetting factors include higher DD&A expenses, interest costs and sheer dilution from the conversion of the mandatory convertible units.","Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2016 is $0.90 to $1.05 per share, compared to $0.99 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The midpoint of this range represents a 5% increase over the weather normalized $0.93 for the first quarter of 2015. As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 26 of the earnings release kit. As of mid-January, we have hedged 91% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone, and 6% our expected 2017 production.","I will now turn the call back to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Before we take your questions, I want to provide a quick update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,358-megawatt combined-cycle facility in Brunswick County was about 96% complete at year-end. There are around 450 workers on site. All major equipment has been installed and all three combustion turbines were successfully fired on natural gas during December. The facility is on time and on budget, with an expected mid-2016 commercial operation date.","The hearing on our request for CPCN and rate rider for the proposed 1,588-megawatt Greensville County project was held on January 12. A decision from the State Corporation Commission is expected in April. The three-on-one combined-cycle facility is expected to achieve commercial operation in December 2018. We continue to execute on our merchant solar strategy. Dominion completed eight projects in 2014, totaling 171 megawatts in California, Utah and Georgia. Our projects for 2016 include 530 megawatts from two joint ventures located in Utah. These projects are under long-term PPAs and are expected to be in service in the third quarter.","In November Dominion acquired an 80-megawatt project to be constructed on Virginia's Eastern shore, supported by a PPA with Amazon and scheduled for operations in the fourth quarter of this year. In December and January, Dominion closed on our agreement for the sale of a 33% interest in 425 megawatts of our solar portfolio to SunEdison for approximately $300 million. We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the fourth quarter, $398 million of transmission assets were placed into service, bringing the full year total to a record $1 billion.","Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. We are continuing to work for the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. We made formal FERC filings for these projects in September. Surveying and pipeline engineering is now over 90% complete. We've also contracted for about 70% of the project materials. We plan to begin construction on both projects in the fourth quarter of this year and begin operations in November 2018.","Now an update on our Cove Point liquefaction project. Overall, the project is approximately 56% complete as of yearend and there are about 1,600 workers on site. Engineering is 97% complete and all 34 of the construction packages have been approved by FERC. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date. We also have 13 energy growth projects underway with $1.2 billion of investment to move more than 2 billion cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The Edgemoor project in South Carolina was placed into service in December and Western Access II project was placed into service in January. In the fourth quarter, we received FERC approval for four pipeline expansion projects planned to be in service later this year or early next.","So to summarize, we are very excited about our combination with Questar Corporation. It will be a premium, quality addition to Dominion and Dominion Midstream's portfolio. The combination provides geographic diversification to our natural gas operation and provides opportunities for future expansion. The transaction is consistent with Dominion and Dominion Midstream's strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure businesses with MLP qualifying assets. The transaction is immediately accretive to Dominion's earnings and provides the substantial addition to our inventory of MLP-eligible operations.","Thank you. And we're ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Dan.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just first off on the funding for Questar, can you give a little more breakdown of how you guys expect the differences between corporate debt, Dominion equity, the converts and DM equity to be broken down?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Dan. This is Mark. Let me go ahead and outline it further. We didn't have a slide on it but I think that's important question. We appreciate you asking it. This is how we view this currently, again, market conditions could change, but we expect to issue about $1.5 billion of incremental DRI debt to support the transaction. We also anticipate issuing about $0.5 billion of Dominion equity. We'll do that either through a dribble or a block trade sometime between now and when we anticipate a closing on the transaction. And then the remainder of the takeout will be a combination of mandatory convertibles at Dominion, which has been a very popular financing vehicle for us with investors, and a drop into DM to support the 2017 EBITDA growth and distribution growth from a portion of the pipeline.","We have a bridge facility for all the financing. As part of that bridge facility, we have a term loan commitment that extends well beyond closing that gives us significant flexibility for the MLP and when we might drop that. Right now, we said in script that we have no plans and no need to have a drop into DM in 2016. And the equity that we would use from the pipeline drop in 2017 is consistent with what we've said would be the EBITDA drop all the way back to February for the distribution growth to go 22% in 2017. So again, $1.5 billion or so DRI debt, a $0.5 billion DRI equity, and then the remainder a combination of mandatory convertibles at Dominion and MLP drop proceeds.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And I guess, if you think about the size, if it was an even split on the residual value for the non-DRI equity and debt, that $1 billion-plus of DM equity is pretty significant. How do you guys think about funding for that and the visibility of that raise given the relative size of DM today?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, again, I would not jump to the assumption, this is an even split. We'll have to see what the market opportunities are for both those instruments out there as we get closer. But I will tell you, Dan, that the DM currency that we IPO'ed last \u2013 a year ago October, I guess, is we had out there for about a year-and-a-half. We're actually buying a few shares back, as we disclosed earlier. There's little liquidity in the stock, and our large holders have told us they really want to see more liquidity. We are very confident that when we decide to come to market to support the 2017 drop that we can either do that in a private placement based on what we've been told by our holders, or in overnight transaction. So we're quite confident we can place (26:58) to drop, and as we get closer, we'll determine what size of mandatory convertible versus what size of MLP drop proceeds will be needed to fund the transaction. Keep in mind, again though, we have a term loan commitment well beyond closing that gives us tremendous flexibility on when we would make a DM drop in 2017.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Just one last question. If we actually look at the full-year results for 2015 and we look at the guidance for 2016, when I compare midpoint of 2015 to midpoint of 2016 guidance range, it looks like more like a 3% year-on-year earnings growth. Can you just maybe dissect a little bit of why that number, the midpoint number is lower on a growth rate basis midpoint-to-midpoint for 2016 than maybe would have anticipated before?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Dan, we're still targeting a 5% growth rate year-over-year. We're not as quite as fine-tuned as you are and others on midpoint-to-midpoint. What we try to do is give a range out there that guides to somewhere in the middle of the range. We use $0.05 increments, as you know. So as we look at $3.80 to $3.90 range, we think that's right in the 5% increase weather-normalized year-over-year, and as we get through the year, we will see if we can refine that range for you.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the deal.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Good morning.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So I just want to be clear that when you said, you thought that this transaction was supportive of your EPS growth aspirations, and would get you towards the high-end of your growth aspiration by 2018, were referring to the 5% to 6% growth target through 2017 accelerating to 7% to 9% thereafter that you gave at Analyst Day in February. Is that right?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, that is right, Greg. We haven't given any specific number for 2018 in terms of percent growth. So right now I think the best data point is the 7% to 9%. And as we said in our prepared remarks, that with this acquisition and the Cove Point full year contribution, we would expect to be at the top of that range or potentially exceed it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","All right. Great. And in the underlying sort of pro forma expectations for Questar, I know you just discussed the financing assumptions. Should we assume that you're basing your business \u2013 your base business case for Questar is based on their most recent public disclosures if you go back to their November analyst deck there, they have like $1.2 billion and the utility rate base growing 6% to 8% a year. They expect to earn their authorized return. They gave some details around the expected growth in infrastructure and returns on the FERC regulated transmission administering assets and a lot of detail around Wexpro. If we want to build our own forecast and merge it with yours, is that a fair place to start, or are there any significant changes or synergies that you're baking into those assumptions?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think on the distribution side we're very comfortable with that at 8%-plus growth. The pipeline, although it may \u2013 as you build your model, our view on the pipeline is, that is an asset that is significantly undervalued. And as Tom reviewed the slides today, the opportunities mid-term and long-term on a business due to the increased gas needs in the west to deal with carbon rules and renewable mandates, we think that number will grow more significantly over time.","And on the Wexpro gas supply side, we are taking a view on that business that we are only going to invest in capital that has been regulatory approved in the state. We view that as a gas reserve business similar to what many other companies are trying to get in their rate base, which they've had for 35 years. So we see that business as they've outlined it is (31:15) over the next several years unless markets were to change, and the growth in the distribution pipeline business picking up.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Greg, I would just add a thought about the pipelines that Mark mentioned with respect to coal. We spend a lot of time, as you know, at Dominion analyzing the Clean Power Plan, its impacts across the country, how important gas infrastructure is going to be, the compliance with Clean Power Plan. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is the key component of that in Virginia, North Carolina for now. And there is \u2013 Wyoming and Utah both are almost 80% coal-fired generation, provide electricity for their citizens. So I think there's a lot to look at in that region over the next decade.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got you. Switching back to the core, talking about the core business and the earnings guidance for 2016, there is a fairly large contribution I think coming from the success you've had building out your utility scale solar business. I mean, do you have visibility into 2017 on the solar business, or should we be expecting that that contribution is significantly smaller but more than compensated for by the accretion from core business investments plus the Questar deal?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Greg, it's going to be considerably smaller than 2016. When we announced this deal we said it's a quarter of our 2017 growth rate, and because of that it will allow us to not rely as much on ITCs in 2017. For planning purposes, and this will be fine tuned, throughout the rest of this year into next year, but I would expect something in the $0.10 to $0.15 range in ITCs for 2017 which is a dramatic increase from 2016.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","All right. Thank you, guys. Congrats again.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. On that same question, what were 2015 actual ITCs, and then what's your projected 2016 ITCs in your forecast?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Steve, 2015 earnings per share basis were about $0.24, and for 2016 they're going to be between $0.30 and $0.35.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And stepping back, Tom, you have generally kind of not wanted to talk about utility M&A so to speak, you focus very much on DM. Now, that you are doing a transaction that's more utility-ish, maybe you could give us a little bit more of your strategic thinking on utility M&A, why are you even doing it at all given you've got very good utility to begin with? And also just, should we view this as more kind of like an opportunistic thing or something that you plan to kind of continue to want to pursue strategically?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Steve, thanks for the question. I guess, I don't view it as being a utility-ish combination. What we've said since our investor conference in February that we will be actively looking for assets to add to our MLP. And we have been doing that, as you know, we added portion of the Iroquois pipeline to our portfolio. We added the Carolina Gas Transmission system. We were particularly attracted to Questar's assets, largely because of the pipeline. We're perfectly happy with the LDC, which is one of the fastest growing LDCs in the country. Utah has often been ranked as the number one state in which to do business, and Questar Gas is a fast-growing LDC. And it has very similar attributes to East Ohio Gas. But it was the MLP-eligible assets that particularly caught our attention. And after we took a hard look at the region's Clean Power Plan goals, or targets, that the EPA has imposed.","So this was a pipeline that's going to have a lot of growth opportunities and a very well-run, active-in-the-community, safety-conscious workforce at the LDC. So we're not looking all over the place trying to buy anything. We're looking for, as we said from the beginning, MLP-eligible assets. This takes care of \u2013 we don't need anything \u2013 we have with this \u2013 2016 is already taken care of. This takes care of 2017, part of 2018. Blue Racer, if it's dropped, will be in the 2020s sometime. So Dominion Midstream Partners has now available to it a long, long runway of contracted long-term gas infrastructure assets with zero commodity risk in them. So I think it's a tremendous acquisition, also for the purpose of Dominion Midstream Partners, or unitholders. So all in all, I wouldn't necessarily view it as, like, we decided we were going to get interested in utility M&As. In fact, it's the same things that we have said since February.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And even with all the distress in midstream, it's still, there's still more to find in owning \u2013 doing this more through someone that's got a mix of utility midstream and not buying into direct midstream companies or assets?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We found this when we think this is an outstanding acquisition for both, or combination for both Dominion and Dominion Midstream Partners. A lot of \u2013 as you know, there's a lot of distress, as you put it, in the midstream areas. This is a company that's distressed. It's very well run, and what we like particularly about it is the nature of the assets, long-term contracted.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then the rating agencies \u2013 basically given your financing plan, have you gotten kind of confirmation of your ratings based on this, no changes?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that you should expect the agencies \u2013 well, first of all, Steve, we met with agencies well ahead of the announcement to walk them through the plans and the metrics that this combination produce. And I expect both of them to come out very shortly with an opinion. I don't want to get out in front of them on that but we had very good discussions with them, and they clearly understand where we're going and the value of this transaction for us.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Congratulations.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a couple of questions from the DM side. I was wondering, would it be fair to think about this transaction as far as extending the runway of drops as opposed to trying to increase the load of drops in the near term, and how does it impact the equity funding plans for DM? It seems like there's still no equity in 2016, and your 2017 plans largely haven't been changed. Is that a fair way to think about things, because investors are concerned about capital market access and all of that, so just trying to help, just trying to think through these different topics.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks for that question. I think the way you look at it is exactly right. We do not have any equity needs for DM to support our distribution growth rate in 2016. And the Questar pipeline asset essentially will just replace a Blue Racer drop that we had already anticipated in 2017. And we will keep Blue Racer in reserve, so to speak, until 2020 or beyond. So it really doesn't change the DM plan in terms of equity needs going forward, and in the near term we are out of the market. And as I mentioned earlier, the structure of our bridge financing with the term loan at the close gives us a lot of flexibility to enter a midstream market at the most opportune time to support that distribution growth in 2017.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's really helpful. And just wondering, as far as this transaction is concerned, it's geographically a bit different than where DM's other assets are. Can you help us think through the gives and takes of geographical diversification versus attractiveness of the assets, or any thoughts there would be helpful.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. We said actually, people have asked us, we said all along that we were going to be looking for MLP-eligible assets. People would ask very logical questions. Does it need to be in your \u2013 are you looking for things that are geographically proximate? The answer was yes, but that it's preferred, but not required. That is the answer we've given since we started talking about this a year ago.","What's particularly interesting about Questar, in addition to the culture of the company, which very closely matches our own, is the hub concept. Dominion, our transmission system is the hub of the Mid-Atlantic. Almost every \u2013 well, every pipeline that comes into the Northeast hits our system somewhere. We move gas from the west, from the south, from Canada. All of it had mixes through our system, and then is redeployed to the east through our system and other systems.","Questar Pipeline provides that same service for the Northwest United States, and a large chunk of California. Almost a third of the gas of Western states goes through this pipeline system. So we're familiar with hubs. We see tremendous value in the hub system. And we think there's a lot of opportunity for growth through what will become, we hope soon, Dominion-Questar.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's really helpful. And then just one last one if I could, as far as Southern Trails, if you're able to touch on what that opportunity could mean for you?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we're going to have to leave Southern Trails to our colleagues at Questar.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning...","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","... or good afternoon. I guess on the bonus D&A question which affected your tax credits in 4Q, is that a reversible item that will come back in 2016, or is that opportunity of $0.03 now gone?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's gone for the foreseeable future, Brian. That was mainly around some manufacturing deductions. There were few other items, but they were mainly around manufacturing. And so until we become a taxpayer again, that is lost. And we don't expect to be a taxpayer for some time with the cash benefit I referenced earlier from bonus depreciation.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Secondly, can you also comment, what is the size of the term loan that you referenced with regards to that bridge financing for Questar?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Brian, we're not going to disclose that right now. But I will tell you it's sizable and it gives us a lot of flexibility on equity drops, more than enough to cover whatever we might be planning.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then last one for me, to what extent is the high-end comment for growth EPS in 2018 and accretive activity in 2017, to what extent is that dependent on DM capital market to access? So stated another way, could you still hit the mid-point of your prior 2017 and 2018 growth targets, if you didn't have, in a worst case scenario, Dominion Midstream capital market to access?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think for 2017 and 2018 it's not contingent much at all on those capital markets. I think we're comfortable that with the other drivers that we have we can meet the targets that we have out there. And again, the main drivers, as you know, is the Cove Point coming online, on time, and on schedule, and on budget, and then the closing of this transaction. So I think we feel in good shape no matter if DM markets are open or not.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Brian.","Operation: Thank you. Our next question will come from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. On the Questar deal, as you've talked about, you clearly didn't need to do it. So what I'm trying to understand is the premium that you've paid for the deal, let's say close to $1 billion, what are the changes relative to Questar's standalone plan, or in terms of synergies, what are the synergies that you're going to extract relative to the standalone plan that helps support a bridge to the $1 billion of premium?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The transaction is \u2013 the premium, I think, particularly, we'll leave it up to you all to compare it to other transactions that have happened in the last year or so. I think it has compared very favorably with those. This transaction though is not \u2013 accretion does not come from synergies. It comes from the ability to use Dominion Midstream Partners' equity instruments, along with Dominion's equity instruments. I think that's important for the analyst community to understand and shareholders, that it's the availability of those tools, and the growth that we see and that we can help enhance at Questar over the next few years. So there is a lot of opportunities there that we think, when in combination, we can be additive.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I got you. And then in terms of taxes, is there a tax saving that you can benefit from for the Questar assets that effectively are MLP-able for the part that is obviously owned by the unit holders; is there effectively a cash tax saving that you can get by dropping them down into the MLP?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, there is not.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Relative to Questar's standalone plan, there is no benefit in cash tax?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, that's correct.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I had just two clarification questions. When we think about the EPS growth that you're guiding us to, would you mind just clarifying, is that off of a base that's the original 2015 guidance, or is that more like 5% to 6% off of the new 2016 guidance? I just want to kind of level set where we are.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What year are we talking about, Stephen?","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, I'm trying to project out earnings growth into 2017 and beyond.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The 2017 number is off of the 2016 range that we provided. And it's consistent with what we've said previously in the 5% to 6% range.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So it's 5% to 6% off of the new 2016 base that you provided here today. Okay.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Okay. Great. And then just more mechanics around financing of the acquisition from the Dominion Midstream, and missed \u2013 sorry if this is obvious or been discussed in some way that I just missed. But when you think about this, it's a large amount of assets eligible for Dominion Midstream and it's a significant amount of capital. Should I be thinking about that as a usage of \u2013 a financing of Dominion Midstream prior to or at closing of the overall transaction, or would this be more over time those assets would go down to Dominion Midstream?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, that's a good question. If we weren't clear on it, I really \u2013 I'm glad you asked that. All we're focused on in terms of MLP qualifying assets out of Questar is the pipeline. We have targeted the pipeline to be dropped over two years, which just replaces existing Dominion assets that were targeted to be dropped, specifically Blue Racer. The gas supply Wexpro-eligible EBITDA, we do not plan on dropping into DM any time soon. It will be held in reserve at D. And again, with the pipeline asset at Questar, that will get us through 2017 and with a small contribution of Cove Point and the rest of the pipeline, it will get us through 2018. And then Cove Point and the EBITDA available from that asset that's left will get us through 2019 and into 2020. And then we have ACP and Blue Racer to grow on next as we move into the next decade.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. That's very clear. That's all I had. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Hi, everyone. Can you just maybe just touch on real quick the Wexpro agreement? Any risks that you see there? And then there's some opportunities to grow under Wexpro too. Are those sort of under review now?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the Wexpro agreement, as you know, there's been a form of Wexpro agreement with Utah, Wyoming and Idaho Commissions for 35 years. And they just very recently did a settlement of Wexpro II, as you know, it's got a different structure to it. It has a lower ROE in it, although you can, depending upon what's going on in the markets, you can return to that ROE.","Frankly, we're going to watch and see what happens with Wexpro. The core here for us is making sure we provide good service, reliable service to the folks in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming that are part of this system, that Wexpro has provided tremendous benefits to those customers over many years.","We don't see any risk, to answer your question, around the regulatory treatment of Wexpro. And the gas production business, the gas supply business, that's how we view it, we're not going to be going off into the E&P business. We'll maintain \u2013 it's our view the Wexpro business needs to be maintained for the benefit of the customers of Questar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Got it. That's helpful. And just lastly, post-merger, do you see any segments that could be potentially opportunities to strategically divest that maybe it's non-core?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Excellent. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So when I look out to 2017, what has changed, because you're saying that you can maintain your earnings growth projections in 2017, even though that transaction is accretive. So what the offset in your original business plan?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there are a number of moving parts, Angie. One is, that the Blue Racer contribution is lower than what we had previously talked about. Second, that we knew in 2016 that we had a fairly large solar ITC number. And we haven't really determined what we were going to do with 2017 because the tax credit was going to go right away. So that \u2013 we're looking at other drivers to help that. Third is that, because of the capacity performance assumption if we have at the end of 2016 versus 2017, the number is better for us in 2016 than it is 2017 in the original assumption. And then there is a few other items that drove us on the downside there. But it wasn't anything \u2013 one single thing that was really large. It was just a lot of assumptions that we made for the February meeting that market conditions have challenged that. And so this offer a good opportunity to kind of make sure we could stay on track.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And the Blue Racer's contributions are lower even though you're delaying the dropdown into DM. So...","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Blue Racer's contributions were lower really just based on -we had slowed Blue Racer down and limited the capital investments in that. The biggest driver was that we were going to have five processing plants online in 2015. We only have four right now. And we have the other one on hold until market conditions improve for 2016. We had expected a full year's contribution from that extra processing plant. We're still very bullish on Blue Racer over time. It will have very good year-over-year growth, but not as good growth as we show in the February Analyst Meeting.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Awesome. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just very quickly, I know that synergies aren't, if I understand correctly, what's driving the merger. But I would think at least on the corporate side, or at least the pipeline operations or stuff (54:24) that there'd be some. Do you guys have any numbers that you want to share with us in terms of what potential synergies there might be?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There will be synergies of course, Paul, you're quite right. But my point was, that's not what drives the transaction. It doesn't drive the accretion of the transaction. And we don't have anything to disclose on that today.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. That's fine. And then in terms of purchase accounting, I would assume because these are regulated assets there probably isn't much in the way of write ups or anything at the actual assets or contracts or anything. Am I wrong about that? Are there any significant write-ups that might impact EPS going forward?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, you're exactly right. These are all regulated assets. So we don't expect any purchase accounting impacts at all.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just two quick ones. On the farm-outs, are you guys still comfortable with the projection of $450 million to $500 million that you guys had before on the farm-out projection?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we're...","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, yeah, go ahead.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Excuse me, we're very comfortable with that, Paul. I mean, and when we talked about that range, our only challenge to that range was when would it exactly happen? And some have happened quicker in 2015 in some areas that we write to and some are slower. Some folks have signed up and now they want to restructure to get more flexibility. So we said that was over five years, very comfortable with that. And we do have an assumption in for 2016 which we think is very manageable. So overall, we like it. I just can't tell you exactly year-on-year how it's going to fold. But it's going to be over the five-year period in the range that we discussed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Fine. And then coal ash, are we finished with that, do you think, in terms of the impairments we've seen associated with that?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have our best estimate out there currently. It's an evolving field. I think we have the permits necessary that we need now to deal with a number of these ash ponds (56:27) with authorities. So I think that the best estimate we have at this point, could be tweaked, possibly, I don't think it will change a lot.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, and congratulations.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this afternoon's teleconference.

GAAP earnings were $0.86 per share for the quarter, the principle difference between first quarter GAAP and operating earnings with a net gain from our investment in our nuclear decommissioning trust.","A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. Before moving to operating segment results, let me spend a minute on sales and actions we are taking to protect against, any sales growth that may fall below our estimate of 2%.","In the first quarter weather normalized sales grew by about 1%, thus far we have seen strong growth in commercial activity this year, our residential sales have lagged. It is far too early in the year to draw any definitive conclusion on changes to our estimates, but you should know that we expect to reduce our 2013 operating expenses by about $100 million from originally plan levels to offset the higher storm and margin events in the first quarter and protect against any potential short-fall in our sales expectations.","As we have previously stated a 1% change in sales equates to about $0.04 to $0.05 per share in earnings. We believe this early action reinforces our plans to grow operating earnings by our annual target of 5% to 6%. Finally, as we explained at our March 4 Analyst Meeting, you should expect most of our growth to occur in the third and the fourth quarters as outlined on slide 4.","Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the first quarter was $278 million, which was below its guidance range, kilowatt hour sales were below expectations and major storm and service restoration costs, due to several major storm events, were higher than expected. EBIT for Dominion Energy was $301 million, which was above the top of its guidance range.","During the quarter, the TL-404 pipeline was contributed to the Blue Racer Midstream joint venture, adding $25 million to first quarter EBIT. This was originally scheduled to be drop in the second quarter and was therefore not included in our first quarter earnings guidance. The short fall and earnings from the delay in Natrium operations was offset by lower fuel costs and lower operating expenses.","Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $415 million in the first quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Lower than expected kilowatt hour sales and lower ancillary service revenues at Virginia Power were the principal factors driving the results for the regulated generation business. EBIT from merchant generation was below the midpoint of its guidance range. February snow storm would nearly 2 feet of snow in the Boston area that you can Justin in the New England transmission system which prevented us from realizing expected margins at Millstone for several days. On a consolidated basis both interest expenses and income taxes were inline with our estimates.","Moving to cash flow and the treasury activities, funds from operations were $1.1 billion for the first quarter. Regarding liquidity, we have $3.5 billion of credit facilities, commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $2 billion, resulting in available liquidity of $1.5 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to our financing plans, we issued $750 million of Virginia Power debt in January and another $500 million in March. We were pleased with the market response to our offering, and thank those of you who participated. We updated our 2013 financing plans at our March 4th Analyst Meeting to reflect the inclusion of the Cove Point Liquefaction Project in our growth plan. In addition to the 300 million of common equity, we expect to rise to our dividend reinvestment and other stock plans, we expect to issue between $500 million of $1 billion of mandatory convertible securities, sometime this year. ","Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the second quarter of 2013 within a range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. This compares with original operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2012. Compared to the second quarter of last year, positive drivers for the quarter include a return to normal weather, earnings from our newly completed growth projects at Dominion Energy, sales growth at Virginia Power, and higher rider related revenues. In addition you should expect a reduction to our originally plan operating expenses due to the program, I discussed earlier. Negative drivers for the quarter include a refueling outage at Millstone Unit III and lower contributions from Dominion Retail.","Our operating earnings guidance for 2013 remains $3.20 to $3.50 per share. The middle of this range corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase over the middle of our guidance range for 2012.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last update on March 4th, we have made no changes to our Millstone hedges. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices is only about $0.01 per share in 2013, and $0.03 per share for 2014.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.83 per share for the first quarter, below the midpoint of our guidance range. Kilowatt hour sales at Virginia Power were less than expected and we have taken steps to reduce operating expenses to offset any potential impact of lower sales, as well as the impact of storms and the delay at Natrium in the fourth quarter. Our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2013 is $0.60 to $0.70 per share. A return to normal weather, earnings from our growth projects, sales growth at Virginia Power, and reduced operating expenses should drive these results.","And finally, our operating earnings guidance for 2013 remains $3.20 to $3.50 per share. The middle of this range assumes normal weather and corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase over the middle of our guidance range for 2012.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell","Good morning. At our March 4th Analyst Meeting in New York, I highlighted our improved safety performance by showing that our OSHA incident rate had been reduced by over two-thirds over the last seven years. That trend continued in the first quarter of this year as well with each of our business units achieving year-over-year improvements in the safety. We achieved record-setting operating performance from our generating fleet in the first quarter as well. The first quarter net capacity factor of the seven Dominion nuclear units was 100%. In fact, up until the April 14 shutdown of North Anna Units 2 for its schedule refueling outage, all seven nuclear units operated continuously for 125 days. Millstone Unit 3 achieved a record of breakout continuous run of over 500 days.","Our merchant fleet established quarterly availability records for the combined cycle fleet as a whole in for the [indiscernible] power station. In particular, we continue to move forward on our growth plan. Construction of the 1,329 megawatt Warren County combined cycle plant is progressing on schedule and on budget for the late 2014 commercial operation days. All three combustion turbines and generators have been installed on their foundations.","The air-cooled condenser and the three heat recovery steam generators are being interacted over 900 people are presently employed at the site. Development of the proposed Brunswick County Power Station continues, last November we filed the CPCN and rider applications with the State Corporation Commission. The public hearing began yesterday and we expect a ruling from the commission later this summer.","On March 15, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued the units air permit, the 1,358 megawatt three-on-one combined cycle facility is expected to be in service in 2016. The conversion of the Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell plants from coal to biomass are progressing on schedule and on budget. Engineering and procurement of all major equipment have been completed and delivered to the sites. The first biomass fuel deliveries arrived in Altavista in March which will allow testing to proceed this quarter. All three projects are expected to be operational later this year. We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Our growth plan includes new investments of over $500 million per year in growth and with that reliability projects including the systematic rebuild of the 500 KB loop that is the backbone of our states transmission network.","Progress in our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues. The nature in processing and fractionation plant was originally scheduled to be in service at the end of last year. We have experienced nearly four month delay in completing this 20 month project for a number of reasons, but we are pleased to stay we have begun commissioning activities and we\u2019ll be fully operational in May. We have accessed the reasons for the delay and have taken steps that we believe will improve our future mid-stream construction performance.","Utica region continues to be very active through April 13 a total of 605 horizontal Utica permits have been issued and 297 wells have been drilled, an increase of 93 wells permitted and 74 wells drilled since just the middle of February. The management team at Blue Racer is actively marketing gathering and processing services to the producers in the Utica region, a 200 million cubic feet per day processing plant has been ordered and will be delivered to the Natrium site this summer. This facility will provide the service we have originally planned to fund ourselves that we had called Natrium II. Blue Racer has also ordered a second 200 million cubic feet per day processing plant and will be delivered to the Berne Ohio site this fall. In February, Dominion East Ohio has signed a gathering agreement with BP to include an investment of $24 million related to the installation of gathering pipe in compression for BP share wells, we drilled in Trumbull County. We\u2019re evaluating this and other assets for potential contributions to the Blue Racer joint venture.","This morning, Dominion Transmission announced a non-binding Open Season to solicit interest in incremental firm transportation capacity to serve our traditional markets in New York State. The project contemplates access to the growing supplies in the Northern portion of DTI system and delivering it to the year for a gas transmission system and to the Niagara Mohawk distribution system serving Albany.","The new gas supply and market dynamics have created an opportunity to provide expanded natural gas service, the existing and growing loads in the North East market area. Dominion Transmission, Dominion East Ohio and Blue Racer are all providing the midstream growth, we anticipated. We are pleased that our board made its final investment decision to go forward with the Cove Point Liquefaction Project on April 1. We announced that the capacity of the project is fully subscribed with 20 year terminal service agreements with Sumitomo and Gail, each contracting for half of the capacity.","Sumitomo in turn has commitments for its first capacity to serve Tokyo Gas and Kansai Electric. We also announced that the signing of an EPC contract for the liquefaction facilities with IHI\/Kiewit Cove point and have already placed orders for some of the major equipment. We have filed an air permit and CPCN applications in Maryland. Also on April 1, we filed the 12,000 page FERC certificate application. We expect to receive our export license from the Department of Energy, some time this year. Subject to FERC approval, we expect to commence construction next year with commercial operation expected in late 2017.","Before we open the call for questions, I want to give an update on our regulatory activities. Our March 28, Virginia Power filed its 2013 biannual rate review application, demonstrating that the company earned a return on equity of 10.11% for the 2011 and 2012 test periods. This falls below the authorized earnings band of 10.4% to 11.4%. If the State Corporation Commission concludes that the company\u2019s earnings did not exceed the top of the earnings band then rates cannot be lowered until December of 2017 at (inaudible). A decision from the commission is due by the end of November.","Finally, on March 22, the State Corporation Commission approved a solar purchase program that offers customers who want solar generation installations, a special rate option. The program has a cap of up to 3 megawatts of customer owned installations. These customers for solar generation will now have the option to purchase all of their electricity from Virginia Power on our current rate schedule, and so their solar generation including renewal energy grows back to the company. We continue to offer innovative solutions, designed to satisfy our customers\u2019 needs.","So, to summarize, the company achieved record setting operating and safety performance in the first quarter. We continue to make progress on our infrastructure growth plans at Virginia Power. A Natrium processing and fractionation plant was a few months behind schedule but is currently being commissioned. Blue Racer is providing earnings growth, we anticipate. We have secured terminal service agreements for the full capacity at Cove Point, buying an EPC contracts and submitted our filing to FERC. All of which support the earnings profile, we provided at our March Analyst Meeting. We look forward to beginning construction in 2014. And finally, we have submitted our biannual review filling with the Virginia State Corporation Commission showing that we did not exceed the authorized earnings band in 2011 and 2012, which should keep our base rates stable through at least 2017.","Thank you and we are ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Listen on the load growth outlook it seems like there is a little more caution maybe you\u2019re telling and what you guys said today maybe even from the Analyst Day. Can you maybe just shed a little more light on what you\u2019re seeing and are we seeing the impact of the sequestration or other things in the area that that\u2019s having more variant on the outlook this year?","Mark F. McGettrick","Dan, it\u2019s heard to hear you, but this is Mark. I think I got your questions, if I can address it on a little more depth. January and February for us was pretty close to expectations in terms of low growth. But March dropped off significantly for us and so the sales for the quarter were only up above 1%. We were very pleased with commercial sales. They were up about 3%, industrial sales which is a small item for us, but they were up by 1%, but our residential sales were fairly flat. We don\u2019t have an answer for this for you today because something we\u2019re monitoring closely and we will talk more about as we go through the year, but the reason, one of the principle reasons to announce the expense reduction program today is to safeguard ourselves from any potential sales shortfall if that would occur. If that doesn\u2019t occur then some of those expenses will be put back into operating budgets later in the year, but we want to make sure we got out in front of this and we safeguard ourselves to we have a better picture on what sales might look at like this year.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right, thanks Mark. And I guess just on that we\u2019re kind of leading to the next question which is on the cost cutting. Can you explain what are all those going into that? Are these kind of your period specific cost that will you caught up in the future periods or these some structural changes that are bringing more cost out of the system as you reevaluate the business?","Mark F. McGettrick","It\u2019s going to be a combination of both, some will be structural changes, some will be timing changes that we will redeploy for future periods. We\u2019re finalizing those plans now and should have that in place by the end of April. I will tell you one of the first steps we took in the first quarter was to significantly restrict new staffing for the company which typically is in the range of 300 to 400 new employees every year as a way to give us a running start on this has been managed very closely. And so based on that we think we\u2019re in good shape as we implement other changes throughout the company and again as I mentioned previously some of them will be time based, some of them will be permanent.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","And so we should assume that the O&M cost for 2013 are now going to be down, almost noticeably versus 2012 with this program as well?","Mark F. McGettrick","Actually, I think with the $100 million item, you should see expenses 2012 to 2013 to be very flat.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then I guess just one last question on the biennial review. You have kind of given what your earned ROEs are and the way the legislation came in through in Virginia this spring. Did you guys see the opportunity potentially to settle with parties and kind of get everybody pass this and focus back on business full time or is this going to be a fully litigated process?","Mark F. McGettrick","Dan, we\u2019re always happy to talk to the parties about settlement. I think you have to let the process runs, scores at least for some period of time before people rounded to talk about that. I do think the issues are pretty limited. In this case, I\u2019m sure people will want to talk about that going forward. Earnings band, for example that won\u2019t affect base rates but we\u2019ll have its impact in some regard in what the earnings test is for 2013 and 2014 and a little increment of that peers in the riders. So I think that will obviously be an area for discussion, but the accounting issues are not very complex.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Trahan.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Yeah, hi, good morning. Just first question on biennial, where did the peer group ROEs come out in your filling, the three year rolling\u2026","Thomas F. Farrell","Steve, I don\u2019t have that sitting here in front of me, I apologize. We\u2019ll get it, we\u2019ll make sure, it\u2019s posted on the website, it\u2019s in the testimony.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay.","Mark F. McGettrick","It\u2019s all out there in public domain. I\u2019m sorry.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay","Mark F. McGettrick","The average of the, if you use all 11 the average is 10.74%.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Great. And then on the retail business, I know you had a tough comp last year, you did very well, but could you just go into any dynamics you are seeing in the retail business so far this year?","Mark F. McGettrick","Steve, let me just mention the comparable to last year first and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul to go into more depth on it. If you look at the reconciliation on the Schedule 4 which is in page 10, I think on the kit it shows the $0.07 quarter-over-quarter change from $0.13 to $0.12 and that was driven by two items, I talked about this at the Analyst Meeting on March 4 to expect this, we took a $0.05 of one-time mark-to-market gain in the first quarter of last year based on some commercial and industrial contracts that were deemed to be derivatives. So that was $0.05 of the difference the remaining $0.02 is just a normal roll off of those contracts that occur beginning in the first, second quarter last year and we\u2019ll continue through the rest of this year. So, those are the two high level drivers, but in terms of the dynamics in retail let me ask Paul to comment on that.","Paul D. Koonce","Yeah. Steve, good morning. The dynamics if you, when you look at the ABS, it\u2019s going to be published here in just a few minutes you\u2019ll see that retail actually had a strong quarter. They get albeit at the low end of the guidance range, but when you look at customer counts in the kit, you can see the customer counts were up, you can see the volumes were up, but it is a competitive business. So, when you compare to guidance it\u2019s kind of what we expected, but it\u2019s less than last year.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. One other question just on the issue with Millstone on the basis, I guess the congestion in February, is this something we should very about just with all the different gas dynamics in doing when that could have any ongoing issues, or is it just very driven by that storm and alike transmission issues from that?","Thomas F. Farrell II","Steve, let me have Dave Christian to answer that for you.","David A. Christian","Yeah. It looks like that was predominantly concentrated in one week in February and wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of that throughout the rest of the year.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Great, thanks very much.","Thomas F. Farrell","","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell","Good morning.","Mark F. McGettrick","","Good morning, John.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I was going to ask about retail so I will ask my other one instead. On the Natrium, you talked about the delay and then you\u2019re going to change some of your operating practices or what about to help reduce risk going forward. Can you just give us a bit more insight into what exactly caused this delay and what you\u2019re going to do differently to fix?","","Thomas F. Farrell","There were a variety of reasons, Jonathan, some I attribute to our management of the project. Many of which I attribute to the contractor and he subcontractors, but we\u2019ve done a, we have, over the last, at least five years, delivered every single projects whether it was in construction or generation plants, operates the plants transmission, electric transmission lines, mid-stream projects, pipeline projects, Cove Point\u2019s expansion, the peer construction, every single one of those projects is delivered on time and on budget. It\u2019s kind of mantra around here. And this time we didn\u2019t do. And so we\u2019ve taken a hard look at the whole process we went through with the bids on that project, our management of it, contractor\u2019s management of it, and we\u2019ve made a variety of internal changes that we think we\u2019ll make sure that does not happen again.","Fortunately the plant looks to be very well constructed it\u2019s gone through its final commissioning really as we speak that has been doing it over the last week 10 days. And it should be running pretty close to fall middle to the late May that we are going through the last pieces of it now, but we made some significant changes we have some a lot of future projects coming.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, so I\u2019m just still speaking in a very generic terms I mean was it one major issue or just a hardest of issues?","Thomas F. Farrell","I wish, I can tell you it\u2019s one issue that we can solve that we will point one finger out, but it was a variety of issues across our management of it and the contractor\u2019s management of it, but it is I consider to be a one-off experience, we\u2019ve made the changes we need to make\u2026.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Thomas F. Farrell","And we\u2019ll be in better shape going forward.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And on similar topic, could you just comment on the sort of contracting status of Natrium 2 to and the banned facility.","Thomas F. Farrell","Yeah, of course, Natrium that will be handle by Blue Racer\u2026","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay","Thomas F. Farrell","Those are their projects they are, remember the way it works, they have to contribute all the capital to the joint venture until our capital accounts are equal which has a ways to go, so they will be putting up all the cash for example to purchase those processing plants. There is a tremendous amount of interests in those two locations which is why they picked them to move these processing facilities to, they are well in the negotiations with the variety of producers and we will have to leave announcements about that up to the Blue Racer management team as they come along\u2026","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much","Mark F. McGettrick","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Thanks. If I take the retail declined in the first quarter and assume sort of a $12 million decrement each quarter between now and end of the year that would seem to put you on the low end of your retail guidance for the year as is that a fair assumption?","Paul D. Koonce","Paul, this is Paul Koonce, we did have a very strong first and second quarter last year, we\u2019ve guided the full year and we have not seen any reason to change that.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay. And I guess my other question would be on the new processing facilities, can you give us a sense of what the capital spend is associated with each of those processing facilities?","Mark F. McGettrick","We\u2019ll have to get back on that Paul its Blue Racer\u2019s capital spend it\u2019s not ours.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Understood, but I\u2019m just trying to take you out, what\u2026","Mark F. McGettrick","Actually Caiman\u2019s capital spend, not even the joint ventures capital spend.","Paul D. Koonce","Paul, I would say that if you are making the comparison Natrium 1 the facility that we are going to put into the joint venture, these processing facilities are significantly different than that and at a significantly reduced cost from that.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Great, but they have no fractionation, right?","Mark F. McGettrick","Right, no fractionation. And so, again, without Dominion management allowed us to release that we\u2019re not in a position to tell you the exact cost of plans, but I certainly can guide you that it will be dramatically lower than what Natrium 1 cost.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","And is there a schedule in the biennial proceeding that\u2019s available?","Mark F. McGettrick","Actually, I think they just issued the schedule. Hearings are supposed to be in the first or second week of September.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay.","Mark F. McGettrick","And the staffs require mandates that they issue the final order before the end of November.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","And staffs and intervenor filings are do, when?","Mark F. McGettrick","August","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay.","Mark F. McGettrick","But there is a, Paul it\u2019s in everyone else. Listen, there was a posted order that we\u2019ll make sure we get on our website for you.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Great.","Mark F. McGettrick","It\u2019s on the State Corporation Commission\u2019s website now.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Thanks very much.","Mark F. McGettrick","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good morning guys.","Thomas F. Farrell","Paul\u2026","Mark F. McGettrick","Good morning.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Just I want to touch base with you on weather versus normal. On page 24, it looks like it was a hurt and on page 21, it looks like that you guys had higher heating degrees actual versus normal. Could you reconcile that for me?","Thomas F. Farrell","Yeah, well that was actually a hurt to normal for us. So about a $0.0015 for the quarter, heating degree days were up, but based on wind that was occurred during the day I think it was the full benefit of that here is most of it, but again weather normalized for us, it hurt us a $0.0015 but quite honestly Paul we\u2019re pretty happy with compared to the quarters over the last two years what we really have been hurt by weather.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And the reason why the heating degrees don\u2019t have this bigger impact even though they are greater than normal because I missed it what was that?","Mark F. McGettrick","Paul, you want to take that?","Paul D. Koonce","The heating degree day had really occurred in March and the March heating degree days are not as significant as the heating degree days that we lost in January, that\u2019s the reason.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, I got you. And then on the mark-to-market gains from last year, are there other gains that happened, I noticed that you guys are seeing some decrease in the second quarter as well on the retail business, just any other mark-to-market benefits that we should be thinking about? That well\u2026","Mark F. McGettrick","I think, if I recall that the second quarter of 2012, there was a $0.035 mark-to-market gain in retail which we don\u2019t expect that in the second quarter of this year.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then just finally on the Blue Racer drop in that happened sooner than you guys had previously expected? What led it to come in sooner? What was the reason for that?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, we were ready to drop in and they want to drop it earlier. The Blue Racer team is very excited to get these assets in place as quick as they can. We had a little bit of work to do on this pipe and we dropped it a month earlier based on their request and as being ready.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Okay, thanks a lot.","Mark F. McGettrick","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Dominion Virginia Power and then one on the remaining merchant generation facility, on Virginia Power what kind of, what do you see as kind of the biggest issues for the general rate case process? And then on the, what\u2019s remaining of your merchant generation fleet mean Millstone a fair less works. You\u2019ve made a consorted effort over the last few years to shrink relative to the broader Dominion, the size and exposure to merchant generation almost to the point where it doesn\u2019t move the needle in either direction. How do you think about these assets versus being kind of part of your core long-term strategic goals are intent?","Thomas F. Farrell","","Well, as far as the biennial review goes because of I mean this is now the second of the biennial reviews, a lot of them, we\u2019ve been through the process, everybody has been through the process, everybody now knows pretty much what the rules of the road are. The legislature has some language that sort of clarifies that period expenses are period expenses and our shareholders have to bear the cost of those of period expenses in the period in which they are incurred storms, natural disasters, write-off, significant plant in this particular case. Our Chesapeake in Yorktown facilities because of the mercury rules that EPA finalized during the period.","Let\u2019s say it maybe clear that\u2019s our shareholders responsibility and can\u2019t be spread out and we have customers to pay for them. And also has the impact of ensuring that they are accounted for as period expenses and the period in which they have incurred. So the accounting issues, everybody has imagination expect we\u2019ll see some interesting arguments, I don\u2019t know, but I think the commission presents pretty clear on all these things. So I think the main issues will not revolve around over earnings, they will revolve around what going forward return on equity is that is taking into account for the providers going forward and what will be the basis for the 2013 and 2014 by any review. They also stated also made it clear that the commission should only utilize a performance standards that they had used in the past, in their present which is in the last time did any of that was in the late 1990s, in which their focus is on generation plant performance, because you can seize direct benefit to customers from better nuclear performance, better coal performance, because it reduces the cost of the fuel for the customers.","We set records on our power plant performance during this period. So that\u2019s it on the biannual review. As for as our merchant plants go, we have Millstone Power Station, Manchester Street Station, and Fairless Works in Pennsylvania. Our shrink, as I think I said at our March Analyst Meeting, you should expect to see the end of the shrinking through the closing or selling of assets by the Dominion Resources. The assets we have, it can fit well within our strategic plan we want to maintain a stable, strong, relatively small merchant power fleet in a localized region, still nearly 4,000 megawatts, the lowest cost unit in all of New England, in Millstone Power Station.","And so, we are very content with those assets and what we\u2019re going to concentrate on is building out the Midstream business, building out Virginia Power and the regulated generation businesses, continuing to build our retail business and build the Cove Point liquefaction facility.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co","Okay I guess, follow-up on the Virginia Power item; I also was under the impression you filed your full loan general rate case outside of the biannual review and while we are we doesn\u2019t get debated in the rate case process, kind of all the general line items meaning [OEM], et cetera will kind of be up for debate in the GRC process. Just trying to make sure I have my hands around what do you think some of the bigger issues in the GRC not really the biannual review process will be?","Thomas F. Farrell","Okay, I think the issues will be the same. We, our filling demonstrates that we are entitled to base rate increase of about I think it\u2019s a $128 million. We did not ask the commission to grant us a base rate increase. We intend to move forward and try to shift to be allowed earnings based upon customer growth in our own actions here.","So we have not ask for a rate increase unless we\u2019re found in the biannual review to have over earned there cannot be a review for rate decrease until 2017. So, that\u2019s why do actually think that interest will be in the biannual review in the earnings test, which I think would be highly unlikely we will have be found to fall above the top the earnings range.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co","Got it, thank you Tom much appreciated.","Thomas F. Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. ","Thomas F. Farrell","Good morning Stephen.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to follow-up on [when] Dan had asked about the cost cutting the $100 million in expense reductions. Mark, you\u2019ve mentioned there is a mix of types of reductions but as we are thinking about sort of the structural cost reductions, could you just talk just broadly about what kind of broader long-term cost reductions you would envision just in broad strokes in terms of categories. As I think about sort of the delays of hiring, does that sounds more like a delayed in a permanent change, But just love to understand the cost cutting better?","Mark F. McGettrick","Yeah, I\u2019d like give you a broader answer on it Stephen, but again we are still in the process of finalizing some of that. I think what you should expect for 2013 is a temporary reduction in expenses and have us evaluate here over the second quarter, and how many of those can become permanent over time. That\u2019s why I emphasize the staffing, we can certainly address the new hires very quickly from previous employment levels that we anticipated as a quick savings mechanisms for us, but I\u2019ll try to get into more color on that in the next call, the third quarter call, you\u2019ll start to see some of those expenses materialize. But I don\u2019t want to get in front of the process. We\u2019re still discussing internally with the businesses and what\u2019s appropriate, but we are very focused that on the levels that I discussed to ensure that we can meet our growth rates should sales fall short on us and to make up for the first quarter short-fall.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Understood. Thank you very much.","Mark F. McGettrick","Thanks you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Julien Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Thomas F. Farrell","Yeah, good morning.","","Mark F. McGettrick","Yes, we can\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Very good morning, excellent, first question, you\u2019ve eluded to sequestration I\u2019d be curious if you just kind of dig into that a little bit more what precisely was the contribution of sequester to 1Q results and secondly what are your expectations through the balance of the year in that regard?","Mark F. McGettrick","Julien, this is Mark. One is \u2013 right now, I\u2019m not comfortable seeing any of it is associated with the sequester. As I mentioned, the first two months of the year were fairly close to expectation for us, and March, for whatever reason, which we\u2019re still evaluating, came in short. So I think we have to go through the year to figure just what are the drivers of any change, if there is any change. And so we\u2019re taking a cautious approach here. But at this point in time, we have no basis to say that any of the shortfall is associated with the sequester activity.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Okay, great. Second question here on New England. I\u2019d be curious, why you\u2019re not take off your hedges here, given pricing? I\u2019d be just curious, I\u2019ve recognized first quarter your hedged up largely. You didn\u2019t realize it but broader thought process there?","Mark F. McGettrick","We established our hedging program years ago and if you look back over the last five years, I think, you\u2019ll see that over that period of time, our hedging strategy has delivered more value to our shareholders than if we had not have a hedging program, actually every year of those years I believe.","So what we\u2019ll evaluate going forward but we don\u2019t hedge, we don\u2019t say the market, our idea what the hedging program is to, we\u2019ll give earnings guidance, we want those assets to produce their share of the earnings guidance. So that\u2019s why we hedged in these windows and roll in over time. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. So that could turn you know we evaluate everything. We think that\u2019s not the way to go about in the future, then we will certainly look at that, but for now, we\u2019re content with the way we\u2019re doing.","Paul D. Koonce","Julien, if you look at what we did in the first quarter, we actually did a significant amount of hedging, we talked about it on March 4, we haven\u2019t done it since March 4th, but if you look at the hit price and what we were able to lock in the first quarter and the movement from the end of the year, it\u2019s pretty significant and it was a good lift price wise push.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Yes, very good point on that one. And then lastly just curious here, Open Season you kind of alluded to if this New York opportunity kind of linked back to New England reliability is that just kind of getting a sense to the size and scale of are there any potential investments there? Kind of thinking more broadly here, this part of a broader aspect here?","Gary L. Sypolt","I would say. This is Gary Sypolt, Julien, and I would say the Open Season really more traditional on LDC market is where we think that that\u2019s headed and not necessarily fire plants all, but the traditional LDC market, that\u2019s really looking for access to shale type gas on the Appalachian region.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","All right, excellent. Well thank you very much guys. Thanks for the time.","Thomas F. Farrell II","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy your day."],"7159":["Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call February 11, 2020 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Steven Ridge - Vice President-Investor Relations","Tom Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jim Chapman - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Diane G. Leopold - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Conference Call Participants","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Michael Weinstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to the Dominion Energy Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference call. At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steven Ridge, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Steven Ridge","Good morning and welcome. Earnings materials including today's prepared remarks may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","This morning, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP, reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which we are able to calculate are contained in the earnings release kit. I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website to review the earnings conference call materials, including the earnings release kit. The Investor Relations team will be available after today's call to answer any questions.","Joining today's call are; Tom Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Chapman, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; as well as other members of the executive management team.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Chapman","Thank you, Steven and good morning. Let me start by saying that we have a lot of ground to cover on today's call, which reflects the exciting progress we are making on our investment program, our financial targets and on our ESG efforts including the introduction of an enterprise-wide net zero emissions initiative.","Over the last several years, Dominion Energy has transitioned into a larger, more regulated and more predictable company and this is reflected in our ability to extend our track record of delivering financial performance consistent with our guidance.","I'm pleased to report on slide 3 that the fourth quarter of 2019 was the 16th consecutive quarter of achieving operating earnings per share that adjusted for normal weather met or exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range.","Quarterly operating earnings were $1.18 per share, which includes a benefit from better-than-normal weather of less than $0.01. Even without adjusting for weather this was still the 16th consecutive quarter of results that align with our guidance range. 2019 full year operating earnings of $4.24 also exceeded the midpoint of our annual guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share.","When adjusted for about $0.02 of help relative to normal weather, these operating earnings for the year met the midpoint of our annual guidance range and represent a 5.5% increase over 2018 weather-normalized operating EPS. GAAP earnings for the quarter and for the year were $1.32 and $1.73 per share, respectively.","Recall that full year reported results were materially impacted during the first two quarters of the year by charges associated with the SCANA merger, including a substantial customer refund as approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission.","Adjusted for these merger and integration-related costs, our trailing 3-year aggregate GAAP earnings are actually higher than our total operating earnings over the same period. A summary of adjustments between operating and reported results are included in the appendix with a detailed reconciliation available on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Turning now to slide 4. As usual our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather variations from which could cause results to be toward the top or the bottom of these ranges. We are initiating 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share.","The midpoint of this range represents a 5% increase over our weather-normalized 2019 results, which aligns with the guidance we provided at our Investor Day last March. Select drivers in 2020 as compared to 2019 include increased earnings from regulated investment growth across our electric and gas businesses, lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances and a lower rate environment, the full year impact of the Millstone Zero Carbon Contract and lower depreciation expense associated with an anticipated extension of the useful life assumption for our regulated nuclear plants in Virginia.","Negative drivers include increased minority interest expense associated with the equity recapitalization of Cove Point, share dilution, lower New England capacity prices and a double outage year at Millstone. Note that the double outage year -- the double outage occurs every third year and will therefore be a positive driver in 2021.","We are introducing first quarter consolidated operating earnings guidance of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. We are also affirming our post-2020 guidance of 5-plus percent annual operating EPS growth as well as our dividend per share growth rate of 2.5% per annum, subject as is customary to board approval.","We have successfully changed the way we manage and report our businesses, as shown on slide five, to better reflect the larger and more regulated nature of our operations. We expect that these realigned segments will also make it easier to model and analyze our company.","On slide six, we provide annual operating income guidance at the new segment level. Let me take a moment and highlight a few points. First, except for contracted generation, which I'll explain in a minute, each of our segments exhibit strong operating earnings growth trends, driven primarily by regulated investment and general cost discipline.","Contracted generations earnings trend is negatively impacted by the sale of Manchester and Fairless at the end of 2018 and by the double outage year at Millstone in 2020. As I mentioned previously, the double outage driver will reverse for 2021. Second, we've adjusted the CAGR of the gas distribution segment to exclude the impact of the addition of PSNC in 2019, to demonstrate the very strong core growth rate at the segment, absent merger activity.","Third, we are not showing the 2018 to 2020 CAGR for Dominion Energy South Carolina as the merger with SCANA did not conclude until 2019. Growth in 2020 is primarily driven by merger cost savings, which we expect to accrue to the benefit of our customers in South Carolina as part of our upcoming electric rate case. In other words, this growth is good for both customers and shareholders.","Finally, these segment level operating income CAGRs, of course, don't reflect equity issuance at the parent over the period shown, including shares issued in exchange for SCANA stock early last year and which act to produce a consolidated EPS growth rate that is slightly below the segment level growth numbers shown here.","On slide seven, we show expected 2020 operating EPS contribution by segment. This page underscores two of the key investment themes we have emphasized. First, that the strategic progression of our company has resulted in having approximately 95% of our operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated-like operation; and second, that around 70% of our operating earnings come from state-regulated utility operations centered around five highly attractive states; including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Utah. Going forward we plan to provide this segment level operating guidance annually.","We have also simplified or added to our existing disclosures, including with regards to weather impacts, customer growth, rate base estimates, Millstone hedging, fixed income and other topics. We hope you find these changes, which are included in our earnings release kit and in the appendix of today's presentation, helpful.","Turning to slide eight. We've summarized our current capital structure. We now have distinct and aligned financing entities related to our Dominion Energy Virginia, Dominion Energy South Carolina and gas transmission and storage operating segments.","These financing vehicles are, in addition to our parent level entity, SEC registrants and, therefore, will continue to file 10-Ks and 10-Qs. For the gas distribution and the Contracted Generation segments we show here the aggregate of existing financing balances across the individual op-co entities, which, primarily due to their smaller size, are financed in the private market.","Let me now address credit more generally. I frequently remind our investors that we manage our balance sheet to a target credit rating range and not just to one of the specific credit metrics. Also, that the cash coverage metrics such as FFO or CFO pre-working capital to debt represent only a small weighting within the overall rating methodologies employed by our credit rating agencies.","Nonetheless, on slide nine, we illustrate the meaningful improvement we have achieved in the cash coverage metric over the last four years and which we expect will continue to gradually improve over the next several years. We've included in the appendix additional detail on the calculation of this metric for 2019.","On a related topic, strong performance of our retirement plan assets, combined with an earnings neutral fourth quarter contribution more than offset a year-on-year reduction in discount rates resulting in an increase in the overall funded balance of these plans by around 7 percentage points.","This leads me to our 2020 CapEx and financing plan. Slide 10 provides our 2020 capital investment plan, which are broadly in line, though a little higher in aggregate than the forecast we provided at our Investor Day due to a handful of small positive revisions and timing deltas.","And slide 11 provides an overview of our 2020 external financing plan. A couple of things to highlight here. First, consistent with previous guidance, our common equity plans for the year include only around $300 million via our DRIP program.","You may recall that we have previously forecast $300 million to $500 million of ATM issuance in 2020, but subsequently announced that we would use proceeds from the Cove Point equity recapitalization to reduce or eliminate that issuance, which is reflected here.","Next I'll point out that during 2020, we intend to issue up to $1.8 billion of privately placed fixed income securities at Dominion East Ohio, which as a result of the Dominion Energy Gas Holdings reorganization, we completed last November is currently levered only on an intercompany basis. We currently expect this issuance in the mid-year, and we'll use proceeds to retire current level debt.","Finally, as is the norm, this annual financing plan does not reflect any opportunistic refinancing activities which may arise during the year. For example in 2019, we rebalanced the capital structure at Dominion Energy South Carolina via a series of bond repurchases.","In this fourth quarter, we took advantage of an attractive financing environment to replace existing debt with an equity credit preferred security that's priced at an all-time industry low. We will continue to monitor opportunities to similarly strengthen our balance sheet in an earnings supportive manner.","Turning now to the Atlantic Coast pipeline, which Tom will address in greater detail in a moment. Since about a year ago, when we announced the last material increase in our estimated total capital cost for ACP, discussions have been ongoing between the project owners and the anchor shipper customers, regarding the equitable sharing of those increases within the contract tariff.","Those negotiations have been productive and we expect to formalize an agreement in the coming weeks. As part of those discussions, the major project customers have confirmed their willingness to take on higher project rates given the strategic importance of ACP as an alternative pipeline option to the region.","As a reminder, these are 20-year take or pay agreement with regulated utility customers and no commodity exposure. This customer negotiation process -- progress allows us to provide guidance related to the project's economic contribution after entering commercial service.","As shown on slide 12, we expect the 2022 contribution to be between $0.20 and $0.25 per share, which includes Supply Header and assumes a full year of commercial in-service. This estimate also reflects the transition from AFUDC to contract-based cash earnings potential.","We expect this contribution to increase over time as we expand the project via compression and laterals. There is no change to our expected contribution this year of mid to high-teen cents per share.","In related news, we're announcing today that we have agreed to acquire certain modestly sized gas transmission and storage assets from Southern company, subject to HSR regulatory approval.","The first is pivotal LNG, which liquefies and delivers LNG as fuel for transportation in the Southeast U.S., primarily from a new LNG production facility located in Jacksonville, Florida. Tom will discuss how this asset, together with Cove Point support the expansion of our LNG strategy to include maritime transportation.","The second asset being acquired is Southern Company's 5% stake in the Atlantic Coast pipeline, which upon closing will bring the project ownership to 53% Dominion Energy and 47% Duke Energy.","Note that the governance arrangements for the project company remains such that it will continue to be recognized on an unconsolidated equity method basis in Dominion's financial statements. Likewise there is no change to Southern Company's status as one of the anchor customers for the project through its Virginia natural gas local distribution company.","The near-term financial impact of the acquisition of these two assets is positive but relatively small and the increased ACP ownership is reflected in the earnings contribution estimates I provided previously. Total cash consideration for these acquisitions is around $175 million.","Turning to Santee Cooper. Our interest remains limited to a management proposal arrangement designed to cooperatively improve operational efficiency from our nearly co-located utility footprint. Consistent with our previous messaging on this topic while the potential financial impact of any such arrangement would not be a material near-term financial driver for Dominion, we are glad to participate if selected by the Department of Administration and the South Carolina General Assembly especially if the collaborative approach results in cost savings that can be passed on to our and Santee Cooper's customers in the state. We will provide updates as warranted as that process moves into the next phase.","Finally, let me offer just a brief comment on the recent third quarter related to the PJM capacity market structure, commonly referred to as MOPR-Ex. We will continue to monitor that situation as it winds towards resolution. In the meantime, we do not see this as the material financial risk for our company given the even balance of supply and demand at Dominion Energy Virginia.","Further, if we determine it to be in the best interest of our customers, we have the option to make a fixed resource requirement or FRR election. This would require a notification to PJM and where we'd also notify the Virginia State Corporation Commission and the North Carolina Utilities Commission.","With that, let me conclude my remarks by reiterating the key investment themes that I spoke to on our last quarterly call. We are highly regulated -- we are highly regulated with about 95% of our company's operating earnings derived from regulated and regulated like operations. 70% of our earnings are from utility operations centered around five attractive states. Another 25% of our earnings are from FERC-regulated transmission and storage operations, primarily serving utility customers under long-term capacity contracts.","During 2019, we grew our regulated rate base by approximately 6%. We continue to expect five-year rate base CAGR of approximately 7% consistent with our expectations at Investor Day.","We are executing on our previously announced five-year, $26 billion growth capital plan that will modernize, strengthen and improve the sustainability of the services we offer to our customers.","And finally this customer focused approach also benefits our shareholders as demonstrated by our growing track record of meeting and affirming our financial guidance including a 16th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding our guidance midpoint.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Farrell","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. First, a reminder that safety is our first core value. On slide 14, we have recast our historic safety results to incorporate our mergers with Questar and SCANA. As you can see, the overall trend reflects a continuous focus on employee health and welfare. Pro forma for past mergers, our company-wide OSHA recordable incident rate decreased in 2019 for an 11th time over the last 13 years.","Turning now to our consistent national leadership as it relates to environmental, social and governance matters. Over the course of the last year, we have intensified our efforts to reduce emissions of all types. As shown on slide 15, we have already reduced carbon emissions by around 50% since 2005, which is nearly twice as much as the most recently reported industry average. We have followed a similar path for methane emissions, which have fallen by around 25% since 2010, a significant reduction driven by industry-leading efforts.","Further as shown on the next slide. We have reduced coal-fired generation's contribution to company-wide electricity production by 80% from 52% in 2005 to 12% in 2019. And we estimate that coal-fired generation today accounts for less than 8% of our total regulated investment base.","Turning to slide 17. I'm pleased to announce a new commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The goal includes both carbon dioxide and methane emissions and covers all of our businesses including electricity generation and gas infrastructure. This represents a significant expansion from the company's previous greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, which included a commitment to cut methane emissions from our natural gas operations by 50%, between 2010 and 2030, and carbon emissions from our power generating facilities by 80%, between 2005 and 2050.","Reducing emissions as fast as possible and achieving net zero emissions company-wide requires immediate and direct action. That is why the company continues to make meaningful steps, to extend licenses for its zero carbon nuclear generation fleet. Promote customer energy efficiency programs.","Invest heavily in wind and solar power. Reduce the amount of coal-fired generation on our system. Enhance gas infrastructure leak detection. Systematically replace legacy gas distribution lines.","And harvest agricultural methane emissions, to be repurposed as renewable natural gas. All of these initiatives are included in our capital investment plan guidance, through 2023. And will extend well beyond that.","Over the long-term, achieving these goals will require supportive legislative and regulatory policies and broader investments across the economy. This includes support for the testing and deployment of technologies such as, large-scale energy storage and carbon capture, which though still early stage, have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, when deployed in conjunction with carbon-free generation.","And we will never lose sight of our fundamental responsibility to customers, provision of safe, reliable and affordable energy. We have issued a press release this morning that addresses the topic in additional detail.","And you should expect to hear more about our plans, including an upcoming climate, and corporate and social responsibility reports. Though certain approaches will undoubtedly evolve over the coming decades to reflect the most up-to-date assumptions, our commitment to net zero emissions, will not change.","I'm pleased to report that our work on reducing emissions and enhancing our ESG disclosures was recognized with a leadership rating by CDP, an influential non-profit that monitors and measures environmental impact.","These ratings put Dominion Energy in the upper echelon of not just U.S. utility companies, but all companies of all industries globally.","In addition, Just Capital, an organization that promotes corporate responsibility, in partnership with Forbes, has ranked Dominion, among America's top 100 corporate citizens. It is of course nice to receive accolades like these, but we are not declaring victory.","In addition to minimizing our own operational environmental footprint, in line with the carbon and methane goals I just described. We are also embracing the notion of Beyond Dominion Energy, as it relates to our ability to transform the emissions profiles of our customers and energy end users, as shown on slide 19, in the transportation sector which accounts for 29% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.","We are leading the way in the development of the largest electric school bus program, in the nation. We are enhancing the resiliency and flexibility of our electric grid, to enable the more rapid deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, as enabled in Virginia by the Grid Transformation and Security Act.","And we are developing infrastructure that will make liquefied natural gas, compressed renewable natural gas and potentially hydrogen fuels more available and more affordable for use in transportation applications, including maritime shipping vessels.","In the agricultural sector, which accounts for 9% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, we are partnering with the nation's largest hog and dairy producers to capture methane from farm operations.","These partnerships have already committed $700 million of shared investment to capture methane emissions. And use RNG to serve homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. These are large and ambitious, multi-decade plans that are consistent with the spirit of Dominion Energy and its nearly 20,000 employees.","Many of these efforts are well underway, including our solar, offshore wind, nuclear re-licensing and energy efficiency programs. Others are in more nascent stages, including our electric school bus, RNG and marine, LNG programs.","Over the coming months and years, you should expect to hear more on these strategies, as we work diligently to reduce the emissions profiles of our company and our customer. I will address several of these now.","Turning to slide 20, late last year, we announced plans to install over 2.6 gigawatts of wind generation capacity approximately 27 miles off the coast of Virginia, a major milestone for a project we began developing in 2013. Since that announcement, we have achieved several additional milestones, including selecting Siemens Gamesa as our preferred turbine supplier and entering into an agreement with three prominent trade unions to support the onshore electric interconnection work. We will begin ocean survey work in April, which will help to support the submission of the construction and operations plan at the end of this year.","We expect to commence construction in 2024 upon timely completion of the BOEM permitting process with full in-service by the end of 2026. We will continue to work to refine the preliminary capital cost estimate of approximately $8 billion, the vast majority of which will occur in the 2024 to 2026 time frame, as major components are fabricated and installed. Cost reductions as well as any tax benefits that we achieve will accrue directly to the benefit of our customers.","Dominion Energy Virginia will be the sole equity owner of this regulated asset. We will seek recovery via Orion from the Virginia State Corporation Commission. While the existing GTSA provides a strong framework for regulated cost recovery for offshore wind investments, legislation which was supported by the governor's office in recent legislative committee meetings is working its way through the current Virginia general assembly session, that if enacted would provide additional regulatory clarity.","Our related 12-megawatt pilot project will begin turbine installation in May and is expected to achieve commercial operation in late summer of this year. The lessons learned on this project will be invaluable to the successful completion of our full-scale deployment.","The pilot is the first and only offshore wind project in Federal Waters to have completed the BOM permitting process, which included a cumulative impact analysis. We expect to leverage the right-of-way and other work already performed under the pilot project to facilitate routing the export cable to shore and connecting it to the onshore electric transmission system.","Also in Virginia, our weather-normalized sales increased 1.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased data center and residential demand. We connected nearly 34,000 new accounts, about 10% more than last year including 26 data centers, which set another annual record.","Earlier this year, PJM revised upwards their peak load assumptions for our service territory to reflect among other things continued strong data center growth. PJM Dom Zone summer peak load growth is now expected to be 1.2% per year over the next 10 years and 1% annually over the next 15. These rates are double the PJM system-wide growth rates and rank our zone as one of the fastest-growing regions among the 13 states that comprise PJM.","Turning to Slide 21. Last month, the State Corporation Commission approved our U.S. forward solar CPCN application, the second such approval in the last 12 months. We expect subsequent rider approval in April. Overall, we have now achieved 57% of our commitment to Virginians to have 3,000 megawatts of solar in development or in operation by the end of 2021.","To date, and inclusive of around $800 million of spending in 2019 alone, Dominion Energy's enterprise-wide total solar investment now stands at approximately $4 billion with an additional nearly $3 billion expected through 2023. We anticipate continued solar investment for years to come which is why we expect to improve our current ranking of fourth among the largest utility owners of solar in the country.","Phase 2 of our grid modernization program is before the commission. Representing around $500 million of CapEx, the request includes deployment of automated metering, a new customer information platform and investments in grid resiliency and telecommunications that are essential to delivering the products and services that our customers desire and which provides for a system more capable of withstanding climate-related risks. We are optimistic that we will receive approval next month.","Our other investment programs, shown on slide 22, such as electric transmission, nuclear relicensing, distribution undergrounding, pump storage, renewable-enabling quick-start generation and rural broadband are tracking in line with our expectations. Virginia General Assembly has been in session for about five weeks and is scheduled to conclude in less than a month. There are two proposals currently pending, that I believe warrant highlighting. One is related to offshore wind, which I previously addressed. The other relates to our nation-leading initiative to replace diesel with electric school buses.","We have already selected a vendor and worked with local school districts in our service territory to allocate an initial delivery of 50 school buses by year-end. Pending legislation calls for replacing an additional 1,500 buses by 2025, representing an estimated Dominion capital investment of approximately $400 million, which will be eligible for cost recovery subject to commission approval.","Ultimately, we would place all 13,000 diesel school buses in our Virginia service territory. Not only will this effort dramatically improve the air quality for our students and their communities, it will provide valuable, real-world experience with vehicle to grid battery technology as the first 1,500 buses, while idle, represent up to 60 megawatts of effective battery storage. We are monitoring other active pieces of legislation, all of which we expect to represent a reasonable and balanced approach to statewide energy policy priorities.","Turning now to South Carolina on slide 23. We are pleased with the work done by our team members to provide for a smooth integration, while maintaining their historically excellent levels of reliability and customer service. Around midyear, we plan to file an electric rate case as stipulated in the merger agreement. Our most recent earned return was around 7.5% and our current authorized return is 10.25%. The most significant driver of the under earnings is related to normal, course safety, customer growth and reliability utility investment over the last eight years. This is not currently captured in rates. We believe the case will conclude by year-end, with an outcome that appropriately balances the interest of customers and shareholders.","Turning to Gas Distribution. Recently, we have begun to hear of investor concern that at least in some states, municipal level ordinances could limit overall demand growth for natural gas utility service. While that may be true elsewhere, we simply do not see any evidence of slowing customer or investment growth in the states in which we operate gas utilities, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.","Compounded annual customer growth across this segment was 1.5% over the last three years and as high as 2.6% and in Utah and North Carolina, with no signs of abating anytime soon. For many of our customers, the alternative to natural gas for home heating is fuel oil or even wood, which have significantly higher carbon signatures. And in certain communities within reach of our system, a lack of energy infrastructure is constraining growth and impacting everyday quality of life.","Further, we are an industry leader in minimizing the emissions footprint of natural gas utility operations, including through promoting energy efficiency, utilizing innovative technologies and increasing access for our customers to renewable natural gas. We also continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars every year in modernizing our distribution infrastructure, which improves safety, reduces emissions and is recoverable in the form of riders or trackers that will continue over the course of at least the next decade.","Regulators continue to approve new investments like our on-system peaking storage facility in Utah that will improve system reliability for decades to come. Our gas distribution segment is focused on being part of the solution to a sustainable future.","Finally, let me now discuss our gas transmission and storage business. First, RNG. We are the largest agricultural waste-to-energy investor in the United States with investments of $700 million across our partnerships over the next 10 years. These investments will grow as the offtake market matures. Through these efforts, we capture otherwise fugitive methane from livestock and convert it to pipeline quality natural gas for use in homes, businesses and vehicle fleets. Every captured unit of methane is the equivalent of eliminating 25 units of carbon dioxide.","Dominion is uniquely positioned to lead the industry in this effort, given the geography of our assets. At Investor Day last year, we identified marine LNG as one of the many innovative ideas we were working to advance. By way of background crews and cargo vessels primarily consume diesel or fuel oil each of which is a major contributor of greenhouse gas and other emissions.","The maritime industry is taking steps encouraged by recent global regulation to reduce its emissions footprint which is expected to result in a material shift to LNG. This expected growth in LNG as a fuel source allows Dominion an attractive opportunity to provide natural gas liquefaction and LNG distribution services to a growing list of maritime customers.","As Jim mentioned, we are acquiring an interest in existing Florida-based operation that currently services marine vessels with an onshore liquefier coupled with marine fuel delivery infrastructure. Customer contracts in this business are typically long-term, take-or-pay with no commodity exposure.","This initial acquisition will support a broader marine LNG strategy that would include Cove Point where we're partnering with an existing export customer to redirect a portion of their liquefied natural gas inventory to provide LNG to constrained markets along the East Coast and to provide fuel for marine vessels under 0 commodity risk take-or-pay contracts.","Importantly, this arrangement does not and will not alter the existing 20-year take-or-pay export contract revenues or terms. While modest initially this market has the potential to support the significant decarbonization of the country's marine industry in addition to radically reducing pollution at our nation's ports.","Overall inclusive of the acquisition from Southern Company, we expect to deploy approximately $200 million on this strategy over the next 5 years. This is an innovative element of our long-term Beyond Dominion Energy effort to help our customers new and old meet their emissions reduction targets.","Turning now to an update on activities related to the Atlantic Coast pipeline as shown on Slide 24. Two weeks from yesterday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments related to the Appalachian Trail crossing aspect of our U.S. Forest Service permit. We remain optimistic that the court will issue an order reversing the 4th Circuit in the May or June timeframe.","We continue to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service on a reissued biological opinion and are pleased that FERC reinitiated formal consultation yesterday. We applaud the service for taking the time to consider thoroughly the feedback provided by the court during the prior judicial proceedings and we believe an updated biological opinion will be issued during the first half of this year.","Upon receipt of the updated biological opinion, we intend to notify FERC and anticipate thereafter, the recommencement of construction across major portions of the pipeline.","We're also pleased with the progress related to projects' Nationwide 12 permit which was issued by and subsequently voluntarily remanded to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Last month The Corps adopted repromulgated regulations that would allow for ACP to seek reissuance of the permit.","As it relates to the Buckingham County compressor station air permit which was vacated late last year, I repeat my message from our last earnings call. We can deliver a very material amount of contracted volumes to customers on our existing schedule even if permit resolution delays the in-service date of the project's third compression station.","We are working on a number of solutions which we expect will resolve the issue during the second half of this year. We believe that the options we are evaluating will satisfy the court's concerns. We started on process not the substance of the permit itself.","Based on our expectation of the biological opinion being reissued during the first half of the year, we are confirming our project time line, the calls for construction completion by the end of next year and commissioning to be completed shortly thereafter.","Project costs of approximately $8 billion are in line with the high end of the judicial option range, we provided about a year ago. This estimate incorporates the various potential approaches to permitting issues and construction plans and timing including as relates to the Buckingham compressor station which are being contemplated in the customer discussions that Jim described.","Also as noted, we have agreed to acquire the 5% ownership in the project from Southern Company further underscoring our confidence in the successful completion of the project.","With that, I will summarize today's call as follows. Our first value is safety and we achieved another year of record safety performance. We introduced a net zero emissions by 2050 target that accounts for carbon and methane emissions across both, electric and gas operations. We achieved weather-normalized operating earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 16th consecutive quarter.","We further improved our credit metrics and successfully completed the restructuring of our operating segments. We introduced 2020 earnings guidance that represents a 5% year-over-year increase consistent with previous messaging. We confirmed our earnings per share growth expectations of 5-plus percent post-2020 and we are making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers.","We will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the floor is open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shar Pourreza","Hey good morning guys.","Jim Chapman","Good morning.","Shar Pourreza","Thanks for the additional disclosures on the ACP slides. With the AFUDC rate versus returns once gas is flowing, can you just elaborate if you're expecting any sort of step down there in your assumptions? I guess what returns are you kind of assuming in your $0.20 to $0.25 per share contribution once the pipes in service post these contract negotiations? And curious, if these negotiations built-in any potential further cost increases?","Jim Chapman","Sure. Good morning, it's Jim. Thanks for that. Yes, there has been as we said in our prepared remarks quite the substantial discussions with the anchor customers, the anchor shippers. And those discussions don't really revolve around ROE. It revolves around a rate. So, what the guidance we've given is, is for the first full year of operation at that rate. And that will of course imply an ROE, which folks can do the math on, but it's reflective of the expected rate for the anchor shippers.","Now, when you do calculate that ROE that's implied by that math, you'll get to a number that is reflective of the first full year of operation only, meaning over time, as that project expands through laterals or compression or whatever, that's not reflected in that year one ROE, but the -- that will all flow from the input, which is a agreed upon customer rate and cost.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. And then, is there a point in time, Jim, that you can sort of update us on laterals and compression? Is there -- and then where is sort of your intentions are there at that point?","Diane Leopold","No. What we can say is that, we are optimistic that there will be expansions over time. Sorry, this is Diane Leopold. But we're right now focused on getting the base project in.","Shar Pourreza","Okay, got it guys. This was terrific. Thanks so much.","Jim Chapman","Thanks Shar.","Tom Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning.","Jim Chapman","Good morning","Greg Gordon","Tom I may have -- you covered a lot and you've made a ton of progress. So congratulations. I don't recall, if you mentioned, whether you think there'll be any substantial legislative activity in Virginia this year? And if so, what we should be monitoring?","Tom Farrell","Thanks, Greg. We mentioned two things in particular, the legislation that would allow for up to 1,500 diesel school buses to be converted to electric between now and 2025. And there are bills in both the House and Senate that are working their way through. Today is what we call Crossover Day in Virginia, where each of the Houses has to finish work on its own bills. So, the House has to finish work on all House bills and then everything goes over to the Senate, they can no longer work on House bills after tonight. And the same is true for the Senate. So, there are bills on the electric school bus in both houses.","And there are bills related to providing even further regulatory clarity around our 2.6 gigawatt offshore wind farm.","Other than that Greg there's been a large amount of legislative activity, some bills are no longer viable others are. And we just are monitoring all those working on them. Until they work their way through the legislative process. It's really -- it's premature to comment on them.","Greg Gordon","Great. And what would be -- what's your expected -- how do we reword this. What would be the outcome that you would expect coming from the legislation with regard to offshore wind if it does pass and what type of regulatory framework would that entail?","Tom Farrell","Well, again Greg I just -- the bills are there pending and I think they speak for themselves. They have language in them that increase regulatory clarity.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you, all. I will go take a read. Appreciate it. Take care. ","Tom Farrell","Thank you. ","Jim Chapman","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Tom Farrell","Good morning. ","Michael Weinstein","Good morning. Hey. What impact of the FERC MOPR have on Virginia the offshore wind projects? And what is your, I guess, your decision process at MEPCO versus an FRR on tariffs?","Jim Chapman","Michael, it's Jim. Let me start there. We -- as we mentioned look we don't expect that that MOPR as proposed will have really any financial impact on Dominion. As you know our capacity and load in Virginia -- Dominion Energy Virginia is pretty well balanced. So no near-term impact. And if we foresaw that some change with MOPR and PJM rules would mean that we would not be potentially receiving capacity payments on new build generation. We could very easily in the interest of our customer -- customers in Virginia just elect that FRR option which we think is pretty straightforward. It already exists for another utility in the Virginia regulatory framework so we just don't see FRR the MOPR in general being an impact to our business one way or the other.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. So for now I mean I guess later on you might make that election if it does impact the ability to bid into the auction for the offshore wind correct?","Jim Chapman","Correct.","Michael Weinstein","One other question. The $8 billion for ACP is a little higher I guess you're at the high end of the range now. What are some of the factors that are pushing that up towards the high end of the range? Is it the Buckingham issue or something else?","Diane G. Leopold","Hi. This is Diane Leopold, again. So we run a lot of scenarios incorporating where we are with permitting issues and based on the timing of that, construction scenarios certainly including Buckingham compressor station options. And all of those have been taken into account in the customer negotiations that are factoring into revised rates. But really that's what took us to the $8 billion which is in line or just above the high-end of that judicial option range.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Jim Chapman","Thank you. ","Tom Farrell","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning's conference call. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy your day. Thank you. "],"6800":["Dominion Resources, Inc.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation we will open the floor for questions. At that time instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning for the Safe Harbor statement.","Thomas Hamlin","Good morning and welcome to Dominion\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning\u2019s earnings release and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you\u2019ve not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for email alerts and view our third quarter earnings documents. Our website address is www.dom.com. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will guide this morning\u2019s discussion. And now for the usual cautionary language, the earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management\u2019s projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company\u2019s performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our second quarter operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2014, as well as operating earnings before interest and tax commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliation of such measures to most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, we are able to calculate and report are contained on Schedules 2 and 3 and Pages 8 and 9 in our earnings release kit.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the third quarter and our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we\u2019ve made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion reported operating earnings of $0.93 per share for the third quarter of 2014, which was below the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. Mild summer temperatures and low humidity in our service territory one of mildest summers in the last 30 years had a significant impact on electric sales and revenues reducing operating earnings by $0.08 per share compared to normal. Excluding the impact of weather, third quarter operating earnings would have been at the upper end of our guidance range. Positive factors during the quarter were lower than expected operating and maintenance expenses and lower than expected interest expenses. Offsetting these positives were lower kilowatt hour sales due to mild weather and lower merchant margins.","On a year-to-date basis, our 2014 weather normalized operating earnings were $0.10 per share better than the first nine months of 2013. GAAP earnings were $0.90 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a charge associated with a previously differed or capitalized cost related to a possible third unit at North Anna power station, offset by a number of items including higher returns from our nuclear decommissioning trusts. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earns can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to results by operating segment, at Dominion Virginia Power EBIT for the third quarter was $248 million which was below this guidance range. Kilowatt hour sales was below expectations due to the milder than normal weather. Excluding weather, sales for the quarter were consistent with a year-over-year expectation of 1% growth. Positive factors for the quarter were higher revenues from electric transmission and lower major storm and service restoration expenses. Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $572 million in the third quarter which was below its guidance range. EBIT from utility generation was below expectation due to lower than expected kilowatt hour sales and lower than expected revenues from ancillary services. EBIT from merchant generation was slightly below expectations due to lower margins. Third quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $236 million which was above the top of its guidance range. Higher transportation and storage revenues and lower operating expenses drove the strong results.","On a consolidated basis, our effective tax rate was about 33% for the quarter which was in line with our guidance. Interest expenses were lower than our expectations. Overall, we were pleased with our third quarter \u2013to-date operating results.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities, funds from operations were $2.8 billion for the first nine months of the year. We have $4.5 billion of credit facilities at the end of the third quarter. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion and taking into account cash and short term investments, we ended the quarter of liquidity $2 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see page 14 and 25 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to our financing plans, during the third quarter we issued $1 billion of mandatory securities. The issue was very well received by the market and we thank those of you who participated. Also during the third quarter, we exchanged $1.2 billion of 144-A bonds issued by Dominion Gas Holdings last fall for registered securities. We expect another new debt issue of at least $1 billion for Dominion Gas in the fourth quarter. We were always looking for opportunities to optimize our capital structure and lower our financing cost. During the third quarter, we issued a notice of redemption for $685 million of hybrid junior subordinated debt replacing it with similar security in October which lowered our annual interest expense by about $18 million. We also called all of the remaining $134 million of outstanding Virginia Electric and Power Company preferred stock. You can expect us to undertake similar actions in the future to take advantage of the current interest environment.","Finally, we successfully completed the initial public offering of limited partner common units and Dominion Midstream Partners earlier this month. Despite a volatile environment for stocks in general and MLPs in particular we were able to complete the transaction and offering price that translated into a record low IPO yield for an operating master limited partnership beating the previous record by nearly 40 basis points. Net proceeds of just under $400 million will be used to help fund construction of our Cove Point liquefaction project. Dominion Midstream Partners now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker DM and we have been pleased with its market performance since the offering. DM will make its first 10-Q filing in November and we plan to discuss its quarterly results and take questions for analysts covering the MLP during Dominion\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call.","Now to earnings guidance, our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014 is $0.80 to $0.90 per share compared to $0.80 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013. A breakdown of the positive and negative drivers of our guidance is shown on slide seven. Positive factors for the quarter compared to last year plus higher revenues from our lighter projects, higher earnings from our farm out transactions at Dominion Energy. Sales growth at Virginia Power a return to normal weather and better margins from a merchant fleet due to existing hedges. Negative factors include every fueling outage at Millstone Unit 3 and higher DD&A expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the year remains, $3.35 to $3.65 per share. Through the first nine months of the year, operating earnings were up $0.15 per share or 6% over last year. Combining year-to-date operating earnings for the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance range and the year-to-date net weather of $0.04 was full year projected operating earnings in the middle of our guidance range.","As to hedging you can see our hedge position on page 27 of the earnings release kit since our last earnings call, we have made modest additions to our hedges at Millstone for both 2015 and 2016, improving the average weighted hedge value of prices for both years. So let me summarize our financial review. Operating earnings were $0.93 for the third quarter of 2014, excluding the $0.08 per share impact of mild weather, earnings would have been at the upper end of our guidance range. Our financings plans for the remainder of 2014 include a debt offering for Dominion Gas Holdings. Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014 is $0.80 or $0.90 per share. Our operating earnings guidance for the full year remains $3.35 to $3.65 per share. And finally, we plan to host a meeting for analysts and investors on Monday February 9, in New York at Waldorf Astoria Hotel. At this meeting, we plan to discuss the long term growth strategy for both Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners.","Given the longer term construction schedule for Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline which we plan to contribute to the MLP, our presentation will cover our expectations beyond the normal five year time horizon. We will detail Dominion Midstream\u2019s long term distribution growth rate which we believe were among the best in class. We will also outline our plant drop down strategy for DM and outlined how the cash flows from the future drop downs Dominion share of the LP units and our general partner interest will be used to enhance Dominion\u2019s earnings and dividend growth rates. In addition, we expect MLP cash flows will allow us to strengthen our balance sheet. By addressing all of these areas in February, investors will readily see the significant incremental value the MLP affords to Dominion shareholder. We hope you\u2019ll be able to attend.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Tom Farrell","Good morning. Our business units delivered strong operational and safety performance in the third quarter. Year-to-date recordables for Dominion Power are at an all time historic low our performance at the other business units is consistent with our targets for the year. Our nuclear play continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our six units was 94.4% for the first nine months of the year. We completed two refueling outages in the second quarter and are completing two more in the fourth quarter. We continue to make significant progress on our growth plan. Construction of the 1,300 29 megawatt Warren County combined cycle plant on plant and on budget. Start up and commissioning activities are underway and all of the units have completed first fire and have successfully synchronized for the grid. Project is expected to be operational later this year. Construction of the 1,358 megawatt combines cycle facility confronts with Brunswick County is well underway. There are approximately 975 workers on site the combustion turbines and generators have been set on their foundations and the construction of the air cools condensers is progressing. Overall construction is about 35% complete is on budget and on time for our mid 2016 commercial operation date.","With plans to filing to the Virginia state corporation commission in the first half of next year for a CPCN and a rig rider for our next major generating project another large three on one combined cycle plant scheduled for service by 2019. Construction is also on schedule for six schedule projects totaling 139 megawatts purchased earlier this year from the current energy. There are over 1,300 workers on site in construction is well underway 100% of the posts are installed and over 96% of the 1.3 million solar panels are in place. We continue to make progress on our two Tennessee solar projects as well. The summer project was placed in service on October 22nd. All of these California and Tennessee facilities are expected to reach commercial operation later this year. In the third quarter, Dominion part two additional solar projects in California. These acquisition on the long term purchase agreements and are expected to qualify for the federal investment tax credit in 2015. Once constructed these additional projects will bring our total generating portfolio 274 megawatts.","At Dominion Virginia Electric Power we have a number of electric transmission projects of various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the third quarter 187 million of transmission assets were placed into service. The year-to-date in service total is almost 700 million and we expect to place over $900 million of new transmission assets into service by the end of this year. Electric transmissions capital budget for growth projects including maintenance as well as security related investments will average over $600 million per year through at least the remainder of the decade. Progress on our growth plan continues as well. The Allegheny Storage, Western Access 1 and Natrium to Market expansion projects will be in service tomorrow all on time and on budget. Since last year we have announced nine produced round of projects totaling nearly 2 billion cubic feet per day of capacity. Of the nine four have been placed into service with the fifth expected tomorrow. The remaining four will be in service by year end 2016. They all were on time and on budget. Since our last earning call, Dominion Transmission signed an agreement for another farmout project from which we allow producers in the Marcellus Basin to drill for gas in and around our storage wells. These projects provide multiple earnings stream for Dominion including famous for mineral rights royalties on productions as well as transportation and potential processing business. This farm out covers 24,000 acres of Marcellus development rights and these are upward storage period in Pennsylvania.","Our agreement provides payments to DTI of approximately $120 million over four years and a 5% overwriting royalty interest in gas produced in the acreage. Portions of Northern Pennsylvania has seen drilling attention from producers since two significant production wells were drilled by shale in the deeper dry gas Utica formation. We have a number of storage reservoirs in this area and in order to exploring additional farm out opportunities. In September, we announced the Atlantic Coast Pipeline a transformational infrastructure project designed to bring much needed natural gas supply and reliability to utilities in Virginia in North Carolina. The pipeline would support new electric generation being developed by Duke Energy and Virginia Power as well as to support growing LDC gas demand.","The pipeline would be on by joint venture of its principal customers the mineral own 5% will be the constructor and the operator of the pipeline. Duke Energy will own 40% and be the largest customer. Piedmont Natural Gas will own 10% and AGL Resources of Virginia Natural Gas will own 5%. The 550 mile pipeline starts in West Virginia and passes portions of Virginia and North Carolina including some areas currently without gas service terminating about 50 miles from the south Carolina border. The estimated cost of the pipeline was 4.5 5 billion. Currently about 91% of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day initial capacity of the pipeline will be under 20 year firm contracts with the four owners of the joint venture as well as public service company of North Carolina. Last week we began a binding open season for the remainder of the capacity. While initially 1.5 billion cubic feet per day ACP is expandable to over 2 billion cubic feet per day with additional pressure. We will initiate the first three filing process today and expect to make the formal filing with in September of next year.","Assuming a normal timeframe for approval we expect to be able to begin construction through the fall of 2016 and be in service by November 2018. We\u2019ve already hosted 13 town hall meetings and surveyed 70% of the . We have begun solicitations for several engineering and procurement activities including large diameter pipe. We have received this and expect to award these long lead items by year-end. We are pleased with the progress to-date and with the reaction of public policy makers to this critically important reliability project. In current with the open season for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, we were also conducting a binding open season for a related wholly owned Dominion transmission opportunity called the supply header project.","As envisioned in our open season announcement this project is designed to connect the origination point of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline with five supply points using expanded compression about 40 miles of pipeline looping. It is expected to have capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. The estimated cost of project is $500 million and it will be in service at the same time as the pipeline. The ACP customers have all expressed interest in taking capacity on the supply header project.","The Utica region continues to be very active. Through the middle of October a total of 1,560 horizontal unit permits have been issued and 1,122 wells have been drilled, an increase of 50% wells permitted 65% wells drilled so far this year. The number of producing wells has increased by 125% of 270 to 607 so far this year. Our Blue Racer joint venture continues to execute its business plan. Currently two processing facilities each with the capacity process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day or in service. The third plant was scheduled to be operational this quarter and the fourth plant is scheduled for early in the second quarter of next year. Blue Racer is also planned for fifth processing plant which is expected to be in service in September of next year bringing its total processing capacity to 1 billion cubic feet per day. Fractionation capacity also been expanded from 46,000 barrels per day to 123,000 barrels that project will be completed in the second quarter of next year. We are very pleased with the success of Blue Racer and will provide an updated business plan at our February Analyst meet.","Now an update on our Cove Point Liquefaction project, in September 29 we received court approval to construct and operate Cove Point. The order contains 79 conditions which were identified as part of the environmental assessment. We accepted the order the following day, Berk issued authorizations for construction of offside areas A and B and we began activities immediately. On Wednesday we received authorization to begin initial site preparation at the terminal itself. We authorized our EPC contract to begin construction activities that same day. The project is estimated cost of 3.4 to 3.8 billion and it\u2019s targeted to be in service in late 2017. As of September 30, the projects on budget the engineering was 62% complete and a procurement of critical equipment is on schedule.","So to summarize our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance. The Warren County and Brunswick County construction projects are perceiving on time and on budget. Our Blue Racer joint venture Dominion East Ohio and Dominion Transmission continue to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the Marcellus and Utica share regions. Dominion along with its joint venture partner will develop the Atlantic Coast Pipeline a transformational infrastructure project to bring new supplies of natural gas to the Southeastern United States. We\u2019ve also commenced an open season for the $500 million applied at a project. We have begun construction of the Cove Point with the fractio we lost Dominion Midstream partners at the lowest yield in the history of operating MLP IPO.","And finally we look forward to updating all of you on our long term growth strategy for Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners Analyst Meeting in New York with particular emphasis on both our potential earnings growth as well dividends for us. Thank you and we are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Michael Weinstein with UBC O\u2019Connor.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Actually, Julien here. So first if you could talk really briefly just focusing on the results actually quickly what is the normalize number you hear for 2014 just broadly speaking. If you were to kind of take out those weather impacts year-to-date?","Thomas Farrell","Weather is down about 4 to 5 times Julien so no to you today.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Gotcha. Excellent. And then secondly just broadly as you think about the opportunities before could you perhaps lay out a little bit time on here for your pipelines Atlantic and perhaps thought process about future pipes and opportunities across your footprint. I\u2019m thinking specifically here is there an opportunity to address Northeast basis given your coverage into that market as well.","We have crossed the pipeline business at Dominion East Ohio Dominion Transmission through the joint venture we now have Atlantic Coast Pipeline you get the Blue Racer joint venture all of them have multiple opportunity to expand the Atlantic Coast Pipeline itself is starting off 1.5 it can go to 2 but not very much additional work. The governors of West Virginia North Carolina a lot of people about very excited about the economic development opportunities having that new source of gas supply and reliability pool will provide those state. So those are all areas Marcellus and Utica we have lots of storage assets where potential farm outs exists. But I guess specifically your question about the northeast base one thing sooner or later form will make some decision about fracing in New York states obviously we don\u2019t know how that will come out.","We have a lot of asset in New York state but specifically Northeast Basin that would be difficult push for us I think really just to be frank about it, it\u2019s a long way from where we are and it would be difficult for us to compete other pipes. And they have a very difficult chicken and egg problem into England as everybody on the phone is aware. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a perfect example we have 20 year NGUs and contracts take or pay and that\u2019s sufficient for us to get a permit and just by the economics of the pipe and that\u2019s a difficult thing in the New England market to get that kind of assurance but pipeline operator. Hope that answers your question?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Yeah. Just hitting the Atlantic Pipeline more directly though as you think about when do you think you\u2019d get some comfort on getting that incremental half of subscription what are you looking for are there key RSPs out there that are kind of the incremental subscribers?","I wouldn\u2019t take out a particular date for you Julien but I think the pipeline won\u2019t come online until November of \u201818 to increase the capacity even between now and then just to take some additional compression. So there\u2019s lots to do and you have governors running around like crazy you got all these announcements in the European countries moving manufacturing slows the United States because of oil energy prices. And of course the other carbon role coming which shall be final in about eight months EPA has given every indication that they are going to issue not completing like summer. You get one year to file your steps so long people this pipeline comes off there is going to be a lot of clarity around the effects of getting from a card breakdown.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Tom on the Marcellus farmout you guys announced this quarter can you may be give little more color on how many more acres are expected you projects you guys have been considering in that bucket and then with this project in particular the 120 million over four years where is the cash flow the earnings from you guys beyond four years?","Tom Farrell","I\u2019ll let Mark can answer the question about cash flow and earnings after four years we still have the royalty payments after that time. But we have I\u2019d just say at this point Dan the farmouts today have been the Marcellus so that\u2019s one thing to concern we have not form about any Utica acreage which is below the Marcellus and the same acreage. And I think it\u2019s easier to just say thing where have we tens of thousands acreage across the system as far as this particular farmout Mark?","Mark McGettrick","Yeah, Dan I think we showed it on slide, $120 million in terms of lease payments, over the four year period or so, all of the farm outs we have and that we\u2019re looking at are structured in a similar manner where we\u2019ll get multi-year payments for the opportunity to drill in and around the storage. On top of that, we\u2019ll have an ongoing royalty payment based on a production coming out of the ground and our hope is that we\u2019ll also be able to gather, we\u2019ll have incremental revenues in gathering and depending on what region is potentially processing. But we see four potential revenue streams from it. We\u2019ll have it in fourth quarter here about a $0.06 benefit from the initial lease payment and that will continue to say for another three to four years.","Dan Egger \u2013 Credit Suisse","So you get $0.06 in the fourth quarter and then it will normalize after that one time uplift and then normal beyond that mark?","Mark McGettrick","I\u2019d assume in the last three years of contract for modeling purposes I\u2019ll spread it.","Dan Egger \u2013 Credit Suisse","I guess the next question is kind of on generation with 2019 [inaudible]. Where does that put you guys, as far as is this being added to keep up with demand or is it still working against your short capacity in Virginia?","Tom Farrell","Working against the short capacity.","Dan Egger \u2013 Credit Suisse","Tom your perspective changes in RPM rules, is there any motivation for you to look at may be accelerating that short position so that you can get out of paying capacity back to PJM because it\u2019s more expensive?","Tom Farrell","Dan we\u2019re always looking at these things. You can look at our IRP there\u2019s a variety of alternatives there. We\u2019re trying to balance the needs for reliability against the increased cost of our customers. I mean theoretically I think we probably could have built all three, we could have built Warren, Brunswick 2019 CC all at the same time and we could have justified that I think. I\u2019m sure we could have justified that. But that would have had a very significant impact on our customers. We try to balance it so that the impacts are reasonable.","Dan Egger \u2013 Credit Suisse","I guess one last question solar investments have gone pretty well in the outside. How are you guys thinking about that over the next couple of years, is it going to be accelerate or have you guys thought about expanding that program from what the original targets were?","Tom Farrell","We\u2019ve been looking very hard at solar and I think leave it, in February we will give you an update on our longer term strategy around solar. We have a lot of ideas what to do with it both in and out of our service territory, that we\u2019ll try to explain in more depth in February.","Dan Egger \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi, thanks. Dan asked my main question, but I guess just on the utility business. Could you just give us an update kind of the when you need to file your next Biennial and how you feel about your composition around the utility business?","Tom Farrell","Good morning. The next Biennial is due I guess it\u2019s March 30th how many days are there March, whatever it is, last day of March of 2015 and investment normal cycle when we make the filing and then the commission order I think it\u2019s by December 1st, \u201815. I remember at first we were \u2013 we did not over earn in the last Biennial Review, so you have the \u201813 \u201814 that will be reviewed year is not over, the two year cycles not over. We have had significant write-offs with the North Anna plant etcetera and very mild weather. But in order for there to be some base rate impact, you\u2019d have to over earn in \u201813 \u201814 cycle and the \u201815 \u201816 cycle. It has to be two consecutive Biennial Review.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Thanks. Good morning guys. Couple of questions, I was just running some basic math off of your earnings book, if we normalize for weather based on your disclosures you would have been I just want to make sure these numbers are right 269 at the Virginia Power weather normal for the quarter and that Dominion Generation you would have been 625? Those numbers sound right on a weather normal basis?","Tom Farrell","If you look at, I think that\u2019s in the range. Offline we\u2019ll get with you on the details for each of the business, Greg.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay, because I just want to baseline that as I look forward. And then my second question is on completely different subject, on the Atlantic Coast pipeline, we\u2019ve gotten some push back from people who cover E&P are saying the cost of transporting gas on that pipeline based on your costs looks really prohibitive relative to the cost of moving gas on other new pipeline projects, few other trunk mines for the producers. I know you say you\u2019re 90% subscribed but you\u2019re 90% subscribed by consumers. So how is the transportation cost of this gas going to be dealt with? Should we assume that the LBCs on the consuming end of the pipe are going to bear some of the cost of transportation if indeed, the producers can move the gas cheaper on other pipes?","Tom Farrell","Greg, I think the short answer is I\u2019d go back to a year whoever is giving you the pushback you tell them they really don\u2019t have much idea what they\u2019re talking about. It was very competitively fit pipeline, there were six bidders. The off-take contracts are from regulated utilities that some of them power generation, some of them local gas distribution companies all of which will be dealt with in the regulatory process. But it is a very competitively priced pipeline and the transportation costs are very competitive. Let Paul Koonce give you more detail.","Paul Koonce","Greg, I think one thing you need to recall is that this is straight rate design, so the variable costs to move gas, is essentially going to be the fuel cost. So when producers are looking at the net back transporting on this line it will be enormously competitive because the customers who have contracted for the capacity are really paying the demand charges, the producers aren\u2019t paying anything.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Gotcha. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Fremont with Jefferies and Company.","Paul Freemont \u2013 Jeffries & Co.","Thank you very much. I guess first question is just I guess simple math, if I take the $0.80 to $0.90, you\u2019re basically looking at an annual number that is going to be between, $3.39 and $3.49. I mean is that a current read for the full year?","Tom Farrell","I think that\u2019s a correct read.","Paul Freemont \u2013 Jeffries & Co.","Okay, because you\u2019re maintaining obviously a much wider guidance range and I\u2019m just not quite sure I understand why.","Tom Farrell","Yeah Paul, we have historically not changed our guidance range unless we were to fall outside of our guidance range which I can\u2019t recall that we ever have. So we always try to put a guidance range out in the way we feel comfortable in land-in and then the variables typically for us weather up or down or where you move in that range, and not know what the rest of this year would be weather wise we could move up or down in it. But we feel what we knew today and what the actual earnings were in the third quarter, then the $0.80 and $0.90 range was reasonable. Again weather can move that higher or weather can potentially move it lower, depending on how November and December turn out.","Paul Freemont \u2013 Jeffries & Co.","And then are you going to recognize any tax benefits from the close out of IRS past year audits in the fourth quarter and were those already recognized? It looks like in the second quarter you had a pretty good tax contribution.","Tom Farrell","Over the last couple of years, Paul, we have been very fortunate to have closed out a number of legacy IRS audits to our benefit most of that work is done. So I would not expect in the fourth quarter to have much of any benefit from incremental audit close out. We\u2019re almost caught up. We\u2019re actually working on 2013 all the legacy years and resolve the IRS. Again, I would assume that benefit would not be there in the fourth quarter as it might have been in previous years.","Paul Freemont \u2013 Jeffries & Co.","I\u2019m a little confused on whether the merchant generation margin is up or down because if you look at page 10 of your reconciliation for the third quarter \u201813 it looks like it\u2019s a penny positive but it\u2019s in your slide presentation it\u2019s a negative driver.","Tom Farrell","Yeah, quarter over quarter, it was higher than last year but it was slightly lower than what was in our guidance. So that\u2019s the difference between two references.","Paul Freemont \u2013 Jeffries & Co.","And do you have any thoughts on potential new build announcements in New England and have you looked at sort of generation yourself at a potential investment opportunity in New England.","Tom Farrell","No we have not. We got enough to do with our pipeline and our regulated utility business but I can see why others might be interested. But I think Paul it\u2019s outside our interest level at this point.","Paul Freemont \u2013 Jeffries & Co.","And last question for me, what was weather normalized growth at VEPCO?","Tom Farrell","For the quarter, for the year?","Paul Freemont \u2013 Jeffries & Co.","Year-to-date?","Tom Farrell","Okay. Weather normalized, 1% at VEPCO right where it\u2019s been tracking here for the past several quarters. We had a very solid third quarter and just kind of a quick synopsis of it. Residential has been very solid the whole year, commercial has been flat to slightly negative aside from data centers and industrial has been very solid so we feel really good about the 1% and again we see a growing improvement in sales as we go forward. I think year end we\u2019ll be right on that.","Paul Freemont \u2013 Jeffries & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning, guys.","Tom Farrell","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Question on what you\u2019ve been saying about the Analyst Day, on the September conference you said you would be talking about long term EPS and dividend growth and the MLP and just the strategy generally. And then I think on today\u2019s call I think I heard you use the word enhance the long term growth rate which I haven\u2019t heard you say before. So I guess my question is, does enhance mean firmer or does it mean potentially increase?","Tom Farrell","Well we\u2019ll talk about this more in February but as we\u2019ve looked at the cash flows over the past six months or so, that are going to be distributed out of the MLP we are very bullish both dividend and EPS growth rates and we\u2019ll expand on that more in February.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right. Thank you. That was it.","Tom Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good morning.","Tom Farrell","Good morning.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Just a few quick follow ups. On the demand side, there was an article indicating that there has been a delay of 60 days in an Virginia underground mine because of a difference it seems in terms of demand not a different but I guess there is a delay because I guess it seems that there is a delay because you\u2019re waiting for PJM to come out with its demand forecast in December and I guess there was some difference within your perhaps what the demand forecast might be in order to support the project. Could you talk about that little bit?","Tom Farrell","I\u2019ll let Paul Koonce will deal with that.","Paul Koonce","Yeah good morning Paul. We are aware that PJM every year puts out their forecast in December we\u2019re getting so closed to that time. Just to assure the community that our planting is solid. We\u2019re just going to wait for our forecast. We don\u2019t expect any change in plans so really it\u2019s just one we\u2019re so close. There\u2019s been a lot of community dialogue about that. We just want to move forward.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. I gotcha. Thanks for the clarity. Then in terms of being short and the capacity performance product that\u2019s been proposed, I haven\u2019t seen you guys specific comments on it and may be because I missed it, because there is so many comments. But how do you guys view that as basically regulated utility short that seems how do you look at those capacity performance product from the Virginia power perspective? Any thoughts about that in terms of, anything you can share about that from your perspective?","Tom Farrell","I\u2019ll let Christian handle that question.","David Christian","As you know that\u2019s a work in progress and we can certainly appreciate the efforts the PJM is undertaking to enhance the reliability in light of what happened during the polar vortex. That said, we\u2019ve been participant and stakeholder in that process and we believe that, PJM is receptive to some of the comments that we have made. I\u2019ll note that in our performance last year during the polar vortex was far better than PJM as a whole and anything they come up with it has to do with the operational reliability generation plays to our strength. So we look forward to participating in that process and we\u2019ll see what the outcome is.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","There was a proposal by some state to have an FRR carve out and I was just wondering with the amount of capacity that you guys have been adding and what have you, is that something you guys might think about or was it just too early to say?","David Christian","We look at the FRR carve out and we evaluate that but frankly as it relates to the 19cc we would see the exemption under self supply is more likely the option.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. I appreciate. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy your day."],"6981":["Dominion Resources, Inc.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. Instructions will be given after the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning, for the Safe Harbor Statement.","Thomas E. Hamlin - Vice President, Financial Planning and Investor Relations","Good morning and welcome to First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call for Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for email alerts and view our first quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are, dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also, on this call we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell, our CFO, Mark McGettrick, and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the first quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year 2016. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activity and review the progress we have made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, landing in the middle of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. Earnings drivers were as expected, with the exception of slightly milder weather, which was $0.03 per share lower than normal.","GAAP earnings were $0.88 per share for the first quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a charge relating to an organizational restructuring across our company made to improve the efficiency of our reporting structure. This one-time staffing charge will support lower labor expenses in the future. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule Two of the Earnings Release Kit.","Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the first quarter was $385 million, which was in the lower half of its guidance range. Kilowatt-hour sales were modestly below expectations, primarily due to mild weather. Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $610 million in the first quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses offset lower merchant margins and lower-than-expected kilowatt-hour sales at Virginia Power.","First quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $377 million, which was within the upper half of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses were the principal driver of the strong results. On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes were in line with our expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.","For the first quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $24.9 million, more than double the level produced in the first quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 71% to $20.3 million, which was consistent with management's expectations. Because of our strong cash position, we elected to accelerate certain planned maintenance activities at Dominion Carolina Gas that led to higher expenses in the first quarter that will not appear in future periods.","On April 19, Dominion Midstream's board of directors declared a distribution of $22.45 per unit payable on May 13. This distribution represents a 5.2% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.","In the next few days, we are planning to file with the SEC for an at-the-market issuance program for up to $150 million in DM common units. As a reminder, we do not need to access the markets to fund Dominion Midstream's 2016 distribution growth. However, should we decide to utilize this program, it would improve the trading liquidity of DM units, something that many of our investors have asked us about.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion. Funds from operation were $1.1 billion for the first three months of the year. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $3.1 billion. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities and, taking into account cash and short-term investments, ended the quarter with liquidity of $2.6 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.","Our public financing activities so far this year have included $750 million of senior notes at VEPCO and $550 million of junior subordinated notes which were remarketed at the Dominion Resources level. This remarketing was related to the conversion of common equity for the first tranche of mandatory convertible units issued in 2013. The remaining $550 million tranche will be remarketed later this quarter.","In addition, we raised $750 million of common equity through a block sale in April. $500 million from that sale has been earmarked for the Questar acquisition, while the remainder was for general corporate financing needs. We have a number of debt financing planned for the remainder of the year, including issuances at Dominion, Dominion Gas Holdings, and VEPCO. In addition, you should expect us to issue incremental mandatory convertible units to support the Questar transaction, as we outlined on our year-end earnings call.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.65 per share to $0.75 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.73 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are higher revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity expense and an increase in solar-related investment tax credits. Negative drivers for the quarter are a refueling outage at Millstone, a return to normal weather and share dilution.","Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share. Combining 2016 actual results for the first quarter with second quarter guidance produces year-to-date results that are $0.06 per share below last year's. Because of this shape to earnings, we want to highlight the earnings drivers in the second half of 2016 which will allow us to achieve our annual guidance range. Slide eight shows 2015's six months actual results of $1.72 per share and the $0.06 per share projected decline for the first half of this year, primarily due to last year's weather and this year's Millstone outage.","However, we have some very significant growth drivers the last six months of this year. First, we expect a return to normal weather, which will allow us to pick up $0.09 to last year's results. If you recall, the weather in the fourth quarter of last year was extremely mild. We also will not have a Millstone refueling outage this fall, which picks up $0.07 for us. The combined benefits of higher capacity performance revenues and lower payments to non-utility generators add $0.16 per share to year-over-year results. The majority of the benefit comes from passive performance (9:48) payments based on last year's auction results and will begin this summer.","Also, as we have said previously, we are constructing more solar projects this year, which produces an incremental $0.04 per share for the period. And, finally, our restructuring changes and normal growth produced $0.02 per share and $0.04 per share, respectively, of higher earnings for the six-month period. We hope this breakdown of our growth in the second half of this year provides clarity to achieving our 2016 guidance.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-April, we were hedged 93% of our expected 2016 production at Millstone and 8% of our expected 2017 production. Regarding Millstone, I would like to point out that multiple New England states, including Connecticut, have been discussing longer-term RFPs aimed at maintaining fuel diversity and environmental benefits. I do not want to speculate on the outcome of these legislative discussions, but we would be an active participant in any future solicitations.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.96 per share for the first quarter of 2016, which was in the middle of our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations and adjusted EBITDA was more than double to the level of last year's first quarter. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2016 is $0.65 to $0.75 per share and our operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued in the first quarter. Dominion was ranked number one in safety among electric utilities in the Southeast. OSHA recordables for each of our business units were roughly one-half the level recorded last year and last year had tied an all-time company record. In fact, excluding contract-related incidents, Dominion generation had zero OSHA recordables in the first quarter.","Our nuclear fleet continues to operate very well. The net capacity factor of our six units was 96.2% for the first three months of the year. The contribution of the Warren County Power Station helped our regulated power Generation Group achieve record net generation during the first quarter. North Anna Unit 2 completed a 512-consecutive day run when it came offline in March for its scheduled refueling. This breaker-to-breaker run was a record for the unit. As Mark noted in our second quarter guidance, Millstone Unit 3 is currently in a planned refueling outage and is on plan to return to service this month.","Now for an update on our growth plans. The 1,358-megawatt Brunswick County Power Station began commercial operations last week, completing a construction schedule that begin in August 2013 and was completed ahead of time and under budget. At the height of the construction, the Station had more than 1,500 workers on site. Brunswick Power Station is anticipated to have 43 employees and an annual payroll of about $7.5 million. In the first full year, the Station's operational fuel savings have been estimated to be nearly $100 million. Those fuel savings will continue over the life of the plant and the Station is expected to save consumers over $1 billion.","Development and engineering continues on our next-generation construction project, the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County three-on-one combined-cycle Power Station. On March 29, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the CPCN and rate rider for the Greensville project. Major contracts have been executed, including the combustion turbine supply agreement with MH Power Systems and the EPC agreement with Fluor. These are the same organizations that just completed the Brunswick County Plant located about five miles away. We expect to receive the Air Permit from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality by the end of this quarter. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018.","Construction on our two large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, continues on time and on budget. Dominion is currently overseeing the construction and both projects are expected to be in service during the fall of this year. Construction of the 80-megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore also commenced during the first quarter and is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of this year. The output from the Eastern Shore facility is under contract with Amazon.","We are also working on a number of regulated solar projects within the State of Virginia. A hearing on the Application with Virginia State Corporation Commission for the construction of three solar facilities within the state was held in March and a ruling is expected by July 1. If approved, these facilities totaling 56 megawatts would be in service by late this year. Today we will be filing with the State Corporation Commission for a CPCN for a 20-megawatt solar facility at the site of our Remington Power Station. The output from the facility will be sold to the Commonwealth of Virginia and Renewable Energy Credits will be sold to Microsoft, who will retire them.","We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. Three of these were completed in the first quarter, including Phase 1 of the Loudoun-Pleasant View 500kV Rebuild. We expect to place approximately $650 million of new transmission assets into service this year. An Application for Phase 1 of our Strategic Underground Program was filed with the State Corporation Commission in December. The filing, which includes a cost-benefit analysis, covers 400 miles of distribution lines to be converted by August of this year at a cost of $140 million.","Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point liquefaction project is approximately 64% complete and there are about 1,600 workers on site. Engineering is 99% complete and 98% of the engineered equipment has been procured. The project continues on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date.","We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. We made the formal FERC filings for these projects last September. In March, after extensive consultation with stakeholders, we provided information to FERC on a route alternative to address Agency and public input and to avoid more sensitive areas in the National Forests. Just this week, we received a Supplemental Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement as modified to include the reroute. This is a very positive development and we are pleased with our progress at FERC. We anticipate getting a FERC Order to allow us to begin construction by mid-2017.","Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. Material procurement is now over 70% complete and we expect to finish the construction contracts this quarter. We have modified the sequence of construction with our contractors. As a result, the modest delay in permitting will not delay the completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline or the Supply Header scheduled in late 2018.","We had one pipeline project go on line in December in South Carolina, flowing 45,000 dekatherms per day, and Western Access 2 went online in January with 450,000 dekatherms per day capacity. We currently have an additional 11 pipeline growth projects underway with $1 billion of investment to move more than 1.5 million cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. The majority of these projects are demand-driven, moving gas to end-use power generation for local distribution companies.","Turning to our farm-out activity. We have enjoyed significant success with our Marcellus and Utica acreage farm-out program, which began in 2013. Our current focus is on the portfolio of remaining Utica acreage packages and the prospect of restructuring of previously-completed transactions.","While many producers are pulling back near-term drilling plans, there remains significant interest in several areas throughout our farm-out program. We are currently in discussions with multiple parties and expect to again realize significant value later this year.","On March 31, Dominion filed its Base Rate Case for our North Carolina service territory, seeking approval of $51.1 million increase in Base Rate revenues based on a 10.5% return on equity. Most of the proposed increase is expected to be offset by reductions in the fuel factor and a two-year rider to refund excess deferred income taxes. Company has requested to implement the new rates on a temporary basis on November 1, with permanent rates to be in effect on January 1.","Finally, I want to update you on our pending merger with Questar Corporation. Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the Questar transaction was received on February 22 and their shareholder vote is scheduled for May 12. Merger applications were filed with the Utah and Wyoming Public Service Commissions and notice was provided to the Idaho Commission. Technical conferences were completed last week and discovery is underway. The Utah hearing is scheduled for August 22 and the Wyoming hearing is scheduled for September 14. We expect to close the transaction later this year.","So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and exceptional safety performance in the first quarter. The Brunswick County Power Station is now complete and in service ahead of time and under budget. The Greensville County Project has been approved and site preparation is underway. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. Construction on the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on-time and on-budget, and we are working towards a successful close from our combination with Questar Corporation later this year.","Thank you, and we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Sir, you may begin.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","As you didn't talk about or reiterate your near-term or long-term earnings growth aspirations. Can I assume that they all remain in place? And then, if so, over the last three months, four months, have there been any major evolutions in things that would be going in or going out of the asset profile or the margin profile that have changed relative to what you thought three months, four months ago?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Greg, this is Mark. I would say nothing in the last three months or four months. We still have the same targeted growth levels that we've talked about historically. But I would say that over the last six months or eight months, that power prices in the Northeast have been weak. We think they will recover as we move into 2017. But that's probably the one variable that's out there that has gotten more negative over the last six months or eight months.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And can you give us any sense of timing on the rest of the financing activity for Questar?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","It'll all be done between now and close, except for the DM equity which I think I said on the last call that we have, as part of our bridge financing, taken out a one-year term loan that is effective at close for up to one year that gives us flexibility to access the DM marketplace when we want. But the rest of the financing will be completed between now and close.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. That's all for me, guys. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So, a couple quick questions here. First, you kind of alluded to it already in the prepared remarks, but can you elaborate a little bit on Blue Racer opportunities? Where do you see that trending right now in terms of your quarter-over-quarter developments? Obviously, we've seen gas prices come back a little bit here.","And then the second question related. What about Wexpro? Are there opportunities to reinvigorate that investment plan, either because of pricing improvements or, perhaps more importantly, because of developments on the land side or what have you?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Julien, with respect to Blue Racer, Blue Racer continues along its plan. There haven't been any changes there. It's a very insignificant part of Dominion's earnings. But it's doing as anticipated and as we expected it to do this year and it's contributing as it should to the earnings profile.","With respect to Wexpro, we're going to reserve all of our comments on what happens with Questar and on what our plans are with Questar until after their shareholders vote and we have a chance to further our dialogue with their management team.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then unrelated, if you can talk about the renewables opportunity. Obviously you guys are trying to scale that in Virginia. But given the extensions, how are you speaking about deploying further, especially solar, assets in 2017 and 2018 as you think about any potential pressures on your earnings growth because of commodity, et cetera?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're looking primarily in Virginia, both regulated and, as we discussed in the script, a couple of different quasi-regulated opportunities have arisen. Now, we're looking actively there. As you commented, we're much more interested in solar than we are in wind. Wind is not a good asset in the territories where we do business for producing power reliably. Solar is better and we are continuing to look at 2017 and 2018.","So far with respect to all of our other growth projects, they're all on time and on budget or ahead of time and below budget. And we'll see how we go along through time and see if we're going to deploy any additional capital into renewable projects.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And last quick clarification. Next biennial review process, obviously you had the latest ROE outcome. When is the next time you could be called in?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","2023.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","If you could, I'd like to understand the $0.16 CP, Capacity Performance, driver in the second half. Can you just remind us \u2013 I think we talked about this before, but does that persist into 2017, like through the first half of the performance year? And then does it also persist beyond the 2016, 2017 year?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Jonathan, this is Mark. Obviously, we had a huge pick up on the Capacity Performance Auction, which we think a lot of people probably overlooked in both 2016 and 2017. The 2016 number on just Capacity Performance will be higher than it is in 2017, but when you combine that with node rolloffs, it will be about the same year-over-year. And if you add on top of that the Millstone capacity in 2017 over 2016, we will actually have an increase in our total income associated with capacity from 2016 to 2017 when you combine those three together.","But we were a very, very large beneficiary. And as you reference, year-over-year it's $0.16 for Capacity Performance. It's $0.14 in the last six months and there's about $0.02 worth of incremental rolloff of nodes in the last six months. That brings you to your $0.16 total.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So is there a roughly similar uplift in first half of 2017?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","On Capacity Performance specifically, the number is lower. But as I mentioned, if you combine all of our capacity resources, Millstone and node obligations, the number is actually higher.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. But then as you roll into the next capacity year? Sorry, I may have missed your answer here.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Remember how this capacity option works on PJM. You had to cover 60% of your load in the first year and I then think it was 70% of your load. So the opportunity on Capacity Performance will get smaller as you have to cover more of your load moving forward. So 2016 is the biggest year for that one single item and it starts to whittle down from there, but we're quite pleased with the result for us.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, Mark. And then you referenced \u2013 I think Tom mentioned at the end of his remarks there was a possible restructuring of one of the farm-out deals that you'd previously struck? Can you give a little more insight into what you're alluding to there, what form that might take?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We did one last year, Greg (29:06), and they could be a variety of different examples. Some of the cases, when we did the farm-outs, there were agreed-to drilling schedules. And, for example, if someone want to modify the drilling schedule, they would have to compensate us for that. So that's the kind of activity we're looking at. But the primary activity is in the traditional farm-out. We still have a lot of Utica acreage and we have a tremendous amount of interest in it.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, the restructuring would be a smaller item than hopefully entering into new ones?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","May or may not be. I wouldn't necessarily draw that conclusion, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wanted to dig into the Connecticut legislation and just first perhaps try to understand the next steps involved and then we can discuss a little bit more about how that would exactly function. But just next steps, what should we be looking for there?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the legislation you're referring to was adopted in the Senate and it has not yet been adopted by the House. I believe Connecticut Legislature finishes their work today. But I think this is a part of a dialogue that's going on all through New England and that's going to continue, it's going on in Massachusetts, it's happening in Maine, it's happening in New Hampshire, on how to deal with the carbon rules and existing carbon-free generation, which Millstone obviously is the largest asset in New England. It provides half of Connecticut's power when both units are operating in its normal operations.","And Connecticut has very little prospect of complying with carbon rules if Millstone were to shut down at some point. So I think the legislature, the political hierarchy in Connecticut is aware of that. We're following the legislation, obviously, closely. But I think it's part of an overall dialogue that will take place over the next few months in New England generally about how to protect these assets, of which I guess there are only two left that are still going to be running, Seabrook and Millstone, which is about twice the size of Seabrook.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. That's helpful. And in terms, is there a timeline in Connecticut through which we need to see either progress or resolution, i.e., is this fairly binary in terms of deadlines for passage or are there opportunities to hold, for example, I'm not sure, special sessions or you mentioned an ongoing dialogue? I'm trying to think through what milestones we should be looking for there.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's going to be an ongoing dialogue. They recessed or adjourned, whatever the right word is. They finished their work today.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And is it possible to have a special session or some other opportunity for passage at a later date, or when would the next opportunity be if it were to pass now?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's certainly always a possibility for a special session in any legislative body. But I would expect it to continue over into the next regular session of the Connecticut Legislature.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. I guess...","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Tom. Just to follow up on that last question, date \u2013 when is the next Connecticut legislative session? Is there still another one this year?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, they reconvene in January.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","January. Okay. And do you expect any legislation to get done today, or you don't think it's going to get done today?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I've been in my job long enough to never speculate on what's going to happen in the legislature.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But I know the same conversation's going on in Massachusetts.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And is their session still last for a while?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep, sure does.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Just to clarify, though, you mentioned looking at opportunities for long-term RFPs, fuel diversity, et cetera. So as the RFPs are currently structured, can you bid Millstone into any of them? Or is it all...","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Because I thought they only had to be new generation.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, it's renewables. As I understand the Connecticut legislation, it would be structured so that Millstone would be allowed to bid as a part of the non-carbon or renewable energy component to these RFPs components of these RFPs. It's quite...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...creative and, I think, appropriate. It is carbon-free and it's baseload, and they can't make their requirements without it.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And just to clarify, this has to be done through legislation. It cannot be done through Commission actions and things like that?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just one question on the \u2013 and I apologize on the detail on this -- just on the Capacity Performance, so (34:47) to make sure I understand this. So your Virginia generation is getting Capacity Performance on all the generation. But in this year, you only have to buy out 60% Capacity Performance from your Utility. But as that 60% goes to 100%, then they'll match up and there won't be a benefit. But there's a benefit from that mismatch. Is that correct?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Hey, Steve. This is Mark. That is almost correct. The assumption, though, that you get the benefit for all of your generation is probably not correct. Each company would have to make a decision on how much they wanted to bid in that generation against their Capacity Performance and hedge their risk for any units that might not perform. So, we made that analysis and based on the generation we bid in covering our load requirements at 60% in the first year, that excess is the benefit that I referenced.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And going back to the first question on your growth rates and targets and all that stuff. So you're reaffirming 2016, but in terms of the growth rates that you I guess re-mentioned when you announced the Questar deal, are those still good or are you wanting some of these pieces to come together before you reaffirm them? I just want to make sure I'm clear what you're communicating.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","They're still good.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, that was close. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good start to the year.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Two things. One, I notice you all took about a $70 million pre-tax charge related to severance. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there and what your plans are company-wide in terms of O&M, what's embedded in guidance?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Hey, Michael. This is Mark. The program that was referenced was really an effort across all the businesses and the corporate support areas to drive decision-making to a lower level, eliminate layers of management, increase management control and make the decision-making really more efficient by having those fewer layers. So that was the focus. We took a charge of about $70 million pre-tax. I think it's $43 million after-tax. And those labor costs will be recouped as the employees move on and so you'll see a full year's benefit in 2017 and a partial benefit in 2016.","In terms of ongoing O&M, we're targeting a flat to CPI growth on O&M going forward. It will probably be different year-by-year and the only thing that would change on that of significance would be the outage period for Millstone, we might have two outages versus one in a given year. But I look for us and for you to model a flat to CPI growth on O&M going forward.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And real quick, can you talk about what was weather-normalized power demand for Virginia Power in the quarter and how does that differ versus your expectation?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Sales weather-normalized for the quarter were down about a little over 1%. We have an annual expectation of a 1% positive sales growth for the year. We still feel pretty good about that. So that was a net for the first quarter. April seems solid and supporting the 1% growth. And we had actually pretty strong growth in all sectors but residential.","I would add, as I always do on sales, is when you're coming and comparing to a very significant weather season, we had a very strong first quarter of 2015 on weather and a light 2016, and so the weather normalization process is not penny accurate. That's why we think 1% growth is still a good assumption for us. Also recall at 1% growth year-over-year, it only equates to about $0.04 a share or $0.05 a share for us.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Mark. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And I apologize, but Michael (39;52) to a certain degree. The ODI, it looks like there's a $0.02 benefit in the second half of this year. How should we think about that going forward?","And in general, the expense \u2013 I'm sorry, the organizational design initiatives and how should we think about the expense associated with that, the one-time or do you think you might see more of that going forward? Or how should we think about those things?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Hey, Paul. This is Mark. No, I don't think you should think about additional programs going forward. We took a one-time charge, as we always do with a non-reoccurring event, and disclosed that. And we showed on a breakdown on Slide 8 that we would expect to see lower operating expenses in labor due to lower the staffing levels of about $0.02 this year for the last six months of the year. And I would expect to see probably $0.04 or $0.05 next year, which is supportive of the growth rate that we have out there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And that's it. Actually all the other questions were asked.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning's teleconference.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow, if you would like to ask a question.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning for the Safe Harbor statement.","Thomas E. Hamlin - VP Financial Planning and Investor Relations","Good morning and welcome to the second quarter 2015 earnings conference call for Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for email alerts and view our second quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast, estimates and expectations.","Also, on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the earnings release kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the second quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2015. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we have made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.73 per share for the second quarter of 2015, which was near the top of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Weather added about $0.01 per share to earrings relative to guidance, while lower operating expenses contributed about $0.02 per share.","GAAP earnings were $0.70 per share for the second quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was the charge associated with future ash pond closure costs. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on schedule two of the earnings release kit.","Moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the second quarter was $374 million, which was in the middle of its guidance range. Kilowatt hour sales were above expectations due to slightly warmer-than-normal weather. Excluding weather, year-to-date sales growth was about 1.5%, above our expectations for the year of about 1%.","Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $546 million in the second quarter, which was also in the middle of its guidance range. Favorable weather in utility generation and lower operating expenses in merchant generation were the contributing factors to the strong results.","Second quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $285 million, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Positive drivers were lower operating expenses and higher gas distribution margins. On a consolidated basis, interest expenses were in line with our expectations, while income taxes were at the upper end of our guidance range. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.","For the second quarter of 2015, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $19.9 million and distributable cash flow of $19.3 million, all consistent with management's expectations. On July 17, Dominion Midstream Partners' board of directors declared a distribution of $0.1875 per unit payable on August 14 to unitholders of record on August 4. This distribution represents a 7% increase over the last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP shares.","On April 1, Dominion Midstream acquired Dominion Carolina Gas Transmission from Dominion Resources. We do not expect to drop anymore assets into the partnership this year to reach our projected fourth quarter annualized distribution rate of $0.85 per unit. However, we continue to actively seek acquisitions to support DM's future growth. Interest by other parties has been active and we are optimistic of additional transactions this year. As we have said in the past, any acquisition would have the same regulated earnings profile DM has today and not carry with it commodity risk.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion, funds from operations were $2.1 billion for the first six months of the year. Commercial paper and letter of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $2.7 billion. We have $4.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash and short-term investments, we ended the quarter with liquidity of $2 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the earnings release kit.","In the financing area, we concluded our public equity needs for the year after raising approximately $500 million through the sale of 6.8 million common shares during the first and second quarters. We accessed the debt markets on two occasions during the quarter with senior note offers. In May, Virginia Power issued $700 million in two tranches, half for 10 years and the other half for 30 years. In June, Dominion issued $500 million of three-year notes. We plan to come to the market with another parent company debt issue, as well as an issue for Dominion Gas Holdings later this year.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.95 to $1.10 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.93 per share for the third quarter of 2014. Positive earnings driver for the quarter compared to last year are a return to normal weather and higher revenues from growth projects.","Negative drivers for the quarter are higher operating expenses and share dilutions. Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.50 to $3.85 per share. As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 27 of the earnings release kit. As of August 1, we have hedged 94% of our expected 2015 production at Millstone and 60% of our expected 2016 production.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.73 per share for the second quarter of 2015, near the top of our guidance range. Favorable weather and lower expenses were the principal factors of our strong performance.","Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And, finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2015 is $0.95 to $1.10 per share. And our operating earnings guidance for the full year remains $3.50 to $3.85 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Our strong operational and safety performance continued in the second quarter. Year-to-date, OSHA recordables for each business unit are ahead of or are consistent with their respective targets for the year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our six units was 95.4% for the first six months of the year. Our Power Generation group also performed well with record net generation and net capacity factors during the second quarter.","Now, for an update on our regulatory activities. On March 31, in Virginia, we filed our review of earnings for 2013 and 2014, showing an earned return of 10.13%, which was below the top of the allowed range of 10.7%. Intervenor testimony was submitted last week and we expect to receive the commission staff testimony next week. Hearings will commence in September and we expect the commission order by the end of November. Neither our base rates nor the allowed rate of return are subject to change in this proceeding. The biennial review process will resume in 2022 covering earnings for the calendar years 2020 and 2021.","We filed our annual Integrated Resource Plan in Virginia and North Carolina on July 1. The filing identifies and evaluates a mix of supply side and demand side resources needed to meet customers' needs at the lowest reasonable cost while considering future uncertainties, including the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which was, of course, only in draft form at the time of the filing. Obviously, earlier this week, we saw the final rule.","We're encouraged by some of the changes made to the original proposal and are evaluating our options to help Virginia comply with the new regulations. It is clear, however, that the plan will require significant new investments in generation and electric transmission in our Virginia service territory as well as many new opportunities for all aspects of our gas infrastructure businesses.","Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,358-megawatt combined cycle facility in Brunswick County was about 75% complete through the second quarter. There are approximately 1,475 workers on site. Construction of the air-cooled condenser is 93% complete and installation of major equipment continues for all combustion turbine units. Facility is on-time and on-budget for a mid-2016 commercial operation date.","A request for a CPCN and Rate Rider for the proposed 1,588-megawatt Greensville County project was filed July 1. If approved, this three-on-one combined cycle facility is expected to achieve commercial operation in December 2018. In January, the company filed for a Rate Rider and CPCN for a 20-megawatt solar facility at our Remington Power Station. This project is the first step in our plan to invest $700 million to build 400 megawatts of utility scale solar projects in Virginia. If approved, the facility will be in service by late 2016.","Since our last call, we placed five contracted merchant solar projects into service totaling 81 megawatts. Another 90 megawatts have been acquired or are under construction for completion this year. In addition, we acquired a 50% interest in a 320-megawatt solar facility under development in Utah. Our plan to grow this portfolio to 625 megawatts by the end of 2016 is in place. We'll provide more details on our plan to sell down of our merchant solar portfolio next month at the September investor conferences.","At Dominion Virginia Power, we have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the second quarter, $315 million of transmission assets were placed into service, bringing the year-to-date total to $514 million. Electric transmissions capital budget for growth projects, including NERC, RTEP, maintenance, as well as security-related investments will average over $700 million per year through at least the remainder of the decade.","Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well for the 4 billion cubic feet per day of projects underway. We have previously announced nearly 2 Bcf per day of producer outlet projects, designed to relieve congestion and move Marcellus and Utica's gas out of the basin. Five of these are now in service and the four remaining will be in service by the end of next year.","As we complete the producer outlet projects, we have seen a significant increase in demand in both traditional LDCs and new gas-fired generation projects as coal plants move to retirement or conversion. We expect these trends to continue as gas supplies continue to grow from the Marcellus and Utica basins. We're presently developing over 2 billion cubic feet of demand side or market-based projects. Seven of these totaling $600 million a day are expected to be in service by the end of 2017.","Looking forward, there is strong interest for further customer-driven projects throughout our service area, including in our newly-acquired Dominion Carolina Gas Transmission system at Dominion Midstream Partners. And we expect to be in a position to give additional details later this year. The Clean Power Plan will greatly enhance those opportunities. We're continuing to work towards the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project.","We began the FERC filing process last November and expect to make the formal filings in September. Surveying is about 80% complete and engineering is about 70% complete. We awarded the large diameter pipe manufacturing contract in January to Dura-Bond Industries of Pennsylvania and expect to award small diameter pipe contract in August.","Construction bids were received in May. And we expect to conclude negotiations by the end of the summer, well ahead of our original project plan. We plan to begin construction on both projects in the fourth quarter of 2016 and commence operations in November 2018.","Now, an update on our Cove Point liquefaction project. Overall, the project is approximately 31% complete and is on-time and on-budget. Engineering is nearly 90% complete and approximately 85% of the engineered equipment has been procured as of the end of the second quarter.","So, to summarize, our business delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter. The Brunswick County construction project is proceeding on-time and on-budget. We continue to work toward a formal filing with FERC for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Projects next month. And construction of the Cove Point liquefaction project is continuing on-time and on-budget.","Thank you. And we are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. On the DM M&A opportunities for this year, I guess, a) what are you seeing as far as receptivity of sellers and some pressure on kind of the yields space with the MLPs or the YieldCos? And how do you guys feel about issuing equity on DM right now to supplement an acquisition at this moment?","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Dan. This is Mark. We've had a lot of interest from a number of parties in terms of assets that would fit nicely within a DM portfolio. If any of those transactions were to materialize between now and the end of the year, we do not expect issuing any equity associated with those \u2013 any public equity associated with those. And, again, I've mentioned in the script that we will be sure to focus on only assets that have a very stable, regulated, long-term earnings stream. But we are excited that people really like the DM currency. And I think there may be greater value with the DM currency than what their current earning streams are within their assets.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, Mark, that means you would cash fund them from what they have available or you would be giving your equity to the seller of the assets?","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It could be both.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right. Tom, can you talk a little bit about kind of thoughts on CPP now that it's made its the land of final and how you guys see that affecting both the IRP and Virginian, maybe some of the ongoing investments in gas generation and solar and that sort of stuff?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dan. Obviously, it's a very complicated rule. It's interesting to take a look \u2013 you have to really look at it state-by-state. I'm sure you know that and all those folks listening. So, to make broad generalizations about it, I think, is a mistake. I think you need to look at how each state \u2013 how they have \u2013 what levels they have to comply with, what their existing mix is.","Example, if you look at the Southeastern states and the Midwestern states, where our pipeline assets are as well positioned as any, there are others well positioned, but I think ours are well positioned as any or better. Gas-fired power will be able to meet the needs with the latest emissions targets \u2013 the rates that were published in the final rule. So we're encouraged by that. I think that's a good news \u2013 opportunity for our infrastructure businesses.","We're going to take a hard look at the IRP. I'd say our Greensville County plant, for example, will clear all these hurdles. It provides tremendous customer benefit \u2013 most customer benefit we've had of any of these projects, truly an outstanding opportunity. We will be looking hard at solar. The renewable and energy efficiency parts of the rule are slightly convoluted with the way the timing works.","If you're looking at a potential gap, I think, in incentives to build renewable, once the tax production did not \u2013 the investment tax credits expire, at the end of next year \u2013 for example, solar, if you start building after your status filed a final plan, which is going to be well after most likely when the tax credits expire, then you can start earning these double credits, but only in the years 2020 and 2021. And then the ability to earn the credits expires. You can't earn them in advance of 2020.","So all the folks that sit in rooms like we're in here today are going to be looking at, well, when do I \u2013 if I'm going to do this, when do I do it? When is the best for my customers, at least a solution to my customers? So I think people will have to be thinking through all that, state-by-state. You could have a couple of years there where there is a lack of incentive to build renewables when compared to waiting. So that's a long answer, probably longer than you want. We're looking for \u2013 it's a complicated rule. All of us have a lot of work to do. And we will be reassessing our IRP. But, as you know, we file it every year. So, it's not like it's stagnant.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess one last one, just on the non-regulated solar sales. You updated those in September. But are you seeing a wavering interest from prospective parties, given what the YieldCo space has done recently?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Quite the opposite.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Wait for September. Thank you, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. It's Julien.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So, perhaps a little bit to follow up on a related question. Just be curious, in terms of the general partnership, how are you thinking about potentially monetizing that in a more attractive manner? And I'm just curious, what is your reaction to what you've seen out there in the marketplace of late and recent months, following some of other companies pursuing new angles here?","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Julien, it's Mark. We think our GP is extraordinarily valuable. It grows in value every day as we get closer to major drops in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Although there's been some good valuations on GP sales down the road, we think that value should move into both the DM and to D stock as we give more and more clarity on that. So, we are not looking to do anything different with our GP except to hold it at Dominion as we grow the entity.","In terms of the MLP sector in general, it appears that some investors have shown concern based on recent transactions around change in business practice or at least change in philosophy on their business mix. DM will not go that way. DM is going to stay with what we told investors in February. That we have a great dropdown story, regulated assets, very firm earnings. And if we decide to acquire anything, it will fit that same portfolio.","Also, it looks like that folks that had to issue equity as part of a transaction have not been treated too well in certain circles. So, again, we do not expect to have any market equity issued for any potential transaction from DM to make sure that we're focused on growing that entity and growing value for both DM unitholders and D shareholders.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","I'd be curious just in terms of some recent pushback on the undergrounding project in Virginia, just be curious what's the latest there in terms of potentially trying to re-file that project or next steps more broadly?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We're taking a look at the commission order. I'm confident we will \u2013 they asked for some more cost justification. There is a lot of cost justification. We don't anticipate any difficulty with that. It's a new statute, new proceeding. So we'll take a look at what they want us to file and then we'll file it and proceed from there. I don't expect any issue on it in the end.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Great. Well, thank you, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Group","Thanks. Sorry to harp on the same subject as some prior questions, but one of the other things that seems to have happened in the MLP\/YieldCo space is investors rightfully focusing on transaction valuations in terms of the long-term IRR for the LP holder and not just the dividend growth accretion that comes from those transactions.","And they're sort of been punishing both the GPs and the LPs of companies that look like they're not disciplined financially. So, can you please go over what's the financial metrics you look at in terms of when you look at a drop, when you look at an acquisition, what are the hurdle rates for IRRs and accretion that you hold yourself to?","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, Greg, I'm going to give a general answer to that, because we're not going to disclose what our internal financial rates are. But, as we look at any transaction on DM, we'll look at is it positive to the discounted cash flow metric, is it positive in terms of long-term IRR, is it positive in terms of strategic long-term value, is it positive in terms of can we operate it more effectively potentially than the current owners. And anything we do on DM is going to, again, fit, I think, the structure that our unitholders are interested in.","And our focus would be, if we did acquire, it allows us to keep the backlog that we have and grow it even more from the $1.7 billion post-2020 that we've already identified. And so, those are kind of opportunities we're looking at. I think the Carolina Gas Transmission acquisition fit all those parameters that I outlined for you. And I think if we have any announcement in the future in terms of acquisition, it will meet the hurdle rates that people are expecting or exceed those and be well received.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Group","Thanks. And I know that the focus of the company appears by \u2013 to be creating shareholder value through the continued growth in the midstream of pipeline businesses, but there does continue to be consolidation of the utility industry. So, on the utility side of house, are you still opportunistically considering expanding the regulated utility footprint? And if the answer to that is yes, what are the criteria that you're looking at there?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Greg, I don't think we've ever said that we were opportunistically looking to expand our utility franchise. In fact, I'm quite certain that we've never said that in the 10 years I've been CEO. All we said is that we have been \u2013 we are interested in assets for Dominion Midstream Partners that fit the criteria that Mark mentioned. I think we are perceived as a management group and a broad of directors that exercises financial discipline. And that's the way we will continue to perceive. But we've never said we're looking around for an electric utility.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Group","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You have Chris Turnure for Jeremy. One quick question on CGT. You guys, I guess, recently did a pre-filing for $120 million extension. So, I guess, looking at the current plan and the current operations at CGT, how that's running relative to your plan at the time of the acquisition?","Paul D. Koonce - Executive Vice President","This is Paul Koonce. The filling was part of our due diligence process. So, it really fits right in line with our expectation. We did go out for solicitation of interest in June, just to kind of pulse the community down there, to find out what the interest was in additional gas service. And that response was good. So, we hope to add to what was already an existing portfolio of spread.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","This is Mark. Let me add on to that. Obviously, from initial expectation on CGT, the cash flows have been better than what we anticipated, one reason that we confirmed earlier that we didn't need to drop anything else in 2015. And so as \u2013 only being associated with that entity for five months or so now. We're very pleased with the way it operates, very pleased with the growth potential that it has. And, again, we believe that there is more opportunities to improve the cash flow coming out of South Carolina than what we've initially anticipated in January.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. That's it from me.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Angie, go ahead with your question.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm sorry. Just to go back to the Dominion Midstream. So you mentioned that you would be pursuing some \u2013 actually pursuing acquisitions even later this year. Now the fact that you're not going to finance them with equity, should we imply that those are not going to be big acquisitions? I'm basically trying to figure out if there is a way to accelerate the IDR payments to make the increased cash flow from this entity more visible to Dominion shareholders? I understand that you've created the structure to actually create value for Dominion shareholders. And I think we're still waiting a little bit for the recognition of the value creation.","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Angie, this is Mark. (31:14) in terms of size would be material to DM, what we're looking at, but not material to a D balance sheet. So our focus really is what assets are out there that may fit our portfolio that would allow us to continue to build our backlog long-term and stay and support our 22% distribution growth. We do not anticipate advancing any drops to do that. This would just be a matter of it fits the profile, has good future growth, but they \u2013 I would say they would not be significant in terms of size is what we're \u2013 from what we're looking at right now.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Now, separately on the Cove Point expansion, can you comment if there has been any movement on your long-term contract supporting that entity, like any attempts to negotiate contracts given the lower LNG demand worldwide?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","No.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","That was easy. So, lastly, some of the strengths in your second quarter earnings have to do with cost efficiencies. I see that you're showing increased operating costs as a drag on third quarter results. So should I imply that this is just a timing of O&M?","Mark F. McGettrick - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think that's a fair representation.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. The Utica details that you used to give, you don't have. And I'm just curious maybe at a high level you can give us an update on your kind of what you're seeing in the Utica, which seems like it's pretty good.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steve. Paul Koonce will provide that.","Paul D. Koonce - Executive Vice President","Good morning, Steve. Yeah. In past calls, we've kind of provided the state level kind of number of permitted wells, drilled wells and producing wells. And just looking at that information since February 9, the number of permitted wells are up 202, the number of wells drilled are up 231, the number of wells producing are up 200. So we still see a lot of activity in Ohio. And really what we're starting to focus on are really the five counties that Blue Racer really serves: Guernsey, Belmont, Noble, Monroe and Washington counties. And if you look at permits statewide, they look like they're leveling off. They're still issuing permits leveling off. But if you look at these five counties, they're continuing to increase month-over-month. So we see that as positive.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just maybe at a high level comp, is it \u2013 given the continued growth in your kind of core areas, I mean, should we expect further maybe new project, new CapEx plan in the midstream gas when you do your update?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Steve, we've got a lot of things we're working on. And we'll do our best to make sure we give you as much clarity as we can in the fall.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a few quick ones remaining here. Just the coal residuals, the one-timer, are we finished with that do you think? Is that sort of one and done with respect to -","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it's two and done.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","All right.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","We've reserved some in December, I think, Paul. And then we've spent a lot of time through the last six months looking at \u2013 we need to keep this in context, of course. We don't have \u2013 there are many other of our colleagues in the industry have a lot more of these ponds than we do. We do have some ponds. We will deal with them. We've fine-tuned it. We don't think it's that significant of an expense, but, obviously, significant money. But we're going to clean them up in compliance with all the EPA regulations. So that's a long way of saying, yes, we believe that's all we will have to do.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. Then the SUP order, the strategic undergrounding thing, last week the order \u2013 the last part of it sort of mentions that although it's not included in their analysis for denying the application, they mention sort of an overall rates \u2013 the context of overall rates for customers. So they say it's not part of their (36:11) doing this, but basically they draw attention to it. So what my question is \u2013 question is basically how do you look at the rate impact that we're seeing here? I know you guys are very cognizant of these rate impacts for customers and CapEx and what have you. How do you look in terms of general about the Clean Power Plan, everything going on here, what the rate outlook might be for customers?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Paul, thank you for that question. We spend a lot of time looking at not only \u2013 take, for example, the IRP. We gave five or six different approaches depending upon we were sort of guessing \u2013 educated guesses of what the Clean Power Plan would look like. And we'll obviously take another look at it. But cost to our customer is a paramount thing for us. We spend a lot of time looking at that. We pace things as a result of that.","Now if you look at the gap that we still have for producing our own generation, if you're went back five years, we could have justified building two or three of these plants all at one time to meet our customers' needs. But we didn't think that was the appropriate way to deal with rates. We start from a very strong position. We're 20% below the national average in rates. We're among the lowest on the East Coast. We have one of the lowest industrial rates in the entire country. So we work very, very hard at keeping really strong operations, particularly in our generation fleet, to keep cost down, reliability for our customers. As these things go along, we take into account all through that process. I don't find it remarkable that a commission would say that they're concerned about rate pressure. I hope that all commissions are concerned about rate pressure.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then just finally on Dominion EDGE with the Clean Power Plan and what have you and other initiatives. I know you guys have done some rollouts here. How is that gone? And do you see any additional opportunity there?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","EDGE is a \u2013 just to remind everybody is a software product that we developed here \u2013 we have multiple patents on \u2013 that does voltage control in real-time instantaneous information and can be verified. The cost savings can be verified through a separate process. So, quite a few utilities co-ops have adopted it and are in the process of installing it. There are a lot more looking at it and some very large ones. So I think the Clean Power Plan \u2013 they got rid of the energy efficiency as one of the methods but they still give you some incentives, of course, if you wait till 2020.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","It sounds like the Clean Power Plan could lead to some additional growth opportunities. Any sense on whether Virginia will submit a state implementation plan, file a lawsuit? And then maybe you can just touch on whether we're looking at a regional approach or state specific?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Our Governor McAuliffe, I think, pretty sure I read, has already stated that they intend to \u2013 the state of Virginia will file a state implementation plan. He's said that before as the EPA was going through it. So, I wouldn't anticipate any lawsuits from Virginia. And, obviously, we will be working with the governor's environmental quality people along with our reliability regulators to help get make sure they have all the information they need to form the best plan for Virginia.","So, a lot in the growth. We're definitely going to have to do a lot more in Virginia, but there is a lot of growth that's also going to happen in the gas infrastructure businesses. People talk about renewables being built and they will be built. But, as you all know, you have to backup all those renewables with gas-fired power plant. So, we think there is a lot of opportunity. And if you look at it state-by-state, the region where our pipeline operates, gas will work.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And then just lastly in Atlantic Coast, are we still comfortable at 1.5 Bs per day or are we still \u2013 is there an opportunity to upsize that?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","It's signed up for 1.5 now. And I think we've said previously that it's easy to expand it to 500 a day just by adding some pressure. So, we're still obviously in the pre-filing process but we'll file that formally next month.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. And then just lastly on DTI. Is there any opportunity to potentially drop down DTI sooner than 2018 or is there just some covenants on the debt that will not allow you to?","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","There are issues around debt, but we have no intention of \u2013 I don't think we've ever talked about DTI before anytime. It's out in the future. What we're talking about dropping right now is Cove Point, the Atlantic Coast pipeline, Blue Racer and all times to \u2013 when necessary to meet the 22% distribution growth rate that we have been meeting so far and will meet over the balance of this period.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks a lot.","Thomas F. Farrell ll - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning's teleconference.

McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion\u2019s operating earnings were $1 per share for the third quarter compared to our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. The contribution of the TL-388 pipeline to Blue Racer originally planned for the fourth quarter, added $0.07 per share to third quarter earnings. Even without this gain, earnings for the quarter would have been near the top of our guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expenses, lower income taxes and lower interest expenses offset the impact of mild weather and lower merchant margins.","Mild weather reduced earnings for the quarter by about $0.04 per share and lower than expected margins from our merchant generating plans reduced earnings by another $0.03 per share. Weather adjusted kilowatt hour sales for the quarter include about 1% compared to last year.","Year-to-date residential sales are up about 1%. Data center sales are up 13% and industrial sales are up 2.1%. However, sales to commercial customers are flat and sales to governmental customers are down about 1.8% for the year. We continue to study these results and we will update our expectations along with our 2014 guidance after the first of the year.","GAAP earnings were $0.98 per share for the quarter. The difference between third quarter GAAP and operating earnings is driven primarily by charges related to the repositioning our producer services businesses. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to results by operating segment. Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the third quarter was $241 million, which was slightly below its guidance range. For electric distribution, kilowatt hour sales were below expectations due to milder than normal weather.","EBIT at Dominion Retail was at its lower end of its guidance range due to customer attrition and lower volumes for polar [ph] customers. Third quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $289 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. As I mentioned earlier, the date for the contribution of the TL-388 pipeline was moved to the third quarter from the fourth adding about $75 million to EBIT. Other factors contributing to the strong results at Dominion Energy were lower operating and maintenance expenses and higher transportation and storage revenues.","Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $579 million in the third quarter, which was below its guidance range. Milder than normal weather led to lower sales and lower ancillary service revenues for utility generation business, lower than expected margins from a merchant generating plants were also a factor. Lower operating and maintenance expenses helped to partially offset some of these negatives. On a consolidated basis, our effective tax rate was 33.3% for the quarter compared to a 35.5% rate for the midpoint of our guidance range.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities, funds from operations were $2.8 billion for the first three quarters. Regarding liquidity, we\u2019ve $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper, and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $2.1 billion and taking into account cash and short-term investments, we ended the quarter with liquidity of $1.6 billion. During the quarter, we extended the terms of all of our credit facilities for 2018. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 26 of the earnings release kit.","Now, moving to our financing plans, in September we announced the formation of Dominion Gas Holdings, a first tier subsidiary of holding company for most of our regulated natural gas businesses. Dominion Gas Holdings provides greater visibility of the capital structure and earnings from these businesses and allows us to raise capital on better terms.","Debt ratings for the new entity were A3 from Moody\u2019s, A- from Standard & Poor\u2019s and BBB+ from Fitch. Because of the structural subordination caused by the new issuer, Standard & Poor\u2019s reduced its rating on Dominion senior unsecured debt from A- to BBB+. There were no changes to Dominion ratings by Fitch or Moody's.","In October Dominion Gas raised $1.2 billion to a 144A senior notes offering consisting of 3, 10 and 30-year notes which are expected to be registered with the SEC next year. We also raised $585 million for Virginia Power in August. These issues were very well received by the market and we thank those of you who participated. We do not anticipate assessing the capital markets for additional financing this year.","In September, we announced that we plan to form a MLP next year using the expected cash flows from Cove Point import and export and the Blue Racer Midstream joint venture. We are likely to file the S-1 during the first quarter and come to the market around the middle of the year. The MLP structure including the partnerships and incentive distribution rights is expected to create significant value to Dominion shareholders over time.","Now to earnings guidance. We are updating our fourth quarter earnings guidance to reflect the transfer of the TL-388 pipeline to the Blue Racer joint venture during the third quarter. We now estimate operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 within the range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. Let me walk you through the drivers of the $0.21 increase from last year's fourth quarter to the midpoint of this year's range.","To remove the unique items from last year's $0.69, we subtract the $0.08 per share from last year's initial asset drop into Blue Racer. Then we add that $0.05 per share of weather hurt from last year and about $0.10 per share due to last year's refueling outage at Millstone. A significant portion of the operation and maintenance expense reductions we discussed early in the year is expected to show up in the fourth quarter, adding another $0.05 per share.","The next step on the chart shows our normal operating earnings drivers which includes sales growth higher rider revenues and earnings from Blue Racer and our gas infrastructure projects. And finally we note the loss of $10 million in anticipated earnings from our producer services business largely offset by the exploration of the Millstone generator tax.","Our operating earnings guidance for 2013 remains $3.20 to $3.50 per share. Operating earnings for the first three quarters of 2013 was $2.44 per share. Adding the midpoint of the range for the fourth quarter to the year-to-date earnings will take you to the middle of our guidance range for the entire year.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 28 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call, we have increased our Millstone hedge position from 80% to 83% for 2014 and from 58% to 71% for 2015. We have also begun hedging for 2016 and now have 11% of projected output hedged.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1 per share for the third quarter compared to a guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95. Lower operating and maintenance expenses, lower interest expenses and lower taxes all say $0.04 per share weather hurt and lower merchant generation margins. Also the contribution of the TL-388 pipeline to Blue Racer during the quarter added another $0.07 per share.","Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013 is $0.85 to $0.95 per share. Normal weather, the absence of a Millstone refueling outage and reduced expenses should drive the higher year-over-year results. And finally, our operating earnings guidance for 2013 remains $3.20 to $3.50 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Good morning. Each of our business units achieved year-over-year improvements in operations and safety performance in the third quarter. Year-to-date net capacity factor of the six Dominion nuclear units was 93.8%. Our power generations with utility fleet achieved a third quarter peak forced outage rate of just 2%; its best in three years. Power generations utility combined cycle fleet had a peak forced outage rate of just 0.9$; its best on record.","We continue to move forward on our growth plans across all business units. Construction of the 1,329 megawatt Warren County combined cycle plant is progressing on schedule and on budget for our late 2014 commercial operation date. Overall, the project is about 60% complete and about 1,400 people presently employed at the site. We have begun construction of a 1,358 megawatt 3-on-1 combined cycle facility in Brunswick County and expect the plant to be in service by mid 2016.","Gas and steam turbines have been procured. The agreements with the gas transportation supplier have been signed and pipeline permitting is underway. The conversion of the Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell plants from coal to biomass are progressing on schedule and on budget. The Altavista plant is placed into service in July. Hopewell is in the last late stages of commissioning and Southampton achieved first fire on biomass during October. Our three projects will be operational later this year.","At September 10, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the company's CPCN application to modify the existing Bremo Power Station's unit 3 and 4 to use natural gas instead of coal as the primary fuel. The station outage has started. The EPC contractor is on site and Columbia Gas of Virginia is installing the necessary pipelines to supply gas to the facility. The station will commence operations on natural gas next summer.","The United States Bureau of Ocean Energy Management conducted a lease auction in September for acreage off the Virginia coast for potential wind power development. Dominion was awarded the leases of 113,000 acres based on its bid of $1.6 million. We are working with the Department of Energy on a possible test facility as well. Should the State decide that pursuing offshore win would be in the public interest, Dominion is prepared to construct a project subject to Board approval. We are not interested in pursuing offshore win on a merchant basis.","We are developing a 14.9 megawatt fuel cell project in Bridgeport, Connecticut secured by long-term power purchase agreement. As of September 30, the project was 79% complete with four of the five modules mechanically complete and operated. The project is scheduled for completion by yearend. We also have three solar projects secured by long-term power purchase agreement under development in Georgia, Indiana and Connecticut that are scheduled for completion later this year.","Finally, after receiving court approval we completed the sale of our Brayton Point and Kincaid power stations and our interest in the other power stations, Energy Capital Partners on August 29. We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the third quarter, $108 million of transmission assets were placed into service bringing the year-to-date total to $546 million. Our plan includes new investments of over $500 million per year in growth projects through at least the end of the decade, including the systematic rebuild with 500kV loop that is the backbone of our transmission network.","We're also participating in the bidding process for a number of competitive transmission opportunities in PJM. In June we submitted three proposals for the Artificial Island project in New Jersey ranging from $114 million to $180 million. We also submitted three proposals to PJM to reduce congestion at the AP South interface while addressing our growth plan for Dominion Energy also continues.","Two projects at Dominion transmission were recently completed and placed into service. Both the Sabinsville to Morrisville and the Tioga area expansion projects were completed on plan and on budget. Construction continues on the Allegheny Storage Project. We expect to be ready to accept injections next spring and be fully operational by November 2014.","The Natrium to Market Project received FERC certification in September. Construction will begin in the spring, were expected November 2014 in service day. We continue to pursue other new GAAP infrastructure opportunities. In September we announced the Marcellus farmout initiative, which involved nearly 100,000 acres of Marcellus right below some of our West Virginia storage fields. We have retained all other mineral rights.","Today we're announcing that we\u2019ve reached agreements with multiple counter parties involving that acreage, which will involve a series of new revenue streams over the next decade. One party which will hold the majority of this acreage expects to commence drilling next year. We expect these agreements initially to generate EBIT of approximately $20 million annually from ongoing lease payments. Additional revenues will approve from the drilling activity itself and also from royalty payments based on the volume of gas produced.","Associated with the farmout project, Dominion Transmission also recently held an open season for transportation service from West Virginia to it's interconnects with other state -- with other interstate pipelines in Mullet, in Clarington, Ohio. The party who holds the majority of position in the farmout acreage will be an anchor shipper and we're in negotiations for additional capacity. We will have more to say about this project in the coming weeks.","In the third quarter, we announced several new pipeline expansion projects. In August, the senior [ph] agreements were signed with Brooklyn Union and Niagara Mohawk for our new market project in New York State. Expanded service of 112,000 dekatherms per day for 15 years will begin in November 2016. We also announced the Western Access Projects on our Dominion East Ohio System. It involves the transportation of 300,000 dekatherms per day from third-party processing plant\u2019s to interstate pipelines.","In addition to these pipeline expansion projects, we\u2019ve had continued success in providing incremental transportation agreements as a result of the growing production within our region. We describe these projects as Producer Outlet Projects taking advantage of the flexibility of Dominion Transmission pipeline network to provide incremental services with shorter lead times and minimal capital investment. In the last several months DTI has signed an initiative service for 200,000 dekatherms per day of these Producer Outlet Projects with multiple counterparties. We believe we will continue to see additional success in these projects in the coming months.","The Utica region continues to be very active. Through October, the total of 953 horizontal Utica permits have been issued, 597 wells have been drilled which is an increase of 21% in wells permitted and 54% in wells drilled in just the past three months. The number of producing wells increased by 50% from 113 to 169 in the past three months as well. The management team at Blue Racer is actively marketing gathering and processing services to the producers in the Utica region. There are currently two new processing plants under construction, Natrium II and another at Berne. They\u2019re scheduled for completion in the spring and summer of next year respectively. Each of these facilities will have processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day.","Blue Racers Natrium I processing and fractionation plant has been out of service since September 21, due to a fire that damaged the small area of the plant. Producers have been able to redirect significant volumes to other processing plants in the area including Dominion\u2019s Hastings plant. Repairs have begun and the plant is expected to be back at full capacity by late January.","As Mark mentioned earlier the TL-388 pipeline was contributed to Blur Racer at the end of September. This will serve as a central trunk line that provides further connectivity between Blue Racer\u2019s gathering lines and key producing acreage. Blue Racer\u2019s management is finalizing multiple agreements in the Southern Utica region with the potential for 150,000 to 200,000 acres to be dedicated to the joint venture, which should be more than enough at full production to support both the Natrium Phase II and Berne processing plants.","Of recent interest, in mid October, CONSOL announced its gathering services agreement with Blue Racer. PDC Energy has also announced that Blue Racer will provide midstream services for PDC in the Southern Utica. We continue to make progress on our Cove Point Liquefaction Project. As you know the Department of Energy proved our request to permit the export LNG to non-FDA countries in early September. We still need several permits including our FERC environmental permit and permits from the State of Maryland. Subject to these regulatory and other approvals, we expect to commence construction in the first half of 2014 with commercial operation expected in late 2017.","Before we open the call for questions, I want to give an update on the 2013 biannual review. Hearings were held in September, and briefs have been filed. A decision from the commission is due by the end of this month.","So to summarize, our businesses delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Warren County power station is proceeding on time and on budget. Construction is begun on the Brunswick power station. Our Blue Racer joint venture, Dominion East Ohio and Dominion Transmission are all capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the Utica and Marcellus Shale regions. And we look forward to receiving our remaining regulatory approvals to begin construction of our Cove Point liquefaction project.","Thank you, and we\u2019re ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Greg Gordon with isigroup.com.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","Thanks guys. How are you doing?","Thomas F. Farrell II","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","I\u2019ve got two questions. The first is; it looks like industrial demand in the third quarter started to improve across most of the regions you disclose in your earnings release. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing with regard to the industrial demand, but specifically but more \u2013 overall demand and whether you think you\u2019ll get back closer to what your prior sales growth forecast were sort of pre to shutdown as we get into next year?","Mark F. McGettrick","Hi, Greg this is Mark, I\u2019ll take the first one there. In terms of industrial demand for the quarter we were up about 7%, but I would describe that as more of an anomaly. It was one customer that gave us increased sales there year-over-year. However, year-to-date on industrial we still are up about 2%. So we see industrial load building for us. We got a good quarter beyond that one customer and we like industrial sales based on original forecast.","But let me kind of give you a rundown of where we're in sales for the third quarter and then year-to-date and what we\u2019re expecting currently. For the third quarter our residential sales were down about 1%. These were all weather normalized numbers. Data centers were up almost 14%. Commercial sales however were flat as we said in our opening remarks, industrial sales up about 7% and governmental sales about flat. So on a year-to-date basis, we\u2019re slightly less than 1% up across our mix, that\u2019s been fairly consistent for the three quarters now. We\u2019re going to monitor this for the fourth quarter as and see what it looks like based on Federal budget approvals and other commercial activity and we\u2019ll talk in January about what we think the longer term growth rate is. But I would encourage everybody as they think about sales for us, even at 1% if you finish the year at 1% we would have one of those strongest growth stories I think of any of our peers, so most of our peers, anyway.","And as you look at our growth going forward, sales are just one of the pieces of our growth. We have very strong uplift based on riders both in our gas business and our electric business and generation. We have very strong growth in our energy business, midstream, in our forward transmission business, and then we have sales growth in mainly Virginia Power. So again, year-to-date we\u2019re a little less than 1%. It's been consistent for three quarters, we will see what it is for the fourth and then we\u2019ll talk on a longer term guidance per sales in January.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","Okay. My second question is around Dominion Energy in the gas infrastructure projects, you list a bunch of things you\u2019re working on, on Page 11. Does your current CapEx budget or any of these specific projects specifically target new long haul pipeline capacity to take gas outside of these flooded regions we're seeing in Pennsylvania or if that opportunity were to avail itself without being incremental to your current capital forecast?","Paul D. Koonce","Hi, Greg. This is Paul Koonce. Included in the list of projects is not what we would call necessarily a long haul pipeline extinct [ph]. The new market project up in the New York State is going to take gas out of Pennsylvania and West Virginia and take it up into New York State. What we have literally been focused on here recently or what we call these producer outlet projects which really gets the producer's gas, other interstate pipelines that take the minimal amount of capital, they take the shorter lead time and we believe that over time, those contracts are anyway from call it three to seven years and we believe that over time that as those producers get connected to us that that will lead us to doing longer term, longer line pipeline in the coming months.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Good morning.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","On the Marcellus deal, can you just help us think about I guess a, how the scaling of that royalty payment in the earnings contribution will go over time? Is it a volume metrically linked and is there some sort of gearing to production we should be thinking about?","Thomas F. Farrell II","That is four revenue streams that come out of us. The first is lease payments which we've given you a number for. The second would be a payment for the drilling activity itself. And third will be a royalty payment which is volumetric. And then the fourth will be the transportation agreements that come out of it. So at this point the only thing we are prepared to give a number on is the lease payments that we'll continue throughout the balance of the lease period. The rest of it will depend on some timing and with the royalties itself is on volume.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","I got it.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Four different revenue streams that will continue out into the future.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Then I guess you also talked about kind of looking into the Marcellus properties and exploring the idea of a joint venture to kind of capitalize like you did Blue Racer. Any updates on thoughts with that strategy now that you have the underlying acreage contracts in place?","Thomas F. Farrell II","We are always considering options like that and not just obviously in the Marcellus and not just in West Virginia.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","So the answer, you're not going to talk about it.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Not any further than I just did.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. Then I guess Paul, can you just give\u2026","Thomas F. Farrell II","Yes, the shorter answer.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. Paul, can you talk about what have you seen in the regional market right now as far as margins and kind of volume competition and if there's any sense of that business stabilizing at this point?","Paul D. Koonce","Sure. It is as you commented, it's a very, very competitive business. We have always run retail as a profit business so we are constantly looking to \u2013 the mix of customers both by state as well as by site to maximize that value. The volumes if you looked in the kit on Page 21, you'll see that the electric volumes were down for the quarter. But that really has to do with a small number of provider of last resort agreements that we had this time last year that we don't have this year because they weren't profitable to continue to serve. So I think as we move through time when you look at customer accounts and you look at volumes, depending on whether you have a provider of last resort contract in there or not will cause the number to either be inflated or to be less. I think as we see these coal plant retirements, I think you have some large merchant fleets that are participating in the aggregation of business and I think as you have coal plant retirements, we think this business will stabilize and grow for us.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Got it. I guess just maybe one more on kind of the MLP outlook. When do you guys expect to or maybe give us some more color on sizing of which assets are going at upfront and then maybe some of the GP splits and how that will get structured within Dominion from an earnings potential perspective?","Mark F. McGettrick","Dan, this is Mark. Unfortunately I think we're going to have to pass on that question until we file the S-1. We have a clear path forward that we think will add significant shareholder value, but until we file that we'll not be able to talk about many of the details around this structure.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay, got it. Thank you, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Thanks. I noticed that with the processing plants including sort of Natrium I but also the follow-on facilities that there is sort of delays in terms of getting these plants on line. Can you sort of just discuss what is it that sort of is slowing down this schedule? And do you still think you can do two processing plants a year or can you do more?","Thomas F. Farrell II","I'm going to let Paul Koonce answer your question. Paul, I'm not sure where you're seeing a delay in projects because I don't think there's a delay. So we can answer that maybe for you offline but Paul can talk about\u2026","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, I think that as it relates to Berne and Natrium II, I mean that's equipment is ordered. Natrium II is already on site. I think Tom mentioned that we expect those facilities to be online spring and summer. So that work is going very well. As it relates to others, of course the Berne and Natrium II are just processing facilities. They are not fractionation facilities. They will use the fractionation capacity that we have in Natrium I. So as it relates to the work that we're doing through Blue Racer, the equipment's ordered. It's fairly straightforward construction process and we expect to bring that online back to the first of the year.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Should we still expect roughly to a year in terms of new processing?","Paul D. Koonce","Yes. I think when you look at the acreage where we're sitting especially in the West Utica and Southeastern Ohio, I think the plan is to continue to add a couple a year. And as I said when we're looking at processing, we're looking at pretty much a skid amount type of equipment, so that shouldn't be a problem for us.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Can you discuss the reason for the lower tax rate than what you guys were expecting for the year?","Mark F. McGettrick","Paul, this is Mark. Yes, I can and we talked about this over the year couple of years really. We have some legacy IRS audits that went back 8 or 10 years that we have been very methodically closing out and settling with the IRS. And we can't predict really what the outcome might be. In the third quarter we had success in settling the 2010 and 2011 audits and because of that, we had a benefit on some issues that were in dispute and so those audits now are closed. So we're almost current on these legacy audits. We'll be current through 2011 by the end of the year. But this has occurred over the last three years by our tax proof taken a very proactive approach of catching up and going \u2013 current going forward. So that's the reason for the rate change.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Last question from me on your second quarter call you had indicated that you were going to dropdown to TL-388 on the fourth quarter. What caused you to move that earlier than what you had sort of suggested back in August?","Thomas F. Farrell II","It was ready. As we dropped it down, we had some maintenance to do on that pipe and it was ready in the third quarter. The joint venture wanted it as soon as they could get it because it's key to marking that area and moving gas, locking in these producers and because the facility was prepared to be dropped, there was no reason to wait and we took it in the third quarter.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Hi. Good morning. Just a question regarding I guess the Natrium II and Berne as well as the farmout and potential investment there. How should we characterize those relative to kind of your overall CapEx plan that you've given, are these things that kind of implementing the plan or are these something that would be kind of incremental or additions to it?","Thomas F. Farrell II","Steve, good morning. I would put them in the category of implementing the plan other than this potential of a longer term, larger pipe that we are working on. That's not in our plans but the rest of these are supportive of the 5% to 6% growth.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. And I guess, this new farmout plan, I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about potentially recreating Blue Racers in other regions. Is this kind of, were your own version of Blue Racer in other region as there are still more of that kind of stuff that\u2019s possible?","Thomas F. Farrell II","I would say, to answer your question is yes and yes. What we have done in with these customers and we will \u2013 there will be announcements downstream about who they\u2019re and implementation and all that. But the way we\u2019ve developed the thing now, there is also a processing rights, that\u2019s something else that will be dealt within the future. That could be possibly done by us our -- we could do that ourselves or we could do that in a joint venture. That\u2019s still -- that part we\u2019ve the rights to the processing and whether we do it ourselves or with our partner is something we will continue to work on. And then we have a lot of assets in West Virginia and Pennsylvania that are not covered by the Blue Racer joint venture that we\u2019re considering.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Quick question on Blue Racer and could you just -- I apologize if I recall this correctly, but remind me what the time frame that you\u2019ve laid out for reaching equilibrium is range and then may be an update on just how you -- how that\u2019s progressing?","Mark F. McGettrick","Jonathan this is Mark. We\u2019ve always said we thought we reach equalization in 2014. I think we\u2019re well on schedule to do that.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thank you. And then just on a number -- I'm having trouble on the cash flow statement just reconciling the asset sale gain number of $118 million that pops up this quarter with the size of the $0.07 on the dropdown gain. So what else is in that number? What other gains were there? Was this related to the merchant gen perhaps and therefore below the line. I\u2019m just curious there.","Mark F. McGettrick","I think Jonathan, I don\u2019t have the schedule right in front of me. But I think the reference probably there is to the gain on the sale of the merchant assets Brayton Point, Elwood and Kincaid, which was transact and concluded in the third quarter.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So I was guessing that\u2019s what it would be -- sort of just a follow-up on that, you\u2019ve said I guess in the -- when we took a charge in fourth quarter you said it was based on the bids you had for those assets? And then -- so why would there been that meaningful again on the -- when the sale actually came to close?","Ashwini Sawhney","Hey Jonathan, this is Ash. The impairments or charges are recognized sooner or rather than later. So we\u2019ve recognized those charges up front. Unfortunately you cannot recognize a gain till it actually occurs, so that\u2019s what trigger the gain recognition when the sale actually took place.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Mark F. McGettrick","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So first and again I apologize if you can\u2019t quite answer this. But when you think about the creation of the Dominion Gas subsidiary, the way you structure the business now? How do that relate to the MLP structure, if you will. And I suppose specifically if you could, does it relate to dropping individual assets out of this into an MLP or you talking about potentially structuring an MLP that would buy stakes of this Dominion Gas business. I understand it\u2019s touchy, but whatever you can provide will be helpful.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Julien, the -- for the present people should be thinking about what we\u2019ve said which is at present what we\u2019re looking at is placing Blue Racer and Cove Point import and Cove Point export into the MLP and how exactly we\u2019re going to do it, when exactly we\u2019re going to do it, we will have to wait on that. The balance of the assets that are in the Dominion Gas Holdings, we will put there so that we would have transparency and visibility on the earnings that come out of the gas infrastructure business, because we didn\u2019t think they were being high as fully as they could be in the markets, but it's up to you all to decide that. We didn\u2019t think they were, so we thought it would be helpful to the financial community to see exactly what they produce. Those assets are eligible largely, eligible to be contributed to an MLP in the future, and that\u2019s a decision that remains up in the future. But the reason why we created that was to allow people to see exactly what the earnings are that come out of our gas infrastructure business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And as a follow-up if you don\u2019t mind; the utility assets, Hope Gas and East Ohio; is this an opportunity to drop into an MLP and perhaps if you could clarify around, is it utility itself or is it some of the gathering assets associated with it?","Thomas F. Farrell II","Those are, there\u2019s very technical issues around what can be put into an MLP and not. Hope Gas, I don\u2019t believe is eligible and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever listed it as a potential. There are assets in East Ohio. East Ohio Gas is much more than a traditional local gas distribution company. It has very large gas storage holdings. It has very large pipelines. It has gathering systems. So it's a different animal. So there are portions of it that would be eligible. But that\u2019s all off in the future. But hope, I don\u2019t think anybody in our team here think that Hope is a eligible asset.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the clarity. And then last on the government shutdown; can you just at least provide a little bit of preview as to how to think about that here?","Thomas F. Farrell II","Well, I think there are two issues. One is the sequester and it's budgetary implications and then the other is the shutdown, which was a short-term phenomenon that it\u2019s actually most of the people still went to work, they just weren\u2019t getting paid. But they\u2019re getting paid twice now, so they\u2019re getting paid retroactively. So the sequester is a bigger -- is a longer term issue and we will have to see how this conference committee works it's way through that ticket and which they -- we believe they will do by the end of the year and that will give us little more clarity on what we, how we view what the sales growth will be.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Just back on the Marcellus format, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this; what's the timing do you think of the -- of getting the lease payments? 1when would that start?","Thomas F. Farrell II","This quarter.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, Paul this is Paul Koonce. So we\u2019ve actually entered into agreement. So the option payment will start now \u2026","Thomas F. Farrell II","Lease payments.","Paul D. Koonce","Lease payments will start now and they will accrue over the -- over a preset drilling schedule that we have with the counter party.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay; and I would think that the incremental capital cost will be probably pretty low from your perspective. Am I right about that or is there additional cost that you have to put into this kind of a deal?","Paul D. Koonce","No, the counter party will provide all the capital for the drilling. So we get an override, a small override based on the production, but it's all their CapEx. Now we have had an open season to provide the transportation capacity out of the basin, that will be our capital we\u2019re working through that now, and I think as Tom said in his remarks there\u2019ll be more to come on that in the coming weeks.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay, great. And then on the competitive electric transmission opportunities and the congestion; compared to the congestion opportunities that apparently are on PJM you guys apparently sort of are selecting just a few, and I\u2019m just wondering do you think there might be additional opportunities for you in that area? Just in general when you\u2019re looking at your market outlook in PJM, what do you think the potential is for some of these market congestion fixes could mean to wholesale markets in PJM?","Paul D. Koonce","Well, this is Paul again. If you look at just PJM generally over the last two or three years, congestion is down substantially based on all of the electric transmission construction that has occurred. So, when you look at congestion projects in order for them to qualify they have to more than offset the congestion expense, and I believe that factors by 1.5 times. So the project has to be very innovative to overcome that hurdle. We bid on three different scenarios in AP South using the series capacitor banks [ph] which we've used on our own system which lowers and seasons which allows greater capacity flows and that has capitalized the very efficient way to deal with that. Now we have also modeled the balance of PJM to see what effect our project and AP South will have more generally on the larger PJM footprint. When we did that we didn't see that there were other projects that necessarily would meet the hurdle with PJM pass for congestion. So we are constantly monitoring how this will play out. Of course coal plant retirements will be a big part of that. But to-date what we have out there we think is very creative. We have not submitted others but we're watching it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","When will we find out about the results from your proposals? When will we figure out whether they're selected or not?","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, this is what PJM is calling a pilot year to try to implement per quarter 1000. So I would expect that PJM is going to move very deliberately and very cautiously to make sure that whatever recommendations they come up with are good. And so for that reason I wouldn't expect that we will know probably until after the first of the year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay, great. Then just back on Kincaid and Brayton, that's finally over right in terms of the impairments that you guys are still incurring from that, correct?","Thomas F. Farrell II","That's finally over.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hi, guys. Really two questions. One, when you think about the long-term earnings growth, the guidance you've given on that, have you ever broken or can you break that out between kind of what do you expect Virginia Power's long-term earnings growth potential to be? And then how do you kind of combine that with what you think the long-term earnings growth power of the energy business? Just trying to get an order of magnitude maybe not even kind of a hard numbers around it, but just directional?","Thomas F. Farrell II","Mike, we haven't broken that but we could. It's clear enough. And on that recommendation, we'll go ahead and look at doing that in the future.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay. One kind of cash flow statement. What are you thinking about the difference between GAAP and cash taxes, like how much of a benefit will deferred tax benefits be fourth quarter 2013 and then as you look out to 2014 and beyond?","Mark F. McGettrick","Mike, we don't have the answer to that question online. We'll follow-up with you after the call.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Sounds good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you.

On the call today, we have Tom Farrell, CEO, and other members of senior management. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the conference over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations for Safe Harbor statement.","Thomas Hamlin","Good morning, and welcome to Dominion's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.","During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings release and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit our website, register for email alerts and view our fourth quarter 2011 earnings documents. Our website address is www.dom.com\/investors. ","In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will guide this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed from the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our fourth quarter and full year 2011 operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2012, as well as our operating earnings before interest and tax, commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliations of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we were able to calculate and report are contained in our earnings release kit.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick, and other members of our management team. Tom will begin with a review of the progress we have made on our growth plan in 2011 and our outlook for 2012. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the fourth quarter, as well as our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2012. We will then take your questions. ","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell","Good morning. For Dominion, 2011 was a year of significant accomplishment. Across our business units, our employees delivered improved service quality in nearly all areas of operations, and in most cases, with record-setting safety performance. We completed several major capital projects in our strategic growth plan and made significant progress in the construction of several others. We also worked to secure the contractual commitments and regulatory approvals necessary for the next round of projects that should sustain our growth plan for the foreseeable future. ","We delivered operating earnings per share within our guidance range in the face of a sluggish, yet improving economy, weak commodity prices and mild weather, particularly in the fourth quarter. Shareholders were rewarded in 2011 with a total return of 29.4%, which exceeded the returns for most of our industry peers as well as the overall market. ","Our strategic growth plan consists of investments in new infrastructure in all of our regulated lines of business. At Dominion Generation, it involved the construction of new generation to reduce the existing capacity deficit of Virginia Power to meet the expected growth in demand from our service territory and to replace the generating capacity that is being retired, in order to comply with new EPA regulations. ","At Dominion Virginia Power, it involves the modernization of the 500 kV loop that has been the backbone of our electric transmission system, as well as upgrades in new service lines to support demand from new customers, including data centers, and to maintain reliability to portions of our service area affected by generation plant retirements. ","At Dominion Energy, it involves the construction of the gathering, processing and transmission infrastructure that will be needed to facilitate the natural gas production from Marcellus and Utica Shale formations. It also includes the systematic replacement of much of the pipeline network at Dominion East Ohio. All told, this plan involves about $11.6 billion of new plant investment and identified projects over the next 5 years, providing the foundation for our 5% to 6% expected growth in earnings per share beginning this year, which we again affirm today. ","2011 was a year of significant progress at Dominion Generation. Construction of our 90-megawatt Bear Garden Power Station was completed on time and on budget. The plant began commercial operations on May 23 and had a 126-day continuous run. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over 95% complete as of the end of last year and is on schedule for commercial operations by the middle of this year. This $1.8 billion project is also on time and on budget. ","Our next large-generation construction project is the Warren County three-on-one combined cycle plant, which is expected to provide approximately 1,300 megawatts of capacity. The CPCN Rider applications were filed with Virginia State Corporation Commission last May, and the hearing was held last month. An order from this commission must be issued no later than next Thursday. If regulatory approvals are received, construction will begin this spring. And the plant should be completed by the end of 2014 at a cost of roughly $1.1 billion. ","We expect to file the Warren County project with a similar size combined cycle plant for completion in mid to late 2016. This plant was identified in our 2011 integrated resource plan and will be necessary to offset the reduction in capacity caused by the retirements of older coal-fired units at our Chesapeake and Yorktown power stations due to the HAPs MACTs [ph] rule from the EPA. ","Local conditional use permits have already been obtained for potential sites in Chesterfield and Brunswick Counties for the proposed facility. We will make a determination on a specific site this quarter and expect to file for a CPCN and rate rider with the commission, either late this year or early next. ","Other growth projects at Generation include the conversions of older coal-fired units to burn other fuels. We plan to convert Units 3 and 4 at our Bremo station from coal to natural gas. The company issued an RFP for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract for the project last quarter and expect to file a CPCN request with the commission this summer.  We are also converting 3 of our smaller coal units to burn wood. The hearing for this conversions was held in December, and we expect the commission order in March. If approved, work on the $165 million project should be complete next year. ","Dominion Virginia Power completed 2 large 500kV transmission lines during 2011. The Meadow Brook to Loudon and Carson to Suffolk lines were both completed on time and on budget. Work began last year on the modernization of the Mt. Storm to Doubs line and will be performed during the spring and fall of the next 3 years at an estimated cost of about $350 million. Our electric transmission project pipeline contains over 40 additional projects totaling about $600 million per year or at least each of the next 5 years.","Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its own growth program in 2011. Construction of the $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer, and the project should be in service by September of this year. FERC approval for the Northeast expansion project, as well as Ellisburg to Craigs was received in the third quarter of last year. Both projects are expected to be in service by November 2012. ","Last year, we announced the Natrium processing project. Construction has begun on Phase I, which is fully contracted and is designed to process 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and fractionate 36,000 barrels of NGLs per day. Phase I should cost about $500 million and should be in service by December. We are in detailed negotiations with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase II at Natrium, which would be in service by the fourth quarter of 2013. ","With the continued successful development of the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, interest in our potential Cove Point liquefaction project is growing as well. We are engaged in discussions with numerous potential customers in Europe and Asia, as well as producers in the Appalachian Basin. On October 3, we filed for approval to export up to an equivalent of 365 Bcf per year for 25-year term to non-free-trade agreement countries. Our filing supports our belief that the project will have many positive economic benefits, and we are hopeful for DOE approval later this year. ","I will now turn to operating results for the year, beginning with safety.","Both Dominion Generation and the Dominion Energy reported record or improving safety performance. Fossil & Hydro generation completed a best on-record incident rate of only 0.33 for 2011, well below their previous record of 0.62 set last year. Our nuclear business unit had only 5 OSHA reportables in 2011, yielding an incident rate of just 0.12, its best on record. Both Dominion East Ohio and Dominion Hope also had the fewest number of OSHA reportables in their history. ","At Dominion Virginia Power, hurricane restoration work contributed to an increase in both OSHA reportables and lost-time, restricted-duty incidents. However our transmission business went 165 consecutive days without an injury. Our service company has best year ever with only one OSHA reportable. Safety continues to be one of our core values at Dominion, and we are pleased with our improvement. ","Moving to operations, our generating plants performed well last year. Our Fossil & Hydro utility fleet achieved a net forced outage rate of 3.8%, with our large coal units surpassing their previous record with the rate of only 3.18%. The peak season equivalent availability of 96% was the highest in the last 3 years. The overall capacity factor for our nuclear fleet declined from just above 90% in 2010 to 85% in 2011. ","Several natural events contributed to the decline. A tornado last spring touched down in the switchyard at our Surry plant, and an earthquake that shook the entire East Coast caused both North Anna units to be offline for about 80 days.  Capacity upgrades for 3 of our 4 nuclear units at Virginia Power have been completed, and the final upgrade of 21 megawatts at North Anna Unit 1 will be completed during its refueling outage this spring. ","Dominion Virginia Power had a challenging year in 2011. Hurricane Irene resulted in the loss of power to almost 1.3 million customers. The second-largest restoration effort in company history was completed in less than 9 days at a cost of about $108 million. As compared to Hurricane Isabel in 2003, approximately 2\/3 the number of customers were affected. However, restoration was completed in half the time and about 1\/2 the cost.","Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. In July, we set a new record system peak load of 20,061 megawatts, exceeding the previous record, which had been set in August of 2007. Additionally, PJM's updated forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that includes Dominion service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years, or an increase of nearly 4,000 megawatts.  Unemployment in Virginia is just 6.2%, well below the national average of 8.5% and is actually only 5% in populist Northern Virginia. ","Weather adjusted sales at Virginia Power were up 1.6% for 2011, and actually 1.8%, if you exclude the impact of Hurricane Irene. Our estimate for weather-normalized sales growth in 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power, with data centers continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth. ","For Dominion Energy, development activities by producers in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions continue to grow, providing the foundation for the infrastructure projects that are a key component of our growth plan. In the fourth quarter, there were 51 new horizontal Utica well permits issued in Ohio, more than doubling the number in effect at the end of the third quarter. 10 different producers have permitted Utica wells, up from 7 at the end of September, and 6 of those producers are currently drilling. Actually, every single Utica well online in the state of Ohio is tied into the wet gas gathering system at Dominion East Ohio.","Producer activity in the Marcellus and Utica formations is occurring despite low natural gas prices due to the economic value of the liquids contained in the gas stream. Our Hastings extraction plant achieved an all-time record reliability factor of 99.3%, leading to an all-time record fractionation volume of over 180 million gallons of NGLs in 2011. After a binding open season held in early November, DTI executed precedent agreements with 3 of the customers at Phase I at Natrium to transport 185,000 decatherms per day of firm transportation from Natrium to Texas Eastern. You can expect a number of announcements related to various DTI growth projects over the course of this year. ","Our regulatory calendar was also fairly active last year. The first biannual review on the Virginia's re-regulation statute took place in 2011. The State Corporation Commission issued its order on November 30, determining that earnings from Virginia Power's base rate revenues produced an earned rate of return on common equity in excess of 12.4% in order to refund to customers $78 million. Furthermore, the commission set a return on equity to be used in the second binding review of 10.9%, which under Virginia's law allows the company to earn up to 11.4% before triggering any potential refunds or rate reductions. We are seeking clarification from the commission as to whether the new rate will apply to the entire 24-month period covered by the second review, or whether the new rate only became effective as of the date of the commission's order as all of the parties had agreed to in the settlement agreement from the going-in rate case. ","Our GAAP earnings for 2011, which comprises 1\/2 of the next review period, were significantly below the authorized level due to write-off of the value of our coal units that are being retired, restoration costs related to Hurricane Irene, the inspection costs at North Anna brought on by the earthquake and the impairment charge on the value of our CAIR emissions allowances. Furthermore,  the commission's treatment of severance costs related to our 2010 voluntary separation plan actually shifted about $100 million of expenses into 2011, further lowering the earned ROE computed for regulatory purposes. ","Finally, I want to comment on our dividend. Last week, our Board of Directors authorized a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which subject to further declarations by the board, equates to an annual rate of $2.11 per share. The new rate represents about a 65% payout at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range for 2012, and reflects the board's confidence in our ability to achieve our earnings growth targets. Last month, our board affirmed our 60% to 65% targeted payout ratio, therefore pending board approval, you can expect future dividend increases in line with our growth and earnings per share or about 5% to 6% annually.","So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that met our expectations for the year. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year. ","Thank you, and I now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick","Good morning, everyone. Dominion's 2011 operating earnings were within the guidance range we gave at the beginning of the year. And largely due to mild weather in the fourth quarter, we're at the bottom of the revised range we issued on our last call. Operating earnings were $3.05 per share for the year and $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter. Very mild weather, particularly in December, reduced earnings by $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter. ","GAAP earnings were $0.35 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.45 for the year.  During the fourth quarter, we wrote down the value of our coal units at our Chesapeake, Yorktown and North Branch Power Stations which will be retired primarily as result of new EPA emissions regulations.  These charges account for most of the difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter. Other factors for the year include restoration costs related to Hurricane Irene, merchant plant retirements, Kewaunee operations and the net impact from the SCC's order and the biannual review. A summary and a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the earnings release kit. ","Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the fourth quarter was $232 million, which was below the bottom of our guidance range. This variance was driven primarily by warmer-than-normal weather plus higher-than-expected storm restoration expenses. EBIT for Dominion Energy was $258 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. Greater-than-expected earnings from Producer Services and lower fuel costs at Dominion Transmission were positive factors. ","Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $229 million for the fourth quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power and lower merchant generation margins due to lower commodity prices and extended outage at Millstone Unit 3 were principal factors in the lower results. Offsetting lower results from our operating segments were lower interest expense and lower income taxes, both of which came in better than expected. ","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $3.5 billion for 2011, on track with guidance given at the beginning of the year. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper outstanding at the end of the year was $1.8 billion, resulting in available liquidity of $1.7 billion. Last September, we extended the maturity of our credit facilities to September 2016. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 13 and 26 of the earnings release kit. ","Now moving to our financing plans. Earlier this month, we issued $450 million of 10-year notes at Virginia Power. This issue was a carryover from our 2011 financing plan. Excluding that issue, we plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year, fairly evenly split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes the replacement of about $1.5 billion in maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings. ","As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment and other stock purchase programs, which will raise about $300 million of new equity. Since our existing SEC shelf registration expires at the end of this month, we plan to file a new universal shelf with the SEC later today to cover financing needs for the next several years. Included in this shelf registration will be the ability to issue common stock through an at-the-money or ATM program. We do not expect to issue any shares under this program this year. We're simply creating the flexibility to use this program in future years, when we choose to issue equity above amount raised through our dividend reinvestment in other stock purchase plans. ","Now to earnings guidance. As Tom said earlier, we expect our operating earnings to grow 5% to 6% this year. Based on our operating earnings of $3.05 per share in 2011, this would imply an operating earnings range of roughly $3.20 to $3.25 per share for 2012, assuming normal weather. Incorporating some degree of sensitivity to weather and other factors to that range, results in operating earnings guidance for 2012 of $3.10 to $3.35 per share. ","On Slide 8, we have highlighted the principal drivers, positive and negative, to our 5% to 6% growth in 2012. As you can see, interest expense, VEPCO revenues, rate adjustment clauses and gas transmission and distribution are expected to provide significant growth. On the downside, DD&A and merchant generation margins are negative drivers year-over-year.  Let me spend a few moments going over these drivers. ","First, on Slide 9 is the breakdown of our merchant generation challenge. In confirming our growth guidance on our last call, we anticipated a merchant margin reduction in 2012 of about $0.13 to $0.16 per share, mainly driven by the shutdown of our State Line coal units this quarter. However, as shown in the middle of this slide, we currently see an initial challenge of $0.06 to $0.08 based on the recent drop off in our open NEPOOL positions. ","We plan to offset the additional margin weakness by reducing operating expenses as shown on Slide 10. Our total annual operating and maintenance budget is approximately $3.2 billion. We plan to reduce that by 2% to 3%. I've highlighted a few areas that we will focus on. First, we will have a number of natural offsets due to current depressed 1x and lower margins at our coal units. We expect to have lower variable operating, environmental and maintenance costs due to reduced production. We are also evaluating planned maintenance outage schedules and other routine maintenance in all of our businesses to meet this challenge. Finally, we'll be closely managing our employee and contractor levels.  If you review our expense level performance over the last several years, we believe cost management is a significant strength for us. ","Moving to interest expense on Slide 11. We expect year-over-year interest expense to drop by approximately $30 million as we continue to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Recent swaps and the replacement of maturing debt are expected to be the main drivers. ","On Slide 12, we outlined our anticipated VEPCO sales and revenue growth. Year-over-year sales should grow between 2% to 2.5% with data centers providing nearly half of the uplift. Outside of data centers, our projected sales are estimated to grow only 1% to 1.3%. This may turn out to be conservative.","Moving to rate adjustment clause revenue growth on Slide 13. You can see the transmission Virginia City and Warren County should provide most of the incremental growth based on the capital spend in these areas. ","And finally on Slide 14, we provide a breakdown of our gas business growth drivers. These growth projects continue to support of the Utica and Marcellus infrastructure needs. All of these projects have been outlined in the growth plan for some time. We hope the breakdown will truly be helpful and provide the details of how we will grow this year. ","Moving to operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2012. Our guidance for the first quarter is $0.85 to $1 per share compared to operating earnings of $0.93 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Please note, we have one additional first quarter nuclear outage in Virginia than last year. A more detailed layout of our earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2012 can be found in our earnings guidance kit, which will be posted on our website later today. ","As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedged positions on Page 28 of the earnings release kit. We've added to our hedges from Millstone in 2012, increasing the hedging percentage to 80%. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 remains about $0.04 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is about $0.07 per share. ","As shown on Page 28 of the earnings release kit, we have hedged about 1\/4 of our expected production at Millstone in 2014 and 2015. Locking in the uplift in pricing in these forward markets reduces the risk associated with achieving our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. ","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for 2011 were within the guidance range. Mild weather, particularly in December, led to an operating earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year 2011 that were at the bottom of the ranges given last October. Our operating earnings guidance for 2012 is $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth targets. First quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.85 to $1 per share. ","And finally, while recent declines in commodity prices present a challenge, we are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we are well positioned to meet our growth targets. ","Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What's the trajectory of new data centers? I mean, does that look like it's saturated? Or do we have a few more years of this?","Thomas F. Farrell","I'm sorry, new gas what?","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","New data centers, excuse me.","Thomas F. Farrell","No, they moved data centers. I'll let Paul Koonce give you the detail, but it's been going on for some years, and it's expected to go on for at least several more. But Paul can go ahead and give you that exact numbers we have. These are points that are under contract.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, Tom. For 2011, we expected to add about 75 megawatts of new demand from either existing or new data centers. And in 2011, that's exactly what we did. We added about the 9 new centers. For 2012, because data centers require facilities, that work is already underway. So for 2011, we expect to add about 11 new data centers. And between 2000 -- and between existing data centers and the new ones, we expect to add about another 175 megawatts of contract demand, for a total of about 545 megawatts. So it's a very predictable schedule. And we have not seen any change in customer needs in this area.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And philosophically, in this commodities market, how do you think about hedging the outyears? Do you -- I mean, are you cautious here, and you just don't want to -- I guess, I was asking, are you bearish or bullish on gas at this point?","Mark F. McGettrick","We're not either bearish or bullish, Paul, on gas. This is Mark. As we look at the outyears, we look it as part of the package. And we're shooting to grow 5% to 6% commodity prices or a piece of that. So as we look at OEM opportunities, other growth opportunities, if we see a power price out there, a commodity price that helps support that long-term strategy, then you can see us hedge it. But you should watch us to average in hedges still at Millstone, but again, it'll be part of a bigger package as opposed to more of a standard averaging that we have done over the last several years?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Does your 1Q and full year guidance contemplate year-to-date weather?","Mark F. McGettrick","Year-to-date as in January?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, we don't -- January is 1 month out of 12 and 1 month out of 3. I think right now, we assume normal weather for the year. That's how we build our guidance range, and we'll see what the actuals prove out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just to clarify, on the long-term earnings growth. If you guys, despite -- if I heard you guys correctly, despite what we've seen in the current market, coal, gas prices, et cetera, because of your hedging and because of the growth prospects and the other parts of the business, effectively, you still think that you can make the 5% to 6% growth, correct?","Thomas F. Farrell","Yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the second thing is the impairment on the Generation assets. Could you just give us a little bit more flavor as to what happened this quarter?","Mark F. McGettrick","Paul, its Mark. I'll be glad to do that. We got the final mercury order in December. And we have been talking to investors for some time that based on what we thought was going to come out, along with some -- with other orders out of the EPA that we would have several facilities in Virginia that would not be economically complying. And so we identified those. And then when the final order came out in December, we impaired them. We anticipate those coal units shutting down and being replaced by new gas unit. And so we impaired them  based on a 2015, 2016 end of life, which is the exactly the same treatment that we talked with our State Line and Salem units, as we identified those as shutdown candidates based on environmental regulations.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Now these are regulated assets?","Mark F. McGettrick","They are regulated assets.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Now, wouldn't you be able to recover the -- I mean, I guess, this is a regulatory treatment, how does it mean -- is this really a real write-off that you guys are going to be a -- you mean, there's going to be a hit to common equity? Is that -- how should we think about those in terms of regulatory rate case kind of thing?","Mark F. McGettrick","Right. Well, I guess the way we think about it is we have an obligation to our customers and shareholders. We're going to be asking customers and our regulators to approve a new $1 billion plus gas facility with 100 basis point premium to replace these facilities. We felt it was appropriate to go ahead and remove them from rate base at the appropriate time, take that charge now and not ask for our customers to pay twice for facilities that will have the same megawatts.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, so you guys are going to be taking a hit on this, it seems like.","Mark F. McGettrick","We'll take a hit -- we took a hit in 2011 on it to our GAAP earnings.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Now how does that -- you mentioned that these are going to be coming out of 2015 and -- that was the expected life anyway. So does that have a depreciation benefit that we should be thinking about in the next few years? I mean, does that possibly impact EPS.","Mark F. McGettrick","No, you shouldn't think about depreciation benefit for the next several years. And we'd be glad to go through the mechanics of write-down with you, with our IR [ph] after the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on Paul's question. We should assume that this gets removed from rate base beginning in 2011 or in 2015 and '16?","Mark F. McGettrick","No. We're going to remove it from rate base in 2013, which is when we would have our next biannual review.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it would be removed from 2013?","Mark F. McGettrick","We're going to take the charge in 2011, and then as we file the biannual review for those 2 years, it'll be included in the 2013 biannual review.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So this charge then would not apply towards '12 earnings, in the biannual review. We should apply this charge towards whatever you would potentially be earning in 2013?","Mark F. McGettrick","No. You should apply the charge to 2011. And on average, the review is done on '11 and '12 earnings. But the actual charge was taken in December of 2011, and that's where you should apply it.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. There was a markedly lower tax rate in the quarter and also a lower tax rate for the year relative to guidance. Can -- what drove that? And should that sort of -- should we -- do we need to make an adjustment on what we assume as a tax rate in 2012?","Mark F. McGettrick","I'm going to let Scott Hetzer answer that question for you.","G. Scott Hetzer","Paul, the tax rate for the year was better because of favorable settlements from federal audit issues and reduced state taxes and having to do with state tax credits on items like the Brayton Point cooling towers. And in the guidance kit, we have a range for 2012, 36 to 37.5.","Mark F. McGettrick","Paul, its Mark. I'd add to that, that we have had a concerted effort over the last couple of years to resolve outstanding IRS audits that date back almost a decade. And the tax group has done a great job doing this. A great deal that benefited in the fourth quarter was a catch-up benefit from those audits. We still have some more work to do on that. And so in 2012, give me a fairly wide range on taxes. Sometimes it's a benefit, sometimes it's a detriment. But we're consistently working on getting as current as we can with the IRS on our federal tax returns.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And the last question for me is if I look at the utility rate base, I guess there's been a lot of accelerated depreciation that's taking place. Is it possible to sort of get an updated snapshot on what that rate base would be at the end of 2011?","Mark F. McGettrick","We'll be glad to do that, which we'll have the IR team call you on the breakdown.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can I just follow-up on this question about what your thoughts around -- not having included the sort of mild start to the year in the guidance score. And did I hear you right that weather was kind of an $0.08 drag in Q4?","Mark F. McGettrick","That's correct.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Was that versus normal or year-over-year, Mark? Sorry, didn't...","Mark F. McGettrick","No, that was versus normal. It would be about $0.11 year-over-year.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And was it --  and you said most of that was December. So is that also correct?","Mark F. McGettrick","Yes. It was extraordinary mild December in Virginia.","Thomas F. Farrell","We have 5 days over 70.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So I mean, I guess, January -- I guess my question is assuming that kind of January has been somewhat similar, do you feel you have enough O&M flex that you could also accommodate that, let's just say, we're just normal from here?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, from what we've seen, Jonathan, from so far in January 1, its nowhere near what December was. December was one of the lowest ones on record in the state. January is not anywhere near that level. And again, what we balance is -- with our other activities. I mean is economy going to be stronger. Is February, March weather going to be better to offset, if there's going to be a shortfall in January? So again, I think we feel real comfortable right now that with all the drivers we have based on what we've seen so far in January, that our guidance range looks good.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So January is pretty less of a drag than December was, so that's good. Can I ask -- and one other thing. Your -- can you comment on where you are on sort of your levels of coal you have under contract going into this year versus, say, where you were last year? Is that appreciably lower or around the same? And as follow on to that, do you expect to see meaningfully incremental switching, in terms of gas substituting coal, given where the curves are, and given how your contracts look maybe in Virginia and also up in New England?","Mark F. McGettrick","Okay, Jonathan, let me ask Dave Christian to answer that.","David A. Christian","I think you could fairly say that we are solidly in the range of gas-coal switching. We followed this coal parity and have been for some time, and we're solidly in the substitution range now. We saw some of this coming in New England and reduced our coal hedging positions. If you were to look the hedging percentage in the kit, you'll  probably see coal hedging at about 26% this year. Last year at this time, it would have been about 70%. So you're seeing significantly reduced coal burns everywhere and saw some of it coming and took some actions. So I think you're going to see a lot of gas burn for the remainder of the year.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Any quantification around how much additional switch might be?","David A. Christian","I can tell you what it is for Dominion. We have in 2011, we went -- from '10 to '11, we from 13.5% gas to 17.7% gas. And coal went down by about the equivalent amount.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And any view on how '12 will shake out as you model it now?","David A. Christian","Too early to give a percentage number on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carrie Saint Louis with Fidelity.","Carrie Saint Louis","Two questions. First, I'm wondering where your annual cash flow guidance that you normally provide is located?","Thomas Hamlin","It's in the guidance kit.","Mark F. McGettrick","It's in the guidance kits, Carrie?","Carrie Saint Louis","Okay. I couldn't find it, so I don't know if I'm missing it or what, but I don't know if you know what page it is.","Mark F. McGettrick","We'll check for the page -- Page 10. [indiscernible] Okay. It'll -- It's going to come out after the call, and it's going to be on Page 10.","Carrie Saint Louis","Okay, after the call. All right. And then I was just wondering, it's been a while since I've seen in any of your published materials, like kind of what balance sheet strength and credit quality metrics you guys have been targeting. So I don't know, have you -- maybe you could just provide an update about what metrics you target like a FFO-to-debt metric and what credit quality you guys are hoping to maintain during this large CapEx build?","Mark F. McGettrick","I'm going to go ahead and have Scott answer that for you.","G. Scott Hetzer","Carrie, it continues to be the credit metrics that would help us achieve the existing ratings. We really like the high BBB rating. And, of course, each rating agency looks a little differently, so we try to get away from specific targets on credit metrics. But they're not different from what you've seen in the recent past.","Carrie Saint Louis","Okay. But the high BBB is kind of -- because, obviously, you have right now a few different credit ratings, so that's kind of where your modeling the business. Do you define that as kind of roughly around the 20% FFO to debt? Or what ballpark do you kind of look out there?","G. Scott Hetzer","That is certainly in the ballpark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Judge with Atlantic Equities.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","I may have missed it, but did you quantify what your last 12 months ROE was at VEPCO if you had taken all those -- after all the charges and adjustments that you've mentioned in the call?","Mark F. McGettrick","Nathan, we didn't quantify it, but I would tell you that we believe our ROE for 2011 will be below 9%.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","So is it -- is there a reason why we couldn't see above allowed ROEs to balance that to get to -- you to that average in the second period -- second half of this period?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, there's a lot of drivers that go into that as you know. But the biannual review is based on an average over the 2-year period. And if you were to ask us know, do you believe that we will over earn our authorized return in the biannual period? Our answer to that would be no.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You guys have done a good job managing cost the last couple of years, and you're obviously targeting more, given these conditions. How should we think about kind of the durability of continuing to manage down O&M looking forward? And what sort of inflation rate should we thinking about from an O&M perspective, as you guys look at a 2- or 3-year period?","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, Dan, we've been very focused on it. We gave very specific guidance in May of 2010 on what we thought our O&M expenditures will be in '10, '11 and '12. And we're right on target with that. We've taken a more aggressive stance now in '12 than what we've shown, so our '12 expenses will now be below 2011. We continue to optimize our operations. O&M's a huge driver for us. We have flexibility in a number of parts of our business to shape O&M year-to-year, in terms of focusing on different expense levels. So we don't have a specific long-term growth rate on O&M or a reduction level on O&M. We'll look at that as -- along with the other drivers that we have and take advantage of the opportunities that we have. We do have focus on it this year at a lower level. And based on the slides we show, we would expect to drive out an incremental $60 million to $90 million in O&M cost from where we stood last fall.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And I guess the other kind of question is, with the degradation in the forward curves -- this is long-term situation, but are you having any change in conversation with people about some of the gas development needs? Or do you see any slowdown? Or are people are kind of charging ahead even as the recount is being talked down a little bit?","Thomas F. Farrell","Dan, it hasn't slowed down at all. Actually, it accelerated in the fourth quarter. Where people are concentrating is in the West formations, which in particular for us is the Western Marcellus. But even more than that, the Utica. I mentioned it in the script. There's a lot in the script, you all could have missed it. It's actually every single well online in Ohio, in the Utica formation, is producing into our gathering systems at Dominion East Ohio. So permitting is going up, drilling activity is going up. But as you note in -- it's not accelerating in the dry gas. It's accelerating in the wet gas, which supports -- and there's not enough facilities in Ohio or West Virginia or Pennsylvania to handle all the wet gas that's coming online. So that's what supports Natrium, for example. And that were not the only one doing it. There are others pursuing these facilities. But we've gotten our share, and we expect to continue to get our share.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I think Tom, you mentioned something about the one issue that's not clarified on the rate order with respect to the timing of starting it. Could you just clarify that issue? And if it matters at all within the guidance range?","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, it doesn't matter in the guidance range, first. Because our rates weren't changed. They weren't subject to being changed. And if we over -- remember, you have to over-earn in 2 consecutive biannual reviews under Virginia law. The commission found we over-earned in the first, which for -- it's for the years '09 and '10. They'll review '11 and '12 in 2013. So what the issue there is -- was this is our view, fairly strongly held view. All the parties agreed in the going-in case in 2009 that the new ROE level for the second biannual review would become effective at the commission's order in the first biannual review or when -- which was issued on December 1. So there's a -- we didn't think it was clear from the order that was entered in December whether they were going to do what that settlement agreement called for, which was that the first biannual review ROE, which was 11.9% apply to the first 11 months of the biannual review, and the new ROE to the second 13 months, or whether they were going to apply to the new ROE to the entire 24 months. It makes a difference of 40 or 50 basis points, I think, on the average of the 2 years. So it's -- we think it's fairly clear, but that's in front of the commissioners under our motion for clarification and they'll rule.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. One unrelated question. Just on the Cove Point export approvals and the DOE process. Could you just go through what their process is? And this has become a bit of a political issue. Just maybe give a little more color on the reasons for support, the reasons against, and your  -- how you think you'll be able to prevail?","Thomas F. Farrell","When you file for a -- first, we got the NAFTA country permits. That's a fairly simple thing to do, because there's a limited number of countries. What matters is getting the non-NAFTA country permit, which is presently under consideration. When you file for that permit, you have to file an economic impact study with it, which we did and is available for review, and you look at a typical economic impact study what -- they're looking at what are the potential impacts on the price of natural gas, if this permit is allowed. But you also look at the economic activity that is created by the issuance of the permit: New jobs, tax revenues. Things like that, that will occur upstream from the facility: a new pipeline operations, processing facilities, drilling jobs, the jobs that spin off of that to support functions, et cetera. The study we filed shows that there are very significant beneficial impacts and economic activity from allowing the permit to be issued, so they'll consider that. They'll certainly consider other people's views. They'll look at what the potential is for impacts on gas prices out into the future. I think if you look at all of it in a balanced way, with all the gas that's available in this country now, and particularly in this region, we think it is likely the permit will be issued. We expect to have it later this year. And if you look at just the map, if you're going to export gas from the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions, I think it's pretty likely that's going to happen through the Cove Point facility, just because of the close -- how close we are to the region.","Operator","We have reached the conclusion of our call. Mr. McGettrick, do you have any closing remarks?","Mark F. McGettrick","Yes, thank you. I just want to remind everybody that our next scheduled earnings call will be April 26.

On the call today, we have Tom Farrell, CEO, and other members of senior management. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations for a Safe Harbor statement.","Thomas Hamlin","Good morning, and welcome to Dominion's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.","During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings release and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting.

Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss the measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our first quarter 2012 operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year 2012, as well as operating earnings before interest and tax, commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliations of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained on Schedules 2 and 3 in pages 34 to 40 in our earnings release kit.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the first quarter, as well as our guidance for the second quarter of 2012. Tom will update our operating and regulatory activities as well as review the progress we have made on our growth plan. I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion's 2012 first quarter operating earnings finished at the bottom of our guidance range of $0.85 to $1 per share. Extremely mild weather in our service territory, the warmest in the 100 plus years of record keeping reduced earnings by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Adjusted for weather, earnings would have been in the upper end of the guidance range. Non-weather factors impacting first quarter earnings were lower merchant generation margins and a lower contribution from Producer Services offset by lower O&M expenses, a higher contribution from Dominion Retail and a lower effective income tax rate.  GAAP earnings were $0.86 per share for the first quarter.","Now, moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the first quarter was $324 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by lower storm cost and cost control initiatives. The favorable variance to guidance can also be attributed to stronger than expected margins at Dominion Retail.","First quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $256 million which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Although Dominion East Ohio's rate structure largely decouples revenues from weather, the mild weather had a $0.01 per share negative impact on portions of its business.  Results from Producer Services were also below expectations given the overall weakness in natural gas markets. Helping to offset these negative drivers were lower O&M expenses and lower fuel cost.","Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $396 million for the first quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower merchant generation margins and lower ancillary revenues were the principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses reflecting actions taken early in the year to offset the impact of lower power prices.","On a consolidated basis, interest expenses came in slightly higher than expected but income taxes were below our estimates. A state tax benefit related to our Fairless Works power station helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 34% for the quarter. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.09 billion for the first quarter. Regarding the liquidity, we have $3.5 billion of credit facilities, commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter for $1.1 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments resulted in available liquidity of $2.5 billion.  For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year with a fairly even split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes the replacement of about $1.5 billion in maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings and have made significant progress on hedging our anticipated 2013 debt needs as well. Today, we have hedged Treasury rates on approximately 50% of our 2013 needs. As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock to our dividend reinvestment, customer stock purchase and employee savings and compensation plans which will raise about $320 million of new equity.","In February, we announced a tender offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding 2006 Series B hybrid securities in order to reduce interest expense. This December, we have retired approximately $100 million of these securities principally through the tender offer. We were pleased with the results of the tender in which we offer to purchase securities at 87% to 90% of par and believe that current trading levels help validate our view on the value of the securities.","In total, we have paid prices ranging from 85% to 90% of par since December. And continue to believe that this price range represents fair value to the holders of the securities and to the company. While we would consider opportunities to negotiate purchases of additional amounts, we are not interested in purchasing them at a price above the range we have previously paid.","Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the second quarter within a range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares with operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2011, which included less than $0.01 of weather help. While it is still early in the quarter, at least through the first 3 weeks of April, the weather has not been favorable. However, weather can have a much greater impact on May and June sales. So it is too early to judge the weather effect for the entire second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, positive drivers for the second quarter include: sales growth at Virginia Power, higher Rider-related revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Negative drivers for the quarter are mainly lower merchant generation margins.","Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the year, we would expect earnings to fall within a $3.20 to $3.25 range or about 5% to 6% above operating earnings for 2011. While first quarter weather was well below normal, summer weather can have a much greater impact on our overall results. So it is too early to estimate where within the overall range we are likely to land.","At 2010 and 2011, strong summer weather added $0.14 and $0.08 respectively, to our earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call in January, we have added to our hedges from Millstone in 2012, 2013 and 2014, increasing the hedge percentages to 95%, 80% and 40% respectively. 2015 remains at 24% hedged. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 is now only $0.02 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only $0.05 per share.","As shown on Slide 8, since our last call we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated output for 2012 and 80% of our 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets.","So let me summarize my financial review.  Operating earnings for the first quarter were at the bottom of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.11 per share compared to normal. Our business units were able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by recent declines in commodity prices through reductions in operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2012 is $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our annual operating earnings guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% earnings growth target.","And finally, we have locked in virtually all of our anticipated merchant margins this year and 80% of 2013.  We are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our growth targets.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell","Good morning. Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter and in every case with improving safety performance as well. Our nuclear fleet achieved a net capacity factor of 98.6% for the quarter with 5 of our 7 units operating at 100%. As a result of low gas prices, our combined cycle power stations operated more than ever.","Virginia Power's large combined cycle units achieved a record capacity factor of over 90% and both our Fairless Works and Manchester power stations achieved record output during the first quarter. Units 3 and 4 at our State Line Power Station were shut down in late March. Station personnel are performing operational decommissioning activities which should be complete by the end of the second quarter and at which time, the site will be ready for physical decommissioning.","The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was over 98% complete at the end of the first quarter. Two major milestones were reached on the project in March. When the unit was first synchronized to the PJM grid and the first fire on coal occurred. Commissioning is proceeding well and commercial operation is on schedule and on budget for the middle of the year. The CPCN and Rider applications for the Warren County power station were approved by the State Corporation Commission in February and construction began in March. The three-on-one combined cycle unit will produce over 1,300 megawatts of capacity at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion and is scheduled for commercial operation in late 2014. The plant will produce significant economic benefits for our customers.","The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatt three-on-one combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The plant, additional transmission and the installation of environmental controls at 2 existing oil units are necessitated by the HAP's MACT rule issued by EPA last December. The projected in-service date is 2016 and is expected to cost about the same as the Warren County Project and will also offer significant value to customers.","Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Brunswick plant. We are currently soliciting engineering procurement and construction bids and expect to file the CPCN and Rider applications with the State Corporation Commission later this year.","Also in March, the commission approved the applications for conversion of the Alta Vista, South Hampton and Hopewell power stations from coal to biomass. Air permits are expected to be issued sometime this summer following construction to begin with commercial operations anticipated -- allowing construction to begin with commercial ops anticipated prior to the end of 2013.","Dominion has notified the federal government that it is interested in obtaining leases off the Virginia Coast in an area of 113,000 acres that has the potential to generate approximately 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of electricity from offshore wind turbines. Virginia State Corporation Commission would have to approve any Dominion Virginia Power offshore wind generation project.","Our growth projects for our electric transmission continue to move forward. The rebuild of the Mt. Storm-to-Doubs line is underway with 58% of the foundations and 9% of the conductor installed. The line is currently out of service for rebuild and is expected to be put back into service for the summer months. PJM has notified the company that when it takes the line out of service again this September, we can continue construction through mid-May 2013. This will enable more efficient construction cycles and should advance the projected closing of the project from mid-2015 to the end of 2014.","Mt. Storm-to-Doubs is just one of the many growth projects in various stages of development at electric transmission. We anticipate annual investment of $500 million in upgrades and enhancements through at least the end of the decade.","Dominion Energy also made significant progress on its growth program in the first quarter. Construction of our $634 million Appalachian Gateway Project began last summer and the project is expected in service by September of this year. FERC approval for the Northeast Expansion Project, as well as the Ellisburg-to-Craigs project was received in the third quarter of last year. Both projects are expected to be in service by this November.","Construction has begun on Phase I of the Natrium Processing Project, which is expected to cost about $500 million and should be into service by this December. Even with depressed natural gas prices, we remain confident that wet gas lines from the Utica formation will meet or exceed expectation. Many producers have directed rigs from dry to wet shale plays to capture the uplift from the heavy hydrocarbon liquid. As of the end of the first quarter, Ohio has issued 192 horizontal well permits to 11 different Utica producer. 77 wells have been drilled or were being drilled in the formation. Currently, we are the only company gathering and processing wet gas from the Utica shale.","We are in discussions with multiple producers for volumes to support the possible construction of Phase 2 at Natrium, which could be in service by mid-2014. We are pleased to announce today that we are moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction project. At the end of March we signed binding precedent agreements with 2 companies, one of which is Sumitomo Corporation, a major Japanese company with significant global energy operations. Between the 2 shippers, the planned project capacity of about 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and about 4.5 to 5 million metric tons per annum on the outlet is fully subscribed. Dominion will provide liquefaction, storage and loading services but would not own or directly export the LNG.","We are continuing to negotiate binding terminal service agreements with the party and expect to complete them later this summer. Last October, we filed for approval to export up to the equivalent of 365 Bcf of LNG per year for a 25-year term to non-free-trade agreement country. Our filing supports our belief that the project will have many positive economic benefit and we are hopeful for DOE approval later this year. We plan to submit a request to FERC early this summer to initiate the prefiling process for approval of the project which may take up to 2 years. Engineering studies are underway and we will provide a cost estimate for the project at a later date. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies, execution of terminal services agreements and provided we receive the necessary approvals we anticipate beginning construction in 2014, with an in-service date in 2017.","As with any project of this magnitude, we would expect some opposition from various environmental and special interest groups. For example, the Sierra Club, which is a party to an agreement restricting activities on a portion of the Cove Point property has expressed its opposition to LNG export facilities and to frac-ing process in general. We have reviewed the various regulations, agreements and rulings from various regulatory bodies governing the site and are confident that we will be able to locate, construct and operate a liquefaction facility at Cove Point. Dominion plans to design the facility to minimize environmental impacts. Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. PJM's updated load forecast projects peak demand growth in the zone that includes Dominion Service territory of 1.9% per year over the next 10 years for an increase of nearly 4,000 megawatts. Unemployment in Virginia is 5.6%, well below the national average of 8.2% and that is actually below 5% in Northern Virginia.","New connects for the first quarter were up 13% over the first quarter of 2011 and we now estimate a year-over-year increase of 3,200 or more than 10%. Weather-adjusted sales at Virginia Power were up 1.1% for the first quarter. Our estimate for weather normalized sales growth for all of 2012 is 2% to 2.5% for Virginia Power with data centers continuing to be a strong contributor to our growth.","On the regulatory front, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. Next week, we will make our annual fuel rate filing in Virginia. Because of low commodity prices and mild weather, we anticipate a significant reduction in the fuel rate as well as the overall bill for customers more than offsetting any Rider-related increases implemented this year. Furthermore, our annual electric transmission Rider update which we also plan to file next week will result in another reduction to customer rate.","So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and delivered results that given the mild weather, met our expectation. We continue to move forward with our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% earnings growth per share beginning this year.","Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","In the past, you guys have talked about potentially not doing the construction all on your own, potentially partnering or finding somebody to take an interest. Should we assume at this point that it's your intention to pair up with other parties or is this something that you would take entirely onto your balance sheet?","Mark F. McGettrick","Paul, this is Mark. We're looking at all options on Cove Point and as we get closer to what a final construction price might be, that'll help guide us which way we might do. We may do it all ourselves. We may take on a partner. We're certainly looking at various financing options, all of them that you can think of. But until we get a little more clarity on exactly what this facility is going to cost, we're keeping everything open. And as soon as we know what that is, we'll come out with a comprehensive financing plan and what the best option is for our shareholders and our balance sheet.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Also, you talked about hedging. I'm assuming that because interest expense is projected down this year, that a significant amount of that is through interest rate swaps. Can you give us some color in terms of the magnitude of interest rate swap transactions that you've done? And also, how far out into the future do those swaps mature just for modeling purposes?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, we said on 2012 we put swaps in place for all of our anticipated debt needs for 2012, which is $1.5 billion to $2 billion. For '13, we announced today that we put swaps to around about 50% of that debt need. And although we haven't specifically said what that debt need might be for '13, you should think probably in a range of $1.5 billion to maybe $2.2 billion at this point. We anticipate continually to put in swaps for '13; it's a de-risking measure that we've been doing for a number of years and it's really helped us significantly.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So in terms of a maturity profile, do these go out years? Do they go out like 1 or 2 years? How far out into the future do they go?","Mark F. McGettrick","Let me go ahead and have Scott Hetzer answer the question.","G. Scott Hetzer","Paul, they are scheduled to start -- these are swaps that are scheduled to start either in '12 or '13. And the term ranges from 5 to 10 to 30 years depending on what kind of security we're hedging.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So they would -- the swaps would be commensurate with the maturity date of whatever it is that you're issuing, right?","G. Scott Hetzer","That is correct.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last question, on New England volumes, you guys were down 18% in the first quarter. Your projection in the second quarter -- and you were, I think your projection for the first quarter was roughly flat. In the second quarter, you're only projecting that you'll be down 5%. Is that because the first quarter lower volumes in New England were somehow related to the mild weather or how should we think about that?","Mark F. McGettrick","No, Paul. The reason for the second quarter being fairly flat is last year we had a Millstone unit outage in the second quarter. This year we don't. And conversely, we do not expect much run time at all out of our coal units in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to explore the LNG export a little bit further. As we think about, over time, the earnings power of this opportunity relative to the import revenue and the import earnings that you are currently achieving, how should we think about in terms of just the transition, the construction work? And then ultimately, once export is up and running, how should we broadly think about how the existing import work and revenue would mesh with the export capability?","Mark F. McGettrick","The Cove Point has different contracts on it on the import. The original portion of it was sold out to 3 parties. The major expansions sold out to one party. There are -- we have the opportunity with the second piece of it to use that part of the contract for importation and exporting. So as we work through the course of this time, you'll see that portion of the contract will be used for export. It's too early -- we're not at a point where we're going to start talking about what the earnings profile is from this facility because as of today we still haven't locked down the cost, financing, exact timing. It's not, when you look across our website and look at what our 5-year growth plan is and the growth CapEx, it still shows nothing related to Cove Point's liquefaction facility. We'll fill that in as we have more clarity on the costs.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, understood. But broadly speaking, should we expect that the import contracts, volumes, revenues, broadly speaking, would over time start to decline as you start to ramp up your export revenues?","Mark F. McGettrick","A portion of the import.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one more LNG question then maybe we'll have them all done. But can you just explain to me as a non-lawyer, what the agreement actually means from a commitment perspective from you guys to the partners and their commitment to you during the process of getting the permits and the engineering work done?","Mark F. McGettrick","Dan, this is a sort of term of ours in the pipeline business and it's the kind of thing we do all the time when we're doing capacity expansions on the pipeline system. If it's a non-negotiate, not a -- a typical FERC-governed transaction, we'll do an open season. We'll see what people's interests are. If we have a project that we say we wanted to be $500 million a day, we'll gauge interest. People will come in and say, hey, we're interested. And maybe people say there's $750 million a day worth of interest. We'll then sit down with them and negotiate what are called in the industry, binding precedent agreement, which commit both parties through parameters, financial parameters, around the project.  There are a variety of things that have to happen as you go through the final negotiations, in this case, for a terminal service agreement or in a more traditional case, a pipeline capacity agreement. So it's -- we're in the same spot we are on -- where we are when we're doing sort of almost any kind of pipeline related expansion. We have found 2 parties who are going to take all of the capacity. The overall financial terms are established and then there's certain criteria that we have to meet, they have to meet and we'll complete that as we go through the terminal services agreement. But it is a -- not a 100% commitment that nobody can change but it is well down the path to that level. We would not have announced it otherwise.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess kind of the next question around the development of this project. There's been some talk that having the Japanese partners was important. Obviously, [indiscernible] was part of their arrangement. Is there something politically expedient to having Japan as kind of an offtake party to help with the getting the export license or do you think this was just the best partner available?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, we had a lot of interest, Dan, from both Asia and European customers. And as we went through the variety -- the negotiations with a variety of partners, between the other partner, we'll -- when the time comes, we will announce who that is, I shouldn't call them partners, the other customer, these turned out to be the best for them and best for our shareholders. I think politically, obviously, the Japanese are strong allies of our country but so are European potential customers.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And I guess one last question, Mark. Just as far as guidance is concerned with the first quarter coming out where it was and the second quarter kind of flat year on year, there's some makeup that has to be done to get to the bottom end of the range for guidance for the full year. Is there anything markup-wise in earnings we should be thinking about? Or is it just kind of a natural progression with investments coming into service and freights going effective?","Mark F. McGettrick","Dan, it\u2019s kind of an unusual year. If you think about the fourth quarter alone, year-over-year, normal weather in the fourth quarter for us will pick us up $0.08 year-over-year. If you recall, we had a very, very mild fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we have Gateway pipeline project coming on in September and we have Natrium coming on in December. So our earnings profile is very back end loaded this year in third and fourth quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Relative to your first quarter guidance, Dominion Generation materially outperformed. What drove that?","Mark F. McGettrick","Generation was actually below their guidance range for the first quarter.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, I must have misread something, sorry. And then, your annual growth is 2% to 2.5% but first quarter was 1%. What -- is it just the data centers that's going to drive the back half?","Mark F. McGettrick","First quarter was on a weather normalized basis 1% to 1.5%. The data centers actually were a little slow in the ramp up in the first quarter which depressed that sales number a bit. And as Tom talked about, we've seen very strong new connect activity in the quarter. Job growth in the state is maturing quickly. We're seeing recovery in some of the residential markets. So while the first quarter is lighter than we'd like, we still think 2% to 2.5% on an annual basis is achievable.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And now that you've I guess gotten much closer around Cove Point, how are you thinking about the MLP option?.","Mark F. McGettrick","MLP will be one of the options we evaluate with a lot of other options in terms of how that project might be financed long term. And we looked at the MLP option before a number of times and didn't fit us. We'll continue to look at it as Cove Point matures in terms of a project life to see if that's the best option for our shareholders. We have no view on that currently except it's one of many that we'll look at.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could I just assert one thing quickly on Cove Point? You haven't disclosed the other party, but is this a different kind of party than you have the arrangements with on the import or is it one of the same parties? Can you at least disclose that?","Mark F. McGettrick","That was a very effective question, Jonathan. But despite that -- how good the question was, I can't answer it. We will -- it's -- each company has its own way of going about things. We will, when this counter party is prepared, we will then announce it. And I don't think it'll be in this too distant future.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm sorry to revisit this but I just didn't quite kind of follow the answer, Tom, but to what extent does this new project sort of limit the potential of your existing import business?","Thomas F. Farrell","I would think about it differently. I would think about what we will have is the facility that will allow both the, in a single place, allow both the import and export of gas into the mid-Atlantic, right into the heart of the market.  That's why we think it is attractive as it is. But it can't be used for both at the same time all the time. But there are -- there's 2 parts of the pier, you can load and offload at the pier, there's different pipes going out to the pier. There are multiple tanks. There is a vaporization facility. There will be a liquefaction facility. So the parties who will have these contracts will have -- certain of them will be allowed to import, certain of them will be allowed to export and we think you should be thinking about it that way rather than segmenting.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it's -- but it's not kind of fully incremental then, it'll just depend on what the relative pricing situation is, whether it's being used for one or the other?","Thomas F. Farrell","I believe that's correct but that'll be up to the party. They'll be paying us once a month, come rain or shine.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on, your slide said you would have no ownership or sourcing of LNG. In the way those contracts are structured, is there any sort of commodity or sort of volume derived commodity exposure or is it just pure and simple flat pricing?","Thomas F. Farrell","Pure and simple capacity theme. No, we will -- there is no commodity risk associated with the income stream at all.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then if I might just have one other. On the sales question. I think you gave a number of 1.1% weather adjusted, was that also adjusted for the leap year or was that kind of including the leap year?","Thomas F. Farrell","No, that includes the leap year.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So absent that, that would have been down a little?","Mark F. McGettrick","Actually, it would've been fairly flat. But -- yes, that's why I referenced, we have a few things that were delayed based on initial expectations. But again, based on the activity we see, we think it\u2019s certainly achievable to still reach the ultimate 2% to 2.5%. But you're right, leap year really reflects most of the growth in the first quarter.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then so if tough connects were up then usage must have been down?","Mark F. McGettrick","Yes, the other thing I referenced, Jonathan, is although we've done the best job we can and as you estimate weather and economy, in an extreme weather quarter, it's very, very difficult to be penny accurate on what goes in what bucket. So again, I think the second quarter will give you a better reflection maybe even third, in terms of what the real growth is here in Virginia.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Fair enough. And then if I can just slide in one other thing. The -- it sounded like this Fairless tax benefit, state tax benefit must have been about $0.04, if it brought your tax rate down to 34% from 37%. Is that accurate and what drove the timing on that?","Mark F. McGettrick","It was about $0.03. And what it was surrounding is we had some historical tax losses at Fairless. And if you recall, that was a capital lease which we had to bring on balance sheet late in the fourth quarter of last year. And by bringing it on balance sheet along with some future earnings projections based on current gas price environments, it allowed us to utilize some of those tax losses earlier than what we thought this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm just circling back with this liquefaction stuff. As you know, the energy markets can be volatile and the politics around them can be volatile as well. And there is, I guess, with some of these licenses, the ability for the U.S. government to restrict exports for national security reasons or what have you, and I'm wondering how you look at that risk and how you dealt with that with respect to this project?","Mark F. McGettrick","We're not getting into details with the contracts, Paul. That is a risk that we believe has been taken care of then protects our shareholders.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And just, in general, from your market outlook, how many of these export facilities do you guys see being built in North America? Do you -- I mean, you guys must have been sort of looking at the market or is it just, does it really matter I guess at this point because like you said you're just basically going to be getting capacity payments and what have you, any thoughts there?","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, I don't -- in our particular case, it really doesn't matter. I'm very confident that we will get the permit from DOE and the environmental permit from FERC. And we will go ahead with the project and we will be getting capacity payments for more than a couple of decades from this facility. As far as overall, I think there are 13 or 14, I think, the number has grown to, permits that people are seeking. And it sort of reminds me of what was going on in the late '90s about how many people were going to build gas fire power plants all over in the United States. And then later about how many people were going to build import facilities all over the United States. And there were many, many announcements made, many, many, many permits sought and a handful actually happened. So I don't really know, Paul, 4, 5, 6 billion a day maybe would be allowed to be exported or could actually come to -- whether allowed or not, actually built, a facility built. But I don't think it's going to be the 13 that are seeking approval now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got one Cove Point question and then a question or 2 at the utility and at the rest of energy. On Cove Point, can you just reaffirm or reiterate what the size of the facility would be or the size of the facility as you've kind of signed up in the agreement so far?","Mark F. McGettrick","It'll be the equivalent of 750 million cubic feet a day. That's not what LNG guys use, as they use tons, but the amount of gas that will come into the facility which will be liquefied, will be about 750 million a day.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is that smaller than what you filed for? Because I thought you all had filed for like a B a day or 7 mtpa a day, kind of roughly?","Mark F. McGettrick","Yes.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Why do smaller size? Is that just a contract issue or construction issue or just why the difference, is all I'm trying to understand.","Mark F. McGettrick","We think it's the optimum size for this site and with these parties.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. O&M, you all did a really good job of managing O&M in the first quarter. How should we think about the O&M trajectory at VEPCO and at Energy throughout the course of the year? Meaning were your O&M savings more front-end loaded? Were they more -- are they going to even get greater year-over-year as we get towards the back end of the year?","Mark F. McGettrick","Michael, they're going to get greater as we move through the year. But I want to make sure I point out the -- on O&M, if you look at the disclosure, if you look at the operating O&M, it drops quarter-over-quarter by about $136 million. $99 million of that has to do with a bad debt rider in Ohio that's trued up every year. And so the bad debt level got lower, that's passed on to customers, but your revenue stream also was reduced, so it's a net 0. So if you look at the quarter, really quarter-over-quarter, operating expenses were down about $0.04 or about $37 million, which was very positive for us. And you should look for us to build on that throughout the year. We said on the last call we expect to reduce expenses between $0.06 and $0.09; you should look for us to be at the high end of that range.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Understand and love my use of [indiscernible] there. Last thing, at electricity demand at VEPCO. Is there concern that there is a structural change among residential and small commercial customers, not necessarily in terms of the new connect but in terms of the usage per customer of installed customer base?","Mark F. McGettrick","Look, I'm going to let Paul Koonce comment on that.","Paul D. Koonce","Michael, we've not seen that. Obviously, quarter-over-quarter the volumes are down but that really has to do with the weather. We've not really seen a structural change. We have a dynamic pricing pilot in place in Virginia right now. And right now we have about 800 customers that have signed up for that rate structure. So we've really not seen any structural change in usage.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So meaning kind of, just kind of think through energy efficiency or some of those other items whether they're actually causing a reduction in electricity demand through the service territory on a weather normal basis?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, I mean, we still see customer additions. We still see electronic devices going into the home. So no, we've not begun to see that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Not to beat a dead horse, but just one clarification question. Do you need to restructure any of your import agreements as part of the export? The other agreements you signed today?","Mark F. McGettrick","No.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay.","Thomas F. Farrell","We've announced, remember a year ago, that we had restructured one of the import contracts.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So even though you don't control the capacity, that's not relevant.","Thomas F. Farrell","We do control the capacity as the result of the renegotiation of the import contract which we announced last year. We're not, when I say no, it is...","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you were planning ahead for this?","Thomas F. Farrell","We did what we needed to do a year ago.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just, Tom, I think you kind of answered this question already but I'll ask it again. Just the DOE, the political aspect that's gone on with the DOE review and the like of export. How concerned are you about that? And does it feel like we're in a bit of like a rush to capture what could be somewhat of a limited audience because of that or is...","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, we're certainly not in a rush. I mean, we started working on this a couple years ago. As we saw -- you think about first -- let's just back up a little bit. The Appalachian region produces, forget the shale, okay, just conventional gas in Appalachia is about a B a day production. So you can fill this facility up to export and leave 1\/4 of Appalachian production left for domestic consumption. So you've got -- we'll export $750 million a day through this facility, for our customer if we want. So there is an abundance of gas in the region. Shale has made that much larger. The economic study that we filed with the permit for the non-NAFTA countries shows enormous economic benefits to Calvert County, Maryland, all of Maryland, all of the Ohio basin, the Appalachian basin, the Ohio River basin that will be, all of the job growth, tax revenues, it's many, many tens of millions of dollars. This project by itself will increase or help our balance of trade by a couple of percentage points on an annual basis. So there are -- the economic arguments are pretty straightforward and they're almost overwhelming that it is beneficial to the United States, the region, Maryland, Calvert County to allow this facility to be built. So that's why we're confident that it will be approved. It doesn't hurt of course, to have a counterparty, at least one counterparty from Japan.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, one last question. Just retail did a lot better this quarter but it seemed like the volumes were flat. Are you just seeing better margins in retail?","Thomas F. Farrell","Paul Koonce will take care of that.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, Steve, just lower supply cost. We've seen obviously wholesale power prices are down, natural gas prices are down and that's coming through in the form of higher margins at retail.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Judge with Atlantic Equities.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Just wanted to ask what your thoughts were on the potential expansion of North Anna now that you have this contract signed.","Thomas F. Farrell","For the expansion of North Anna 3?","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Yes.","Thomas F. Farrell","Talking about building North Anna 3. And I assume you're -- implicit in that question, Nathan, I'm not trying to ask your question for you. Implicit in that is that there's large capital costs associated with 2 projects.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Yes, also and just more of a general concept of what your view of building a new nuclear given the natural gas price environment as well, just as a concept?","Mark F. McGettrick","Okay. We will -- we're pursuing the combined operating license, and MHI is pursuing the design approval. We expect those to occur early '15. We will continue to pursue those. We are -- we believe we will receive both. MHI will get the design approval, we will get the COL. At that time, we're going to assess where we are. Now, I would say this though on a broader basis, if we were contemplating -- if we had been contemplating building a merchant nuclear power station, I think I would have been able to give you a much shorter answer to your question about North Anna 3. But we're not. We believe that it is best for our customers for the long term to have a balanced fuel mix. And by long term, I'm talking over the next 50 or 60 years. Having 4 nuclear power stations in Virginia is one of the reasons why we have among the lowest rates in the United States, and among the lowest on the East Coast. So we think it's important to keep all that in context as you make those kind of decisions. I believe North Anna 3 will be built by our company. I don't know if it will be in 2015 or 2018 or 2020. But we will -- North Anna and Surry's existing units will have to retire in 2030 through that decade. And we're going to need to have nuclear power in the state to keep a balanced portfolio. So I would give you 2 different answers. One, if we were a merchant, I would have just said what's North Anna 3? I don't know what you're talking about. But we're not. We're in a regulated environment where it's important for our customers to have a balanced fuel mix.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Just as it relates to capital constraints, if you were indeed building, as you mentioned, the LNG facility around 2014. Perhaps you started to spend capital on North Anna. Is there actual enough capacity to then add on offshore wind?","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, that's also a good question. Probably offshore wind and North Anna probably would not go forward at the same time. I think that's unlikely.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Do you have a better sense of when the offshore wind could come to fruition if it does?","Thomas F. Farrell","I think that's going to be a long permitting process. They haven't even done the lease sales yet but it's one that we're going to continue to observe and participate in. But I think it's a long process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On the Sierra Club and their complaint against you guys, I guess there's some confusion over what their -- what the agreement originally was and if you can just kind of share how you think you can work around their complaints, as they see them today?","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, I don't think there's any confusion about it. The agreement -- there's an agreement that was entered into I think in the 1990s that has sort of carried through this process with the Sierra Club. We've had a very cooperative relationship with the Sierra Club all through that time. We've been very good partners with each other. We hope to continue to be, as we move into the liquefaction. I'll let them speak for themselves but the agreement allows us to use the existing footprint and we're carrying on LNG operations to perform liquefaction exercises and to deliver liquefied natural gas for the terminal. So I don't think there's really a lot of confusion about it. It's pretty clear in black and white. I'll let them speak for themselves. We would much rather, as we do with all folks -- all stakeholders in which we're going to have an impact. We like to work out cooperative arrangements. We always have with the Sierra Club. We hope that we can as we go along here but we have the right to build it and we're going to proceed accordingly.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We have reached the conclusion of our call. Mr. McGettrick, do you have any closing remarks?","Mark F. McGettrick","Yes, thank you. I appreciate everybody tuning in today and just want to remind everybody our second quarter earnings release is scheduled for August 1. And our first quarter Q will be distributed today.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. Instructions will be given to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning, for the Safe Harbor Statement.","Thomas E. Hamlin - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter 2016 earnings conference call for Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for email alerts and view our third quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also, on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.","Joining us on the call this afternoon are our CEO, Tom Farrell, our CFO, Mark McGettrick, and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the third quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. He will also discuss Dominion Midstream's financing of its planned acquisition of Questar pipeline which was priced this morning. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities, and review the progress we have made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good afternoon. Dominion Resources' reported operating earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter of 2016, finishing well above the top of our guidance range. Positive factors relative to guidance for the quarter were favorable weather, lower operating expenses, and earlier approval of our Questar acquisition and partnership income from one of our large solar projects. Some of the partnership income is timing-related and will reverse in the fourth quarter. Negative factors were an unplanned outage at Millstone and higher major storm restoration cost.","GAAP earnings were $1.10 per share for the third quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings were charges related to transaction cost for our merger with Questar. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.","Moving to results by operating segment, for Dominion Virginia Power, EBITDA for the third quarter was $423 million, which was in the upper half of its guidance range. Favorable weather conditions were partially offset by higher major storm restoration costs.","Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $921 million in the third quarter, which exceeded the top of its guidance range. Favorable weather was the principal factor in the strong performance, partially offset by an unplanned outage at Millstone.","Third quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $310 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. Lower operating expenses and an earlier-than-planned contribution from Questar were the principal drivers of the strong results. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of each of our operating segments.","For the third quarter of 2016, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $27.9 million, 37% higher than the level produced in the third quarter of last year. Distributable cash flow increased 22% to $24.1 million, which was consistent with management's expectations.","On October 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.2475 per unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our plan to achieve 22% annual distribution growth for LP units.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion, funds from operations were $3.1 billion for the first nine months of the year. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities and, taking into account cash, short-term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $2.5 billion. For statements on cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the Earnings Release Kit.","During the third quarter, we completed a number of financing transactions to support our growth plan and cover the acquisition of Questar. Slide 6 highlights our recent financing activities. We have one public debt financing planned for the remainder of this year at VEPCO. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Dominion's operating earnings guidance is $0.90 to $1.05 per share. The midpoint of that range is $0.28 per share above operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015.","Positive earnings drivers for the quarter compared to last year are a return to normal weather, the absence of a refueling outage at Millstone, lower capacity expenses and the addition of Questar. Negative drivers for the quarter compared to last year include higher financing costs and DD&A. Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.60 to $4.00 per share.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 27 of the Earnings Release Kit. As of mid-October, we have hedged 8% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We expect to add to our hedges over the next three months and plan to have about 80% of our 2017 production hedged by the end of January.","So, let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2016, which was well above our guidance range. Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations. And finally, Dominion's operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter is $0.90 to $1.05 per share and full-year earnings guidance remains $3.60 to $4.00 per share.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good afternoon. Strong operational and safety performance continued in the third quarter. All of our business units are on track to meet their safety goals for the year. We expect to set another company-wide safety record this year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our six units was 93% for the first nine months of the year. The contribution of the Brunswick County Power Station helped our regulated power generation group achieve record net generation.","Now, for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. Approximately 480 workers are on site performing civil and structural work. The $1.3 billion project is expected to achieve commercial operations in late 2018. Our two large contracted solar projects, Four Brothers and Three Cedars in Utah, were completed in September on time and on budget. We own 50% of the two projects that have a combined capacity of 530 megawatts and are secured by 20-year power purchase agreements.","We have a number of solar projects under development in the state of Virginia, and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers, including datacenters, military installations and the state government. The 80-megawatt solar facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore is complete and went into the service \u2013 went into service over this past weekend. Three other Virginia solar projects totaling 56 megawatts are also expected to be in service by year-end. Earlier this month, we announced a 60-megawatt solar development in North Carolina, secured by 25-year power purchase agreements. This project should also be in service by the end of this year.","We have filed with State Corporation Commission for approval of an additional 20-megawatt solar facility at the site of our Remington power station to be in service next year. In July, we signed a lease with the Department of the Navy to develop an 18-megawatt solar facility at the Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia. If approved by the State Corporation Commission, this solar facility is expected to be in service by late next year. This will bring our operating solar fleet to 1,200 megawatts by the end of 2017. We are in discussions with multiple parties for further solar development in the future, and we fully expect to exceed our goal of adding 500 megawatts of solar farms in Virginia and North Carolina.","We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $580 million worth of these facilities have been completed so far this year, including our new systems operation center. We expect to place over $730 million of new transmission assets into service by year-end.","Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point Liquefaction project is now 75% complete, with over 2,000 construction workers on site. Our engineering, procurement and construction contractor, IHI\/Kiewit, has installed well over half of the 21,500 tons of the structural steel required, and the piping installation is proceeding on plan. All major components have been delivered to the site, and all will be installed on their foundations by year-end.","Our operation staffing plan is also on schedule. The project continues to be on time and on budget for a late 2017 in-service date. We continue to work towards the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. FERC issued its Notice of Schedule on August 12. We expect to receive the Draft EIS in a few weeks and the final EIS in June. We anticipate beginning construction upon receipt of the FERC certificate during the second half of next year.","Surveying and pipeline engineering is nearly complete and will be finished this year. We're finalizing our detailed construction plans, and on September 16, executed the construction contract with Spring Ridge Constructors. We expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header in the second half of 2019.","In addition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header, we have 10 pipeline growth projects underway with $1 billion of investment to move 1.5 million cubic feet per day for customers by the end of 2018. On the (13:02) project, with more than 200,000 dekatherms per day of capacity, it was put into service in October. And we have another three projects to come online this year. Our new expansion projects are primarily demand driven, moving gas and to end-use power generators for local distribution companies.","In regulatory matters, hearings were held earlier this month for Dominion's base rate case for our North Carolina service territories, seeking approval of a $51.1 million increase in base rate revenues. A settlement was reached with the staff and a group of investor customers calling for a $34.7 million increase based on a 9.9% return on equity. We will implement the proposed rates subject to refund tomorrow with permanent rates becoming effective January 1 of next year. A decision is expected in December.","Finally, I want to update you on our merger with Questar Corporation. The Public Service Commission of Utah approved the merger on August 23 and the Wyoming Public Service Commission approved it on September 14. We completed the merger two days later. Ron Jibson, Questar's retired Chairman and CEO, has joined Dominion's Board of Directors. Harris Simmons, the former lead Director for Questar has joined the board of Dominion Midstream Partners. We are excited about adding Questar to Dominion's operations and look forward to developing new growth opportunities in the Western states.","So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the third quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction project is on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project. And we are excited about our future opportunities that will come as a result of our merger with Questar.","I will now return the call to Mark for a discussion of our financings at Dominion Midstream Partners.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Tom. We issued press releases this morning announcing the launch and subsequent pricing our Dominion Midstream financing to acquire Questar Pipeline. I wanted to discuss it on this afternoon's call for a number of reasons. First, it represents one of the largest financing transactions by a publicly traded MLP this year. Second, based on the low initial yield for the preferred equity and the modest discount to market for the common units, this financing was the least expensive for an MLP issuer this year. It provides clear evidence of the high level of interest by investors in DM equity.","Third, despite being one of the largest offerings this year, demand for the common equity was significantly oversubscribed, leading us to upsize the offering. Fourth, the successful financing validates our strategic plan for Dominion Midstream Partners which involves accessing capital markets at advantageous terms to fund the acquisition of midstream assets from Dominion that will in turn support a 22% annual distribution growth rate. And finally, this successful financing in low-achieved yields confirm the value accretive proposition underlying the formation of Dominion Midstream two years ago for investors of both D and DM.","As noted in this morning's press releases, Dominion Midstream Partners will acquire 100% interest in Questar Pipeline on or about December 1 for an implied enterprise value of $1.725 billion or about 10.3 times 2016 EBITDA. About $435 million of existing long-term debt will remain in place at Questar Pipeline, leaving net consideration of just about $1.3 billion. As announced this morning, we have priced common unit offering including both an underwritten offering in a private placement totaling some $500 million assuming underwriters exercise the greenshoe option.","Again, I would note that this common unit offering registered is one of the largest MLP unit offerings of the year and at just 2.9% reflects, by far, the smallest discount to any trade of any offering this year.","We have also received commitments from a group of private investors led by Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners for up to $600 million in convertible preferred securities, which was priced together with this morning's offering and which closes in conjunction with the transaction close on December 1.","Among comparable securities offered by MLPs, this preferred security has the lowest ever initial yield of 4.75% and an attractive conversion premium of 15%. It is clear from the interest in DM preferred structure, investors see very high growth potential in DM shares. We very much appreciate the overwhelming interest and participation in this offering from both public and private investors.","At closing, the cash consideration to Dominion provided by these offerings will be used to repay existing Dominion level debt. We will also refinance the existing DM intercompany note with a three-year term note from a group of banks.","As shown on slide 19, including the $1.2 billion of proceeds from this transaction, we expect the MLP to generate about $7 billion to $8 billion in cash for Dominion through 2020, which will be used to reduce holding company debt, increase dividends, invest in new growth projects and repurchase common stock.","We realize the D\/DM structure is somewhat unique in the utility space, and investors have been waiting for us to begin to execute our dropdown strategy. We expect that with the success of today's transactions, both D and DM investors will see the clearer long-term growth in value for both shareholders and unit holders.","With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will open the floor for questions. And the first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So, perhaps, first quick question, can you elaborate just a little bit on the Millstone hedging plan from here on out? I just want to make sure if I heard you right; 80% from 8% largely today by early 2017. Is that sort of irrespective of the commodity environment? And perhaps, more importantly, how are you thinking about hedging future years, 2018, 2019 at this point?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Julien, it's Mark. The answer to the first part of your question is it's regardless of what the market power price will be between now and the end of January. We committed over many years to investors and the credit agencies that there'll be a clear firm cash flow stream from Millstone as we put guidance out in the current period. So we've always hedged Millstone in the 80%-plus range by the end of the year call, and we plan on doing the same for 2017.","In terms of future periods, we will be very cautious on hedging Millstone for a number of reasons. One is we believe that the current forward strip is dramatically understating the value of the market. And second, as you know, there is a lot of discussion in Connecticut about potential legislation and the ability to Millstone bid into future auctions. We hope that would be cleared up in the first half of next year, and we would want to see what the outcome of that would be before we hedge 2018 and beyond.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Just to follow up real quickly \u2013 obviously, well done on closing Questar. Just what's the status in terms of future growth opportunities? Can you elaborate just real quickly in terms of where you stand on some of the initial thoughts you'd originally delineated with that transaction?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Julien, the more we look, the more opportunities we see. The West \u2013 that part of the West is largely powered by coal-fired power plants. Many of them are going to have to close or be converted to natural gas. There's an increasing amount of RPS requirements in states on \u2013 particularly on the Western Sea Coast where, as you know, and I think investors know, the more renewables that are built, the more gas-fired peakers are going to be required to deal with the fact that it's intermittent.","So, that's just one potential opportunity that we see in the West. There's a lot of natural gas infrastructure that's going to be required in the future there. Now, it's not on the same scale obviously as the Mid-Atlantic as far as population goes. But starting from the base that we have in the West, we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But nothing more specific at this point in time?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","No.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come...","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Nothing more after six weeks of ownership, no.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mr. Arnold, please make sure your phone is not on mute, sir. The next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Congratulations on the equity offerings today, especially on the preferred, which effectively look like the same cost of equity as the common when factoring in the IDRs. Given your ability to access far more equity than the majority of your MLP peers out there, I'm just wondering if you can provide us any updated thoughts as far as what you think about opportunistic M&A out there given your ability to access so much equity on attractive terms today.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Jeremy, this is Mark. We were very pleased \u2013 although we were always confident, as we've stated to investors over the past nine months, based on what we've heard from investors that lack (24:39) liquidity in the DM stock. We knew there'd be a lot of interest. We've been particularly pleased with the convert and interest shown in that by multiple parties, and the very aggressive financing around that. So, I think that just reinforces our view that if we see an asset out there that fits the DM profile that we can fund it within the DM umbrella if we need to, or with D parent support if required. But I think today's results just validate for us that the DM shares are highly valued and will be a great source of future equity financing if we decide to enter the M&A stage (25:20) at all.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That makes sense. And then, just one follow-up if I could. There's been some concern in the market with regards to recent developments from the IRS, and just wondering if you might be able to comment there, maybe this alters one mechanism that you guys were looking at for dropdowns, but it seems like your targets over time would be largely unchanged. Is that a fair way to think about things?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Yes. Our targets will be unchanged, and I think your reference is that the IRS after this calendar year do not allow certain tax shields that existed prior to that \u2013 that MLPs can make themselves available to. But we have a long-term tax planning for each of the years through 2020. We were aware of that potential down the road, and it will not impact either our growth rate or distribution focus going forward. That has been incorporated into our tax planning for quite some time.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Mark, just on \u2013 you mentioned this solar that you booked in the quarter, but then some of it will come out in Q4. Could you just explain that a little better?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Sure, Steve. This solar involves partnership income from one project, Four Brothers in Utah, and it's complicated partnership accounting. When we put the guidance out \u2013 actually, when we put the budget together this year, we thought the contribution will be evenly distributed over a number of quarters, but the final accounting determination required us to book $0.04 in the third quarter and that will roll off $0.02 in the fourth quarter and $0.02 in the first half of next year. So that's a timing issue for the quarter, but for year-end, there's no impact on our guidance at all.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, can I just have handy the number for the full year of what you're expecting for earnings to be for 2016?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","And I believe \u2013 in terms of ITCs, I think we're looking about $290 million.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, on the transaction, which is great, you got that done. The \u2013 just in terms of thinking about kind of the \u2013 so you're selling the asset down, you're getting the IDRs back. I think you're keeping \u2013 what percent of DM are you going to own now after this transaction?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","North of 50% still.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. All right.","Operator","Thank you for the question.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Good.","Operator","The next question will come from Rose-Lynn Armstrong with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Can you provide an update on the outlook for the ITC realization in 2017? I think on the last quarter call, you indicated potential for up to $0.30 of ITCs next year.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Yes, Rose-Lynn. I would continue to model $0.30 for next year.","Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And are those from identified projects at this point or still to be announced, still to be determined?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Almost all of them are identified. We have a few others that we're still working on. But I would say we're very far down the road in terms of identifying what supports the ITC estimate for 2017.","Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Angie Storozynski with Maguire \u2013 Macquarie, I'm sorry. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So, I just want to go back to the 2017 guidance. So, what do we need as far as developments to happen for you to be able to provide 2017 guidance? Are we waiting for some legislative actions in Connecticut? Are we waiting for the start of commercial testing at Cove Point, or are we simply waiting for the annual Analyst Day around, say, February, March timeframe?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Angie, for 2017, we almost always give guidance on the year-end call, which is typically at the very end of January, beginning of February. The only thing we're really waiting on for 2017 is what will the actual hedge price be at Millstone. And since we're pretty open at Millstone right now, we hesitate giving any guidance range for 2017 until we're much further down the road on hedging.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And now, the dropdown today to DM, clearly very successful, but is it coming a bit early in a sense \u2013 I understand that the funds that you're raising from DM are aimed to de-lever the balance sheet, but are you, in a sense, trying to manage your interest expense for 2017 by accelerating this DM dropdown, or is it simply an opportunistic timing?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","It's more of the latter. We really believe we have overhang on both these stocks based on an anticipated offering at DM. We also, I think \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, people have been waiting for us to validate the structure of D and DM and those advantages and really answer the question, can you access the equity market at DM at a very high level that benefits both DM and D. So, based on that, we elected to go early. We didn't have to do it until the third quarter of next year, but we wanted to get it behind us. It does help us on financing a little bit at D next year, but the principal reason was to validate the model and to show the investor base that DM is a security that is sought after and has huge benefits to DM and D shareholders.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And then, the last question on Atlantic Coast Pipeline. So, with the start of construction in, I think you said, second half of 2017, are we basically assuming that you're booking AFUDC from the moment you start construction, and so the impact on earnings of the delay of the start of operations (32:53) simply because you're booking AFUDC earning during construction?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","I think that's right, Angie. I think that's why you ought to have it in your \u2013 in mind.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Hi, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","The first question \u2013 hi. Good afternoon. First question was on \u2013 you've kind of indicated the $7 billion to $8 billion of cash that you expect Dominion to generate from the MLP through 2020. Just wanted to understand what kind of financing mix you're thinking about at the MLP to kind of fund the growth and kind of pay back Dominion. And secondly, in terms of future ownership, how do you see that ownership level of Dominion stay over this timeframe through 2020?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Praful, this is Mark. I think you're going to see it, and today's examples are a good one. You're going to see the financing will be a combination of preferred common units and debt by adding leverage at DM; although, we said many times that we're going to make sure it's investment-grade rated when we decide to rate it, but it'll be a mix of the three. We'll also potentially take back some units as part of that for tax planning purposes.","But again, with the ability today and the market we have today to raise over $1 billion for the first transaction out there, and as the size of DM grows over the next couple of years, we're very optimistic about being able to place the financing.","In terms of ownership, I think you could \u2013 should assume that for the next several years our ownership is going to stay in the 50% range, and then over time, toward the end of the decade, start to move down more into the 40% range.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you. And then originally, you were talking about Millstone, and just nuclear in general, you were talking about \u2013 thinking about hedging depending on the support you get. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you expect in terms of the kind of support, is it similar to a New York ZEC kind of program or what you expect and where in the regulatory approval process it stands right now?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Let's go back to \u2013 the hedging will happen, as Mark said, regardless of what the price is. We've done that for a long time and we will continue to do it into the future. So everybody knows what expectations we should have for earnings and cash flows.","As far as the Connecticut, the New York example, as I understand New York, is a \u2013 basically a tax payer subsidization of two facilities in the northern part of New York without any support going to the Indian Point reactors outside New York City. That's how I understand it. Just from recent trade press, I see similar moves are being followed into Illinois, for example.","Connecticut has gone about it in a different way. They have a RPS standard there and an auction has been established for some years where the LSEs bid \u2013 take their \u2013 meet their RPS requirements by auctions from renewable suppliers into that RPS auction on an annual basis. The contemplation by the legislature, not the regulators, in Connecticut is to expand that to a clean power standard that would include nuclear which would allow up to approximately 50% of Millstone to be included in that auction. That at this point obviously is still in contemplation by the legislature. There is some momentum behind it. We're following it very closely, but it won't affect 2017. It would affect 2018 and beyond.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The final question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mr. Weinstein, please make sure your phone is not on mute, sir.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","How about \u2013 hello, can you hear me now?","Operator","Yes, sir.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Sorry about that. Hi. Congratulations on getting the financing done. What kind of an assumption are you making on the $7 billion to $8 billion cash projection going forward? Considering the price that was received, I guess, for $23.20 for the LP units, and can we assume that it's going to still be a 10 to 11 (37:43) dropdown based on $7 billion to $8 billion?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","We can't answer that question today. We'll have to see what the market bears and what the conflicts committee is comfortable with. It's a long period of time, but I will say that the remaining dropdowns this decade are principally around the Cove Point export facility which we place a very high value on. So we'll see. We said two years ago if we were to model it, we'd model 11 times. So, this transaction went at 10.3. I think anything between 10 and 11 would be a very realistic data point, but we'll have to see what asset drops and what the market will bear at that time.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","When do the converts \u2013 when do the preferred converts convert over?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","That's a complicated question. We have certain conversion rights here at Dominion and then there's other conversion rights by the owners. I'll be glad to answer that after the call for you, but it's probably too complex to go into on the call.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Okay. Got you. Anyway, congratulations. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. Instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning, for the Safe Harbor statement. You may begin.","Thomas Hamlin - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter 2018 earnings conference call for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our Earnings Release Kit. Schedules in the Earnings Release Kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for e-mail alerts, and view our second quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dominionenergy.com and dominionenergymidstream.com. In addition to the Earnings Release Kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.","And now, for the usual cautionary language. The earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also, on this call, we will discuss some measure of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the Earnings Release Kit and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners' press releases.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results, financing plan and Dominion Energy's earnings guidance. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we have made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $0.86 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which was well above the top of our guidance range. Drivers of these positive results for the quarter relative to our guidance include: lower operating expenses, favorable weather, and more benefit from tax reform than anticipated.","GAAP earnings were $0.69 per share for the quarter. The principal differences between GAAP and operating earnings were an update of the expected coal ash remediation costs and the impact on prior year's results from a FERC capitalization review. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.","Moving to results by business segment, EBITDA for our Power Generation Group was $639 million in the second quarter, which exceeded the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expenses and favorable weather were the main contributors.","Our Gas Infrastructure and Power Delivery groups produced second quarter EBITDA of $534 million and $410 million, respectively, both of which were near the middle of their guidance range. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong results from our operating groups.","Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $76.3 million for the second quarter of 2018, compared to $68.6 million produced in the second quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow was $49.3 million, which was 21% above last year's second quarter.","On July 25, Dominion Energy Midstream's board of directors declared a distribution of $0.351 per common unit payable on August 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment. Our coverage ratio remained strong at 1.11 times at the end of the second quarter.","On June 29, the board of directors of the general partner, or Dominion Energy Midstream, exercised its IDR reset election option pursuant to terms outlined in the partnership agreement. By restructuring the IDRs, we expect to extend our ability to recommend distribution increases while we continue to evaluate next steps for DM.","Tom Farrell will discuss FERC's recent clarification on the recovery of income taxes by MLP owned pipelines in a few moments. However, neither the FERC's recent actions nor the reset election changes our previous guidance of no drops into DM during 2018, while we continue to monitor the sustainability of MLP capital markets.","Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy, execution of our 2018 financing plan is well underway with continued progress toward achieving our credit goals as discussed on last quarter's call. The most significant remaining transaction is the $3 billion project level financing at Cove Point, which will be in the form of a three-year non-amortizing term loan. This financing is currently in syndication with commitments for over half of the total already received and the balance will be committed in the next two weeks. We expect to close this transaction next month. As a reminder, proceeds of this financing must be used to repay parent-level debt. As to asset sales, we are in the process of evaluating indications of interests for a number of our non-core assets and expect to announce results of that initiative before our next earnings call.","Now, to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy, operating earnings for the third quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share compared to $1.04 per share earned from last year's third quarter. Positive factors for this year relative to the third quarter of 2017 are earnings from Cove Point, lower tax expense due to tax reform, and a return to normal weather. Negative factors relative to last year are lower solar-related investment tax credits, higher financing costs and a higher share count. Operating earnings guidance for 2018 is unchanged at $3.80 to $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Given the strong results for the first half of this year, we expect to produce full-year results in the upper half of our guidance range. Our earnings growth rate also remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period.","So, let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.86 per share for the second quarter, exceeding the top end of our guidance range. These results were driven by strong performance by our Power Generation Group and higher-than-expected benefits from tax reform. Based on the very strong results for the second quarter, we expect to be in the upper half of our 2018 guidance range, and our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8%.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning. Our employees' strong safety performance continued through the first half of 2018. I'm very proud of our company-wide commitment to industry leading safety performance. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our six units for the first half of this year was 95%. Dominion Energy's nuclear fleet has been operating for 660 days and counting, without an unplanned reactor shutdown. The previous record was 339 days set in 2012.","We continue to see strong electric sales growth at Virginia Power. Weather normalized sales for the first half of the year were 2.25%, above the first half of last year, and have grown at a 1.7% rate for the last 18 months, led by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. During the first half of this year, nine new data center campuses were connected. Over the past year, we have added over 400 megawatts of demand capacity across 14 data centers and expect to see continued strong growth.","Cove Point Liquefaction entered commercial service early this quarter, and has been operating as designed. Customer utilization is high, as evidenced by the more than 60 billion cubic feet of LNG loaded across 19 cargoes thus far. We continue making progress tuning and ramping activities typical for these early months of operation.","Now, for an update on our growth plans, construction of the 1,588 megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station continues on time and on budget. The $1.3 billion project is 95% complete. We have achieved first fire and grid sync of the GT-1C and GT-1B turbines, and expect to fire and sync the one GT-1A turbine within the next two weeks. 226 of 253 systems are in commissioning. The Greensville County station is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year.","We have begun full construction on numerous portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Project, including full construction on all 2018 Supply Header scheduled spreads and active construction in all four West Virginia mountain spreads for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.","You may have read that we voluntarily requested a temporary suspension in water body crossings in West Virginia. We remain committed to full compliance with our nationwide permit and have requested this stay temporarily to ensure that the Army Corps has the adequate time to review our plans. We do not expect any significant delays resulting from that review.","Just last week, FERC approved our request to begin full mainline construction in North Carolina and mobilization is already underway. Upon approval of our erosion and sediment plan by the Virginia DEQ, which we expect in the coming weeks, we will file a FERC Notice to Proceed for mainline construction in Virginia as well. Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Projects are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of next year.","In regulatory matters, we are pleased that the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued its final RFP for procurement of zero carbon resources yesterday in Connecticut. Moreover, we are pleased the DEEP modified the at-risk time period. By doing so, DEEP acknowledged that an existing resource that is determined to be at-risk should have all of its attributes valued now.","On May 1, Dominion submitted a petition for at-risk treatment with the Public Utility Regulatory authority which included a full accounting of Millstone's financials. We expect Millstone to be granted at-risk status, which means the bids will be judged on price and non-price attributes, such as carbon, economic impact and fuel security.","RFP bids for all zero carbon resources are due September 14, and DEEP is expected to select winners by the end of the year. Winning bidders will execute contracts with the local electric distribution companies thereafter and receive final pure approval early next year.","We are also pleased that FERC responded to request for clarification of its March statement on income tax recovery for pipelines owned by MLPs. In an order two weeks ago, FERC reinforced its position that commercial contracts with negotiated rates such as those for Cove Point and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline are not affected by tax-related recourse rate modifications.","We continue to study other aspects of the Commission's revised guidance. While FERC's action provides some increased clarity, we will need to have more confidence in the long-term sustainability of the MLP capital markets before resuming our drop-down strategy.","Last week, we made our first regulatory filing of the Virginia's Grid Transformation & Security Act, the law enacted earlier this year that paves the way for immediate customer savings, expanded investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology; a stronger, more secure electric grid and improved energy efficiency programs. The filing requests a Corporation Commission to approve the programs, investments and costs included in the first three-year phase of the 10-year grid transformation program.","The phase 1 filing calls for over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security. In a separate filing, the company will seek to add 240 megawatts of solar energy in Virginia. The company will soon seek SEC approval for its proposed Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. The 12-megawatt facility would be the first of its kind in the mid-Atlantic located in a federal lease area about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. This two-turbine test project is being developed with \u00d8rsted Energy of Denmark, a global leader in offshore wind generation.","Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. As you know, on January 3, we announced our agreement where Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Included in the offer was a customer benefit proposal including upfront payments and ongoing bill reductions, which would substantially and permanently reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development project.","SCANA has filed a motion to enjoin the South Carolina Public Service Commission from imposing a temporary rate reduction pursuant to legislation enacted earlier this summer on grounds that it is an unconstitutional taking and violative of its due process rights. Hearings on the matter were held Monday and Tuesday of this week, and we are awaiting the judge's decision. The judge stated that she expects to rule soon and before August 7.","And yesterday, the merger was overwhelmingly approved by SCANA's shareholders, with a 98% vote of those voting. We've also received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission and approvals from the Georgia Public Service Commission and FERC. We will file testimony with South Carolina Public Service Commission this week. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by regulators and we can complete the transaction later this year.","So, to summarize, our business has delivered record-setting operating and strong safety performance for the second quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. We have begun full construction on portions of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Project, and anticipate full construction along the entire route later this summer. We are on track to be in service late next year.","Cove Point Liquefaction achieved commercial in-service early in the second quarter and is operating as designed. We are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year. And finally, our operating earnings continue to be very strong, and we expect to finish the year in the upper half of our guidance range.","With that, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. Our first question will come from Steve Fleishman, Wolfe.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I know this order just came out, but just the decision by FERC or proposed decision by FERC yesterday on the Enable MRT case and how they interpreted the kind of C-Corp\/MLP tax relationship. Any thoughts on how that might impact from your standpoint?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","We're taking a look at the order. Obviously, Steve, as you said, it came out last night. But I'll let Mark comment further on our whole issue around MLP.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Steve, as we've talked about in the past, there's two main issues around the sector today. The first and the largest issue has to do with, is the MLP sector open to equity at all. And based on my knowledge, over the past eight months, there's only been one transaction done. It was done at a very significant discount for a very small amount of equity. We're a drop-down story and so that market is not open to us and this mechanism doesn't work for us at DM.","The second issue is the one that you referenced and that is the FERC ability to gross up for assets that are held within MLPs. Our structure is a little bit different than Enable, but it is of a concern to us and it's something we will be watching closely. But I have to say, of the two issues, market access is the bigger one for us. We've been watching it closely for several months, and we'll be talking to both Dominion Energy board and the Dominion Midstream board over the next several months on what the current state of the MLP market is in terms of equity for their consideration.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just is there any timeline on this kind of review with DM? Is it the next three to six months? Is it a year?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Oh, no, it's going to be certainly no longer than the three to six months. And I would say it's probably going to be more on the short side of that.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then one other question, just on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, so this Fourth Circuit Court seems to be a problem, at least on Mountain Valley. I know you're addressing the Army Corps permit. But then last week, we had the permit from the Forest Service and BLM, and I don't know if you have an issue potentially with those two. Could you just talk a little bit more about how you're managing things other than just the water crossings and conviction that you can hit the timeline?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","So, Steve, I'll give a preliminary answer and I will turn it over to Diane Leopold. Speaking about the Fourth Circuit, I just saw headlines. I haven't read the decision. It actually came out this morning that Fourth Circuit upheld the MVP 401 permits from Virginia just this morning.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","And I can assure you, ours has been a very thorough review with the Virginia DEQ on our 401 permit. And as far as the others, the stay that we asked for voluntarily with the Corps of Engineers, I'll have Diane talk about it. The Forest Service issues we have are different than MVP had had, but Diane will cover that for you.","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Okay. Good morning. So let me start with the Army Corps issue. In that case, it's related to a 72-hour time limit to cross the stream. And our cases are very different in there. And Mountain Valley is through theirs right now. We have been committed, remain committed to be able to make those crossings in that timeframe to meet the compliance requirement, and we'll continue to do so.","Just out of an abundance of caution, we decided that we would request this temporary suspension so that we can have the time to talk that through with the Army Corps and they can thoroughly review the crossings and our design and our methods for compliance within that.","With respect to the latest one with Mountain Valley, there were two issues: there's the BLM, which does not apply to us; and then the Forest Service. And while there are certain aspects of the case that was raised in the Atlantic Coast appeal also, we do believe the facts and circumstances to be quite different between the two. And the Forest Service, in our case, has conducted a very thorough and rigorous and very transparent review of our impacts. And so, we do believe and are confident that the agency will proceed with our \u2013 will be upheld \u2013 the approval will be upheld and affirmed by the court in the case of the Forest Service issue.","And then our final issue is we're continuing to work through this incidental take permit. The Fish and Wildlife Service helpfully put on record to FERC that it does not impact the majority of our areas, including North Carolina. So we received our Notice to Proceed for North Carolina last week and are mobilizing there. So we answered questions back to the Fish and Wildlife Service as they process our new incidental take permit, and we expect that to be resolved quickly.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Long and short of that, Steve, is that nothing has happened and we don't expect anything to happen that will take us off our schedule late next year.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Angie Storozynski, Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So my first question is you guys mentioned that there was a larger-than-expected tax benefit. So is it just related to this quarter or will it have annual implications?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Hey, Angie, this is Mark. We operate in multiple jurisdictions. And as we put out guidance at the beginning of the year, we've put our best foot forward on what we thought how different people would handle things. Obviously, it's going to be better than what we thought this year. On the first quarter call, I think we expected $0.10 to $0.15 annual benefit from tax reform. It's certainly going to be probably in the $0.15 to $0.20 range, at least, and a large portion of that will continue mainly driven by our contracted or unregulated assets.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That's okay. Thank you. On the term loan on the project debt for Cove Point, is this \u2013 I mean, the fact that it's a three-year loan, I mean, is it surprisingly short or it's just my perception?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","I think ultimately we would want to have a longer loan for Cove, but the legal structure around Cove Point involved Midstream right now. And to make sure that it's a very clean document, we elected to go short on this and got all of our banking partners comfortable. So they're going to take this loan for the three-year period. It's important to note that we can prepay this loan at any time with no penalty. So we'll see what the long-term financing should be around Cove. I suspect it will be much longer than three years.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And my last question, the renewable growth in Virginia. Just remind me, was this included \u2013 so both solar and offshore wins? Were those included in your updated growth plan that you launched last year?","Paul D. Koonce - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Angie, this is Paul Koonce. The Grid Transformation & Security Act found that 5,000 megawatts was in the public interest of renewables, onshore and offshore. So, last week, we announced our intent to have 3,000 megawatts, either in operation or in development by 2022. Some of that will be in the form of PPA, some of that will be self-developed, and we are in the process of updating those capital schedules now. Mark and team will be communicating that later this fall.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Angie, let me add, the incremental spend that wouldn't be disclosed already would be mainly in the 2020 to 2022 timeframe. We announced previously that we're going to have CapEx reductions of about $1 billion from previous plans. We're committed to that. But there will be incremental capital added 2020 to 2022. We'll give that update as we usually do in the fall timeframe.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So perhaps just a quick clarifying question, following up on Steve's earlier one on the ACP. Can you just give us a little bit of a sense for potential critical milestones when it comes to just timeline itself? Obviously, there's certain windows for construction et cetera, just to give us a little bit more sense of your added comfort here on the timeline, so sort of sidestepping the specific issues of which obviously you've addressed already with Steve earlier, but just \u2013 is there a critical date by which you need to get clarity?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","There's nothing pending that we'll \u2013 nothing we're working on, nor anything pending that gives us any concern about the timeline.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","If something happened in the future, but where we are today, there is nothing that we are working on with regulators or it's in the courts that we think will affect the timing.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you for the clarity there. But, separately, going back to some of the other commentary about financing, can you elaborate a little bit on your thoughts on asset sales at this point just vis-\u00e0-vis you've obviously got a number of different things potentially contemplated? Just curious, Blue Racer, power plants, et cetera, I mean, is there a preference, a pecking order, if you will, on assets to potentially sell down to reach your targets and again the timeline there, it would seem at least per the media that things are already underway?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Julien, it's Mark. We don't really have a preference. We're going to take the best value that we offered if we think it's fair value on the assets that we talk about previously. Obviously, from some of the prepared remarks you can see we're pretty far down the road on some of this since we're going to \u2013 we believe anyway we'll announce results prior to the next quarter's call.","There's been a lot of interest in both Blue Racer and in the fossil assets, and we're talking to a number of different parties seriously about those. So we think we'll have closure on FPs (29:35). They probably won't be closed by the end of the third quarter, but we'll certainly have clarity and have signed documents to go ahead and move toward a closing process in the near term after that. We're quite optimistic on it. The asset is a whole of lot value, and I think the counterparties we're talking to, at least in the early stages, agree with that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And to clarify there, just to be extra clear, could you potentially sell all of the assets, or are you singularly solving for a proceeds number?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","We don't have to sell all those assets to meet the credit targets and debt reduction that we've committed to, but we could sell all those assets if the value met the thresholds that we were looking for.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Excellent. Thank you, all. Best of luck.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just to follow up, I think I understood that last point on Julien's question on the non-core assets. But I guess in general, are you encouraged by the level of interest and indications that you've been receiving so far?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Very encouraged. Again, we...","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","...we're always talking to assets that have a lot of value and based on discussions with multiple parties, so obviously a lot of other people do as well.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then just on Atlantic Coast Pipeline, I think you gave a lot of great color. I just wanted to make sure I understood the Fish and Wildlife process in the state of Virginia. Where do we stand on that, and what's the sort of next steps there?","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Well, Fish and Wildlife, we have the permit we need from the Fish and Wildlife. There's been a lawsuit filed over that permit that's sitting in the courts right now. There's no other process with Fish and Wildlife.","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Just the Incidental Take.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Yeah. There's the permit through the Forest \u2013 I'm sorry. I was confusing out, I thought you were asking about Forest Service. Forest Service were done. Fish and Wildlife, the court said that their Incidental Take permit needed more specificity. They've been working on that, and we expect it to be issued relatively soon. But they've put on the docket at FERC that a very small part of the pipeline was affected by the Endangered Species Act and the Incidental Take permit, and that's why we've been able to go full bore with a lot of construction.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I see. So, basically, yeah, the portions affected were very small. That allows you to continue forward with your work. And then I guess we'll just have to assess when the court comes out with the revised language on the Incidental Take I guess then we would then assess what that means, or is there anything further to read into that?","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","No, there's really nothing further we would expect. This is Diane Leopold, sorry. The Fish and Wildlife Service would quickly then reissue a new revised Incidental Take Statement consistent with that. But all through this time, their biological opinion remains in full force and effect.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Praful Mehta, Citigroup.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So just to follow up on the asset sales, just in terms of tax and tax leakage, what's the kind of numbers we should be thinking about for potential tax leakage and is there a preference given the tax profile of those two assets in terms of which one you would like to sell?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","There is probably a preference, but it's not one I'd like to talk about. They all have different tax profiles. And so, again, we'll look at the bottom-line value that's offered net of tax. It's important to note, too, we have a significant number of NOLs currently, so we may be able to protect ourselves on some of the tax exposure. But tax will be part of the ultimate decision, so I wouldn't lean one way or the other on what the tax basis is for any of those as being the driving factor.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Fair enough. And sorry if you've already addressed this question, but just on the MLP side, given there's no real drop-down planned at this point and given where the market is, is there a call you plan to take at some point in terms of the future of the direction of the MLP?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Well, I mentioned earlier that we will be talking to both the Dominion Energy and Dominion Midstream board here over the next couple of months on the status of current equity markets in the MLP sector. I referenced that, at least this year, to my knowledge, there's only been one very small equity transaction in the market, and it's been at pretty significant discount. So, obviously, if these equity markets aren't open to us, the DM structure that we've set up to finance assets that are dropped in doesn't work, and we'll have to determine what the best course is. But I would expect we will review that more in the near term than in the long term.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. So by year-end 2018, you would have a direction kind of where you want to take DM?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Well, I think one of the other callers asked a timeframe of three to six months, and I said I'd probably put it on the short side of that.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this does conclude this morning's conference call.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning for the Safe Harbor statement.","Thomas E. Hamlin - VP-Financial Analysis & Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to the first quarter 2015 earnings conference call for Dominion Resources and Dominion Midstream Partners. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website, register for email alerts and view our first quarter earnings documents. Our website addresses are dom.com and dommidstream.com. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss the measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our first quarter operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year 2015, as well as operating earnings before depreciation and amortization, interest and taxes commonly referred to as EBITDA. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in the earnings release kit and Dominion Midstream's press release.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the first quarter and our earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year 2015. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we've made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.99 per share for the first quarter of 2015, which was at the top of our guidance range of $0.85 per share to $1 per share. Favorable weather condition in our electric service area, particularly in February, added about $0.05 per share compared to normal.","Higher-than-expected earnings from our Marcellus farmout activities were $0.04 per share above guidance as we closed a new agreement on development rights for 11,000 acres and amended the terms of an existing agreement. On the negative side, margins from our merchant power business were below expectations, largely due to lower power prices in New England.","GAAP earnings were $0.91 per share for the first quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a charge associated with Virginia legislation enacted in February that required the write-off of Virginia Power prior period deferred fuel cost during the first quarter of 2015. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on schedule two of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, the EBITDA for the first quarter was $402 million, which was at the top of its guidance range. Kilowatt hour sales were above expectations due to colder-than-normal weather. Excluding weather, sales growth for the quarter was about 1.5%, slightly higher than our full year expectation of 1%.","Dominion Generation produced EBITDA of $676 million in the first quarter, which was in the middle of its guidance range. Earnings from utility generation were above expectations due to colder-than-normal weather, while merchant generation was below expectations due to lower-than-expected power prices.","First quarter EBITDA for Dominion Energy was $413 million, which was above the top of its guidance range. The colder weather and higher earnings from farmout activities drove the strong results. On a consolidated basis, interest expenses and income taxes were in line with our guidance. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter operating results.","For the first quarter of 2015, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $11.8 million and distributable cash flow of $11.9 million, all consistent with management's expectations. On April 22, Dominion Midstream's board of directors declared a distribution of $0.175 per unit payable on May 15 to unitholders of record on May 5.","On April 1, Dominion Midstream acquired Dominion Carolina Gas Transmission from Dominion Resources for a combination of debt and units valued at approximately $495 million. The acquisition is supportive of management's plan to grow limited partner distributions at a 22% compound annual rate through the end of the decade. We do not expect to drop any more assets into the partnership this year to reach our projected fourth quarter annualized distribution rate of $0.85 per unit.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities at Dominion, funds from operations were $1.1 billion for the first three months of the year. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $3.25 billion. We had $4.5 billion of credit facilities at the end of the first quarter. And taking into account cash and short-term investments, we ended the quarter with liquidity of $1.4 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the earnings release kit.","Finally in the financing area, we began an aftermarket program earlier this year to raise $500 million of common equity. Through the first week of April, we had raised $264 million and expect to complete our equity issuance by year-end.","Now, moving to earnings guidance, our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2015 is $0.65 per share to $0.75 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.62 per share for the second quarter of 2014. Positive earning drivers for the quarter compared to last year are return to normal weather, higher revenues from rider projects, the absence of a refueling outage at Millstone.","Negative earning drivers for the quarter were higher operating expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the year remains $3.50 per share to $3.85 per share. As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 27 of the earnings release kit. As of mid-April, we have hedged 88% of our expected 2015 production at Millstone and 60% of our expected 2016 production.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.99 per share for the first quarter of 2015, at the top of our guidance range. Favorable weather and higher earnings from our farmout activities were the principal factors in the strong performance.","Operating results for Dominion Midstream Partners were in line with management's expectations, and the Dominion Carolina Gas Transmission business was dropped into the partnership effective April 1. And finally, our operating earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2015 is $0.65 per share to $0.75 per share. Our operating earnings guidance for the full year remains $3.50 per share to $3.85 per share.","I would now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Our business units delivered strong operational and safety performance in the first quarter. Year-to-date, OSHA recordables for all units are consistent with their respective targets for the year. Dominion ranked first in safety in the Southeast Exchange in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor our six units was 97.7% for the first three months of the year.","Our Power Generation group also performed well during the quarter with record production from our combined cycle and large coal plates and a first ever six-month breaker-to-breaker run for the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. Virginia Power experienced a new record peak demand of 21,651 megawatts on February 20, exceeding the previous winter peaks by 9% and the previous record summer peak by 8%.","Our natural gas transportation storage and delivery businesses also operated well during the recent winter. Despite the cold, DTI had no interruption to firm service customers. The system experienced a record storage turn of 67.4 billion cubic feet for the month of February and set a record throughput of 7.24 Bcf on February 15. Our natural gas distribution companies also met the higher demand brought on by the cold weather safely and efficiently.","Before I discuss the progress we are making on our growth projects, I want to update you on a number of regulatory and legislative issues affecting the company. As many of you are aware, Virginia General Assembly passed legislation in the recent session modifying the base rate review process for the next several years. The changes were advanced because of the uncertainties and potential impact to the state from the proposed Clean Power Plan being formulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.","In its current form, this plan would impose some of the strictest CO2 emission standards in the Eastern U.S. on the Commonwealth of Virginia and could result in substantial cost for our customers and have a negative impact on our economy. A study by the Virginia State Corporation Commission estimated total compliance cost of $5 billion to $6 billion, excluding up to $2 billion for the cost of potentially retiring much of our existing fleet of coal-fired generating plant.","The recently enacted legislation suspends the biannual review process during the early years of the compliance period for the new CO2 standards. During this time, the company will file its integrated resource plan annually with the commission to include various compliance strategies and has committed to seek a solution to the new rules, which will allow the continuing use of coal as an energy resource in our state. We will file our integrated resource plan with the commission on July 1 of this year.","We filed our review of earnings for 2013 and 2014 on March 31, showing an earned return of 10.13%, which was below the top of the allowed range of 10.7%. We expect the commission order in this review by the end of November. The biannual review process will resume in 2022 covering earnings for the calendar years 2020 and 2021.","Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,358 megawatt combined cycle facility in Brunswick County was about 60% complete through the end of the first quarter. There are approximately 1,140 workers on site. The turbine building construction is in progress and all field-erected tanks were in various stages of construction or hydro testing. Construction of the air-cooled condenser is approximately 75% complete. The facility is on budget and on time for a mid-2016 commercial operation date.","Dominion announced that Greensville County will be the site for the next three-on-one gas-fired combined cycle facility to be constructed in Virginia. We expect to file a request with Virginia State Corporation Commission for CPCN and Rate Rider for this project in July. If approved, this 1,600 megawatt station is scheduled for commercial operation in late 2018.","During the first quarter, the company announced plans to invest $700 million to build several utility scale solar projects in Virginia, totaling up to 400 megawatts. Legislation enacted by the General Assembly states that the development of 500 megawatts of large-scale solar by utilities within the Commonwealth is in the public interest. Also during the first quarter, Dominion announced the development of a 20 megawatt solar facility at our Remington Power Station and filed for an A-6 Rider and CPCN in January. If approved, the facility would be in service by late 2016.","Construction is also on schedule for five merchant solar plants totaling 132 megawatts scheduled for service this year. The largest of these projects is our 50 megawatt Pavant project in Utah, which is currently under construction. Two projects in California totaling 42 megawatts should be in service by the end of this quarter. We also recently announced the acquisitions of the Richland Solar project, the 20 megawatt facility in Georgia, and the Alamo Solar project, a 20 megawatt facility located in California. Both projects will be operational later this year and bring our merchant, solar portfolio to 384 megawatts. Our plan is to grow this portfolio to 450 megawatts by the end of this year and to 625 megawatts by the end of next year.","At Dominion Virginia Power, we have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. During the first quarter, $199 million of transmission assets were placed into service. Electric transmissions capital budget for growth projects, including NERC, RTEP, maintenance, as well as security-related investments will average over $700 million per year through at least the remainder of this decade.","Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. At our February 9 meeting for analysts and investors, we highlighted a number of producer outlet and market access projects underway at Dominion Energy. Five of the nine producer outlet projects, which are designed to relieve congestion and move Marcellus gas out of the basin, are in service, while remaining four are all on time and on budget for completion over the next two years. Similarly, all four market access projects, which are customer-driven expansions, are on time and on budget for completion in 2016 and 2017.","On March 31, Dominion East Ohio filed an application with the Public Utility Commission of Ohio for expansion of the PIR program. If approved, DEO's annual capital investment would increase from $160 million to $200 million by 2018 and by 3% per year for the following three years.","In West Virginia, legislation was passed authorizing the West Virginia PSC to approve expedited cost recovery of natural gas utility infrastructure projects. Dominion Hope plans to file an application later this year for this replacement and expansion program.","During the first quarter, we closed on a new farm-out agreement and adjusted the terms of another. In March, DTI closed on an agreement to convey approximately 11,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights underneath one of its storage fields. The agreement provides for an upfront payment of $27 million plus an ongoing overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage.","Also in March, DTI and a natural gas producer amended the terms of a December 2013 agreement covering 79,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights for payments over a nine-year period. That amendment resulted in immediate conveyance of approximately 9,000 acres or 11% of the overall development rights and a two-year extension of the term of the original agreement.","We are continuing to work for the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project. We began the FERC filing process last November and expect to make the formal filing in September.","On February 27, FERC issued a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for both projects. During March, FERC held 10 scoping meetings at locations along the pipeline route. We have been continuing our public outreach efforts. 11 open houses for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and two open houses for the Supply Header were held in January. Three additional open houses were held in March for proposed reroutes. Surveying is about 72% complete and engineering is about 42% complete.","We awarded the pipe manufacturing contract in January to Dura-Bond Industries in Pennsylvania, and expect to award the pipeline construction contract this summer. We should begin construction in the fourth quarter of next year and begin operations in November 2018.","Dominion completed the acquisition of Carolina Gas Transmission from SCANA in January, and sold it to Dominion Midstream Partners in April. This transaction is illustrative of the kind of third-party acquisitions we will be seeking to supplement Dominion's already large inventory of MLP eligible assets that support our growth targets for Dominion Midstream.","Now, an update on our Cove Point Liquefaction Project. Construction is continuing at the site and is on time and on budget. The first foundations have been poured and the first structural steel has been erected. Engineering is nearly 80% complete, and approximately 85% of the engineered equipment has been procured as of the end of the first quarter.","So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the first quarter. Brunswick County construction project is proceeding on time and on budget. We continue to work toward a formal filing with FERC for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in September. And construction of the Cove Point Liquefaction Project is continuing on time and on budget.","Thank you, and we are ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. Our first question will come from Greg Gordon from Evercore Group.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Pretty thorough presentation as I really only have one question. I know that you've been given a lot more runway in Virginia to run the business given the flexibility of the new legislation and the uncertain \u2013 but there's also a lot of uncertainties that goes with that. It doesn't look like the weather normal sales were moved one way or the other that dramatically versus last year. Can you talk about whether or not you're still running behind your longer-term growth expectation for kilowatt hour sales in your market and what your base case assumptions are over the next several years for growth?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Greg. This is Mark. We actually were quite happy with the first quarter weather normalized sales where we were up slightly more than 1.5%. If you recall, we guided everybody this year to 1% sales growth annually, 2015 over 2014. And then as we talked on February 9, we looked for growth beyond that 1.5% next year and then a more normal 2% range for us, 2017 through the end of the decade. But for the first quarter, residential sales came in strong. And what we're very pleased about is commercial sales came in strong, excluding data centers, which we already knew were going to be very strong. Commercial sales were where we lagged in the last couple of years due to sequestration particularly in Northern Virginia and Eastern Virginia. So we'll see how that trend continues through rest of the year, but with just three months' worth of data, we think we're off to a strong stale start.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. The only \u2013 it looks like even industrial \u2013 it looks like across the board, everything was pretty strong. Maybe industrial is a little bit weaker delivers...","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(22:10) weak but \u2013 excuse me, Greg, the industrial was a weaker right, but it's very deceiving because most of the industrial weakness was due to low curtailment activities in the first quarter based on weather.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fabulous. Good answer. Thank you. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, it's Julien here. Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So turning to the farmouts and just broadly the volumetric outlook on the Dominion Energy side, can you talk to just hitting the target you laid out at the Analyst Day as you think about subsequent execution of farmout deals and also the royalty payments given the oil price environment? And then subsequently the Blue Racer impacts from where we stand today. So basically kind of a G&P, are you on track to hit the target farmout royalties and just generally G&P.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Julien, sure. Paul Koonce is going to handle the farmouts first and then I'll talk generally about Blue Racer versus what we showed in February.","Paul D. Koonce - Executive Vice President","Good morning, Julien. Yes. We still remain very much engaged with producers on Utica acreage. We had a lot of success with the farmouts in the Marcellus. We're now moving into the Utica, which is really the dry Utica, which right now seems to be where a lot of producers are putting forth their interest. So if you go back to the chart that Tom showed at February 9, the $450 million to $500 million between 2015-2020, we really haven't seen anything change that. We've been quite encouraged, frankly. So that's kind of where we stand. We're in negotiations right now, and we'll continue that.","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Julien, on Blue Racer \u2013 this is Mark. If you note in the script, there were two areas that we didn't talk about mainly because we gave such comprehensive update in February, and one of them was Blue Racer. And what I want to mention on Blue Racer is that we need to bound Blue Racer because we get lots of questions on it, we get lots of questions on the basin. But Blue Racer's contribution at $85 million to $95 million, which we showed on February 9, is less than 2% of the total contribution to Dominion's overall earnings.","The other area that we will update only on significant changes are unregulated gas retail business, which again, the reason we've stopped including that in our script is because it's 1% of our total overall earnings. So I just want to give that backdrop.","And in terms of Blue Racer, in the first half of this year, we feel real good with the processing volumes that are out there. We have three processing units up and running. The frac addition that was scheduled for the second quarter is in commissioning. So I think \u2013 and we feel real good with Blue Racer. The question I think will be with Blue Racer and others is later this year, do we continue to see the tie-ins that we expected before, and we'll have to wait and see what producers do. But permits continue to grow in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and we are optimistic, but we'll wait and see what the fourth quarter brings.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then subsequently just in terms of the 22% CAGR and thinking about subsequent dropdowns, vis-\u00e0-vis M&A, how are you thinking about more drops? Is there still the potential to have acquisitions at the MLP or is generally the thought process at this point in time to warehouse those assets, whatever you may be targeting at Dominion until a subsequent period of time to smooth out the growth rate, if you will?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Julien, I think it can happen in a number of different ways. Most of the assets that are in the market right now are liquid-sensitive assets which we would not be interested in. But there are some that have fairly stable regulated earnings pipeline-type assets. We \u2013 if they were accretive and supportive of our growth rate at DM, we could do it at DM. We could do it at D and house those until we want to drop them in the future. So we have tremendous flexibility. That's why we like the model of D and DM, focusing on these assets together. And we may well be a straight unit buy at DM or it might be buy at D with a dropdown very similar to Carolina Gas Transmission. So lots of flexibility, but I can assure you, we are not going to buy anything unless it adds value to both DM and D.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then lastly, just on the \u2013 speaking of housing, any developments on finding a yieldco partner, maybe too early?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","For solar?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Yep.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're pretty far down the road on how we want to structure that, Julien. We've had a lot of inbound from all kinds of people that would be interested in partnering with an ultimate sell-down. I think the structure is going to be very similar to what we've talked about publicly before, and that is a partial sell-down into a joint venture and then an ultimate absolute sale in the future after certain tax restrictions are released. So look for more on that probably late summer or fall, but that process is well underway.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","But a cash sale to get \u2013 to bind to the JV up front. And that's where you will get the premium for effectively having this transaction.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the way it will work, Julien is that we will get a cash sale for the interest that we sell initially into the JV. And then we'll get a cash sale when we ultimately sell down the remaining interest at a future period.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neel Mitra from Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","First question was on Carolina Gas Transmission. Could you discuss in a little bit more detail the growth projects that kind of get you from the 10% CAGR in EBITDA from 2015 to 2018? And then also if there was any synergies between CGT and Atlantic Coast?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll ask Paul Koonce to answer the first part of that. In terms of Atlantic Coast, we're only focused on the existing project we have at Atlantic Coast and moving that process through the approval and construction period. We don't, at this point in time, see any other project but what's been announced on ACP.","Paul D. Koonce - Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just on CGT growth, there are three projects in particular that have already been executed with the counterparty. They execute \u2013 the counterparty in this case being South Carolina Electric and Gas. So the growth is in place. The contracts have been signed. The permitting process is well underway. So we really don't see anything there that would really cause any question or concern.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And my second question was on generation. So in the past, you've said your CCGT projects were used to kind of catch up with retirements and Greensville County is going to be used to serve the additional load in your territory. After Greensville County, are you set for generation for a while or are there other needs within your service territory that would require additional builds, whether it's gas or other forms of generation?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Tom Farrell. Of course, we have Brunswick. We just finished Warren. Brunswick is 60% complete. Greensville County will be filing for. We also announced the 400 megawatts of solar. And it is \u2013 I am highly confident that we will need more generation construction in Virginia post Greensville County as a result of the carbon \u2013 the so-called Clean Power Plan.","How much and what it will look like? We'll have to see how the final rule comes out. There's issues around the interim target and how rigorous that will be, whether it's a cliff-like target for 2020 or whether it'll be some kind of phasing in over the first few years of the compliance period ultimately getting to 2030. But I don't think there's \u2013 I think there's very little chance we won't need to construct significant more generation in Virginia over the next 10 years to 15 years.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then just as far as the approval for Greensville County, can you give us a timeline for that? And then the RFP process for looking at merchant generators was that any different than Brunswick or Warren or was that pretty standard?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It was \u2013 we ran this typical RFP process. It's all done completely at arm's length. It was reviewed by independent parties and you'll see all that supported in the filing when it comes. We should have the approval on Greensville County early next year and then get under construction.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Tom, I know it's not a big amount of capital, but can you maybe give your thoughts on kind of the takeaways in the Artificial Island process and decision and maybe how that might affect some of the transmission investment decisions you guys might be looking at going forward?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Dan, it was interesting results, obviously, after a very long drawn out process. I'm not sure, to be honest with you, what it pertains to the future. We have our new Chairman \u2013 our new FERC Chairman is there. We'll have to see what emphasis there is on these kinds of projects. We'll continue to look at them. And if we think it makes sense for us to participate, we will. And it's hard for me to \u2013 I wouldn't want to try to judge much about the future of that one data point. But we're going to \u2013 I can understand why you would ask. We're all going to continue to watch it.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And I guess just on the stay out in Virginia with the legislation in place. Are there any major things you guys need to change operationally to be able to manage earning your ROE for such a long period without kind of the review process or something we should be watching change in strategy-wise out of the business?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there will be \u2013 just to make sure there's not a big deal, but there's nuance in this. There is a ROE reset in 2018. There is not in this biannual, and that will apply to the riders going forward. There's no earnings test, but there is a ROE review. We're just, Dan, I would just say that we will focus very carefully on how we manage the business and we expect to be able to balance the needs of our customers and our other constituency as \u2013 constituents as we go through the next five years.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And I guess just on the FERC pipeline investments, you guys have done a good job of finding opportunities in the last year or so. Are you seeing things popping up right now or bubbling out that were opportunities going to exist here forward or do you think the market is at a spot we are going to have to absorb what is in process before the next wave of announcements comes?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we have a lot in process but Paul Koonce spends a lot of time day-to-day on this, so I'll let him answer the question.","Paul D. Koonce - Executive Vice President","Hey, Dan. Good morning. What is interesting is that people sort of look closely at the clean power plan. We're starting to see a lot of our business development effort shift towards providing supplies to combined cycle. So we're seeing it off of the Dominion East Ohio System up in Ohio. And of course, we're seeing it along the DTIs system along the East Maryland and Eastern Pennsylvania in those areas. So I think as we go forward in time, you'll hear us talking about combined cycle, gas supplies for combined cycle. That I think is going to be the next wave of growth.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And Paul, you see that being newbuild generation or rerouting to existing plants?","Paul D. Koonce - Executive Vice President","No, I think we're seeing combination of both, but new build certainly is one area where we've seen a lot of activities. So our pipeline team is really spending a lot of time looking at the flexible services that generators need. So, for example, we've typically designed pipe to provide ratably over 24 hours. If you need to supply all of that in an eight-hour period, it's a little bit different design spec. So those are the things that we're looking at. It's not just repowering, it's newbuild as well.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Thank you, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve \u2013 I'm sorry, Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just on the farmout, was this something that was in your kind of rough guidance expectation for the year or was this kind of a new thing?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Steve. It's Mark. One of them was in our guidance for the year. The other one was an agreement that we have with a producer that was not in this year's guidance. And so that was $0.04 of the $0.07 difference, but that's kind of the breakdown.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, I think and just generally \u2013 not just this, but other pipelines \u2013 are just starting to see maybe a little bit more noise in terms of citing these pipelines and I guess some pressure at FERC. Is this \u2013 do you think this is like a big change or is this more just the nature of the fact that there is just a lot of building going on and so it is not really a big change?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, I actually think it's a little bit of both. There is a lot of activity going on. And so \u2013 and I think the nature of the conversation has gotten louder. But when you back up and look at it, we've already surveyed nearly 80% of the right of way for the Atlanta Coast Pipeline. We've let out the making the steel. We're going to \u2013 we're doing looking on the construction projects. Now FERC has \u2013 this is what they do. They're very professional about this. They recognize their role. And I just think it's \u2013 the world has changed some for sure, but we'll see how it all goes on from here. But I think it is \u2013 there's going to be more noise around all pipeline.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Maybe just one last question, just the overall environment for the Dominion Midstream in terms of both G&P and new pipeline growth. Obviously, we have oil collapse, now it has stabilized some. Things keep changing, but would you say your overall market perspective is still the same as it was three months, six months ago? Has anything changed meaningfully?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, I don't think anything's changed measurably. We had the drop-off in oil. It went down to mid-$40s [ph prop month (38:52), but the strip is back to \u2013 in the low-$60s for 2015, mid-$60s for 2016, 2017. So I think if oil continues to stabilize and recover, we have a growing confidence that a lot of the producers will start tying in a lot of these wells and continue to grow at least in the regions that we're operating in. That's why I mentioned earlier we're just going to have to wait and see till the fourth quarter or so as they work through. The wells are already been drilled and those \u2013 in that production.","But I guess what makes us feel pretty good, if you look at the permitting in Ohio and Pennsylvania, West Virginia, you continue to add every month new permits and new growth. And so it's just going to come down to producer confidence on how quick they're going to tie in and what basins they're going to ship resources to. But it certainly looks like Marcellus and Utica are still the two prime regions to drill for gas oil and liquids if you're going to invest your capitals. So we'll see where we go between fourth quarter next year in terms of volumes.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Just broadly speaking, can you maybe just provide a little bit of color on what you're seeing as far as muni and electric co-op opportunities. I think there's at least maybe one muni or electric co-op within the state that's helped public hearings as far as the potential sale? Little bit of color there will be good.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's Bristol you're referring to, which is in the far southwest part of the state, which is outside of our service territory. We have a \u2013 I think there are 14 electrics co-ops that are in our service territories, it's like that, and it's above 10. Now, they're all \u2013 we work very cooperatively with them. We're their transmission providers. We have a \u2013 they have a collective group that advise generation on the markets, some from us they own, some plants, they own part of North Anna with us and part of Clover. But that \u2013 I don't \u2013 I haven't heard any notion of that from any of the other co-ops other than or munis for that matter other than Bristol.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. It's a little bit preliminary, but just on Atlantic Coast, if you're seeing any potential opportunities to upsize that pipe to a little over 2 Bcfs per day. And then maybe just touch on some of the comments that came out of those potential reroutes of the pipeline.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As we've said about the \u2013 right now, it's a 1.5 Bcf pipe. It can be expanded to 2 Bcfs a day with just adding some compression to it. It's almost 100% sold out at the 1.5 Bcfs. And that's \u2013 we're just going to sit there for now until we get through this permitting process. There've been \u2013 and the second question was on the comments?","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right. (42:03)","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(42:04) reroutes.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We look at \u2013 this happens with every pipeline, whether it's 10 miles or 500 miles. We've already done over 100 small reroutes along the lines. It's one of the reasons why you go survey is to be able to meet with the landowners and they can express concerns about a particular \u2013 where you're touching their property. If you can figure out a way to change it to make it work for everybody, that's what we do. And then we're looking at 10. We've already adopted 10 major reroutes and looked at others. So this is all part of the process. This is why you go through the pre-filing process to make sure everybody gets the chance to be heard on it, and you can figure out what's the best approach. We've had \u2013 there've been almost 30 open houses and scoping meetings on this project so far, 7,500 people attending. And that's the natural outcome, is to have reroutes.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Turnure from JPMorgan.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Tom, did I hear you say that the legislation that was passed back in February, I think, allows for gas reserve by you guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. No.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I didn't touch on that at all. That's an interesting idea and we'll have to \u2013 we'll talk to our staff about the \u2013 staff at the State Corporation Commission \u2013 the Utility Commission staff to see what interest level they have in it. It's the kind of thing you would \u2013 we would want to have sort of stakeholder process to go through and see if people really wanted us to do that or not, but the legislation did not touch on that.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Do you think that you have the ability to do that without legislative approval if you wanted to proceed?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Possibly. But it's not something that I would think about with us right now.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my second question is on equity issuance. You mentioned in addition to the outstanding ATM that you're going to exhaust this year and the, I think, converts that you have coming due in the next couple years, you're potentially going to need $500 million to $1 billion of incremental equity through 2017 or 2018. Is there any update that you can provide us on that number or the timing there or the method by which you would want to issue them?","Mark F. McGettrick - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Chris, this is Mark. No, there's no additional update other than what we talked about at the Analyst Meeting. And you're exactly right. We said after we do the aftermarket, we could have potentially an equity need of $500 million to $1 billion over the next three years. But what we're watching closely in terms of influencing this is what's going to happen with bonus depreciation. If bonus depreciation were to be extended a year or two year, we would be a very large beneficiary of that because we have some very large projects underway that could well have a significant impact on any equity needs that will be remaining over the next three years. So stay tuned on that later this year and see what happens in Washington and then we'll be able to give some more clarity from 2016 and 2017.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just back on the farmouts, what is the expectation for server run rate on them for this year and next?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Paul, we said at the Analyst Meeting that we saw about $500 million worth of earnings for farmouts over the planned period that we talked about.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right.","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's going to be \u2013 I think it's going to be a little lumpy depending on what region you're in. We've done most of our Marcellus farmouts already, so we're focused on that 180,000 acres of our Utica. We've had some strong interest in acreage there. But I think if you want to model it, I'd model a $100 million a year or so as you'll go through, but just knowing that depending on the timing of producers' interest, it could move around.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","That's a $100 million pre-tax?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Pre-tax.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the ISO New England, the new zones, I know you guys filed sort of protest or a complaint because of the process. But I was wondering if there was anything that you saw in those zones that the economic impact, if any, that you might be seeing as a result of the zones for the next capacity auction?","Thomas F. Farrell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Dave Christian will go ahead an answer that for you.","David A. Christian - Executive Vice President & CEO-Dominion Generation","Yeah. We filed comments mostly regarding the process. We thought that there should been additional opportunity for some stakeholder input. So the way they went about it was a little unusual on our view. But our most sensitive unit up there, Millstone, stays in the Connecticut zone, and we don't see any meaningful changes there. The rest of it we're still evaluating, and it'd be too early to say if there's anything substantial. But I'm not seeing anything meaningful at this point in time.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. Instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow, if you would like to ask a question.","I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning for the Safe Harbor Statement. ","Tom Hamlin","Good morning and welcome to the fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings releases and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.","If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our websites, register for email alerts, and view our fourth quarter and full-year earnings documents. Our website addresses are dominionenergy.com and dominionenergymidstream.com. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will follow this morning's discussions.","And now for the usual cautionary language; the earnings releases and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates, and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, we are able to calculate and report are contained in the earnings release kit and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners\u2019 press release.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results and Dominion Energy's earnings guidance. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we\u2019ve made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share for 2017 which was in the middle of our guidance range. Mild weather conditions in our electric service territory in both the winter and summer had a $0.10 per share negative impact on our results.","Adjusting for weather, our earnings results were in the upper half of our range. Other negative factors impacting earnings were a lower allowed rate of returns on our Virginia rider projects and lower margins from our merchant generation business. The positive factors for the year relative to our guidance includes lower than expected general merchant capacity expenses, interest expenses and operating expenses.","EBITDA summaries of our operating segments for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 are shown on slides four and five. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of our operating segments in 2017. GAAP earnings were $4.93 per share for the year. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings was a $988 million gain due to tax reform, primarily driven by an adjustment to a deferred tax liability. The reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $299 million for 2017, which is more than double the level produced in 2016. Distributable cash flow was $178 million, which was 68% higher than 2016. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of 2016 was the principal driver of the increase.","On January 25th, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $31.8 per common unit payable on February 15th. This distribution represents a 5% increase over the last quarter\u2019s payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan. Our coverage ratio remains strong at 1.29 times. Also we are in advanced stages of securing a $500 million revolving credit facility for Dominion Midstream that will replace its existing credit line with the parent company. This should be in place in the next few weeks.","Moving to treasury activities at Dominion Energy, cash flow from operating activities was $4.6 billion for 2017. We have $5.5 billion for credit facilities and taking into account cash, short term investments and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the year with available liquidity of $2.2 billion. We are also in the process of increasing Dominion\u2019s credit facilities by $500 million up to a total of $6 billion, which would further improve our liquidity. For statements of cash flow and liquidity please see pages 13 and 24 of the earnings release kit.","On Slide 8, we outline a number of initiatives we've planned for 2018 which are in support of our balance sheet and credit profile. First, we issued $500 million of new common equity through our at-the-market program in January. This issuance was not related to our planned SCANA financing. Second, we've reviewed our capital spending plan and anticipate reducing our expenditures by $1 billion over the next two years. These reductions will have no impact on our previously disclosed growth capital estimate.","Third, as I just mentioned, we are securing an extension in upsize of Dominion's credit facilities up to a total of $6 billion. This is in addition to the new $500 million credit facility planned at Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. And finally, we're initiating the process of de-levering a parent company and on a net basis will reduce holding company debt by $800 million or more this year. These and other elements of our 2018 financing plan excluding our planned SCANA transactions are shown on Slide 9. I want to assure everyone that we're committed to investment grade ratings and we'll strive to meet the associated credit metrics.","Moving to tax reform on Slide 10, recently enacted changes to the federal tax code were a significant impact on most utilities. Assessing the impact is a difficult process for a multifaceted company like Dominion, operating in seven different states. In estimating the ongoing impact from tax reform, we've assumed that the benefits of lower tax rates will be passed-through to customers in all of our state regulated businesses.","On the plus side, lower tax rates will improve the profitability of our non-regulated and long-term contracted businesses. Also the normalization, amortization of excess deferred income taxes will provide incremental growth to rate base in our regulated businesses. On the negative side as highlighted by some of the recent comments from the rating agencies, tax reform creates strong credit headwinds particularly for companies like Dominion who are currently not-cash taxpayers. We estimate the 2018 impact of federal tax reform will be a positive $0.10 to $0.15 per share.","Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy, operating earnings for 2018 are expected to be between $3.80 and $4.25 per share. The midpoint of our range is 10% above the middle of last year's guidance range. Positive factors compared to last year are earnings from Cove Point and return to normal weather, one fewer refueling outage at Millstone, and a lower effective tax rate due to tax reforms. However, a large portion of the tax reform benefit will be offset by the delay in promotional operation for Cove Point.","Tom Farrell will expand on the operational timing of Cove Point in a few minutes. Negative factors for 2018 compared to last year include lower investment tax credits, higher financing costs, and share dilution. Our earnings growth rate remains 6% to 8% for the 2017 through 2020 period. This compound growth rate could improve to 8% plus if we are successful in our efforts to combine with SCANA Corporation. Our operating earnings guidance for the first quarter of this year is $0.95 to $1.15 per share compared to $0.97 for the first quarter of last year.","Positive factors for the quarter compared to last year's first quarter are returned to normal weather, a contribution from Cove Point export, higher merchant generation margins and federal tax reform. Negative factors include lower solar investment tax credits, higher financing cost, higher capacity expenses and higher DD&A. You will notice in our guidance documents that projected EBITDA for our operating segments and total company were showed a decline compared to the prior period, even though net income and earnings per share are higher. This is due to the impact of the flow-through benefits of tax reform and our state regulated businesses.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $3.60 per share, remaining in the middle of our guidance range despite mild weather. Changes to federal tax code are expected to be a net positive for Dominion's earnings. We are taking aggressive steps to strengthen our balance sheet to offset the credit impact of tax reform and 2018 operating earnings are expected to be at least 10% above the midpoint of our 2017 operating earnings guidance range, consistent with previous guidance.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Tom Farrell","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion Energy in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals for the year. Our employees set an all-time low OSHA Recordable Rate of 0.66 in 2016. In 2017, they exceeded that record by an additional 10% to a new record low of 0.60. We are very proud of our companywide commitment to improve safety performance.","Our nuclear fleet continues to operate well. The net capacity factor of our six units in 2017 was a record 95.1%, exceeding the previous record of 93.7% set in 2013. Weather-normalized electric sales for the year were up 1.7% over 2016, led by growth and sales to data centers and residential customers. Total new customer connects were above our expectations with strong growths in both residential and commercial sectors. For the year, we connected 13 new data centers compared to 11 in 2016.","Now few comments on Millstone Power Station, we are looking forward to the opportunity to compete with other non-emitting generating resources in a state-sponsored solicitation for zero carbon electricity. It provides a path-forward to retain 1,500 well-paying jobs in Millstone's substantial environmental energy and economic benefits for Connecticut. Preliminary reports issued by DEEP and PURA in December and January highlighted the importance of Millstone to the region's power markets and the state's economy.","We have worked with the regulatory agencies including the sharing of confidential financial information, to convey the actual cost of operating two dissimilar units in a high regional labor market. An updated report issued on January 22, concluded that the solicitation should take place in that Millstone can't participate. Our recent report from ISO New England regarding the region\u2019s future fuel security and reliability risks also supports the need for Millstone. The final report from DEEP and PURA is expected this week and we look forward continue to work through this process with the Connecticut regulators.","Now for an update on our growth plans; construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of December 31, the $1.3 billion project was 73% complete. All major equipment is set. The primary natural gas line and M&R station are completed and awaiting final commissioning. Greensville is on schedule to achieve first buyer in the second quarter and is expected to achieve commercial operations late this year.","The upgrade of our electric transmission network continues. In 2017, we invested $806 million and placed $519 million of assets into service. We plan to invest $800 million on electrical transmission business this year and every year for at least the next decade. Progress on our growth plan for gas infrastructure continues as well. Construction of our Cove Point Liquefaction project is complete and we are in the final stages of commissioning. While commissioning has taken longer than we originally planned, we are progressing toward an in-service state in early March. This is an enormously complicated process, and we and our contractors are ensuring that all the work is done safely, thoroughly and correctly.","We are currently in the process of cooling down to liquefying temperatures to make LNG and met final tuning and testing phase. The actual production of LNG at the facility is imminent. Once commercial, our contracts become effective and the project will produce the expected earnings we have previously discussed. However, as Mark mentioned, the absence of these earnings for the first few months of the year will offset some of the earnings benefits expected from lower income taxes. Nevertheless, we still expect 2018 earnings to be at least 10% above the midpoint of last year\u2019s guidance.","On January 19th, FERC issued a Limited Notice to proceed for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project, which allows us to begin felling trees. Tree-felling started for ACP in Virginia and West Virginia on January 20th and for the Supply Header on January 26th. We are making excellent progress particularly in the mountain areas.","Last week, we received our final North Carolina 401 water quality permit as well as our final E&S permits from West Virginia. We expect all remaining major permits including our Army Corps 404 and Virginia E&S permits any day. These are the final major permits necessary to request FERC authorization to commence full construction. We remain on schedule for completion of the projects in the second half of next year.","It is noteworthy that during the cold weather earlier this month, power crisis in Virginia and North Carolina increased substantially, surpassing the highest daily power price average in New England by 10% and underscoring the urgent need for the increased regional gas transportation that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Project will provide.","Finally, a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation, on January 3rd, we announced our agreement for Dominion would exchange 0.669 shares of its common stock for each SCANA share. Including the offer was a proposal for upfront payments and ongoing build reductions that would substantially reduce the cost to customers from the abandoned nuclear development projects.","We filed a regulatory proposal with South Carolina Public Service Commission on January 12thj. All of the other state regulatory filings and the application for Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance have been made. We expect to receive approval from SCANA's shareholders in May. We\u2019ve participated in legislative caring to explain our proposals to lawmakers who are considering possible changes to the South Carolina Base Load Review Act. We are optimistic that our proposal will be viewed favorably by law makers and regulators, and we can complete the transaction later this year.","So to summarize, our businesses delivered record setting operating safety performance in 2017. Construction of the Greensville County project in on-time and on budget, commissioning of Cove Point is continuing, and we expect to be in service in early March. We received the Limited Notice to Proceed for Atlanta Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project and have begun tree-felling along the route. Other permits are expected any day.","We expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018 driven by completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction project and 6% to 8% from 2017 to 2020. Success in our efforts to merge with SCANA could increase our growth rate to 8 plus percent. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate of Dominion Energy of 10% per year through at least 2020. And finally, the programmatic investment plans across all of our business units we\u2019ve highlighted last fall, provide the foundation for earnings growth of at least 5% well into the next decade.","With that, we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first quarter will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Notwithstanding just the very short delay that you\u2019ve got on Cove Point, when I think about the structural benefits of tax reform, the $0.10 to $0.15, because obviously being delayed a few months of Cove Point is just a few months doesn\u2019t really matter in the long run. Is it fair to think about the steps you\u2019ve taken in terms of issuing the 500 million of equity and reducing the CapEx budget by about $1 billion and bringing -- starting the $800 million of targeted debt reduction at the parent early? Like all those things are sort of you\u2019re taking the earnings benefit of tax reform and utilizing that to get a jumpstart on the deleveraging goals? So in other words like your earning targets are so on track because you were able to take the benefits of tax reform and use them to get a jump on the deleveraging that you\u2019ve articulated you\u2019re looking to achieve. Is that the right way to think about this? Or am I not thinking about it correctly?","Mark McGettrick","Greg, this is Mark. I think you\u2019re right on track there. A large piece of that we\u2019re using to go ahead and aggressively support credit. One reason, we went ahead and issued equity at the market in January, knowing what our position was going to be even with a slight delay in Cove. So, we did take advantage of that and we\u2019re committed to the ratings that we have. We will take the steps necessary to support that and we took advantage of taxes to get a jump start.","Greg Gordon","Great, I just wanted to make sure I understood that, that was the sort of what you were doing. Other than that I actually don't have any other questions, congratulations on a good year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, a quick clarification actually, just given the conversations with Moody's and other agencies of late, just to the extent at which you've updated your plan at present. Does this put you in a position to get back on track and remove some of these outlooks? I mean obviously you've probably added some of the conversations you've shared with us this morning. Is this more of a question of timing and execution to get you up and put debt metrics in a place that is consistent with the agencies for your current ratings? Is that the right way to think about that at this point? And maybe you could even share just a little bit on, how you see the FFO to debt profile off the lows here progressing?","Mark McGettrick","Hi, Julien, this is Mark. We have shared with agency our plans, and this is obviously an industry-wide issue for regulated utilities in terms of FFO pressure because of tax reform. We think this gives us a very strong start to support our FFO metrics going forward, but there's probably more work to be done in the future. The approach I think we believe agency is going to take are for all the companies that are impacted by the FFO is to make sure they can execute the plans that they outlined for the agencies and for investors and that's what we're committed to do to get our FFO metrics where all the agencies are comfortable with them and very strong investment grade, that's our commitment and will remain our commitment.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And I wanted to come back to the earnings growth. Obviously, you've got a number of moving pieces in the update, not least of which at the $0.10 to $0.15 in tax reform. I know you in the key takeaways reaffirmed the 8% plus trajectory, but can you talk about ex-SCANA just how this might shift your standalone prospects for the earnings outlook, if it does at all?","Mark McGettrick","Well, Julien, I think, I hope we've been clear on at that -- our 2017, 2020 growth rate is 6% to 8% without SCANA on a compound annual rate. And I think as Tom mentioned, 5 plus percent post 2020. If we're successful in the SCANA transaction that growth rate from '17 to '20 could move to 8 plus percent. So with or without SCANA, we're in terrific position with one of the best growth rates we believe in the industry and one of the highest dividend growth rates as well, but certainly SCANA would be a positive result for us.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Same question in a different way. Assuming that $0.10 to $0.15 net benefit continued through 2020, why wouldn\u2019t you be a little bit higher in your 6% to 8% growth? Or is that $0.10 to $0.15 change over the period?","Mark McGettrick","Steve, I think it's going to change a little bit over the period, but again I think the 6% to 8% range we feel real comfortable with and there's a lot of moving parts on tax reforms still in terms of how states might handle it, how FERC might handle it, and timing of the cash impacts on that. So, we've made our best assumptions here, and we think that 6% to 8% is the right range without SCANA. Could it move us off a little bit? It's possible. I don't think it will move us down at all, but I think taxes could move around little bit post '18.","Steve Fleishman","And then just to clarify, could you remind us if you are including any Millstone kind of benefits of the potential contract there on not in your plan?","Mark McGettrick","We are not. Again, our range that could move us within our range depending on the success at Millstone, but we did not put a specific number in when we came out with our 6% to 8% growth range for prior to the Millstone legislative work.","Steve Fleishman","Could you maybe also just talk a little bit about the Virginia legislation that was recently proposed? And then what's Dominion's view on that and potential impacts?","Tom Farrell","Steve, this is Tom. There is a comprehensive piece of legislation that has been developed by a variety of leaders in the General Assembly, both in the Senate and the House that deals with lots of issues in the state energy policy. It's moving through -- Virginia moves legislation through in a very rapid pace normally. And I don\u2019t think this will be an exception, they have to adjourn by the end of the first week of March. So, we are working with a variety of stakeholders on it. We think there are some very good things in it. There are some things that will have to accommodate ourselves to, but overall we think it's constructive a piece of legislation for our state and our customers.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","I was wondering if -- maybe you could discuss some of the opportunities that you see from the legislation for both investors and customers. I know in the past we have talked about grid mod and riders and some other possible benefits.","Tom Farrell","I don\u2019t -- I think it's premature to talk about it. There is still lots of work to be done on it -- maybe a little bit later when we see the final products in the committee hearing will be coming up in the next couple of weeks, and we will see how goes from here. And we'll be in a position to talk about it I think more thoroughly on the next call.","Michael Weinstein","On the Dominion Midstream, in the past you used to talk about $7 billion to $8 billion of cash from 2016 to 2020. Is there any update for that as well post tax reform?","Mark McGettrick","No update on that, Michael. We still expect that cash to come back to Dominion and that is the one of the many levers we are going to have to de-lever the parent. That story has been consistent in terms of the drop of Cove Point into the Dominion midstream and the benefits back to the mainly shareholders since day one and we fully expect to execute on that beginning in this year.","Michael Weinstein","And just one last question on -- in New England, can you talk about whether you would -- whether you plan to bid in the forward capacity auction Millstone? Or is that dependent on the outcome on February 1st of the review?","Paul Koonce","Michael, this is Paul Koonce. We are not prepared to discuss what we are going to bid. I mean that\u2019s obviously competitively sensitive. So, we are working very well with both DEEP and PURA to kind get through that process. They are going to issue their final report as Tom said later this week. That will we believe lead to an RFP being issued in the May timeframe, and so we will be working with DEEP and PURA between the final report in May to understand the structure of a bid and then we will submit our bid as any others.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Group. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski ","So my question is -- okay, so, the $1 billion reduction in your CapEx doesn\u2019t impact your gross CapEx? So, what is this? Is this maintenance CapEx that is getting reduced?","Mark McGettrick ","Hey, Angie, this is Mark. It's going to be a number of things. The largest component of that $1 billion is associated with an announcement we\u2019ve made recently to go ahead and put nine of our generating facilities in Virginia into coal storage based on current market economics. The timing of that over the next 12 months or so would have required a lot of maintenance at all those units and that will be a lowered portion of the reduction. But there will also be reductions in other non-core maintenance activities over the next couple of years to come up with the $1 billion over the two year period. But we have very good line of sight on that.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Second question on the credit negative outlook, credit outlook and -- okay so the negative outlook was issued in January and if I understand it correctly, the credit agencies were already aware of the equity financing and the lower CapEx that you\u2019re proposing. Does it mean that you need to step up some of the credit improvement initiative i.e. do I need to account for more equity come '19 and \u201820?","Mark McGettrick ","Angie, when we shared with the agencies our plans over the next three years, it was associated with the SCANA transaction and we had not adjusted for the equity that we\u2019ve talked about today or the $1 billion adjustment. They were not advised until very recently and that was a decision that we made internally here to make sure that we -- our focus on the metrics -- they know we\u2019re focused on the metrics and are making quick headway to improve that based on the tax reform impact. So, they were in their original numbers and we think this is a big step forward, as we go ahead and complete SCANA transaction.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","I just wanted to check in on the overall goals in terms of leverage given a lot of helpful commentary this morning around target credit metrics. But just -- you had mentioned in the past the desire to reduce the holdco debt as a percentage of total debt moving from 50% down to lower level by the end of the decade, I believe 30% to 40%. Is that still we should be thinking in terms of how you think about your total holdco leverage?","Tom Farrell","Yes, you\u2019re sure. That\u2019s the same range. We may get although little quicker for some of the changes that we talked about today, but that is the range we\u2019re targeting by 2020, 30% to 40% at the holdco as a percentage of total family debt.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, great. And then shifting, this is I know a little broader and off the beaten path, but couldn\u2019t help but notice the Amazon shortlist locations, three of them are in your territories. Have you all thought through what might be required in terms of infrastructure, if one of those selections took place? Is this something that could be material in terms of infrastructure? Or is it more likely you can broadly utilize the existing infrastructure that you have?","Tom Farrell","Well, there\u2019s talking about a lot of jobs and a lot of -- that means a lot of homes and residences and businesses to spin off of that 50,000 jobs over a decade I think. And obviously depending upon where it is they want mass transportation, you\u2019re referring I am sure -- what you\u2019re referring to I think obviously is the District of Columbia, suburban Marilyn and Suburban Virginia were all suburbs of Washington were all included on that shortlist. There will be a lot to deal with over a decade, and we\u2019re hopeful that they see the wisdom of coming in the right state.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Ridge, Director of Investor Relations for the Safe Harbor Statement.","Unidentified Company Representative","Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 earnings conference call for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. I encourage you to visit the Investor Relations page on our website to view the earnings press releases and accompanying materials as well as the slide presentation that will follow this morning's prepared remarks. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting, and the Investor Relations team will be available immediately after the call to answer additional questions.","The earnings releases and other matters that will be disclosed - discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures which are able to calculate and report are contained in the earnings press release kit in the Dominion Energy Midstream Partners press release. For our prepared remarks, Jim Chapman, Chief Financial Officer will provide a financial update including quarterly earnings results, Tom Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer will review safety and operating performance, highlight progress on growth initiatives and provide other updates. I will now turn the call over to Jim Chapman.","James Chapman","Good morning. Dominion Energy reported operating earnings of $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, which was at the top of our guidance range. Drivers relative to our guidance including - includes lower operating and maintenance expense, higher-margins and our power generation group in better and normal weather.","GAAP earnings were $1.30 per share for the quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings is a gain on nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the Earnings Release Kit.","Moving to results by business segment. EBITDA for the Power Generation Group was $820 million in the third quarter, at the top end of its guidance range. Lower operating and maintenance expense, higher margins and favorable weather contributed to the outperformance. The Power Delivery Group produced EBITDA of $434 million, which was near the midpoint of the guidance range. And the Gas Infrastructure Group produced third quarter EBITDA of $598 million, which was in the top half of its guidance range.","Lower operating and maintenance expense was the primary driver for that outperformance. Overall, we're pleased with another quarter of very strong execution across our businesses. Dominion Energy Midstream Partners produced third quarter adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow of $76 million and $50 million respectively. On October 19, Dominion Energy Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.369 per common unit payable on November 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's distribution. On September 19, Dominion Energy announced an offer to exchange each outstanding public Dominion Energy Midstream common unit for 0.2468 of a Dominion Energy common share. The board of Dominion Energy Midstream has authorized its independent complex committee to evaluate that offer.","Given Dominion Energy's existing ownership interest in Dominion Midstream, the consent of third-party unitholders is not required to approve this transaction. We expect to complete the definitive agreement between the two companies this quarter, with closing to follow in early 2019. We also expect to recommend to the Dominion Midstream board a fourth quarter 2018 common unit distribution to be paid in early 2019 prior to or in conjunction with transaction close. Given anticipated cash flows and the existing financing mix, that final distribution is expected to be equal to the third quarter distributions that was declared on October 19.","Tom will provide some additional remarks later in the call about the rationale for our decision to eliminate Dominion Energy Midstream Partners as a financing vehicle for Dominion Energy. Moving now to our credit and improvement initiatives, we're pleased to have completed several meaningful steps for achieving our previously announced credit objectives for the year. First in September, we closed on a $3 billion [indiscernible] term loan in our Cove Point facility. Strong demand from a broad lending group drove attractive pricing in terms. Proceeds from the financing are being used to reduce parent level debt. Second, and also in September, we announced agreements to sell our interest in three merchant powergenerating facilities representing some 1.8 gigawatts of generation capacity for approximately $1.3 billion of cash consideration across two transactions.","We greatly appreciate the dedicated service of the power station employees who have served our company with distinction. Given our increased strategic focus on regulated energy infrastructure of these assets have become increasingly noncore. We are pleased with the results from this initiative and we expect both transactions to be closed before the end of the year. Cash sales proceeds are being used to reduce parent level debt. Third, as announced this morning, we have executed an agreement to divest our 50% interest in the Blue Racer midstream joint venture to first reserve and affiliated investment funds for total consideration of up to $1.5 billion, including cash consideration of $1.2 billion and up to $300 million of ongoing earning payment - earn out payment through 2021 based on Blue Racer midstreams ongoing performance. We have consistently indicated that Blue Racer while a very high quality business with an extremely capable management team is considered noncore for Dominion Energy, and the sale of our interest would be opportunistic based on a compelling valuation and structure.","This transaction represents an attractive valuation multiple range of 14x to 16x estimated 2018 EBITDA, based on book ends of potential payments to be received under the earn out structure. We expect to close by the end of the year and upfront cash sales proceeds will be used to reduce parent level debt. We wish the other Blue Racer owners, the management team and the employees for their collaboration and successfully executing the very impressive growth of this business since the partnership was created in 2012. To summarize, we have forced - we have sourced funds to reduce our parent level debt by around $8 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion of new equity, approximately $2.5 billion of proceeds from noncore unregulated asset sale agreement, with up to $300 billion of additional payment through 2021 and $3 billion from the Cove Point asset level financing.","As a result of these steps, we expect to achieve cash flow coverage metrics to support our existing credit rating and achieve our targeted parent level debt to total debt metric two years earlier than originally planned. By divesting some of our last remaining unregulated businesses, we've also improved our business risk profile. Now to earnings guidance at Dominion Energy. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to be between $0.80 and $0.95 per share compared to $0.91 per share earned in last year's fourth quarter. Positive factors relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 include the contribution from Cove Point Liquefaction and lower tax expense due to tax reform. Negative factors include lower solar related investment tax credit, higher financing costs and higher share count.","Given where we are in the year, we are narrowing our 2018 full year guidance range to $3.10 to $4.10 per share, preserving the same midpoint as our original guidance. Assuming normal weather, we continue to expect operating earnings per share for 2018 to be above the midpoint of this narrowed guidance range. We're also affirming our 2017 to 2020 operating earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. Please note that 2019 full year guidance is expected to be provided on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call to take place early next year.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you, Jim. I congratulate Jim on his new role as our company's Chief Financial Officer. Since joining Dominion, Jim has played a key role in our most important strategic and financing initiatives, and I'm confident that he will do very well in this new role. Also we should take a moment to recognize the transition of Mark McGettrick who has been with the company for 38 years, the last nine of which have been exemplary CFO. We wish Mark our very best.","Going into the final quarter of the year, our company is operating at the last OSHA recordable incident rate in our more than 110-year history. Exceeding our record-setting results last year and placing us ahead of 15 of the 17 peer companies operating in the southeast United States. On the job safety just does not just often. These results represent years of focus on making sure that every employee returns from in the same condition in which they arrived at work that day. We will continue to improve until we achieve the only acceptable safety statistics, zero.","Operating performance across our asset portfolio continues to be excellent. I'd like to share four examples. First, our nuclear units extended a company record by operating for 753 days and still counting without an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown. This represents the nuclear power industries best fleet performance.","Second, Hurricane Michael. Represented as the sixth-largest outage event in the company's history with over 600,000 customers without power at their peak, representing nearly 1\/4 of our electric customers. Within 48 hours of Michael exiting our service territory, our crews had safely restored power to nearly 90% of the customers affected, and we've restored service to every customer within just five days. Third, the Cove Point Liquefaction facility which was the largest single capital project in both the company's and the state of Maryland's history has liquefied almost 100 billion cubic feet of gas for export by our customers since entering into commercial service.","And during the recent planned outage, the site reported no OSHA recordable injuries despite the presence of nearly 600 staff in contractors on site. Finally, in recent months, we have launched an initiative to improve our engagement with investors regarding our industry-leading track record on environmental, social and governance matters. We have enhanced our disclosures and will launch an ESG dedicated website in the coming days. At Dominion, ESG is a board level priority as evidenced by the recent creation of a sustainability and corporate prosperity for commitment. that overture performance as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen.","Now, I'll turn to business updates. As the Power Generation Group, construction of the $1.3 billion Greenful Power Station continues the pace as was 98% complete at the end of September. The project is expected to achieve commercial operations on time and on budget in early December.","We filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for the first of what we expect will be several utility scale solar projects for inclusion in rate base. We have significantly expanded our solar fleet in recent years, and now ranked as the fourth-largest utility on our solar generation in the United States. We'll continue to regulated solar capacity and the clean energy gas power generation required to complement due solar generation, both at the urging of our states elected representatives.","Now, on October 16, we filed with the regulatory commission for subsequent license renewable for the [indiscernible] power station reactors. This is an important first step in which we expect will be a multiyear $4 billion investment program that will extend the lives of both the [indiscernible] and North Arizona nuclear stations by an additional 20 years. We expect to submit the North license suspension application in 2020. As a result of this initiative, our customers will continue to benefit from clean, reliable and low-cost generation from these best-in-class facilities. We've also filed with the [indiscernible] Corporation Commission's for approval construct two offshore wind turbines under a fixed cost construction contract.","Like the solar and nuclear relicensing investments, this pilot project has the support of government pattern in Virginia General Assembly, will provide an important early learning that we believe will lay the foundation for commercial scale offshore wind for Virginia's clean energy future. Finally, on September 14, we filed our offers in response to the Connecticut Department of Energy and environmental protections RFP for procurement of zero carbon resources. We have requested that [indiscernible] be recognized as an at risk resource where the contract to sell a portion of [indiscernible] zero carbon power starting July 1, 2019.","We are pleased that both deep and the office of consumer counsel have filed briefs asking that the Connecticut Public utilities regulatory authority grant millstone at risk designation which will allow millstone's offers to be judged on price and nonprice attributes, such as zero carbon, economic impact and fuel security. Millstone is vital to Connecticut in each of these respects. [Indiscernible] is expected to select RFP winners by the end of this year. Winning better be validated by PURA and then entering into contracts with the local electric distribution companies.","We have been cleared with Connecticut policymakers that the contract providing long-term financial assurance is the only path forward for millstone's continued operation. At the Power Delivery Group, we continue to benefit from very strong electric sales group. 2018 year-to-date weather normalized sales are 2.4% higher than the same period last year, led by strong growth across data centers, residential and industrial classics. We have placed nearly $600 million of electric transmission assets into service through the third quarter. In July, we filed a grid moderation plan with the Virginia State Corporation Commission through the first three year phase includes over $900 million of investment in grid reliability, resiliency and security.","And in October, we completed the 1,000-mile of our writer program to place 4,000 miles of overhead taplines underground. Improving our ability to respond storm events like Florence and Michael. Both of these long-lived investment programs were found to be in the public interest, in [indiscernible] and legislation signed by the government earlier this year. As the Gas Infrastructure group, we continue to make progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply better projects. We have been constructing in West Virginia and North Carolina and on October 19, we received the final Virginia permit required to [indiscernible] underway with full mainline construction in all three states. Following approval from FERC of our notice to proceed filing, we will begin mainline construction in Virginia. We appreciate the professional manner in which all of our permitting agencies have worked collaboratively with us to ensure that this critical energy infrastructure project will meet the stringent environmental standards required by law and regulation.","The FERC stop work order in delays obtaining permits necessary for construction have impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, project cost actions have increased the range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion to a range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion excluding financing costs. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is pursuing a phase in service approach with its customers whereby we maintain a late 2019 in-service date for key segments of the project to meet peak winter demand in critically constrained regions. ACP will be pursuing a mid 2020 in-service date for the remaining segments. Abnormal weather and\/or work delays may result in cost or schedule modifications in the future. We're currently working with customers to determine the rates and terms for interim service. Although we can't discuss the details of those discussions, we are confident that we will balance customers' needs and preserve the returns for HCP.","The supply inter project target in-service remains late 2019. Moving from gas transmission to gas distribution. We're making important progress on our gas utility gas pipeline replacement programs. We're investing over $300 million annually under existing rivals across our service territories to enhance the safety and reliability of the gas distribution service that we offer our customers. We are pleased with the meaningful role that Dominion Energy's playing in delivering critical energy resources to a wide variety of customers can across the spectrum of regulated energy infrastructure platforms.","We are constantly challenging the status quo to be sure we are adapting to meet the evolving desires of our customers. In fact, Dominion recently added a fifth element to our long-standing core values of safety, ethics, excellence and one Dominion Energy. Our new core value is embrace change. Which speaks to our focus on adapting our business to the accelerating pace of technological change and increased diversity in our society. This focus on innovation and change will broaden the transform to customer's experience, deliver affordable energy to our customers that is cleaner, more sustainable and more reliable.","Several years ago, when we divested our exploration of production portfolio, we set in motion the transformation of Dominion Energy from our heavily commodity exposed ENP a utility company into one of the world's finest regulated energy infrastructure companies. The offer to buy at Dominion Midstream as well as the sale of merchant power generation assets, and our interest in Blue Racer midstream will further reduce commodity exposure in several of our business model. We have identified and are actively developing the first set of regulated growth plans - growth programs across all of our operating units that will provide meaningful benefit to our customers, and aggregate to billions of dollars annually of gross capital investments which will support our earnings growth well into the next decade.","Let me turn now briefly to the offer we have made effectively to buy in Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. This decision was the result of a careful and patient evaluation of the sustainable ability of Dominion midstream to support Dominion Energy's growth capital plans at a cost of capital advantage. We took Dominion Midstream public in late 2014, since we took them public, there has been a gradual but absorbable shift in public capital market support to the MLP structure. That retreat accelerated meaningfully after March 1, 15 [ph] policy reversal on income tax recovery through cost of service rates. Public equity investment, they mastered limited partnerships this year is some 90% lower than in past years. And the outlook for recovery to historic levels is not promising.","In addition to weak capital market conditions, there has been an evolution of limited partner investor views on incentive distribution and governance rights, that erodes support for the structure that allowed Dominion Energy's general partner to exercise a level of operational control and retain an amount of financial upside that exceeded the level of our common unit ownership. For these reasons, Dominion Energy has provided Dominion midstream with an exchange offer that represents fair value or its underlying assets. Finally, I want to make a few comments on our offer to merge with SCANA Corporation. In North Carolina, we are pleased to have agreed to a settlement with the staff as credible for the commission and which we expect will be approved in December.","In South Carolina, the hearing of a number of related matters commenced this morning. Last week, we submitted an alternative customer benefit plan as an option for the PAC to consider, which provides significant customer value, while also preserving the economics of the transaction for Dominion Energy. While we prefer our original plan, we are comfortable with the new alternative and if the commission determines that the alternative plan is in the best outcome for customers we are willing to move forward with that solution. We are confident that we will complete our merger with SCANA later this year. In summary, we have successfully executed several initiatives to support our earnings and credit objectives and the sale of noncore unregulated assets which further improve our business risk profile and clarify our investment narrative.","We have delivered very strong earnings results that have been at\/or above the high-end of guidance range for three straight quarters and we're continuing to expect the full year results will be above the midpoint of our narrowed guidance range. The company continued to demonstrate a culture of excellence in safety and operating performance. We are embracing enhanced reporting and disclosures around ESG matters and look forward to increased investor average on those topics. We are laying the foundation for the diverse portfolio of capital investment programs that will drive predictable growth well into the next decade.","We continue to progress towards completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and supply better projects. And we are optimistic that we will complete our merger with SCANA late this year.","With that, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from securities.","Shahriar Pourreza","So very healthy transaction multiple on Blue Racer, so quick thoughts there as I'm assuming this kind of surpassed your internal assumptions but more importantly, can you just elaborate further on the earn outs and are they incremental to your current delevering timeframe assumption or do you assume the earn outs are in your plan. So what I am trying to get at is can we see a further reacceleration of your parent leverage targets?","James Chapman","It's Jim. We are very happy with that transaction. We satisfied with the value and the term. In particular, we are happy with the structure which allows us on to on the one hand derisk at 1.2, but on the other hand still participate in the growth of that business over the next three years would be up to $300 million of earn out payments. The detail - the very specific details of those earn outs are not going to be public that's between us and first reserve. But it's formally. So if Blue Racer revenues and EBITDA grow over the time period above some reasonable threshold, we participate in that every year, participate in that growth upto that $300 million maximum level. So very happy. As it relates to our credit profile, we are using the upfront proceeds this year to repay parent company debt. I think that brings us to where we need to be on a credit basis already. So the 300, the upto 300 over the next three years is just a part of the give-and-take on our overall plan of 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2020.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it, okay. So it's incremental. Just real quick on ACP. We got the delay. We got the higher cost estimate, right? So can you elaborate a little bit further on how should we think about the impact of the projects returns versus your original estimate? Or does sort of tax reform kind of mitigate any return pressures versus what your original assumptions were? And then just real quick around sort of the delays. And it seems like your hedging yourself a little bit around potential for further delays. You know can just hit on a little of contingencies you have in place to sort of have in place to mitigate any further delays, I mean do you feel better about this updated and service date?","Thomas Farrell","I'll answer the question on the return, Shahr, and Diane will talk about the hedging as you referred to it. Through this process, we've already been through one process with customers on the rates, and we'll continue to work with them. The returns are going to be very adequate and comments with the normal returns we get in projects like this in our midstream business. Now I'll turn it over to Diane.","Diane Leopold","This is Diane Leopold. Would say is when we first updated the cost estimates in light of the delay and the stop work order, we also updated all cost estimates for aspects - all aspects of our construction plan, including seasonality and when we're going to be building each of the spread and related productivity factors. We believe those are very reasonable for the plan that we have in place. And then we did add appropriate contingency level to cover a range of risk that are typical for our project at this phase.","Operator","The next question will come from Steve with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","So just agree on a rate sales price on Blue Racer. So just in the context of reaffirming your 6 to 8% growth. Does that fully include now all these asset sales and the debt paydown?","James Chapman","It does.","Steven Fleishman","Okay, great. And then Jim, you mentioned the business mix improvement. Is that so obviously - we can see that. Is it possible you also get some kind of business risk reassuring from the agencies. Or from these changes or is that not likely?","James Chapman","I think that's possible. We certainly see it that way as the reason we have done it in that manner. It's a little bit early to comment as we haven't really held those discussions yet with agencies. But that will be a fair argument to make in my view.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then, maybe one last question for Tom on the SCANA deal, I think you said you remain very optimistic on getting it done. It's obviously very noisy down there. And it's hard to - when you're watching it from the newspapers that necessarily be that strong on it. So could you maybe just give a little more rational why you're very optimistic about getting it done?","Thomas Farrell","Sure, Steve. It is noisy. There's lot of things going on, there's lots of moving parts, but we we've been working on all those moving parts now for 10 months. We're very familiar with the folks that we're dealing with and what their interest are and their needs are. And in the end of the day, the Dominion offer or two offers now, our original offer which very popular with customers by the way, and the alternative offer which is popular with other kinds of customers are by far in a way, it's not even close, the best alternative for SCANA in the state of South Carolina, we were confident that the policymakers will come to that conclusion. We saw that last week or earlier I guess this week with the letter from Speaker Lucas for example, recognizing that among all the alternatives, this was the best.","Operator","The next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Gregory Gordon","Can you hear me? There is no mention in the official slide deck or the release on dividend policy, so can you just restate where you are on the dividend policy, please?","Thomas Farrell","No change for our dividend policy.","Gregory Gordon","So 10% growth for '19?","Thomas Farrell","Yes, but it's obviously up to the board, it's up to the board but that's the expectation, yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I just wanted to follow up little bit on the credit question still. Can you elaborate a little bit on the use of proceeds year useful rates are obviously very well on the manger proceeds there. by just thinking about the near-term and practically what you're doing?","Thomas Farrell","Yes, so for the Blue Racer proceeds and the generation sale proceeds all expected this quarter. So we will take that and use it to repay parent level debt as mentioned. And we have kind of an array of debt in parent company, some of which is prepayable, some of which is commercial paper, which is kind of a shock absorber on our baseline timings of their receipt etcetera, cetera. So we have identified ways to use that cash this quarter and pay down debt. I would expect some Big Bang kind of liability management exercise with standards and the like. It's going to be managed on a more solid basis with our existing securities which are prepayable, et cetera.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And maybe to clarify that. Just obviously it's very good multiples here. I mean net-net, how do you see it in terms of accretion, dilution on an earnings basis relative to the liability management?","James Chapman","Given the sales price - prices achieved, and given the reduction in interest from the debt paydown, and given the likely receipt of earn out proceeds on the Blue Racer side, we are very comfortable with that impact is modest and in line with our 6% to 8% growth profile through 2020.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent. And then just a quick clarification on SCANA. Just with respect to the deal and of course the court case pending, how do see that court case. is there a pathway to that court case and the ability to close the transaction given any net range of outcomes?","Thomas Farrell","Well, one of the conditions we have to close is to no change in law, that court case with change law as we - as it existed when we made the decision transaction. But no orders being entered. Lots of rumors running around South Carolina and I just wouldn't believe everything one reads in the newspaper about every single thing everybody is saying. We're going to continue to work with all the parties including that we have the lawsuit, we're not a party of the law suit. But obviously the interest of that law suit. As well as what's going on at the Public Service Commission. So all these things have to be resolved without affecting financial parameters that we entered into the original financial parameters we entered into with SCANA in January. Or we won't close. I'm optimistic that that will all - we work our way through all of it, and we will close by the end of the year.","Operator","The next question will come from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","So quickly just following up on SCANA. I wanted to understand what prompted the new proposal? Was there some feedback you received that suggested this would go better? And is there room for another proposal? Or this is it at this point, this is what's on the table and you're expecting one of these to go through?","Thomas Farrell","We have been in dialogue with people, variety of customers, customer classes, policymakers, all name it for literally last 10 months. And it became apparent to us that there was the significant interest by many in moving the refund into more of a non-rate going reduction. So we work through that and came with the proposal that you saw us put forward I guess it was last week. Things are all sort of running here. I guess it was last week that we put that proposal out. But that's all, there's two proposals, either one we're comfortable with. We don't expect any changes to either one of them.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Fair enough. And then secondly, in terms of Blue Racer, the $300 million earn out, Jim, is that expected to show up in operating earnings, is that going to be removed more as onetime?","James Chapman","The $200 million, most likely in operating earnings.","Praful Mehta","I got you. And finally just on ACP. If you have a - you kind of highlighted the point that you want to hit the late 2019 timeframe to meet the critical winter period. If you do not hit that timeframe, is there any implications from an earnings or any penalties perspective?","Diane Leopold","No, I wouldn't expect any change in earnings. The construction plan and costs are going to be similar regardless given the AFUDC that we have when we get into service.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning's conference call.

At this time, each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today\u2019s presentation, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Steven Ridge, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Steven Ridge","Good morning and welcome. I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website to view the earnings release kit, a presentation that accompanies this morning\u2019s prepared remarks and additional quarterly disclosures. The Investor Relations team will be available after today\u2019s call to answer any questions regarding this quarter\u2019s results.","Earnings materials including our prepared remarks today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","This morning, we will discuss some measures of our Company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP, reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which we are able to calculate are contained in the earnings release kit.","Joining today's call are Tom Farrell, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Chapman, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer as well as other members of the executive management team.","I will now turn the call over to Jim.","James Chapman","Thanks Steve and good morning. Before I walk through the quarterly results which were above the mid-point of our guidance range, I wanted to highlight Dominion Energy\u2019s key investment themes, all of which were consistent with the messaging from our Investor Day in March.","At the highest level, we delivered exceptional value to our customers, our communities, our employees, and our shareholders.","We do this by providing affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy to our customers. Approximately, two-thirds of our operating income comes from our state regulated utility operations whose customers center around five key states.","Our demand for utility-centered FERC transmission and storage customers account for most of the rest of our operating income.","Together, these regulated and regulated-like customers comprise approximately 95% of our total operating income. From 2019 through 2023, we plan to invest $26 billion in growth capital programs that will modernize, strengthen, and improve the sustainability of our systems to the benefit of these customers.","Further, we do this by engaging with communities in which we live and work by being responsible stewards of the environment, and by focusing relentlessly on the safety of our nearly 20,000 employees. Tom will touch on these three topics more extensively in his remarks.","Finally, we do this by delivering financial results that are consistently within our guidance for earnings and dividend growth. As an example, this quarter\u2019s results represent the 15th consecutive quarter of delivering weather-normalized operating earnings per share that are at or above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and also the 15th consecutive quarter of being in or above the range without weather normalizing. And today, we are also reaffirming our annual and long-term growth guidance.","Turning now to quarterly results on Slide 4, today we reported third quarter 2019 operating earnings of $1.18 per share compared to our guidance range of $1.00 to $1.20 per share. Strong performance across our segments was aided by better-than-normal weather, which increased utility earnings by about $0.05 per share.","Adjusted for normal weather, operating earnings for the quarter were $1.13 per share, which is also above the midpoint of our guidance range.","GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.17 per share, a reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. On Slide 5, we've summarized several milestones achieved since our last call. First Millstone began to sell electricity under the Zero Carbon Power Contract with Connecticut Utilities on October 1.","Under the 10-year contract, Millstone will sell 9 million megawatt hours of electricity per year, representing 55% of the plant\u2019s output at a fixed price for $49.99 per megawatt hour. This contract, the financial impact of which is incorporated into our existing guidance recognizes the tremendous value of Millstone\u2019s environmental and other attributes for the state and the region.","For the plant output not covered by the contract, we will continue to employ a prudent hedging strategy. Note that the contract does not cover capacity as the entire plant is expected to continue to be compensated via the existing regional capacity program. We\u2019re pleased with this agreement as it ensures the ongoing financial viability of the plant, and we wish to thank the Governor's office, DEEP, PURA, and the electric utilities who work in a collaborative and thoughtful fashion to safeguard the state's environment, economy, employment, and energy security.","Next, we continue to achieve constructive results across our various and normal course state-level regulatory proceedings. In North Carolina, we reached a nearly complete settlement with commission staff for our electric operations in the state with interim rates based on a 9.75% ROE to be effective this month.","In Utah, our gas distribution business has filed its first post-merger base rate proceeding, which we expect will conclude early next year. Finally, we expect resolution of our Virginia ROE proceeding later this month.","The updated ROE will impact in the near-term, approximately $4 billion of rate base currently earning rider returns of 9.2% plus adders of up to 1%.","We estimate that every 50 basis point change in ROE would impact near-term rider earnings by between $0.01 and $0.02 per share per year.","Next, we expect to complete the transition to our new operating segment by the end of this year. As a reminder, and as shown on Slide 6, we are reorganizing the way we manage and report our operating segments to more closely align with their customer and regulatory profile.","During our fourth quarter earnings call early next year, we expect to provide our 2019 full-year results and 2020 guidance in conformity with these updated segments. As discussed previously, we believe that this new reporting structure will make our company more accessible and will highlight the premium nature of each of our businesses.","Turning to Slide 7. On October 21, we announced that as part of our previously communicated intention to establish a permanent capital structure for the Cove Point facility, we reached an agreement with a financial investor affiliated with Brookfield to participate in an equity recapitalization of that asset.","This transaction, the financial impacts of which are already included in our existing earnings, earnings growth guidance accomplishes several key objectives, including: highlighting the intrinsic value created through Dominion\u2019s five-year development efforts with an implied enterprise value of nearly $8.25 billion, compared to a construction cost at the time of liquefaction completion of just over $4 billion redeploying capital from the low-growth annuity type area into a robust regulated growth capital program, preserving full operational control of the facility with no impact on existing customer contracts or employees, and reducing Dominion\u2019s annual common equity financing needs in the coming years from the levels described at our March Investor Day.","Immediately upon close, expected later this year, we will use 100% of the proceeds to retire parent-level debt. This transaction, which attractively addresses the equity portion of the facility\u2019s long-term capital structure is step one of two, as we intend to finalize long-term debt related to the asset in the near future.","Moving quickly to credit, during 2018 we took major steps to improve our balance sheet while also reducing our business risk profile. We expect that our full-year 2019 credit metrics will be supportive of our existing credit ratings with debt coverage ratios normalize for merger related charges in the mid-teens.","Moving out to operating earnings guidance on Slide 8. As usual, our operating earnings guidance ranges assume normal weather variations from which could cause results to be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. For the fourth quarter, we're initiating guidance of $1.10 to $1.25 per share. Positive factors as compared to last year include the absence of the Millstone refueling outage, growth from regulated investment across electric and gas utility programs, contribution from the Southeast Energy Group, commitment of the Millstone Zero Carbon Contract, net capacity expense improvement and the impact of O&M initiatives.","Negative factors as compared to last year include the impact of 2018 asset sale, share issuances, and return to normal weather. This fourth quarter guidance implies a narrowing of our 2019 full-year guidance range to $4.15 to $4.30 per share with no change to the midpoint of our original guidance.","Before I turn it over to Tom, let me summarize it today, we reported our 15th consecutive quarter of weather normalized operating EPS at or above the midpoint of our guidance range. We're confirming the midpoint and narrowing our guidance range for 2019 full-year operating EPS and we are reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectation of approximately 5% next year, and 5% plus thereafter.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Farrell"," Thank you, Jim and good morning. First, a reminder that safety is our first core value. I'm pleased to report that our year-to-date safety performance is consistent with the record setting results we have achieved in the last few years.","We're focused on continuing that trend over the last two months of 2019. Turning to Slide 9, I will now address the topics Jim mentioned in his remarks. First three weeks ago, we released our latest sustainability and corporate responsibility report. It's our most comprehensive report to-date and it delivers on the company's commitment to complete transparency. it embraces ESG disclosure best practices, and it includes information on corporate governance and stakeholder engagement, social and workforce metrics and industries that match the standards of the Global reporting initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board as well as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.","Key highlights in the report include Dominion has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 52% since 2005. We've also prevented more than 250,000 metric tons of methane entering the atmosphere from our gas infrastructure assets in the past decade, which is the equivalent of planting more than 100 million trees. The company has raised its diverse hiring rate from 27% to 42% from 2013 to 2018 and one in every five new hires is a veteran. In 2018, Dominion contributed nearly $35 million social betterment and employees volunteered more than 126,000 hours in community service.","In August, we announced plans for the largest electric school bus initiative in the nation. This innovative effort aims to replace 100% of the approximately 13,000 diesel powered school buses in our Virginia Electric Utility Service territory by 2030, which will be the equivalent in emission reductions of removing 65,000 cars from the road.","The vehicle to grid technology allows the bus batteries to store and then release energy out of the grid during periods of high demand when the buses are not in use. Finally, last week, we announced that we are expanding our 50:50 partnership with Smithfield Foods become the largest renewable natural gas supplier in the nation.","In total, we are doubling our combined investment over the next 10 years to $0.5 billion which will allow us to capture RNG thatreduces greenhouse gas emissions that are equivalent to taking 500,000 cars off the road or planting 40 million new trees.","We are one of the most sustainable and innovative energy companies in the United States and we believe that our customers and shareholders will benefit from our efforts. Turning to Slide 10, we have several important initiatives underway in Virginia. First, Offshore Wind, last month we received key approvals from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management BOEM regarding the design, fabrication and installation of our 12-megawatt pilot project, which is under construction and scheduled to enter service late next year.","The knowledge and experience we obtained from the permitting construction and operations pilot will be invaluable as we embark on our programs to develop 2.6 gigawatts of utility scale offshore wind in support of Governor Northam\u2019s recent Executive Order Number 43. That order provided clear direction to policymakers and agencies regarding the State's sustainable energy future as well as a challenge to Dominion Energy to accelerate the life lock timeline with more renewables on our system, the challenge we embrace.","Our intention is to bring the project which is located 27 miles off the Coast of Virginia Beach online in three phases of 880 megawatts each. The three phases will enter service in 2024, 2025 and 2026 and taken together will be the largest offshore wind installation in the United States.","Projects will be developed and owned by Dominion Energy, Virginia with regulated cost recovery subject to approval by the Virginia State Corporation Commission. Our current five-year capital plan provided at our Investor Day identifies $1.1 billion for offshore wind inclusive of $300 million for the pilot. Preliminary cost estimates which we will work hard to reduce in the interest of customer savings. Total and additional $7 billion, we anticipate capital expenditures to ramp-up in the latter part of our current five-year plan with the most significant investment to take place in 2024 through 2026.","We look forward to working closely with policymakers, regulators and other stakeholders to establish Virginia as the center of the United States offshore wind industry. Efforts presently underway include Ocean Survey work and the development of the Construction and Operations Plan, which is targeted for submittal to BOEM late next year.","We will make additional details available as we continue to make progress. Offshore wind is just one of the many investment programs that we continue to execute on for the benefit of our customers and in accordance with the Grid Transformation and Security Act. Four weeks ago, we filed for a second phase of Grid Transmission investments to complement the cyber and physical security telecommunication investments already approved by the SEC this past January.","This second phase which calls for over $500 million of capital investment through 2021, will enhance service to customers through implementation of new technologies, and a series of new programs developed with input from stakeholders and customers over the past several months, as well as a thorough third-party cost benefit analysis.","That analysis concluded that the planned investments will deliver significant benefit to all customers across a wide range of areas, while also driving down -- driving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, increasing economic growth in the Commonwealth, and providing savings to electric vehicle owners.","This phase includes the installation of nearly one million smart meters, as well as a new customer information platform which allows customers to digitally manage their energy use. Our prudency determination is expected in about six months with recovery determinations thereafter.","Overall, we expect our grid transformation investment programs to total nearly $3 billion over a 10-year period. Finally, two weeks ago, we announced an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia that combined with previously announced contracts will produce enough renewable power to make roughly 45% of the state government\u2019s annual energy use, which is the largest state renewable energy procurement in the country.","To accomplish this, Dominion will own approximately 345 megawatts of new solar facilities and sell the output to the state under the long-term Power Purchase Agreement. The balance of the megawatts will come from a third-party owned wind farm.","With these projects, we are nearly halfway fulfilling the commitment we made to Governor Northam to have 3,000 megawatts of solar and wind resources in service or under development in Virginia by 2022. ","Turning to Slide 11, we have provided a brief summary of capital investment related to the GTSA. As you can see, we are taking significant steps in successfully implementing programs that have been identified by state policymakers as crucial for our state. Over the last several months, the SEC has approved approximately $1.6 billion of capital investment with an additional $800 million filed in pending approval.","During the third quarter, the Commission approved rider recovery for nearly $300 million of our Rider E request which was related to environmental upgrades in certain generating units. Since the last statewide election that took place two years ago, Virginia's policymakers have supported on a bipartisan basis, common statutory legislation that puts the Commonwealth firmly on a sustainable and modernized path to continue delivery of low carbon affordable and resilient power.","Notable examples include the Grid Transformation and Security Act in 2018 and comprehensive coal ash and world broadband solutions in 2019. As we execute on these policy priorities, we remain vigilant of customer fuel impacts. We intend to keep rates reasonable and competitive in the future, just as they are today.","Turning to Slide 12, we continue to see very strong customer growth across our gas distribution franchise. Pending under our rider investment programs, including pipeline replacement is tracking in line with the five-year approximately $2 billion CapEx plan highlighted at our investor day.","Last week, we received approval from Utah Public Service Commission to proceed with our investment in a regulated reliability driven LNG peaking facility. And in West Virginia, regulators recently approved a plan that will allow us to double our annual investment in replacing infrastructure at 2023.","In South Carolina, our integration efforts and focus on operational excellence continued to proceed successfully. In early September, as Hurricane Dorian swept up the East Coast, nearly 300,000 of our South Carolina electric customers as well as over 170,000 of our North Carolina and Virginia customers experienced service disruptions.","Our crews worked around the clock in hazardous conditions to quickly and safely restore power. In fact, in all three states, including South Carolina, where nearly 40% of our customers lost power, service was restored in less than three days. As part of our commitment to relief efforts across Virginia, North and South Carolina, we also donated $250,000 to the American Red Cross to support the purchase supplies, food as well as shelter for those in need.","Turning next to the Atlantic Coast pipeline on Slide 13. Consistent with our expectations, the United States Supreme Court granted our appeal of the Fourth Circuit Karl decision which relates to ACP\u2019s crossing underneath the Appalachian Trail.","We expect that the Supreme Court will schedule arguments to occur late winter or early spring of next year with a final decision no later than June 2020. We\u2019re confident in our legal position and believe that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s ruling will be overturned.","Our focus remains on the Supreme Court appeal, but all other options remain available. Let me also address two other points. Regarding the project\u2019s biological opinion, I will reiterate our commentary from last order that there is nothing in the court's opinion on the four species that we expect would prevent a biological opinion from being reissued during this winter\u2019s tree felling window.","However, even if the timing of the BO reissues prevents us from taking full advantage of the window, including through the end of the first half of next year, we do not expect the existing project cost estimate to $7.3 billion to $7.8 billion to change. This cost range which we provided early this year, incorporated a variety of potential permit resolution and construction recommencement timelines, including a successful at AT Supreme Court appeal.","We continue to expect project construction to be completed by the end of 2021 with full commissioning to conclude in early 2022. This past Tuesday, the Fourth Circuit have heard arguments regarding an appeal of our Buckingham compressor station, minor source air permit, we remain confident that the extraordinary protections undertaken at the site has adapted to address \u2013 and as adapted to address community input more than satisfy both the process and steps required by applicable law. Department provides with the most stringent controls for any compressor station in the United States.","We have demonstrated emissions measured added beyond the station fence line will meet the highest public health standards is applied to even the most sensitive populations and environments.","We expect the court to issue a ruling within the next three months. We expect the project will be able to deliver significant volumes to customers under our current timeline, even if this permit needs more time to be resolved. I'll also note that since the last quarterly call, we have continued to advance discussions with Atlantic Coast pipeline customers regarding the equitable resolution of project cost increases.","We expect to reach an agreement in principle by the end of this year, and we are confident that the result will satisfactory balance customer rates with project returns. Our customers demand for this critical and common sense energy infrastructure is unwavering.","Turning to Slide 14, early last month, we announced several leadership changes to better reflect the new financial and operating reporting structure that will take effect later this year. Bob Blue currently CEO of Power Delivery Group will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy Virginia and Dominion Energy Contracted Generation. Diane Leopold, currently CEO of the Gas Infrastructure group will assume responsibility for Dominion Energy South Carolina, Gas transmission and storage and gas distribution.","In addition, Bob and Diane will each assume the title of Co-Chief Operating Officer. Carter Reid, currently Chief Administrative and Compliance Officer will become the Chief of Staff for Dominion Energy and President of Dominion Energy Services. Bob, Diane, Carter and Jim Chapman, the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer will continue to report directly to me.","These leaders are exceptionally well qualified to play important roles in the execution of our long-term strategy and I congratulate them. I also want to thank Paul Koonce who will retire in the coming months for his many years of dedicated service to our company.","His contributions will be missed. And we wish him all the very best in his future endeavors. With that, I will summarize today's release as follows. We are on track to achieve full-year safety results that are consistent with record setting performance of recent years, we continue to take industry leading innovative steps to demonstrate our leadership on environmental, social and governance matters.","We achieved weather normalized operating earnings, exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 15th consecutive quarter. We're narrowing our full-year 2019 operating earnings per share guidance and affirming our original midpoint. We\u2019re reiterating our long-term EPS growth expectations of approximately 5% next year and 5% plus thereafter, and we're making significant progress across our capital investment programs to the benefit of our customers. We will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question and that is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey, good morning guys.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza","So, Tom, you obviously highlighted a couple of questions here. You obviously highlighted the huge opportunity you said you guys have with offshore wind right? And we know the development cycle could be kind of long, we've seen it with vineyard. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit around how you're thinking about contingencies around permitting, construction in contract terms, and then as the projects start to go through construction, maybe just a little bit on financing.","I mean, should we think about the first tranche of the projects, self-funding future projects with the cash flows they are generating. So maybe how we should think about sort of the financing of what could be a very large capital outlay?","Thomas Farrell","Thanks. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Paul Koonce who has spent an enormous amount of time working on this development, and Jim Chapman can answer any further questions on the financing. I would mention we are expecting rider recovery and we will seek rider approval for all three phases.","We've been working on this project for six years. We bought the right lease option, the lease rights in a 2013 auction that was run by BOEM. And ever since that time, we've been working with a variety of stakeholders to make sure we had the right plan and we had the right folks to help us do the pilot.","We got approval from the State Corporation Commission, it\u2019s been through BOEM, we have the permits for BOEM. One of the things to keep in mind that differentiates us from the New England situation is we own the entire lease for the entire coastal region of Virginia, and ot is 26 miles offshore. It is not in fishing grounds and it is not visible from the shore. So, it's very significant differentiating aspects of what's going on here in Virginia and what you've seen happen in New England, but from the macro level, and I'll turn it over to Paul to answer the balance of your question.","Paul Koonce","Thanks, Tom. Shahriar, good morning. As Tom mentioned, we've been at this for quite some time. We expect, as Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks, to file the construction and operating permit about this time next year. We\u2019ve got ample time to get the BOEM permit in place in order to meet the first phase construction. We will be starting the work now, the ocean mapping, the geotech work, the environmental studies, and that will take place over the course of 2020. And having, as Tom mentioned, having just gone through it on the CVOW project, well that was a research area permit and this is a commercial and operating permit. The process is identical, that we know the stakeholders, we know the process and we feel really pretty good about it. I'll ask Jim to comment on financing.","James Chapman","Yes, two things, Shah, one is as Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks in our existing plan that we walked through in some detail back in March, we highlighted $1.1 billion of spending in offshore wind in our plan from 2019 to 2023. So, obviously recent announcements are much larger dollars than that. The vast majority of the increase is going to come in those years of completion 2024, 2025, 2026.","So the majority of the spending to come in our current planning horizon is already in our plans that we walked through, and the rest we will update over time as time comes closer, but given what Tom and Paul just described, this is all in a regulatory construct to be financed at Vepco. It's certainly achievable, but the details will come in the next period.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Just around VRP, the retirement plan, is there any status, and then I know your past comments is it's supportive of your growth, maybe just a little bit of a sense on how that program is going, how it's shaping the O&M profile, and sort of bigger picture is VRP offshore wind, the rate plans you have in Virginia, is there a point in time when you can change the way we guide to grow, i.e. moving from five plus more of a range especially as we're trying to model what the incremental accretion is from offshore wind, because it just seems like between Cove Point, your plan is becoming much more visible. So, is there a point in time when you can start to layer in more of a definitive growth range versus five plus?","Paul Koonce","Shah, you have linked quite a few things into one question there, good job. Look the offshore wind, what that does to our guidance, I mean, it's beyond our five-year planning horizon.","So, the spending and any associated earnings as I just walked through the $1.1 billion including the pilot, I mean that\u2019s in our plan, it\u2019s in our earnings guidance. There are no changes for now on that front. On the VRP, you are right, that is kind of done and dusted earlier this year. We talked about that as being a savings of, call it, $0.05 to $0.06 this year maybe double that on a full run rate next year and diminishing over time as it's given back to customers.","So that -- we talked about that as being available savings to offset unforeseen headwinds, and that's still the case. But as an update this year, as you know, the vast majority of our business, 95% of our business is not commodity exposed in any way, the 5% that's not regulated, regulated like it is.","And within that 5% of our operating earnings, there's a couple things. One is obviously the gas commodity environment is weak, and our business is largely immune to that. We have a little bit of exposure, mostly around our single remaining processing plant, which is in West Virginia, and that's a little bit of a headwind as those businesses go from like very small to even smaller this year.","So that is a little bit of headwind, well materially though, this farm-out program that has been very successful as you know, Shar, this is monetizing acreage and mineral resources, blow our storage field. We announced that program in early 2015. And we give guidance to the end of the decade of $450 million to $500 million of pre-tax earnings. And we've been taking along that kind of like clockwork, we\u2019re 75% through that, that guidance. But given the pricing, given the commodity environment and the pricing that's available to us today, we're choosing not to transact on a farm-out this year.","And we're going to, we're going to hold that acreage, net value for farm-out transactions in future periods when there's an improvement in the commodity pricing environment. So what that means is obviously we just reiterated our guidance in the midpoint. So that means we've overcome any unforeseen headwind previously unforeseen related to our decision, not to transact on a farm-out this year. So that is basically the VRP savings which we're using it pretty much as we described, we would. VRP savings and other initiatives to overcome that decision. So no change to our guidance, those are the parts.","Shahriar Pourreza","Perfect, guys, thank you so much.","Paul Koonce","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Yes, hi, good morning.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman","Hey Tom. So your offshore wind is obviously different from really any other so far that it's going to be done, plan to be done in the regulated business. How do you know that that structure of it will be approved or could there be people that want to try to bid for it, et cetera. Could you talk about that?","Thomas Farrell","Sure. Well, we're the only one that owns the offshore lease. We own 100% of the offshore lease, we pay for it in the auction, nobody else can build a wind farm off of Virginia. Governor Northam if you I guess couple of months ago now called for the construction of this wind farm because it's his intention to help Virginia developed into the center of the offshore wind industry along the East Coast and that's a challenge that we embrace.","And he specifically said that he recognized that there may be some who want to push back on that, whether it was necessary required or a good thing for Virginia that he was going to work very hard to ensure that public policy and regulatory supports in place to carry out this plan. And it was only after those statements that we went ahead with our announcements, the full deployment. Although we had been working obviously because we filed for the PJM interconnection agreement.","So there's obviously a process in front of us, we are highly confident that it will be carried out to fruition. There is a lot of public support from this for this project, including from political leaders on both sides of the political fence, both Democrats and Republicans want to see this thing happen.","So we have, obviously there are long way to go on it, but we have high confidence level in it going forward. It'll be the only offshore wind farm in Federal Waters. It will not be visible from the shoreline. So you don't have any of these visual impacts of concern people. Environmental community is very supportive of the project going forward. The economic development people In Tidewater, Virginia are very supportive of this going forward. So, obviously, we don't have any guarantees of that Steve but we have a very high confidence level in the outcome.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, great. Thank you.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, team.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And congratulations to all those receiving promotions here, another number. But perhaps just to pile on this offshore wind question, and perhaps the compliment that you talk about finding ways to mitigate costs to consumers, can you talk a little bit more precisely about the game plan first for qualifying on the tax credit front, just given the longevity of the plan, but if you're starting today, in theory, you should qualify the sum of it and then and then separately, when you come out with some more definitive plans and filings except maybe following the last question here to actually pursue this at the SEC level?","Thomas Farrell","Well, let me just give you a macro answer, Julien. And the folks who got the promotions are in the room, they heard your congratulations. On a macro base and I'll turn over to Paul Koonce.","We are very concerned here about customer rates. It's something we focused on all the time. And because our goal is to ensure that our customer rate stays very competitive, well below national averages below the regional averages, they are now and we intend for them to stay that way including with the construction of this wind farm.","So we will be working very hard with the fabricators, developers, installers. We will be the operators to ensure that we get the cost down as low as we can as we go ahead, which will be important for everybody involved helping us with the project. So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul.","Paul Koonce","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, Julien. Again, just to follow up on Tom's comments about costs, I think that's one of the key reasons why we broke the project up in three phases, so that we could continue to let the supply chain mature, let the costs continue to come down, so that the impact rates are minimized.","Just in terms of ITC, and safe harboring, of course as you know in order to qualify for ITC, a treatment for an offshore wind farm you have to begin in construction this year. We're looking at that, we don't have anything to comment about that, but we're aware of that timing. There may be some things that we can do to safe harbor certain of those costs. So we're before more to come on that in 2020.","In terms of plans and filings we're not as Tom said, we're going to file for the BOEM application this time next year. We're not prepared to say exactly when we're going to file for the SEC application. But I can tell you that we will be conducting many public meetings over the course of 2020.","As we make the environmental assessment, obviously, marine lives, plant and birds, we will be doing ocean mapping and will be doing geotech analysis or sub-service analysis. So you will begin to see all that sort of play out in 2020. And I think that will be a good way to sort of pace when we might expect to make an SEC filing.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. But just to clarify the last question too, how much of this is in the five-year window as you see it, perhaps Phase 1 if you will?","Thomas Farrell","Julien, as mentioned, we've got $1.1 billion in total in our five-year plan as we walk through in March and for now that's the number.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","That $7 million is added to that?","Thomas Farrell","That\u2019s right, everything else comes in 2024, 2025, 2026.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, all right. Fair enough, excellent and then just to clarify the prior one on 40, the order does ","that change the criteria that the SEC is going to be applying in that process?","Paul Koonce","Julien, this is Paul. The GTSA finds that offshore wind is in the public interest. Now the SEC ","process is well known whether they and how they conduct a market test anytime, we build generation for the benefit of our ratepayers, there's a certain process that we follow and that's the process we know well and we'll just step to that when that time comes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thanks for the patience guys.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Thanks guys. Shah\u2019s question was like the question from back to school, one question but in 27 parks right? On ACP, when I first read the release, I felt like it was kind of my first reaction was, this is kind of negative. It looks like there could be slippage in the biological permit, but now that I'm hearing your commentary on it, I feel less. I guess we should feel less concerned because you feel like even if the, even if the permit comes in, after the turn of the year, you've scrubbed your construction costs forecasts and you still feel like you can move the schedule around and comment on budget?","Thomas Farrell","Thanks, Greg. I'll turn it over to Diane Leopold, who spends a lot of her life working on the Atlantic Coast pipeline. Diane?","Diane Leopold ","Yes, when we looked at it, I think you haven't exactly right. When we gave guidance earlier this year, we looked at a lot of different scenarios and a lot of different contingencies to try to capture a variety of outcomes, including going to the Supreme Court, including when we would restart construction. And so just given looking at the different segments of the pipeline, we feel comfortable with that, we are well within what we've incorporated for both cost and schedule at this point.","Greg Gordon","Can you give us some sense of why the permit may have slipped a few more months? Is it just that they're being extra careful to make sure that they comply with all the nuances of the remand and don't get another stay or is there something else going on?","Thomas Farrell","Greg, I don't think we're trying to imply that we think the permit is slipped. What we're trying to say is, even if it does, work still on the schedule and cost.","Greg Gordon","Okay, great. My last question\u2026","Thomas Farrell","I think it\u2019s going to slip.","Greg Gordon","Okay, sorry. I'm sorry if I misconstrue that. The last part of my question, you talked to negotiations with the offtakers on the pipe who are mainly utilities. This is a demand driven pipe, they need the gas, which is why you're building it. It's not a supply push situation.","I think investors are concerned that with the cost overruns, this winds up being a pipe that doesn't earn its cost of capital. But you seem to be positioning it in such a way that you should be able to potentially share the burden of those unexpected cost increases with the utilities who are taking the capacity.","So can you talk through like how much of that you are, you think you'll be able to share given the unforeseen delays in the pipe and what type of return we should expect on the pipe, if you're successful?","Diane Leopold ","Yes, this is Diane Leopold again, I won't get into the actual expected project returns, I will tell you, as Tom said, in the actual script, the customers very much need this pipeline for regional security, for their own customers needs. This is clearly a demand driven pipeline. And we are in very constructive negotiations with the customer for fair rates to their customers as well as fair returns for us and more comfortable with the returns that we\u2019ll get for the pipeline.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you very much.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Turnure","Good morning, guys.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning.","Christopher Turnure","Tom, I think you spent a lot of time in your prepared remarks on the political environment in Virginia. And kind of how you guys are thinking about that in the legislation from last year, but could you give us an update to both the South Carolina and North Carolina or pardon me, South Carolina, Virginia regulatory environments right now and political environments, and also just the latest on your South Carolina regulatory strategy for next year?","Thomas Farrell","Sure. We announced the South Carolina the SCANA merger, I guess late in, I guess it was 2017. And then spent the year 2018 going through the process and it was a relatively hot political climate in South Carolina over because the SCANA and Santee Cooper\u2019s cancellation of the expansion of the summer business plans.","We went through that whole process very transparently, answered all the questions, went to all the meetings. And then, as we closed the transaction, we said to policymakers that our intention was to stay out of the headlines through our blocking and tackling provide reliable service, both gas and electric at reasonable and much reduced electric rates and just be part of the community. ","That was our goal. And that's exactly what's happened in the State of South Carolina. Things are very moving along very well there, progressing well. We're out of the headlines except when we do things in the communities we serve, including the extraordinarily prompt restoration of the loss of electricity for 40% of our customers got all their lights back in three days. All that helps, the community understand their new neighbor.","We will be filing a rate case next year, we are under earning in South Carolina, it\u2019s well known to everybody and we're formulating and completing that regulatory strategy now but we will be filing in IT May.","James Chapman","We can file before May 1.","Thomas Farrell","Before May 1 of 2020. Now I'm sorry, in North Carolina. We have a rate case file in North ","Carolina, we have settled all but one or two, we consider them to be relatively small issues got agreed on 9.75% ROE, very constructive regulatory environment and economic development environment in North Carolina.","Christopher Turnure","And in Virginia, if the legislature stays Republican, would that change some of the plans that you've been talking about today, or kind of shift your capital spending at all in different direction?","Thomas Farrell","No, we have a long history of working with whatever parties in the majority in whatever the two houses, Democratic Governors, Republican Governors, Democratic leaders and Republican leaders, so not to expect any changes to our plan.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, and then my second question is just on equity needs going forward. I think you partially addressed this in your prepared remarks. But will the sale of existing stake in Cove Point mean that you will not need any equity, internal or external for the next several years?","James Chapman","Yes, going back to our, it\u2019s Jim. Going back to our guidance from our analyst day back in March, we had shown a projection through 2021 that had equity component to support our regulated capital spending of $300 million of DRIP as on and $300 million to $500 million per year of ATM. So all the number of programs. With the Cove financing, we are using 100% of those proceeds by year-end $2 billion to pay down parent level debt as I mentioned, but we will effectively offset the ATM portion of that prior guidance in 2020 and 2021.","So taking to midpoint of that $300 million to $500 million, is $400 million, so that goes to zero. But the DRIP, the DRIP is always on. So that will be the only remaining program that's active for equity in those years.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, that's clear. Thank you.","James Chapman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Thomas Farrell","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein","On Cove Point -- good morning. Is there any interest in selling an additional stake in Cove Point at this point or is just now you're now at the minimum desired level of ownership?","James Chapman","Thank you for that question. There's no interest in our desired outcome.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And in the discussions with the ACP customers, I just wanted to be clear that the talks are over the cost increases above the I think $6.25 billion that's currently in the agreement embedded in current agreements?","Diane Leopold ","Yes, I won't disclose anything in the contract, but it's basically negotiating cost increases up to the current anticipated level.","Michael Weinstein","And is there anything you can say about what those contracts obligate each party at, on the face of it at this point before negotiations?","Diane Leopold ","No, no, we don't want to disclose that thing.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, and just one last question I had is about the renewable tariff, I think you know had some major C&I customers in Virginia looking for alternative suppliers and have you guys has Virginia -- has the Virginia utility received permission to have its own renewable tariff at this point, so they can compete against these renewable suppliers?","Thomas Farrell","I will ask Bob Blue to answer that question.","Robert Blue","And Michael, it\u2019s Bob. We have pending an application for a 100% renewable energy tariff, as you know in Virginia law, our customers can seek service from a competitive service provider unless utility has 100% renewable tariff we filed for one earlier this year.","But hearing on that in November, the State Corporation Commission staff filed their testimony yesterday and did not raise significant objections to our proposal and the one that we have filed is modeled closely on one that was approved not earlier by the Commission. So we feel very good about where that will go.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Thomas Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and enjoy your day."],"6795":["Dominion Resources (NYSE:D) Q2 2013 Earnings Call  August  6, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Tom Farrell \u2013 CEO","Mark McGettrick \u2013 CFO","Paul Koonce \u2013 CEO, Dominion Virginia Power","David Christian \u2013 CEO, Dominion Generation Group","Tom Harlin - IR","","Analysts","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse ","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research ","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank ","Julian Smith - UBS","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs ","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Dominion\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, we have Tom Farrell, CEO; Mark McGettrick, CFO; and other members of senior management. ","[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Harlin, vice president of investor relations and financial analysis, for the Safe Harbor statement.","Tom Harlin","Good morning, and welcome to Dominion\u2019s second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning\u2019s earnings release and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification on these schedules. ","If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the investor relations page on our website, register for e-mail alerts, and view our second quarter 2013 earnings documents. Our website address is www.dom.com. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will guide this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates, and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our second quarter 2013 operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the third and fourth quarters of 2013, the full year 2013, as well as operating earnings before interest and tax commonly referred to as EBIT. ","Reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained on schedules 2 and 3 and pages 8 and 9 in our earnings release kit.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick, and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the second quarter of 2013 and our guidance for the third and fourth quarters. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities for the quarter and review the progress we\u2019ve made on our growth plan.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion\u2019s operating earnings were $0.62 per share for the second quarter, compared to our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. Earnings for the quarter were impacted by lower than expected kilowatt hour sales at Virginia Power, a function of both milder weather and lower than expected economic growth in our commercial and governmental sectors and operating losses at our producer services business, driven by large basis declines.","GAAP earnings were $0.35 per share for the quarter. The difference between second quarter GAAP and operating earnings were driven by the following charges. First, we recorded a charge of $70 million associated with the sale of our Brayton Point and Kincaid power stations. The majority of this charge was driven by cost to redeem debt at both facilities. We expect to close this transaction in the third quarter of this year, with only FERC approval remaining. ","Second, we decided to exit all activities in our producer services business except fuel management services for Appalachia producers and Dominion affiliates. Emerging shale production has fundamentally changed the regional gas markets, all but eliminating seasonal and locational pricing variations. The mark-to-market value of our open forward positions results in a charge of $24 million. We expect to sell the majority of these positions by year-end.","In addition, we terminated lease agreements for two small gas processing facilities in Ohio and West Virginia, and we\u2019ll mothball these units over the next two years. These plants were built before the Utica and Marcellus shale potential was known and are not large enough to economically accommodate high-volume shale wells.","Finally, we reflected a $17 million charge in support of our operation and maintenance expense reduction program. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Before moving to operating segment results, let me spend a minute on sales growth. As we discussed on our last earnings call, first quarter kilowatt hour sales in our Virginia Power service territory were below our expectations. Based on the momentum in new connects and economic activity we had seen in the second half of last year, we had expected about 1% weather normalized growth from our traditional customer base and another 1% increase related to data centers.","However, total weather normalized sales growth in the first quarter was about 1%, and growth in the second quarter was less than half that amount. We are very pleased that weather normalized residential sales were nearly 2% higher than the same period last year and our data center growth for the same period is up over 12%.","However, we are seeing a significant shortfall in commercial and governmental sales versus our expectations. It appears this shortfall is driven by lower commercial sales in northern and eastern Virginia and a dropoff in usage by governmental customers in Hampton Roads. ","These areas are the most susceptible to impacts from the federal sequestration due to their high military and government support presence. We believe it is too early to say if these trends will be short term or have a longer term impact on sales.","As we stated on our first quarter call, we will be lowering our operating expenses by $100 million to safeguard against a potential sales decline versus our original expectations. As we will discuss in a moment, most of these expense reductions will occur in the third and fourth quarters.","Now, moving to results by operating segment, at Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the second quarter was $254 million, which was outside its guidance range. For electric distribution, kilowatt hour sales were below expectations, partially due to lower than expected load growth and milder than normal weather. ","Also, in early June, our electric distribution business experienced a storm that affected 330,000 customers. The cost of [unintelligible] for this storm was another driver of the lower results. Electric transmission exceeded guidance due to a rider revenue true up and higher rate base. ","EBIT for Dominion Retail was in the upper half of its guidance range. Weaker than expected results from the core business were offset by the monetization of a book of business in Illinois due to our decision to redeploy our capital into other markets. Retail is a maturing business, and you should expect us to routinely shift resources to states where we receive better current and future returns and away from those with lower returns.","Second quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $201 million, which was in the lower end of its guidance range. As I mentioned earlier, we have exited most activities of our producer services business due to the changing fundamentals in the region. The significant price volatility experienced as we were derisking producer portfolio resulted in a $12 million EBIT loss, accounting for most of Dominion Energy\u2019s shortfall for the quarter.","Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $298 million in the second quarter, which was in the lower end of its guidance range. Lower than expected kilowatt hour sales and mild weather were the principal factors driving the lower results for the regulated generation business. EBIT from merchant generation was just above the midpoint of its guidance range.","On a consolidated basis, both interest expenses and income taxes were below our estimates, benefitting earnings for the quarter. Moving to cash flow and treasury activities, funds from operations were $1.8 billion for the second quarter. ","Regarding liquidity, we have $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper, and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $2.1 billion, and taking into account cash and short-term investments, we ended the quarter with liquidity of $1.5 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit. ","Now, moving to our financing plans, we issued $1.1 billion of mandatory convertible securities in June. We were pleased with the market\u2019s response to our offering, and thank those of you who participated. Our financing needs for the remainder of the year include about $600 million of debt for Virginia Power and $750 million to $1.2 billion of debt for the parent company.","Portions of these issuances will be used to meet maturing obligations. We have locked in treasury rates through hedges for most of these planned issues, and the majority of our plan issuances for 2014.","Now to earnings guidance. As we have discussed on our previous calls, the bulk of our year over year operating earnings growth is expected to occur in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. For that reason, we are providing detailed guidance this morning for both the third and fourth quarters of 2013.","This should demonstrate that despite being in the lower half of our guidance ranges for the first and second quarters, we still expect to deliver full year operating earnings per share in the middle of our $3.20 to $3.50 per share guidance range.","We estimate operating earnings for the third quarter of 2013 within a range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. This compares with original operating earnings of $0.92 per share for the third quarter of 2012. As shown on slide seven, positive drivers for the third quarter include earnings for gas transmission projects, the absence of last year\u2019s Long Island Sound heat-related outage at Millstone, and higher rider-related revenues.","In addition, you should expect a reduction from our originally planned operating expenses of about $30 million. Negative drivers for the quarter include higher interest expenses and higher utility generation outage expenses.","We estimate operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 to be in a range of $0.95 to $1.05 per share. This compares with our originally reported operating earnings of $0.69 per share from the first quarter of 2012. The $0.31 increase from last year\u2019s fourth quarter to the midpoint of this year\u2019s range represents most of our year over year growth we expect for all of 2013.","Let me walk you through the drivers of this growth, which are detailed on slide eight. To remove the unique items from last year\u2019s $0.69, we subtract $0.08 per share from last year\u2019s initial asset drop into Blue Racer. Then we add back $0.05 per share of weather hurt from last year, and $0.10 per share due to last year\u2019s refueling outage at Millstone.","We are also announcing today that we plan to contribute the TL-388 pipeline to Blue Racer in the fourth quarter. This drop was not originally anticipated and will add $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter. The bulk of the operation and maintenance expense cuts we discussed on the last call will show up in the fourth quarter, adding another $0.05 per share.","The next step on the chart shows our normal earnings drivers, which include sales growth, higher rider revenues, and earnings from Blue Racer and our gas infrastructure projects. And finally, we note the loss of $10 million in anticipated earnings from our producer services business, offset by a $10 million fourth quarter pickup due to the expiration of the Millstone generator tax.","Our operating earnings guidance for 2013 remains $3.20 to $3.50 per share. Operating earnings for the first half of 2013 were $1.44 per share. Adding the midpoints of our ranges for the third and fourth quarters to the year to date earnings will take you to the middle of our guidance range for the entire year.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call, we have increased our Millstone hedge position from 73% to 80% for 2014 and from 48% to 58% for 2015. Please note that for our 2014 hedge positions, we show good growth over previous years. 2014 hedge prices are over 5% higher than 2013, with 80% of the volume hedged.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings were $0.62 per share for the second quarter, compared to a guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70. Lower than expected commercial and governmental sales growth and mild weather at Virginia Power, as well as lower contributions from our producer services business, were the main negative drivers for the quarter.","Our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2013 is $0.85 to $0.95 per share. Earnings from our growth projects and reduced operating expenses should drive these results.","Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013 is $0.95 to $1.05 per share. Normal weather, the absence of a Millstone outage, a new asset drop into Blue Racer, and reduced expenses should drive the higher year over year results.","And finally, our operating earnings guidance for 2013 remains $3.20 to $3.50 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Tom Farrell ","Good morning. Each of our business units achieved year over year improvements in operations and all but one group improved on record-setting safety performance. The second quarter net capacity factor of the six remaining Dominion nuclear units was 93%. ","Until our April 7 shutdown of North Anna Unit 2, for a scheduled refueling outage, all seven of our then-operating nuclear units operated continuously for 125 days. Millstone 3 achieved a breaker to breaker continuous run of over 500 days. ","We continue to move forward on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,329 megawatt Warren County combined cycle plant is progressing on schedule and on budget for a late 2014 commercial operation date. Overall, the project is 43% complete, engineering is 91% complete, procurement is 99%, and construction 35% complete.","About 1,400 people are presently employed at the site. Last week the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the company\u2019s CPCN and rider applications for the Brunswick County Power Station. The final notice to proceed was issued [to floor] yesterday, and we will immediately begin construction of the 1,358 megawatt three on one combined cycle facility and expect it to be in service by mid-2016.","The conversion of the Altavista, Southampton, and Hopewell plants from coal to biomass are progressing on schedule and on budget. The Altavista plant was placed into service last month. The remaining projects will be operational later this year.","We have a number of electric transmission projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. For example, last week a hearing examiner recommended approval of the Skiffes Creek line to support reliability in Hampton Roads. ","Our plans include new investments of over $500 million per year in growth projects, including the systematic rebuild of the 500 KB loop that is the backbone of our transmission network. ","Progress in our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues. The natrium processing and fractionation plant was placed into service in May. ","The Utica region continues to be very active. Through mid-July, a total of 789 horizontal Utica permits have been issued, and 387 wells have been drilled, an increase of 187 wells permitted and 90 wells drilled since the middle of April.","The management team at Blue Racer is actively marketing gathering and processing services to the producers in the Utica region. A 200 million cubic feet per day processing plant has been ordered to expand the capacity of natrium and construction commences this quarter. This facility will provide a service we had originally planned to fund ourselves that we had called natrium 2. ","Blue Racer has also ordered a second 200 million cubic feet per day processing plant that will be delivered to the [burn site] this fall. To enhance Blue Racer\u2019s gathering capacity, we plan to contribute the TL-388 pipeline to the joint venture in the fourth quarter. A filing with FERC to abandon by sale was approved on July 24.","Blue Racer is finalizing multiple agreements in the southern Utica region, with the potential for 150,000 to 200,000 acres to be dedicated to the joint venture, which will be more than enough at full production to support both the natrium phase 2 and burn processing plants.","As we have stated previously, in addition to growth projects at Blue Racer, we will also have growth projects along the Dominion system. For example, last week Dominion East Ohio signed binding precedent agreements with two customers to provide firm transportation services for over 300 million cubic feet per day from the outlet of a new Utica gas processing facility into nearby interstate pipeline interconnects. We expect to place this $90 million project into service in the fourth quarter of 2014. ","Also, last quarter Dominion Transmission announced a nonbinding open season to solicit interest in incremental firm transportation capacity to serve our traditional markets in New York State. The project contemplates access to the growing supply in the northern portion of the DTI system and delivering it to the Iroquois gas transmission system and to Niagara Mohawk, serving Albany, New York. We have seen significant interest and anticipate signing precedent agreements later this year. ","We continue to make progress on our Cove Point liquefaction project. Last quarter, we reported on our board\u2019s final investment decision, the signing of the terminal service agreements and EPC contracts, and the full filing with FERC and the Maryland Public Service Commission.","In May, the Department of Energy issued an export license to the Freeport LNG project, moving us up to second place in the queue. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect to commence construction in 2014 with commercial operation expected in late 2017.","Before we open the call for questions, I will give an update on the 2013 biannual review. Interveners submitted their testimony last week, and it is important to note that no intervener, including the Office of Consumer Counsel, opposed the company\u2019s position, that Virginia Power\u2019s base rates are not subject to downward adjustment because we did not earn above the authorized ROE ban. We expect to receive the staff\u2019s testimony later this month. Hearings are scheduled in September and a decision from the commission is due by the end of November. ","To summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the second quarter. Construction of the Warren County power station is proceeding on time and on budget. Construction will begin immediately on the Brunswick County power station. Our Blue Racer joint venture is operating as expected, and both it and Dominion Transmission are capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the Utica and Marcellus Shale regions. And we look forward to receiving our export license from BOE by the end of the year and regulatory approval to begin construction of our Cove Point liquefaction project.","Thank you, and we are ready to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse ","Could you give us a little more detail on your O&M cutting plans, kind of maybe a little more detail on what\u2019s going in to get the $100 million out? And as you guys are getting into the program, are you seeing room for additional savings beyond that number at this point?","Mark McGettrick ","The $100 million is really broken down in three main areas. About $50 million is coming from a reduction in staffing contractors and a remeasurement of our pension and OPEB. And let me just touch base on that for a second. We\u2019ve had some staffing reductions around our service territory to address this. Those are essentially complete. We have reduced contractors in support of our maintenance and our capital work and those are also complete.","And because of the significant change that has occurred in our staffing levels with the disposition of our [merchant] plants, specifically Kiwani, Break Point, Elwood, and Kincaid, as well as these incremental staff reductions that I just mentioned, we took a remeasurement of our pension and OPEB obligation in June, which will also support that $50 million annual savings due to staffing, contractors, and pension\/OPEB.","So that\u2019s the first piece. The second piece is we\u2019re going to reduce between $10 million and $15 million in administrative and general expenses in support of our business units. That process is well on its way and will be completed here shortly. And the remaining reductions are spread across the company in maintenance and in outage expense from all of our business units. So in aggregate, that is the key breakdown for the O&M.","Now, in terms of longer term, we would expect this level of reduction to be able to be carried forward beyond this year.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse ","And are you guys seeing more savings opportunities as you get into this? You have a bunch of companies this quarter who have talked about additional cuts and kind of bigger changes to retirement and healthcare benefits and that sort of stuff to try and manage the slow growth environment.","Mark McGettrick ","Well, I think if you look across the spectrum our operating expenses versus our peers are quite low in comparison. And I think as we\u2019ve gotten into this, the $100 million level has been achievable for us, but we really haven\u2019t seen anything incremental to that based on the plans we have thus far.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse ","And then on the producer services business exit, can you just walk me through for the full year how much earnings you guys expected from that business? And then will there be any residual costs beyond the exit and the charge you guys took this quarter?","Mark McGettrick ","To put it in perspective, again, for producer services, it\u2019s less than 2% of our earnings contribution for the company. It was a supplementary business for our pipeline area, and we expected, on an annual basis, about $40 million in contribution from that business. Going forward, on an annual basis, we would expect a contribution in the $15 million to $20 million range after exiting everything but the fuel management services that we talked about earlier.  ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse ","And then just on the retail business you guys have exited Illinois entirely. Where are you guys seeing opportunities in that business, and are there signs of margins stabilizing at this point?","Mark McGettrick ","Let me ask Paul Koonce to answer that.","Paul Koonce","We\u2019re seeing continued opportunities, clearly, in Texas. That\u2019s been a good market for us. We were recently ranked number one by JD Power in the Baltimore market area. We\u2019re seeing good customer growth in the Baltimore area as well as in Ohio. And we continue to have a lot of customers we continue to serve in Pennsylvania. Illinois, we just never made any progress, and so it just made sense for us to make sure that we\u2019re focusing our efforts on where we can see customer growth.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse ","And then I guess just one last question on the Blue Racer side of the business. How should we think about additional asset moves from Dominion into Blue Racer over the next 12 or 18 months? Is there a list or something we should track to figure out when they make sense to transfer over?","Tom Farrell ","The longer we\u2019ve spent with our partners at Caiman in the Blue Racer joint venture, the more opportunities we\u2019ve found. There\u2019s a lot of gas, as we\u2019ve mentioned. There\u2019s a big increase in wells being permitted, a big increase in wells being drilled, particularly in the Utica. We have a lot of assets sitting there in Ohio, where we have this geographic region. TL-288 wasn\u2019t contemplated as we started the year, so it\u2019s an example of the kind of thing. That\u2019s a pretty significant one. But we\u2019re finding other opportunities we can either build or find other assets we have to contribute. ","And I think it\u2019s also important to recognize that the Blue Racer partnership with Caiman, we\u2019re very pleased with it, but it\u2019s only limited to eastern Ohio and a few counties in Pennsylvania. We have geographic regions in Pennsylvania, West Virginia. Ultimately we are expecting, at some point, New York State, which we have a lot of assets to open up to drilling. ","So I\u2019m answering a little bit broader than your question. I think Blue Racer shows us the opportunities there are in this business, and not just in that JV, but in other areas.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research ","Just to follow up on that last question, you mentioned other opportunities in the other regions outside Ohio. Is it possible we might hear something on similar ventures for those in the near future?","Tom Farrell ","I\u2019m not going to predict when you might hear something. We\u2019re managing the business as we have, but we\u2019re always trying to look at other areas. So I don\u2019t want to give a timeframe around it. But we have a variety of things we\u2019re looking at.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research ","On the sales issue, to the degree that you determine that the sales weaknesses sustained due to sequestration or whatever the issue is, how should we think about that in the context of meeting your 5% to 6% growth rate long term?","Tom Farrell ","That\u2019s a very good question. If you break it out, you see that the residential sales growth was pretty good, just about 2% in the quarter. Data centers was quite good, 12%, I think, in the quarter. The issue has shown up in commercial sales. Governmental we actually don\u2019t expect to be a long term issue. We think that was anecdotal to the quarter for a variety of reasons.","The commercial, though, is an issue that we\u2019re looking at very carefully in northern Virginia, in particular eastern Virginia, around the naval base and the air bases and things we have in that part of the state. Commercial sales can come back quite rapidly. ","So we don\u2019t know. We\u2019re not going to make any judgments about what\u2019s going on with our sales growth based the anomalies in the second quarter. But we are watching it carefully. ","As far as the overall 5-6% growth, we have a lot of things going on at our company. We have, you\u2019ll see merchant growth next year in the power prices we have. Finally, we\u2019re through the trough of declining portions in merchant power with the sale of the fossil assets, which we will close on this quarter.","We have Blue Racer opportunities, we have other opportunities in gas infrastructure. We are not unaware of what other companies are doing with financial structures. So we\u2019ve got lots of things we\u2019re looking at. We have rider revenues. Brunswick was just approved, for example. We expect to come through the biannual review as we said previously, with our base rates intact. We have electric transmission growth projects.","So you take all the pieces together. We don\u2019t see any reason to change our 5-6% earnings growth targets at this time. If the sales issue continues, and if we conclude that it\u2019s longer term, we\u2019ll take a look at what that means in the overall context, but we aren\u2019t anywhere near that point right now.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research ","Just one last quick question on any kind of more color on DOE and LNG export? I think we\u2019re maybe kind of past the 60 days since the last approval.","Tom Farrell ","Yeah, we are. Just to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page, Steve\u2019s referencing, of course, when the last permit was issued in May, one of the assistant secretaries at DOE said they thought they were in a position to issue these permits ongoing, about every 60 days or thereabouts. We are past that 60-day window. Secretary Moniz in the interim has been appointed, confirmed. He\u2019s reorganized the department. He\u2019s getting to know his folks. ","He has said recently that he\u2019s examined the studies that were done on the economic impacts for non-free trade agreement countries, and indicated that no more studies are needed, that that study was adequate for their purposes. He examined the Freeport permit process, found that to be properly done.","So, all that said, we don\u2019t have any particular information that you don\u2019t have, but we anticipate more action from the Department of Energy pretty soon. And we\u2019ve said since March, when we had our analyst day, that we expected to get the DOE export permit during 2013, by the end of this year. And we still think that\u2019s the right timeframe.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Fremont with Jefferies. ","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","It looks like retail is already, year to date, at the low end of your guidance range. Should we expect a further decline in the remainder of the year in retail? Or is retail going to be flat to last year for the second half?","Paul Koonce","You know, if you look at where it is, and then you look at the third and fourth quarter, when you look at the third quarter last year and the fourth quarter last year, they actually had lower than expected margins because of some of the mark-to-market value that came in the second quarter 2012, so that when you do a full year comparison, what you ought to see is retail still hitting within this guidance range.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies ","And then I guess I\u2019m not quite understanding on producer services. You\u2019re talking about sort of an ongoing contribution of $15 million to $20 million. Where\u2019s that coming from?","Paul Koonce","You know, producer services, over the years, really engaged in a number of activities. One was the supply management, the transportation and storage management, for mid-Atlantic and northeast utilities. That\u2019s the activity that we\u2019re stopping. There really is no value for us to add in that procurement process.","The activities that will continue are really fee-based services for small Appalachian producers. Now, granted, in light of the Marcellus and Utica, it\u2019s a pretty small subset of producers, but they still pay our Dominion field service team a fee for getting gas from point A to point B, aggregating that gas, and really that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do, in addition to really focusing on the gas supply procurement activities for our Virginia Power fleet and our [unintelligible]. ","As we\u2019ve built out our gas fleet, that has become a much more important activity, and so we\u2019ll really be focusing our resources on that. ","Paul Fremont - Jefferies ","And my last question is, I guess you showed about $1.5 billion of interest rate swaps at the end of the first quarter. Is that mostly floating effects, or what makes up those swaps?","Mark McGettrick ","It\u2019s a mix. Some of it is fixed to floating, which we\u2019ve talked about, and we really initiated a number of years ago. That\u2019s the majority of it. But also some of that is reflected in hedging for future issues that we have for both \u201913 and \u201914 in terms of anticipated debt issues.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies ","So how much of that would be fixed to floating, like on a percentage basis?","Mark McGettrick ","I don\u2019t have that in front of me. We\u2019ll follow up with you after the call on that.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies ","Okay, and is there any concern there about the effect of rising interest rates on those positions?","Mark McGettrick ","No, really not. They\u2019re fairly short term dated. And I have to tell you, when we put those on three years ago, four years ago now, they have just been terrific for us, and they continue to be. So they\u2019re not longer term dated to give us any concern on any significant rise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley ","I wanted to just look longer term at your generation needs beyond Brunswick. And thinking about if you\u2019re in a more muted low growth, perhaps 5% or 1% low growth, can you talk broadly about, as you think about more generation requirements down the road, how should we be thinking about that longer term?","Tom Farrell ","Well, we file an IRP every year that keeps us up to date. PJM does its own analysis. We\u2019re still in a deficit situation in Virginia. We are still catching up with what happened over the course of an entire decade, 2000s, when nothing was built in the state whatsoever, and we had very rapid growth. So we\u2019re still in a deficit situation. We\u2019re catching up with that. Brunswick is an important part of that. ","But you need to remember, Brunswick is only replacing plants we\u2019re shutting down. Brunswick didn\u2019t gain us any ground at all on our short position. We had to shut down the Chesapeake plants and two of the three units at Yorktown. And Brunswick is just making up that deficit. ","So we\u2019ve got a long way to go. Our plan shows another combined cycle later in this decade. We\u2019re continuing our development of north Anna unit three. We don\u2019t know what will happen with that. So I think you should expect to see this plan continuing through the balance of the decade, and our planning horizon hasn\u2019t gotten into 2021 yet.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley ","Understood. And just following up on thinking about low growth, you had mentioned Hampton Roads in your remarks, about slowdown in governmental customers. When you all think about further government slowdown in spending, not just in the military heavy Hampton Roads area, but also in the Virginia as well, do you have a sense for the outlook for power demand from the governmental side of things under a variety of scenarios? How much of a risk or an opportunity is that going forward over the next 12 months?","Tom Farrell ","Well, government load for us is larger than you\u2019ll find at many utilities. It\u2019s about 10%. But by contrast, we have a much lower industrial load than many utilities have. I think I said a few minutes ago that the slowdown in governmental load in the Hampton Roads area that we saw in the second quarter we think is an anomaly, and do not expect that to continue. There\u2019s a variety of reasons around that. ","The issue is more concentrated really in northern Virginia, the commercial sector, which is where what they used to call the Beltway Bandits are, the defense contractors and all the think tanks that are there serving the government. ","So we\u2019re going to watch that very closely and see how it progresses over the course of the year, but we do not expect to change the overall need to close the gaps we have in generation in Virginia. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s [not] an important part of our growth, but it doesn\u2019t overwhelm the rest of it. Keep in mind, our residential usage grew 2% year to date, which is pretty healthy. And that\u2019s 40% of our load. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. ","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Just on the sales growth, the numbers that you were giving, Mark, was that weather-adjusted? ","Mark McGettrick ","It was weather-normalized, on slide 4 of the deck.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates ","And then in terms of the data centers, that\u2019s in what, commercial? Or governmental?","Mark McGettrick ","It\u2019s shown in commercial, but we show it on this slide separate, because we thought it was important. Data centers, we\u2019re still seeing very, very strong growth, so we broke it out of commercial. Otherwise, commercial would show a growth of about 0.8 of a percent, almost 1%. And I think that masks what the real commercial growth is, so we broke it out separate and showed data centers separately. It\u2019s at 12%, and commercial growth slightly negative for the year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates ","And then with the Brayton and Kincaid, just what happened there? I thought you guys would have already [brought] this thing down and you\u2019ve got the sales set up, so I\u2019m just wondering what happened, and is that sort of finally over?","Mark McGettrick ","Nothing really happened. We were hoping that the sale would be complete in the second quarter, waiting for FERC approval. FERC has a defined timeframe in which they review these, and it actually doesn\u2019t expire until the middle of September. But we thought we might get it in the second quarter. So we\u2019re going to wait and go ahead and retire into fees that debt at the same time we got the proceeds in. But because it wasn\u2019t approved, we decided to go ahead and take care of that and just get it behind us. It was part of our plan initially, it was part of our financing plan initially, so we just went ahead and took care of that one open item in the quarter.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates ","And then finally, just on Millstone, just a quick question, the expiration of the Millstone tax, just what\u2019s the expected annual impact of that? And also, with the [unintelligible] reliability issue associated with natural gas that they\u2019re talking about in terms of some little changes potentially in terms of fuel supply for fossil power plants, just how do you see that impacting the market in New England? I know you guys are nuclear, but just in general, does that benefit you guys in the future? Or are we already seeing it pretty much right now in the market?","Tom Farrell ","Let me answer the first part of that question, and Dave Christian will answer the second part. The first part, in terms of the tax, the tax was a burden on us of about $40 million a year, in a normal operating year. It\u2019s based on run time of the units, so [playing out], it\u2019s just good to change that a little bit. But that tax will expire in the third quarter, and so that will go away. That\u2019s what we showed on one of our slides today, that in the fourth quarter we would have a pickup year over year of about $10 million.","David Christian","Yeah, and on the [unintelligible] New England reliability studies that are underway, we\u2019ve got market policy people that are participating in that process because we\u2019re a key stakeholder. But I think fundamentally, we\u2019re not seeing anything negative coming out of that, that we are absolutely participating in the stakeholder process.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates ","Would you stand to benefit, though? It would seem that the [calls would be pushed upon] merchant gas guys, and you guys are not really fossil.","David Christian","Yeah, we\u2019re essentially base load running all the time. I think it would be speculative to predict any particular upside to that.","Tom Farrell ","I\u2019ll just remind you, the only gas unit we have left in the northeast is Manchester. It\u2019s already dual fuel, so it has a lot of optionality that some of those other units don\u2019t have.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank ","I have one question on the TL-388 drop down, and just sort of parsing that back to the Blue Racer trajectory slide that you gave at the analyst day. Is this something that would have been part of the 14-15 outlook, and it\u2019s being pulled forward? Or is this an asset that wasn\u2019t really contemplated for the drop down before?","Tom Farrell ","It\u2019s an asset that was not contemplated. It is not a pull forward from the 2014 or 2015 plan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank ","So as we look at that, it should be incremental, then, to that slide?","Tom Farrell ","Correct.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank ","And then on the third quarter, you referenced this outage expense number that\u2019s going to weigh on the third quarter, and you listed quite a number of positives that it\u2019s just going to offset. Can you give us a little more color on what\u2019s going on there?","Mark McGettrick ","We have a planned nuclear outage scheduled in the third quarter of this year, which we did not have one in the third quarter of last year.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank ","So it\u2019s just the planned nuclear outage, it\u2019s not performance?","Mark McGettrick ","That\u2019s right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Smith with UBS.","Julian Smith - UBS","If you could clarify on the cost cuts, just what\u2019s the annualized impact as it stands today for \u201914? I know you\u2019ve talked about a number of different numbers, but just to make sure we\u2019re crystal clear about that.","Mark McGettrick ","Well, we told you it was in the range of $100 million annually, and that you should expect $30 million in the third quarter and I think we gave you actually cents per share in the fourth quarter, but if you do the math, it\u2019s about $40 million in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019ve seen about $20 million to $30 million thus far.","Julian Smith - UBS ","All right, so the full $100 million annualized by 2014. ","Mark McGettrick ","That\u2019s correct.","Julian Smith - UBS ","And then on the governmental sales, clearly it seems as if sequestration\u2019s impacting it. Was this sort of a one-time drop, and you\u2019re seeing it flatten out? Or is there a continued degradation, if you will, that you\u2019ve seen of late? Just trying to get a sense as to, looking towards \u201914 and onwards, if this has sort of happened, that we\u2019re re-baselining, or is there sort of a continual change going on here?","Paul Koonce","Tom mentioned anecdotal evidence on the governmental side in his remarks. What we\u2019re seeing there are two aircraft carriers that are not in port. They prefer we not talk about that, but that\u2019s why we see the drop in governmental sales. We expect that that will return.","Julian Smith - UBS ","All right, fair enough. There\u2019s nothing else really driving that? That\u2019s the primary factor?","Paul Koonce","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with Keybanc.","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc","You mentioned other companies doing some financial engineering. What are your latest thoughts on that front?","Tom Farrell ","Financial engineering? Is that a reference to MLPs, for example?","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc","MLPs, yield [codes]. There\u2019s all kinds of things going on.","Tom Farrell ","We\u2019re well aware of what other companies are doing. We\u2019ve looked at MLPs over the years, and concluded in the past that it was not an advantage to our shareholders to start an MLP or have an MLP. We are continuing to examine that issue, taking into account our present market conditions and what our present asset base is.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "," ","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just wanted to be clear on the asset drop downs into Blue Racer. TL-388 is new, but Natrium 2 and [Burn] are not incrementally new. Is that correct?","Tom Farrell ","Natrium 1 is an asset that was in the original plan to drop into Blue Racer. Natrium 2 and [Burn] are joint venture project that they\u2019re developing now. They\u2019re not drop downs.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then also, I think in your analyst day slide deck, you had indicated there was a generic combined cycle gas plant beyond Brunswick. Has there been any update or developments on that? When can we expect to see any developments on that front?","Tom Farrell ","That was shown again in the [RP] we filed, and it\u2019s still in the plans. I think if you look at our website, you\u2019ll see in our investor book where that shows up in the development process. Really more \u201818-19 kind of a timeframe that would become operational. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs ","Real quick, just want to kind of think through the merchant generation business, because now you\u2019re down to really just a handful of assets, obviously one big one. How do you think about that business relative to the broader portfolio, the broader mix of assets and business [unintelligible] and whether you think about that as being kind of core to the long term of Dominion, or not necessarily as big of a contributor and as core as some of your other businesses?","Tom Farrell ","It is not as big a contributor as it once was, obviously, but we consider these stations, Millstone, Manchester, [unintelligible] to be core to our continuing operations.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs ","But do you kind of think about this business as a business, okay, you\u2019ve now shrunk it and kind of pared it back, and now you would try and grow it from there? Or is it still in the harvest mode for one or two of the assets going forward? Or is it just pure stabilization from here?","Tom Farrell ","We\u2019re past harvesting. These are the assets that we want to maintain. And it will grow with the markets. ","Operator","This does conclude this morning\u2019s teleconference.

On the call today, we have Tom Farrell, CEO; Mark McGettrick, CFO; and other members of senior management. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Tom Hamlin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Analysis for our Safe Harbor statement.","Thomas Hamlin","Good morning, and welcome to Dominion's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings release and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor relations will be available after the call for any clarification on these schedules. If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit our website, register for e-mail alerts and view our third quarter 2012 earnings documents. Our website address is www.dom.com\/investors.","In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will guide this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.","Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our third quarter 2012 operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 and 2013, as well as operating earnings before interest and tax, commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report, are contained on Schedules 2 and 3 in Pages 32 to 39 in our earnings release kit.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the third quarter, as well as our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012. Tom will update our operating and regulatory activities, as well as review the progress we have made on our growth plan.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion's 2012 third quarter operating earnings were $0.92 per share, toward the bottom of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.01 per share when compared to normal. While temperatures, as measured by degree days, were above normal, other factors impacting weather-related demand, principally low humidity, offset the higher temperatures. Although the degree days were above normal in July, they were close to normal in August and below normal in September.","Additionally, the highest temperatures during the quarter occurred in the aftermath of the derecho storm in early July, where over 1.2 million of our customers lost power. Full restoration took nearly a week, which prevented us from benefiting from the extreme weather.","Through the first 9 months of 2012, mild weather conditions have reduced earnings by a total of $0.17 per share compared to normal. Lower interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate had a positive impact on the results for the quarter. Negative factors in the quarter relative to the midpoint of our guidance range where a storm-related outage at our Hastings processing plant and an unplanned outage at Millstone, due to water temperature limitations that required us to remove Unit 2 from service for almost 2 weeks.","Earnings for GAAP purposes were $0.36 per share for the third quarter. Earlier this week, we announced our decision to close the Kewaunee nuclear plant and the associated write-down of the investment in that plant. This was the principal factor for the lower GAAP earnings for the quarter.","Other differences between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were the results related to the Brayton Point, Kincaid and Elwood Power Stations that we are in the process of selling. Consistent with our treatment of previous transactions, results for these assets were excluded from operating earnings as of this quarter. A reconciliation of 2012 operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the third quarter was $242 million, which was just below the midpoint of its guidance range. Lower-than-expected results at Dominion Retail, due to mark-to-market changes, were partially offset by lower-than-expected storm costs and lower operating expenses.","Third quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $178 million, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. The derecho storm had a negative impact on operations at our Hastings processing plant. This unit was off-line due to a loss of off-site power for several days, which impacted processing volumes and income. The overall weakness in the storage and gas transportation markets also impacted results from both the Gas Transmission and Producer Services businesses.","Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $617 million for the third quarter, which was also below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power, lower ancillary service revenues and higher operating expenses were the principal factors driving the results for the regulated Generation business. In the merchant business, the Millstone outage I referred to earlier was the principal driver for lower merchant generation contributions.","On a consolidated basis, both interest expenses and income taxes came in better than our estimates. Consistent with past practices, interest expenses associated with the merchant plants are now being -- that are now being sold, have been excluded from operating earnings. State tax benefits, as well as the resolution of some IRS audit issues, helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 35% for the quarter compared to our guidance range of 36.5% to 37%. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be about 35% to 35.5%.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $2.8 billion for the first 9 months of 2012. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. During the quarter, we extended the term of these credit facilities by an additional year to September 2017. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.4 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments, resulted in available liquidity of $2.1 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to our financing plans. We issued slightly more than $1 billion of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes for the parent company in September. We were pleased with the market's response to our offering and thank those of you who participated.","We had planned to issue an additional $750 million of Virginia Power debt in the fourth quarter, but have decided to push that issue into 2013 based on current cash projections. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for a substantial portion of our anticipated 2013 debt needs and have begun to lock in rates for 2014 needs as well.","As part of our 2012 and 2013 financing plans, we will issue new shares of common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, as well as from our compensation and benefit plans, which is expected to raise about $320 million of new equity in each of those years.","The expected proceeds from the sale of the 3 merchant power stations should be sufficient to offset any need for market equity in 2013, as well as reduce some of our debt need.","Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the fourth quarter within a range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. This compares with original operating earnings of $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011, which included about $0.08 per share of weather hurdle.","Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, positive drivers for the quarter include a return to normal weather, earnings from our newly-completed growth projects at Dominion Energy, sales growth at Virginia Power and higher Rider-related revenues from our generation growth projects. Negative drivers for the quarter include lower merchant generation margins and a higher effective tax rate.","Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 has been $3.10 to $3.35 per share. With normal weather, our year-to-date operating earnings would have been $2.53 per share rather than the $2.36 per share we have reported. Adding the middle of our fourth quarter guidance range to our reported year-to-date operating earnings would result in a full year operating earnings that would be below the bottom of our guidance range. Therefore, absent a cold fourth quarter, it will be difficult for us to achieve full year results that are within that range. However, when adjusted for weather, we expect earnings in the middle of our guidance range, which is 5% to 6% above the $3.05 per share we earned in 2011.","Last month, we issued operating earnings guidance for 2013 of $3.20 to $3.50 per share. The middle of this range assumes normal weather and corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase over the middle of our guidance range for 2012. Therefore, the weather hurdle we have experienced in 2012 should have no impact on our growth targets for 2013 and beyond.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge positions on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. With the decision to sell the Brayton Point and Kincaid Power Stations and our 50% interest in the Elwood Power Station, we will no longer include these positions in our hedge disclosure. Since our last earnings call, we have made no changes to our hedge position for Millstone. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices for the remainder of 2012 is less than $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is now only about $0.025 per share.","As shown on Slide 9, we have locked in nearly all of our anticipated 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for the third quarter were toward the bottom of our guidance range. Lower interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate had a positive impact on results for the quarter. Negative factors in the quarter relative to midpoint of the guidance range were mild weather, higher operating expenses and unplanned outages at Hastings and Millstone.","Our operating earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $0.65 to $0.75 per share. We expect weather-normalized earnings for 2012 to be in the middle of our original guidance range and consistent with our 5% to 6% weather-normalized earnings growth target. And finally, we have issued operating earnings guidance for 2013 of $3.20 to $3.50 per share. The middle of this range assumes normal weather and corresponds to a 5% to 6% increase of the middle of our guidance range for 2012.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell","Good morning. Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the third quarter and in every case, with improving safety performance. Year-to-date, net capacity factor of the 7 Dominion nuclear units, excluding refueling outages, was 99%. Including the 3 refueling outages, the net capacity factor for the 9 -- first 9 months of 2012 was an impressive 95%.","Earlier this week, we announced our decision to close and decommission the Kewaunee nuclear power station. Last year, we announced our intention to sell the facility because it no longer fit strategically with our merchant portfolio. However, we were unable to find a buyer for Kewaunee and expect to cease power production in the second quarter of next year and move to safe shutdown. The decommissioning obligation is fully funded.","Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was declared commercial on July 10. The $1.8 billion project was completed safely, on-budget and on-schedule following 4 years of construction.","During the third quarter, significant progress was made toward biomass commissioning, which should be completed during the fourth quarter. Construction activities are progressing for the 1,329 megawatt Warren County 3-on-1 combined cycle plant. The EPC contractor has poured the foundations for the major equipment components. This fully-wrapped $1.1 billion project is scheduled for completion in late 2014 and is on-time and on-budget.","The company advanced plans for another 1,300-megawatt 3-on-1 combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The facility is expected to be in service in 2016 and should have costs similar to the Warren County plant. We have made progress with equipment procurement, gas supply agreements and permitting is underway.","On July 31, Dominion executed the EPC contract with Fluor and issued a limited notice to proceed. We expect to file a CPCN and Rider applications with the Virginia State Corporation Commission next month.","The projects to convert the AltaVista, Southhampton and Hopewell Power Stations from coal to biomass are progressing on schedule and on budget. Engineering is 95% complete, and the 3 projects are expected to reach commercial operations prior to the end of next year.","The company is proposing to modify the existing Bremo Power Station Units 3 and 4 by converting them to use natural gas instead of coal. A minor air permit modification has been submitted to the Department of Environmental Quality, and a fixed-price EPC contract for this work has been awarded. A CPCN application was filed with the State Corporation Commission in August. Pending the receipt of the required approvals, the station will commence operations on natural gas beginning in the summer of 2014.","Dominion Energy continues to make significant progress on its growth program. The Appalachian Gateway Project was placed into service on September 1, on time and below budget. Pipeline expansion will relieve congestion in the region allowing conventional natural gas production to move to market.","Both the next -- Northeast Expansion and the Ellisburg to Craigs Projects are expected to be in service next week, on-time and on budget.","Development of the Utica Shale formation is proceeding, as demonstrated by the leading indicators of announced well permits and drilling activity. Through early October, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources had issued 413 horizontal well permits to multiple producers with 176 wells drilled to-date. 35 of those wells are now producing. 24 rigs are currently on location in Ohio.","Dominion continues to leverage our Ohio and West Virginia infrastructure in support of this rapidly-growing energy supply. The construction of Natrium in Phase I is moving forward. The inlet, outlet and product lines are expected to be complete in November.","All major equipment, spheres and towers have been set, and piping and electrical work has been progressing well. Over 900 workers are on-site, working 2 shifts to meet the late December in-service date.","As noted in our last earnings call, recent legislation paved the way for Dominion East Ohio to construct new gathering facilities and to convert existing strategically-located pipelines to wet gathering service outside of utility rate regulation.","Building on that framework, we have entered into several gathering and processing agreements to date, and we continue to negotiate with many producers and midstream developers. And as disclosed last quarter, Dominion East Ohio is now negotiating with parties who express interest in over 1 billion cubic feet per day of residue gas transportation, moving processed gas from Ohio plant outlets to various downstream interstate pipelines.","We're pleased to announce that Dominion East Ohio recently entered into a long-term service agreement with M3 Ohio Gathering to provide significant firm gathering services for wet gas in Northeastern Ohio. Under this agreement, Dominion will receive 180 million cubic feet per day of gas from Utica in conventional wells committed to M3 Ohio, and we'll deliver those volumes to the Kensington processing plant, which is presently under construction. The services will be provided from existing pipeline assets, with limited capital upgrades to support the project. We will begin this gathering service for phases of Kensington that are slated to come online in early 2014.","We are continuing to develop a liquefaction project at Cove Point. The project, which is expected to cost between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion, exclusive of financing costs, has a planned capacity of approximately 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and 4.5 million to 5 million metric tons per annum on the outlet.","Dominion has continued to receive strong interest from the market and is in advanced negotiations with multiple parties for definitive terminal service agreements. We have made significant progress toward finalizing these agreements and remain confident that the full plant capacity will be contracted by the end of this year.","On October 1, a hearing was held in Maryland State Court in our request for declaratory judgment regarding the Sierra Club's challenge to the project. The other party to the agreement at issue is the Maryland Conservation Council, who filed a brief fully supporting Dominion's position. A decision is expected on this matter later this year.","The front-end engineering and design studies are on schedule and are progressing well. The FERC prefiling process is also progressing in accordance with plan. Two open-house meetings have been held with the public to discuss the scope of the project. FERC issued its notice of intent to prepare an environmental assessment that will address the potential environmental impact of the construction and operational facility supporting the project. We will provide a more detailed cost estimate early next year as those studies become more defined and we finalize our financing plans. Subject to successful completion of engineering studies, execution of terminal services agreements and after we receive the necessary approvals, we anticipate beginning construction in 2014, with an in-service date in 2017.","At Virginia Power, economic growth is continuing to drive improving results. Compared to 2011, weather-adjusted sales are up 1.5% year-to-date. Year-over-year growth in sales to data centers was 9% for both the third quarter and year-to-date. New connects for the third quarter were also well above last year's level. New connects in the first 9 months of 2012 actually are about 30% higher than the comparable period for 2011.","On the regulatory front, hearings were held in October on our application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a $53 million increase in base rates, less a $27 million reduction in fuel revenues. The net revenue increase of $26 million incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. We expect the decision by year end.","On September 15, a hearing was held in our Virginia Supreme Court appeal of the effective date for the return on equity established by Virginia State Corporation Commission to be used in next year's biannual review. The effective date will establish whether the average authorized return on equity is 10.9% or 11.36%.","So including the statutory return on equity collar, the appeal will determine if the return on equity to be used for the biannual review of 2011 and 2012 earnings is 11.4% or 11.86%. We expect the final decision next month.","Virginia Power's return on equity computed using GAAP earnings adjusted for rate-making was less than 9% for 2011. Incorporating results through the third quarter of 2012, Virginia Power's similarly-adjusted return on equity for the first 21 months of the 24 months to be covered in the 2011 and '12 biannual review is about 9.5%.","So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and together delivered results that met our expectations. We continue to move forward all of our growth plans and expect to deliver 5% to 6% weather-normalized earnings per share growth in 2013 and beyond.","Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tom, just -- I want to make sure I understand on the Cove Point lawsuit in Maryland. I think originally the expectation was there would be a decision toward the end of this month, and then you said by year end in your comments. Is there some slippage on that from a schedule or procedural process? Or do you think that the original expectation is still reasonable?","Thomas F. Farrell","Dan, I'm not sure where an expectation come, they would come by the end of this month. I don't think we ever said that. But the hearing was October 1, and all the parties agreed that the -- no evidence was needed and the judge could decide the case based on the briefs. There's no change in expected timing. It could come any day.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then on VEPCO with the earned ROE at 9.5% through the first 21 months. Can you just walk through some of the major adjustments, the derecho and those sorts of costs that you guys have in there that the commission might potentially try to address as far as maybe adjusting the ROE and where your position is on the validity of those expenses coming out of the ROE calculation?","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, there are a variety of them that occurred in 2011, 2012. I wouldn't call them adjustments. They are GAAP earnings, which is what the statute calls for the commission to review. There are, like I said, a number of them. First, one is the VSP that was -- we did the early retirement program that was in -- severance program, which was in 2010. The commission's last biannual review carried $100 million of that negative effect into this biannual review. We have derecho, we have write-off of the cash for allowances -- or care allowances, rather. And one of the important things to keep in mind is we are $0.17 down for weather in 2012, which is what it is. There's no weather adjustment for any rate-making in Virginia whether it's forward-looking rates or for biannual reviews. So there's a number of issues. We have the coal plants in Chesapeake and Yorktown and some others. So there's a list of them. We can be happy to take you through the details of each of them if you have any further questions.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just the last one, Tom, on when we were looking at the decision to sell the coal plants. I'm kind of surprised that there was no ultimate bid for Kewaunee and the idea of -- actually, selling a nuclear power station is interesting. But what is your level of confidence or what's the level of interest you've had on those plants so far and your timeline is going to help defray some of the equity needs for '13 and maybe in '14.","Thomas F. Farrell","We have very high interest actually in those plants. We've had many, many parties express interest. I don't think you can compare -- you obviously can do whatever you want. I don't think you should compare Kewaunee to Kincaid, Elwood or Brayton Point Power Station. Kewaunee is a very unfortunate situation. It's a superbly operating plant. There are great people there, but it is a relatively small nuclear facility. In MISO, there's no capacity payments there. Gas prices have reduced the energy prices there, which I think is very difficult for a single-unit nuclear facility to, at least for us, to work in that market. We couldn't make it work and apparently nobody else could either since we found no buyers. But I don't think that's a comparable situation to a Brayton Point, Kincaid.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The first question is just a clarification, which is based on the fourth quarter guidance of $0.65 to $0.75 effectively, then your annual guidance would really be now $3 to $3.35. Is that fair?","Mark F. McGettrick","Paul, this is Mark. We did not change the $3.10 to $3.35. But what we wanted to give everybody color on today is that with the range we gave for the fourth quarter, we're going to need $0.04 or $0.05 of weather, cold up to normal weather, to get into the original guidance range of $3.10 to $3.35. So we've kind of bounded it for everybody. But the most important thing we think to focus on there is that with the ranges out there, when you normalize for weather, we are right in the middle of our weather-normalized 5% to 6% growth off last year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Second question would be, when you talk about sort of the interest expense on power plants being excluded, would the bulk of the interest savings at corporate and other also be financing costs associated with those plants? Or is it just a generation that we should be looking at in terms of the interest savings?","Mark F. McGettrick","Yes, the interest savings this month that was taken out of operating earnings was about $17 million, and that's what you should expect in the fourth quarter as well from the sale of the merchant plants.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Because the total interest savings was closer to $50 million, so can you at all walk us through what the driver was for the...","Mark F. McGettrick","Are you talking quarter-over-quarter? Year-over-year? What are we talking about?","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Third quarter 2012 versus third quarter 2011. It looked like the consolidated interest savings was close to $50 million.","Mark F. McGettrick","Yes, I think we'll need to walk you through that, Paul, on that number. There's only one other item that impacted interest year-over-year of significance, other than our focus. Now we have refinanced a lot of debt. Year-over-year, debt has improved '12 over '11, which has lowered our interest expense. We have the non-offs of the merchant plants, which I referenced was to $17 million. And we did have one interest rate swap we settled in the third quarter of this year, which was about $10 million. So the way I would describe it is you take the $10 million plus the $17 million, which we've referenced and the rest of it has to do with efficiencies around refinancing of the portfolio.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last question would be, there's a significant increase I think at VEPCO in terms of operating and maintenance expense there. What would have been the driver there?","Mark F. McGettrick","Again, what period are you talking about?","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Again, the third quarter '12 over third quarter '11. It looks like interest -- O&M expense is up like $20 million?","Mark F. McGettrick","I'll ask Paul Koonce to go ahead and take that.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, you're right. That is net in the kit. That's electric transmission-related O&M, so it's Rider-related O&M, so it's offset in the revenue. So it really has no earnings impact.","Operator","Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So the -- just to be clear -- just to clear up the -- from the last question, if the -- you earned $2.36 for the 9 months ending and the guidance is $0.65 to $0.75, then before the weather add-back, you'd be between $3.01 and $3.11, is that fair?","Thomas F. Farrell","Yes.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Other than the biannual review, is it right that you're also going to probably have a base rate case next year? And can you talk about what will be adjudicated in that versus what won't be adjudicated in that given the way the legislation works? I mean, is ROE going to be addressed or is ROE already sort of set through the biannual rate review and it's really just a review of operating cost and capital. I'm just a little unclear on how this all works together.","Thomas F. Farrell","Sure, Greg. The way the statute works, if you -- the collar -- you have to over-earn above the collar in 2 consecutive rate reviews in order for there to be a consideration of a reduction in your rates. And so it has to be above the 50 basis points twice, the collar, twice, consecutively. In order to ask for a base rate increase, you only have to be below the 50-basis-point collar once. We believe we will be significantly below the 50-basis-point collar at the end of the biannual review, which means that we -- triggers the possibility of a rate increase, so that we anticipate -- and the way the commission ruled last year was that we should -- if there's going to be a base rate case, it should be filed at the same time as the biannual review. So the ROE issue will be basically the same in both of them, but we will be filing for all of our increased costs that we've been associated with, the run rate we've had at the company. There'll be more traditional rate cases. Of course, you don't have any of the Riders in there. The earnings from the transmission, electric transmission or from the generation Riders are not included in the rate review and would not be included in a base rate review.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And a reset of the return on equity would also not be in -- a part of that case or would it?","Thomas F. Farrell","The review of the ROE is in both a biannual review and in a rate case.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","With the $17 million of debt associated with the plants, I was a little confused by that. How does that actually work? I mean, is that going with the plants? Is that going to be...","Mark F. McGettrick","Paul, what we've done consistent with any of the divestitures that we've had is we take out the EBIT contribution from operating, nonoperating, and we take out the interest expense for financing, whatever the asset might be. We did it with the Peoples transaction. We did it with Hope. We did it with Kewaunee. We've done it with all of them. But the asset base here is fairly big, so it's kind of stuck out where it's a larger number. But we've always taken out both sides, and we'll continue to do that until the plant is sold.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. The write-offs, if you look year-over-year, we just see a lot of write-offs. I'm just sort of wondering, should we basically -- how should we think about these nonrecurring expenses going forward? Are we pretty much -- do you think we're pretty much through with the merchant write-off experience? Or I guess, also, I guess anything at the utility or what have you, I mean how should we think about sort of recurring, nonrecurring expenses, if you follow me?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, I think it is fair to say over the last 2, 3 years we've had quite a few nonoperating expenses as we've reshaped the portfolio, some positive, some negative. Peoples was a positive expense in the sale that we've had there. But I think we're nearing the end of that, if not at the end. So we think '13 after the resolution of the merchant assets that are currently out for sale, I think you should see pretty clean operating versus nonoperating expenses going forward.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the EDGE, that program that you guys have, which you didn't highlight in this presentation but you have in previous ones. So if you just sort of elaborate to us how about you think that might impact Dominion, specifically, but just also any industry impact this algorithm that you guys have come up with?","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, first off, with respect to Dominion, we're not forecasting. It is part of our earnings other than -- what we hope to get out of it next year is in the 5% to 6% per share earnings growth projection or forecast. It depends -- the product works, that's for sure. How many people we're able to show that to and sell it to and its potential impacts, we're going to -- it's not just going to be in the United States. It's also -- I think it works everywhere, particularly useful I think in Europe to meet their energy efficiency mandatory targets. But we'll see. I can't forecast for you yet what it will do to Dominion's earnings growth, positive way or what it would do to the industry at large. But there's no question I don't think -- the algorithm works. It allows you to certainly reduce your fuel expense across your system.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And -- okay. But we can't get really a sense of -- do you have any idea when we might get a better idea as to what the impact might be or is it just sort of too much whatchamacallit?","Thomas F. Farrell","I think we'll probably not be able to give you any real good view of that until 2014.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. Just first on the utility sales. The -- Tom, you mentioned the strong data centers and new connects. Overall sales look down some, I assume some of that's weather. But industrial is also down. Could you just give more color on the sales growth this year and thoughts on  outlook for that?","Thomas F. Farrell","We'll ask Paul Koonce to do that for you, Steve.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, if you look at what's in the kit. Certainly, that's actual sales which take into account sort of the weather impact that we experienced in the third quarter and really the absence of derecho weather, mostly. But as Mark mentioned in the call, September was certainly below. We are seeing strong growth. Tom mentioned 1.5% year-to-date weather-normalized sales. We've mentioned in previous quarters that there's been some ramp-rate demand around data centers. We saw that pick up. So I think from quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see a little lumpiness there. But from a revenue standpoint, those customers have contract minimum demand, so we're protected. But I see -- I think you see that kind of coming through a little bit this quarter. Industrial sales are down about 100,000 megawatt hours. Of course, that's against the total system of about 23 million for the quarter. We're not a very intense industrial marketplace with sort of a Northern Virginia, Central and Eastern Virginia. And it is just kind of a lot of small numbers added up. I would say if you looked at our top 5 industrial customers, their consumption is up, so that's good. So what you see in the kit is really the actual sales based on the weather. But when we kind of peel it back, we have seen very strong megawatt hour sales to data centers and generally, kind of accumulation of new connects over the last 12 months.","Mark F. McGettrick","Steve, this is Mark. The only thing I'd add to Paul's comments was, to your -- and you referenced to weather. Quarter-over-quarter, weather was about $0.06 better last year than this year. And so there wasn't a weather extreme in the actual numbers as well.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. One other separate question on the Cove Point and LNG export. The -- I assume you need to get the court ruling to finalize these terminal agreements?","Thomas F. Farrell","No.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess also, do you need kind of the DOE report and final outlook on how much LNG export is allowed to be able to finalize the agreements?","Thomas F. Farrell","No, Steve, because they'll all be contingent on us getting the permit and having the right to -- they'll all be contingent on us getting the DOE export permit, getting the FERC environmental permit and winning the Cove Point lawsuit. So the fact that there are -- those -- these 3 things are out there doesn't mean we won't sign these contracts by the end of the year. We believe we will sign the contracts by the end of the year, but they will have in them like all of our -- anything that needs a permit in the future will have a provision that says, if we don't get the permit, then the shippers don't have to obviously pay us anything. So I don't think that's anything out of the ordinary.","Operator","Our next question will come from Julien Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So quick question, going back on the fourth quarter comments here. Obviously, we're a little bit into the fourth quarter here. What is the weather year-on-year versus normal, if you will?","Mark F. McGettrick","I think we're best -- better talk about that in January, Julien, because the weather quarters here are really November -- the weather months, I should say, are November and December. October's not an influence during the fourth quarter much at all.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then secondly, a little bit on weather again. The derecho impact, can you quantify that within the weather number that you included there at all, specific to the derecho?","Mark F. McGettrick","Are we talking about in terms of Hastings? Are we talking about in terms of Virginia Power or...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Actually, maybe perhaps both.","Mark F. McGettrick","Okay. Hastings cost us about $0.01.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then the derecho when it comes to DBPs?","Mark F. McGettrick","DBP, it's a couple cents it cost us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right, great. And then maybe just kind of following up on the last question on Cove Point. As far as providing incremental data points, as far as financing plans, et cetera, would you need to get resolution in terms of DOE export authority prior to giving us clarity there? Or would you be kind of willing to provide us that clarity early '13 regardless of what happens with DOE here?","Thomas F. Farrell","I think we'll be able to give you our plans because they'll be based upon the TSA agreements and the feed studies, the actual final estimates on the capital costs. The DOE permit will come when it comes. The economic impact analysis was originally going to be issued in the summertime and then somehow or other, it seems to have gotten caught up in this ongoing election thing.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Actually, as far as it goes to the DOE, I'd be curious. I mean, do you expect there to be a limitation on the total quantity of exportable LNG? I mean, what kind of conditions here are we talking about, if any?","Thomas F. Farrell","We don't know that. The -- there's -- let me just -- let me go back some. I haven't been here that long, but I've been here long enough to have seen charts where we were going -- people were going to build 300 to 400 gas-fired power plants all over the United States. This was the hot thing. Everybody's going to do that. And then we saw, I don't know how many LNG imports facilities were going to be built. 30 of them or something like 43 of them were going to get built. And I think about 3 of them got built. We have lots and lots and lots of announcements around LNG exporting. In our situation, we have -- we already have an import facility. We have the terminal, we have the pipes, we have the storage. We have a pipe that goes directly into the Marcellus and Utica Shale that's dedicated to Cove Point. All we need to do is build the liquefier. So the environmental impacts are, we believe, very modest. We think that's what the FERC review will demonstrate. There's not going to be another one built on the East Coast of the United States, I do not believe. So we were early in the queue. We're not first in the queue, we're not second in the queue, but we're in the top 25%, first 25% in the queue. We're going about this just in a very workmanlike manner. We're not paying much attention to all the other announcements. We're dealing with our customers and our feed studies, our financing plans, and we have to deal with the Sierra Club on this one particular issue and forging ahead with the FERC process. So we're going to keep at it every day, step-by-step. And we believe we will get all the necessary approvals, but that all still remains to be seen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wondered if you could talk a little bit about Dominion Retail and just general trends you're seeing in terms of levels of competition, margins, et cetera. Any trends that you're seeing in that business?","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, Paul Koonce will take that.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, as you know, the trend is competition, no question, and margin pressure. But if you looked at Dominion Retail from the first quarter kit to the second quarter kit to what was put out this morning, what you will see is that we've been able to hold steady at about 700,000 electric customers, about 550,000 gas customers, and our products and services business continues to expand. So what we've seen is competition. We've been able to hold our customer count steady in the face of that competition. And with the cost of supplies, we've actually been able to improve our margins a little bit. But it's a daily challenge and one that we're well aware of. What will happen if we get on a price uptrend? What we see is customers tend to shop less because they know they're going to be getting a higher price. So in some respects, we view that as a good thing. But during this downturn, it's been tough.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up question on the question on interest expense relating to the assets for sale. Just to be clear, there would be some debt that would go with the assets potentially?","Mark F. McGettrick","That's yet to be determined. We're evaluating that. It could be part of a package or it might not be. It depends what -- who the buyer will be and what the best result will be for our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question will come from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Just wanted to go back to the question about retail. I mean, if it's true that there's no further deterioration in the customer count as far as electric customers are concerned, but it is a pretty significant pullback year-over-year? And then secondly, I'm just trying to figure out your sale -- or pending sale of merchant power plants, how is it going to tie into your growth and margins in the retail business?","Thomas F. Farrell","Why don't we have Paul answer the first one, Angie.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, I'll answer the first one, then I'll turn it back to Mark to talk about the power plants. The year-over-year difference has persisted throughout the year, and that is principally related to a decision we made last December to turn back a fairly large block of customers where we did not believe we could beat the price to compare and maintain our margin. And we did not think it was worth maintaining the volume and commodity risk without commensurate margin. So that was a decision that we made last December, and it's persisted throughout. And frankly, we've got one more quarter where you'll see that. So I think, to me, the relevant number is how have we done since that decision has been made. And if you look back, as I mentioned earlier, at the first quarter kit and second quarter kit, you'll see that we've been holding really steady.","With respect to the merchant power plant sales, I'll turn that back over to Mark.","Mark F. McGettrick","Angie, on merchant sales here, we have never tied our Retail business to our power generation business. They do not contract back from those units the resale into the wholesale market or we're contracted with other counterparties. So retail back-to-back out of the wholesale market, so there's no tie to all of that.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And my second question is about Cove Point and the fact that you haven't really told us anything about financing. I mean when I look at your midstream business, you're obviously completing your existing projects, but we haven't really heard about any new projects. It seems like Natrium 2 has been pushed out, and you haven't really made any announcements about new projects. Is it somewhat related to the Cove Point expansion in a way that you are holding onto cash and your debt financing capabilities because you might be needed to finance Cove Point? Or is this simply the general lack of projects in the midstream business that you would consider attractive?","Thomas F. Farrell","Angie, we have had some announcements around additional midstream thing, which -- some of which -- a couple of which we announced today. But they are modest compared to the string of them that you heard from us in 2011. A lot of that does have to do with the fact that we are at this point concentrating on completing the Cove Point terminal services agreements, which we expect to have by the end of the year and concentrating again on the engineering work that's being done around getting those feed studies completed so that we can finalize the rest of those plans. So I'd say it's a combination of both, but largely more -- I would weight it more toward our concentration on Cove Point at this point. If you remember last fall, fall of '11, when we laid out our growth plan, we had -- we said there was about $1 billion in potential projects that we didn't have in our growth plan and were not part of our 5% to 6% earnings growth, but they were out there. We were working on them. I said early in September this year that we were replacing that $1 billion with the additional $2.5 million to $3.5 million from Cove Point. And Cove Point, similarly, is not in our 5% to 6% earnings growth plan that we've developed for you in talking about in '13, '14, '15, et cetera, because Cove Point won't come online until 2017. But we've also said before, we are looking at a variety of ways to finance Cove Point to make sure that it doesn't curtail our growth plans while it is in the middle of its construction.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I know, but my worry is simply that you're waiting for a decision to go ahead with Cove Point and that could potentially impede your near-term growth prospects because you're holding onto cash without deploying it, right?","Thomas F. Farrell","I wouldn't -- I can understand your concern, Angie, but I don't think you should have it. We are going along -- ahead with many other projects. We have a lot of negotiations going on in the midstream. We don't have anything to announce today other than the ones we've already announced. The fact that we're working on Cove Point doesn't mean we're not working on other midstream activities. We are, and we'll continue to announce things as they become available to us.","Operator","Our last question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Guys, this may be a Paul Koonce question, just real quick and there are actually 2 of them here, so I have a follow-up. On Dominion Retail, when you break out your customer accounts, Paul, you've touched at length about the electric side, and the gas decline year-over-year wasn't that big. But what's up is actually customers you put in that products and services category. Can you just really define what that is? I mean, are these folks who are buying both gas and electricity or are they buying something else?","Paul D. Koonce","Michael, yes, great question. These are customers who are buying what we call products and services that are really function like in-home warranties. We've got a waterline protection plan. So if a waterline breaks, the pay so much a month; if the waterline breaks, we'll repair it. In the in-home wiring, we have some surge protection-type products. So what we typically do is lead with a commodity product and then we try to cross-sell as best we can these other products into the home. But we don't -- in terms of the products and services business, we have a network of contractors that we rely on to perform that work. We're not doing that work, but as part of a contractor network. So it's just a way to cross-sell an existing customer with an additional product and improve our revenue streams.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Any other -- a kind of follow-on to that. If I look at electricity volumes in the quarter at Dominion Retail, first is customer account. Customer account's down. Volumes are up about 10%. What's -- and this is coming off a prior year third quarter where weather was hot in a large part of the country. What's going on?","Paul D. Koonce","Yes, Michael, good observation there. We did have 4.4 million megawatt hour sales in the third quarter of '12 versus 4 million in the third quarter of '11, and that really relates to aggregation. We have done about 4 aggregation transactions. And in that case, you don't get the customer accounts, but you get the volumes. And so as aggregation becomes more and more of it, it's going to be more difficult to kind of make that connection.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And last item, just where do you -- within your regulated sort of Virginia Power, within your regulated customer account, are you putting the data centers in industrial? Just kind of looking at that decline from 530 to 510 industrial customers year-over-year.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes. Again, we put them in the commercial account. They use a lot of megawatt hour sales, but they're commercial customers in our accounts here.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our call.

On the call today, we have Tom Farrell, CEO; Mark McGettrick, CFO; and other members of senior management. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Corynne Arnett, Director of Investor Relations for Safe Harbor statement.","Corynne Arnett","Good morning, and welcome to Dominion Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings release and pages from our earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit our website, register for e-mail alerts and view our second quarter 2012 earnings documents. Our website address is dom.com\/investors. In addition to the earnings release kit, we have included a slide presentation on our website that will guide this morning's discussion.","And now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our recently -- and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.","Also on this call, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include our second quarter 2012 operating earnings and our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year 2012, as well as operating earnings before interest and tax, commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliations of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained on Schedules 2 and 3 in Pages 34 to 41 in our earnings release kit.","Joining us on the call this morning are our CEO, Tom Farrell; our CFO, Mark McGettrick; and other members of our management team. Mark will discuss our earnings results for the second quarter, as well as our guidance for the third quarter of 2012. Tom will update our operating and regulatory activities, as well as review the progress we have made on our growth plan.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick","Good morning. Dominion's 2012 second quarter operating earnings were $0.59 per share, just below the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Mild weather in our Virginia service territory during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.05 per share when compared to normal. Recall that in the first quarter, mild weather reduced operating earnings by $0.11 per share; so for the first 6 months of 2012, mild weather has reduced our earnings by a total of $92 million or $0.16 per share compared to normal.","There are 2 other items I would like to highlight in our second quarter operating earnings. First, our unregulated retail business had a very strong quarter, with results about $0.05 better than expectations. This was driven by $0.02 of better margins and a $0.03 gain on some mark-to-market contracts that will roll off largely over the next 12 months. Secondly, we've excluded $74 million from pretax operating earnings from major storm costs related to the late June storm activity that resulted in over 1 million of our customers being without power. While restoration activity continued into July, we recognized the entire estimated cost to restore service in the second quarter, consistent with our accounting for past major storm events. Tom will provide more operating details on the storm later in the call.","GAAP earnings were $0.45 per share in the second quarter. The principal differences between GAAP earnings and operating earnings for the quarter were the costs related to the late June storm activity and charges related to some of our merchant generation plants, which have been or are in the process of being sold. A reconciliation of 2012 operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to results by operating segment. At Dominion Virginia Power, EBIT for the second quarter was $282 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by stronger-than-expected results at Dominion Retail. Second quarter EBIT for Dominion Energy was $186 million, which was at the midpoint of its guidance range. Results from Producer Services were below expectations given the overall weakness in the natural gas markets but were offset by lower O&M expenses. Dominion Generation produced EBIT of $312 million for the second quarter, which was below the bottom of its guidance range. Mild weather at Virginia Power and lower ancillary service revenues were the principal factors driving these results. Partially offsetting these factors were reduced O&M expenses.","Year to date, across our businesses, we reduced operating and maintenance expenses by the equivalent of $0.08 per share, more than offsetting the headwinds from lower commodity prices. On a consolidated basis, interest expenses came in as expected. Money income taxes were below our estimates. State tax benefits, as well as the resolution of some IRS audit issues helped reduce our overall effective income tax rate to 35.5% for the quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be 35.5% to 36.5%.","Moving to cash flow and treasury activities. Funds from operations were $1.74 billion for the first half of 2012. Regarding liquidity, we had $3.5 billion of credit facilities. Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter were $1.6 billion and when netted against short-term cash investments, resulted in available liquidity of $2.1 billion. For statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see Pages 14 and 27 of the earnings release kit.","Now moving to our financing plans. We plan to issue between $1.6 billion and $2 billion of debt this year, with a fairly even split between Dominion and VEPCO. This amount includes the replacement of about $1.5 billion of maturing debt. We have already locked in treasury rates with hedges for all of our anticipated 2012 debt offerings and have now hedged most of our anticipated 2013 need as well. As part of our 2012 financing plan, we will issue new shares of common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, as well as from our compensation and benefit plans, which is expected to raise about $320 million of new equity.","Now to earnings guidance. We estimate operating earnings for the third quarter within a range of $0.90 to $1 per share. This compares with original operating earnings of $0.95 per share for the third quarter of 2011, which included about $0.06 per share of weather help. Compared to the third quarter of last year, positive drivers for the third quarter include sales growth at Virginia Power, higher Rider-related revenues from our growth projects and lower O&M expenses. Negative drivers for the quarter include a return to normal weather and a lower merchant generation margin.","Our operating earnings guidance for the full year 2012 remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. Assuming normal weather for the full year, we would expect earnings to fall within a range of $3.20 to $3.25 per share or about 5% to 6% above original operating earnings for 2011. I mentioned earlier that mild weather in the first half of the year has reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share. However, weather in the month of July was a little better than normal, and a hot August and September can reduce some of the full year weather impact as well. We will discuss our range in more detail on our third quarter call after we see the summer results.","As a reminder, our growth plan is predicated on normal weather, and you can expect our guidance for future years to be based on 5% to 6% above weather normalized earnings. As to hedging, you can find the update of our hedge position on Page 29 of the earnings release kit. Since our last earnings call, we've added to our hedges at Brayton Point for 2013. Our sensitivity to a $5 move in New England power prices in 2012 remains $0.01 per share. Our sensitivity to a similar move in 2013 is still only $0.05 per share.","As shown on the Slide 9, we have locked in nearly all of our anticipated 2013 output at prices significantly above current market rates. Locking in these positions reduces the risk associated with achieving our earnings growth targets.","So let me summarize my financial review. Operating earnings for the second quarter were near the midpoint of our guidance range. Mild weather reduced our earnings for the quarter by $0.05 per share compared to normal. We've excluded $0.08 per share from operating earnings due to the significant June storm activity. We are able to offset the incremental earnings headwinds created by the declines in commodity prices through reductions in operating and maintenance expenses. Our operating earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2012 is $0.90 to $1 per share. Our annual operating guidance remains $3.10 to $3.35 per share. The midpoint of this range is consistent with our 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings growth target. And finally, we've locked in nearly all of our anticipated merchant margins for 2013. We are confident that through control of operating expenses and taking advantage of the low interest rate environment, we remain well positioned to overcome the current commodity price environment and meet our weather normalized growth targets.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell","Good morning. What has been a particularly mild weather year in Virginia changed quickly in late June when a series of powerful storms with winds in excess of 80 miles per hour moved through the state and Northeastern North Carolina. More than 1 million of our customers lost power, making it the third largest storm event in the company's history behind only Hurricanes Isabel and Irene. Our employees with help from utilities as far away as Florida and Quebec conducted a multi-day restoration effort in 100-plus degree weather. On behalf of our customers and our shareholders, I offer them thanks, and I also thank our customers for their patience and understanding.","Each of our business units delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter and in every case, with improving safety performance. Year-to-date net capacity factor of the 7 Dominion nuclear units, excluding refueling outages, was 100%. Including the 3 refueling outages, the net capacity factor for the first half of the year was an impressive 93%.","State Line Power Station was shutdown in late March. On June 26, we sold the plant to BTU Solutions, a company that provides demolition services for generation facilities. On June 29, we executed an agreement to sell the Salem Harbor Power Station to Footprint Power who will operate the station until it is removed from service in June of 2014. Footprint is planning to re-purpose the site including the potential development of a natural-gas-fired power station.","Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center was declared commercial on July 10. The $1.8 billion project was completed safely, on budget and on schedule, following 4 years of construction. Virginia City is one of the cleanest, if not, the cleanest coal-fired power stations in the country, and it may well be one of the last to be built in the United States given recent EPA regulations. The groundbreaking for the 1,329-megawatt Warren County 3-on-1 combined cycle plant occurred on May 31. Procurement of equipment and materials is about 50% complete, and foundation work is well underway. This fully wrapped $1.1 billion project is scheduled for completion in late 2014.","The company advanced plans for another 1,300 megawatt 3-on-1 combined cycle plant to be located in Brunswick County, Virginia. The facility is expected to be in service in 2016 and should have costs similar to the Warren County plant. Both will offer significant value to customers. Like Warren County, we have chosen the gas and steam turbines from Mitsubishi Power Systems of America for the Brunswick facility. We have signed a natural gas firm transportation precedent agreement with Transco and have signed a fully wrapped engineering procurement and construction contract with Fluor. We expect to file the CPCN and Rider applications with the State Corporation Commission in the fourth quarter of this year.","On May 22, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality approved the air permits for the company's conversion of the Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell power stations from coal to biomass, allowing commencement of construction activities. Completion is expected in the second quarter of next year for Altavista and the third quarter for the other 2 plants.","Dominion Energy continues to make significant progress on its growth program. Construction of our Appalachian Gateway Project is nearly complete, and the project should be in service on schedule by next month. The Northeast Expansion project, as well as the Ellisburg to Craigs Project are expected to be in service this November. Construction is well underway on Phase I of the nature and processing plant and associated pipelines. We continue to work toward a December in-service date. Producer activity remains robust in Ohio. 112 wells are drilled or are being drilled, and 295 permits have been issued. This represents a 15% increase in both metrics since just last quarter.","On June 11, Ohio Governor, John Kasich, signed House Bill 487, which provides regulatory certainty for existing dry gas gathering pipelines that are converted to wet gathering service. The bill allows Dominion East Ohio to exempt those converted facilities from future PUC rate regulation. In conjunction with previous Ohio legislation to exempt new gathering investments from utility regulation, these provisions ensure that the company has an opportunity to earn predictable, sustainable returns on existing and new investments used to provide wet gathering service without incurring regulatory approval delays. We are currently working with multiple producers to reach agreements to gather their gas. In addition to gathering, we recently conducted a nonbinding open season to transport gas from the outlet of Ohio processing plants to interconnect with downstream interstate pipelines. Multiple shippers displayed interest totaling over 1.1 Bcf per day. Investments to build the facilities needed to support this activity will be better known once binding shipper commitments are reached.","On our last earnings call, we announced that we were moving forward with our Cove Point Liquefaction Project. In June, we requested and received approval to use the FERC prefiling process for environmental review. We expect the FERC certificate to be granted within 18 to 24 months. We also filed in Maryland State Court for a declaratory judgment regarding the Sierra Club's challenge to the project. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for October, and we expect a decision later this year. The other party to the agreement at issue is the Maryland Conservation Council, who, last month, filed a brief fully supporting Dominion's position. We're confident in our ability to construct and operate a liquefaction plant at Cove Point. We continue to make progress on our negotiations to reach terminal service agreements. Those agreements are expected to be finalized later this year.","Front-end engineering and design studies are progressing as well. We will provide a cost estimate for the project later this year as those studies become more defined. Subject to successful completion of the studies, execution of terminal services agreement and after we receive the necessary approvals, we anticipate beginning construction in 2014 with an in-service date in 2017.","As part of its ongoing business, Dominion Transmission recently extended a contract for 49 Bcf of general storage service for a 10-year period at maximum tariff rates. This is an example of a continued strong demand for our gas storage services.","Economic growth is expected to drive improving results for Virginia Power. Weather adjusted sales increased 1.1% for the first quarter and 1% for the second quarter. New connects for the second quarter were well above last year's level, and data center growth continues. In fact, new connects in the first half of 2012 are about 20% higher than the first 2 quarters of 2011. While we see continued positive growth signals in our Virginia service territory, we now expect that weather normalized sales growth for 2012 will be between 1% and 2% rather than our original estimate of 2% to 2.5%.","On the regulatory front, at the end of the first quarter, we submitted an application for an increase in base rates for our North Carolina service area. The request is for a revenue increase of $37 million, net of expected fuel rate reductions and incorporates an 11.25% return on equity. The hearing will be held in October, and we expect the decision by year end.","Last month, briefs were filed in our Virginia Supreme Court appeal of the effective date for the return on equity established by the Virginia State Corporation Commission to be used in next year's biennial review. The effective date issued will establish whether the average authorized return on equity is 10.9% or 11.36%. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for September, and we should get a final decision in November. The appeal will determine if the top end of the return on equity collar will be used for the biennial review of 2011 and 2012 earnings is 11.4% or 11.86%. On our last call, we indicated that Virginia Power's return on equity, computed using GAAP earnings adjusted for rate making, was less than 9% for 2011. Incorporating results for the entire first half of 2012, VEPCO's similarly adjusted return on equity for the first 18 months of the 24 months to be covered in the 2011 and '12 biennial review is still less than 9%.","So to conclude, all 3 of our business units performed well and together delivered results but given the mild weather, met our expectations. We continue to move forward with our growth plan and expect to deliver 5% to 6% weather normalized earnings per share growth beginning this year.","Thank you, and we are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess just on the earned ROEs at VEPCO, I mean, last time through the commission, seemed to make some discretionary decisions away from the GAAP accounting to get to a different ROE. Is there anything, when you look at the 18 months so far, where you think there would be some level of discretion for them to change that? Or is it -- I mean, it seems like the below the range ROE seems pretty set at this point.","Thomas F. Farrell","The -- first off, the weather has been below normal. That's not a discretionary issue. Those earnings are what they are. What Virginia Power earns is what it is. I think what you're referring to probably from the last review was the early retirement program where they carried it over and part of it, over into the second biennial review. That was not completely out of line with prior precedent. They've matched it to the retirement, actual retirements, but the effect of that, of course, was to bring over $100 million of that VSP into the second biennial review. And that's -- there won't be any discretionary issues around that. That cost is there according to the commission's own rulings. So I think when you take a look at what we've been dealing with, I think all of these costs are appropriately included in the biennial review period. They're expensed, as they have been according to all commission -- prior to  commission precedent, and I expect we'll see -- of course, we don't know what we'll earn. We'll see how it'll go over the next 2 quarters, but that's where we stand today.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just on guidance for the year, the other $0.16 of below normal weather, well, I guess, will put you below the range, so it's going to take a little better weather than normal to get above the bottom of the range. Is that the right way to interpret what you said, Mark?","Mark F. McGettrick","Dan, this is Mark. If you look at history here in Virginia, we picked up $0.06 to weather last year. We picked up $0.08 to weather the year before. This is all in the third quarter. So if you do the math of it, we need a little bit of weather help between July 1 and the end of the year, but again, if you look at the history here, I think we're well within the bounds of the $3.10 to $3.30, assuming we get a little bit of weather help the rest of the year.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then for the fourth quarter, so you think it's going to be made up perspectively in the third quarter or fourth quarter, so there's just a bit of watch factor. When I think about the growth rate, the 5% to 6% since your weather was closer to normal on '11, we should be able to grow the '11 number by 5% to 6% for '12 and then 5% to 6% for '13, to figure where we should expect '13 to be?","Mark F. McGettrick","That is exactly right, and it's a question we've had from a lot of folks. And we built this plan on normal weather, and so weather -- if normal -- if weather's extreme or right, you should always go back to the midpoint of our range, which is based on 5% to 6% weather normalized growth, and that's what you should expect us to have in 2013 as we start talking about guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","As we think about the 2014 earnings outlook, the -- I saw on the merchant power side, the hedge level remained the same as the prior quarter, and so as we think about the headwind from the roll-off of hedges there, can you help us think about the offsets to achieve the earnings growth and how you feel about those offsets rolling out from here?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, Stephen, this is Mark. First, if you look at our hedge slide, I think it's on Page 9 in the deck, if you go back just one quarter and reference what '14 look like, I believe the hedge market position at that point was about $40 and some change. We show $42 here just in 3 months. If you look at the market forward price for '14 as of yesterday, it was almost $43. So this price has moved up in just 3 to 4 months by 6% or 7%, and we're well over 1.5 years away from a '14 midpoint number. So first of all, we think there's certainly a very good chance that prices will continue to improve '14 and beyond. But in addition to that, we will continue to look at, as we did in '13, in interest rate environment where we can protect ourselves with low interest rates through hedges in the out years to give us some help versus what we might be thinking about today. We're also continuing to look at expenses, which a lot of folks asked us early in the year whether we could offset the commodity headwinds in '12 with reduced O&M expenses. I think if you look at the first 2 quarters and what we expect the rest of the year, we've been able to do that. So we have a number of things that we're looking at for '14 and beyond, but again, if you look at power prices alone, they've improved dramatically just in several months, and we would hope they continue to improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Quick question on Kewaunee, could -- is there any update there on how you're getting on with the potential sale? And then can you also remind us how much longer you can keep excluding it from continuing operations? What's the accounting task for that?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, I think, the easy answer to that question, Jonathan, is we expect to have a resolution on Kewaunee this year. And we will certainly not carry it as a nonoperating expense beyond the end of this year, and we hope to have the auction complete and results announced by year end.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So where is that in the process today? Is there -- you kind of you have bids? Or you're shortly to have put it out there?","Mark F. McGettrick","I would say midpoint in the process, data rooms open and bidders are evaluating information.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then, Mark, I think I missed it. How much of the $0.05 increase in retail in the quarter was due to these mark-to-market gains that you expect to reverse? How much was to kind of margin expansion?","Mark F. McGettrick","$0.02 was margin expansion, and $0.03 were mark-to-market gains, which the vast majority will roll off this year.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And you -- so you -- and are you -- net of that mark to market, I guess you were like -- you're $50-odd million ahead on the year so far at retail, of which maybe $30 million or so is this mark to market. Is the remaining $20 million of uplift more or less in line with what you were baking into guidance? Or are you doing better at retail than you thought you would be doing?","Mark F. McGettrick","I'd say we're doing better in retail than we thought we'd be doing. Our margins particularly in our last reports have been better than expected, so we've been very, very pleased with the retail results so far.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And so we'd looked at that as a driver going into Q4 as well?","Mark F. McGettrick","Well, we'll have to wait and see, but if the first and second quarter are reflective of the third and fourth quarter, then we would expect retail to have strong performance.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Could I just clarify one other thing? On weather, from what you've been saying, it's as though kind of weather was going to be a headwind in the back half of the year, but looking at your kind of Q4 '11 disclosures, it looks like it was a net hurt between being having been a  benefit versus normal but a big drag in, but you're Q4, but you're benefiting Q3 but a bigger drag in Q4. Am I looking at the numbers right? So you should -- normal weather, you should actually have a help in the second half?","Mark F. McGettrick","Yes. To compare it to last year, we had $0.08 drag in 2011 in the fourth quarter due to weather. So year-over-year, we would expect normal weather to be a pickup for us.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","For the second half as a whole.","Mark F. McGettrick","That's right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just wanted to understand the weather a little bit more. It looks like the cooling degrees were actually higher than normal. Is it -- what's -- is it the heating degree days that are doing it? Or is it the storms that are making it weather adjusted more mild than normal? I'm just sort of not completely clear on exactly what's driving that.","Mark F. McGettrick","Paul, there were a couple of things. One, cooling degree days were actually 4% off from norm, but humidity in the second quarter was very, very mild. So we got no extremes, and we're very close to norm for the whole period. And particularly, Virginia in the month of June, humidity drives increased sales for us, and we did not see that. So that was the main difference from a strictly degree day view.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then with respect to the outlook for weather normalized sales growth being less than what you guys have previously thought, just a little elaboration on why that is. You brought it down, I think, right? You guys had a higher number before. Now you guys think it's going to be a little bit more lower.","Mark F. McGettrick","We talking about for 2011, 2012?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","2012.","Thomas F. Farrell","Paul Koonce will take that.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes. We have been looking at the megawatt hour sales. One of the drivers really is the actual consumption that we're seeing by the commercial sector. I think that's just part of the overall economic situation in the country, a little bit lighter megawatt hour sales to data centers, but we're protected revenue wise there because they enter into contract minimum demand. So we don't see it really having a material impact on us financially.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then the Q2 -- I mean, Q3 we're seeing a lot of hot weather. I mean, I know you guys are a big -- you guys are in a very wide geographic area, but PJM has seen some very, very hot weather in general, as I think New England. And we haven't really seen all-time peaks, and I was wondering whether or not you guys were seeing anything on the demand response side, specifically sort of we have a new revenue tariff now on PJM with respect to the energy market and the ability to get paid there has changed. Just wondering whether or not you guys are seeing anything or if you got expectations in terms of outside of Virginia, just in PJM in general. Do you guys see anything happening there? Or I was just was wondering if you had any thoughts on that.","Thomas F. Farrell","Paul?","Paul D. Koonce","We've been -- we have a number of customers on our system that are participating in the PJM demand response programs. We have seen PJM call on customers as part of that program. One of the things that we see happening is PJM really tightening up who participates in those programs, so that for the industry, we can really confirm that when it's called on that they're actually performing. Though we're really not seeing anything out of the ordinary other than we continue to see PJM really tighten down on who can participate, and we think that's a good thing because it's going to become more reliable over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was just hoping to get a sense from you guys given all of the adjustments for interest expense this year and given the fact that you've pretty much, I think, locked down the future rates on borrowings for 2013. Can you give us a sense of how much incremental interest expense we should expect '13 versus '12.","Mark F. McGettrick","Paul, we're not in position today to do that. We'll talk more about that this fall as we put out guidance for '13 and beyond. But as you referenced, we've been quite aggressive with interest expense. We also have a lot of maturities, probably more than many companies this year and next, which should provide benefits for us. We called in some hybrids earlier. So Scott Hetzer and his treasury group are doing a lot of things. But we're not in a position today to give any tighter guidance on interest for '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Couple questions on the Cove Point project. I guess first, when do you think you will hear more on the -- this court case that -- with the Sierra Club? And then also, do you have any kind of latest color on what you expect from the DOE and administration's kind of overall view on LNG export.","Thomas F. Farrell","First, with respect to the court case. First thing I would do is encourage anybody who really has any interest in it to read all of the briefs that have been submitted. They're all there on public file in the Calvert County, Maryland Circuit Court, and I think that you can draw your own conclusions about what the most likely outcome of the case is. Both parties have said the court has all the information -- all the parties have said the court has all the information it needs to decide the case. Lawyers would call it, these cross-motions for summary judgment. The hearing is in the fall. We would expect the decision from the court by the end of the year. And I think the documents are pretty clear that we can do liquefaction and that we can transport gas in and out of the site by pipeline. So -- but like I said, if you, people question that judgment, read the briefs yourselves and draw your own conclusions. Now with respect to the DOE, we -- I think most of the signals -- all the signals have been coming out of the administration, indicate that they do not intend to stand in the way of exporting this product. We should have some indication, hopefully by the end of the summer, from some of these outside studies that have been done, and I expect the DOE will move forth fairly rapidly with its permitting as soon as those are issued. So we're looking for this with our permit by the end of the year, and I have every expectation that we will receive one.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. I guess, one other question just on the remaining kind of gas projects that, I guess, the unidentified billion dollars or so that you might do. Just we've had, obviously, high gas price, low gas price. Now gas price back up. There's, I guess, been some pullback in drilling. Just how do you feel about being able to execute on that remaining billion dollars?","Thomas F. Farrell","Well, first, remember the billion dollars is not actually in the plan. It's not in the growth plan. The growth plan is predicated on the projects that are identified. That said, we are working -- there's a lot of activity in Ohio. There's less activity in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, but there's still a tremendous amount of activity in Ohio. As I said, I think, during the call, well permits are up 50% just above last quarter's number. So drilling is still going on. We're working with a lot of drillers, producers on the gathering, primarily in gathering. We mentioned we've done an open season on a more of a larger pipeline project. So how much of the billion dollars? I don't know at this point, but we're working -- chipping away at that, and we'll have more information about that as we go through the course of the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So maybe following up on the last question to start off with. With respect to Natrium 2, perhaps if you can comment on timeline there, just be curious how confident do you guys feel about getting that done in the first half of the decade. And on -- I'll follow up with a second here in a second.","Thomas F. Farrell","If you'd -- by the first half of the decade, you're talking about through some time between now and 2015.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, exactly.","Thomas F. Farrell","That timeframe should work for Natrium 2, but we don't have any announcements to make affirmatively, one way or another on Natrium 2. We're still working with producers on that project.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, when it comes to asset sales. Broadly speaking, I know you mentioned Kewaunee earlier, just on the merchant generation side, how do you feel after Salem Harbor of late about the balance of your portfolio? Any other processes ongoing?","Thomas F. Farrell","There -- I would say -- there are -- we don't have any processes ongoing, but let me just mention on asset evaluation. Said this for -- since I've been CEO of the company, which is nearing 7 years now, we are constantly evaluating our assets. If they face headwinds that we think cannot be overcomed in a -- overcome -- in a reasonable period of time, then we will evaluate whether we should sell the asset or shut the asset down. And it's not something we do on an intellectual basis. We have sold all of our power plants in South America. We sold a utility in the U.K. We sold a power plant in the U.K. We sold peakers in Ohio and Pennsylvania. We have shut down and we sold 1\/3 of our company in our -- when we sold E&P business, so my point about all of this, we're constantly evaluating these assets. And if we don't think we can overcome the headwinds, then we'll -- we will act on it. But I don't have anything to announce on that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then maybe just a last quick follow-up here to a prior question on LNG, how confident are you guys in moving forward with the financing proposal later this year? I mean, how is that progressing if you can?","Mark F. McGettrick","Julien, this is Mark. We're well down the road on how we plan on financing this project, but we'd really like to wait to talk about that until we have firmer cost numbers, until we have all of the service contracts locked down. But we spend a lot of time to what's optimal for shareholders in terms financing, and we hope to be in a position later this year or early next year to talk about Cove Point as a package, of which financing will be part of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you revisit a little bit what's happening more of what you're seeing with demand in Virginia? And the only reason why I ask is that your commentary about new connect levels year-over-year is very bullish. Your commentary about raw demand -- weather normalized demand levels, meaning coming in below your original expectation, less bullish. It implies either some kind of lag in usage or it implies some weakness in kind of usage per customer. Can you just talk about what you're seeing and touch on the individual -- on the 3 main customer segments and where differences are showing up?","Paul D. Koonce","Yes. This is Paul. We're seeing very strong new connects as compared to last year. We've had over about 15,000 new connects this year versus a little over 12,000 last year, year to date, so that's very positive. I think that shows us that developers and homebuilders are getting back out. They're turning dirt, and we're starting to see that activity in the form of new connects. Now it does take some time for new connect demand growth to really show up in our numbers, but that's a good early indicator. Generally speaking, the industrial loads are all looking strong. We've had some consolidations of industrial customers here in our service territory, but the overall economic strength is very good. I would say if you look for where there's some softness in our numbers, it's probably widely distributed among kind of the commercial sector. And I don't think that is coming as any real surprise given the overall economy throughout the country. But it's really distributed among a lot of various types of commercial accounts, whether it's laundromats or whether it's welding shops, those type of places. But we expect when the economy strengthens that, that's going to come back very well. So seeing good early strong indicators, industrial growth, the data centers still connecting. Just attended grand opening of a new data center yesterday. We plan to connect 9 this year. That's still on pace, so as I look at things going forward, we have a strong economy. It's widely distributed, and all the areas are really doing pretty well.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on the industrial side because when I look at the data in the operating stats portion of your earnings release, year-over-year, 3 months, 6 months your customer account for industrial is actually down, and your demand number for the quarter is actually down 4%, 5%, and for the year-to-date, it's basically flat. And I kind of thought just from a weather perspective, industrial tends to be far less weather sensitive than any of the other categories. So just I'm trying to kind of true up your comments versus some of the data that's in the operating stats.","Paul D. Koonce","Yes. As I indicated earlier, we've downed about 17 industrial accounts. That's what's on the schedule. That's principally a couple of consolidations with pharmaceuticals as one. Smurfit-Stone was acquired by Rock-Tenn. That's another. So there are some consolidations happening among of our industrial accounts. And again, in terms of sales year-over-year, I think it's a -- just a couple of different isolated areas where perhaps a few customers had stronger quarters last year but not anything really concerning.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Citi.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question was asked and answered.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our call. Ms. Arnett, do you have any closing remarks?","Corynne Arnett","Yes, thank you. Just a reminder that our third quarter earnings release is scheduled for October 25.","Operator","Thank you.

Mark will discuss our earnings results for the quarter and Dominion's earnings guidance. Tom will review our operating and regulatory activities and review the progress we have made on our growth plans.","I will now turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning. Dominion Resources reported operating earnings of $0.97 per share for the first quarter of 2017. Mild winter weather including a record mild February reduced earnings for the quarter by $0.08 per share. Excluding the weather impact, operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.05 per share which was near the top of our guidance range. Compared to the midpoint of our guidance, positive factors for the quarter were higher weather normalized electric sales, lower income taxes, and lower operating expenses.","GAAP earnings were $1.01 per share for the first quarter. The principal difference between GAAP and operating earnings for the quarter were gains recorded in our nuclear decommissioning trust. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings can be found on Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.","Moving to results by operating segment. Dominion Virginia Power recorded EBITDA of $414 million for the first quarter which was in the middle of its guidance range. The impact of mild weather was offset by higher weather normalized sales and revenues and higher than planned earnings from electric transmission. EBITDA at Dominion Generation was $695 million, also in the middle of its guidance range. Offsetting the weather impact were higher weather normalized sales and revenues, lower operating and maintenance expenses, and higher than expected realized margins from our merchant plants. Dominion Energy produced EBITDA of $582 million, just under the midpoint of its guidance range. Mild weather impacted results from the LDCs and retail. Overall, we're very pleased with the results from our operating segments.","For the first quarter of 2017, Dominion Midstream Partners produced adjusted EBITDA of $75.4 million which was three times the level produced in the first quarter of last year. The acquisition of Questar Pipeline in December of last year was the principal driver of the increase. Distributable cash flow of $44.1 million was more than double the level of last year's first quarter. On April 21, Dominion Midstream's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.274 per common unit payable on May 15. This distribution represents a 5% increase over last quarter's payment and is consistent with our 22% per year distribution growth rate plan.","Now moving to treasury activities at Dominion. Cash flow from operating activities were $1.4 billion for the first quarter. We have $5.5 billion of credit facilities. And taking into account cash, short-term investments, and commercial paper outstanding, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $3.2 billion. For our planned debt financings in 2017, please see slide seven. And for statements of cash flow and liquidity, please see pages 14 and 25 of the earnings release kit.","As we move through 2017, Dominion will continue to see very strong capital growth, with the final year of construction at Cove Point, ongoing construction of the Greensville County Power Station, and the start of construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. However, with the completion of Cove Point and the planned asset drop in Dominion Midstream Partners, the company's cash flow profile will change dramatically, moving from negative to significantly positive. As we have highlighted in the past, we expect to receive $7 billion to $8 billion of cash between 2016 and 2020 from Dominion Midstream Partners, which will be used to reduce Dominion-level debt, increase dividends in excess of 8% per year, invest in new growth projects, and repurchase common stock.","As to hedging, you can find our hedge position on page 27 of the earnings release kit. We have hedged 89% of our expected 2017 production at Millstone. We plan to limit our hedging for 2018 production until we see the outcome of pending legislation in Connecticut. This legislation, which was voted out of committee and will be taken up by the full House and Senate, would allow Millstone to bid into a competitive procurement conducted by Connecticut regulators to secure carbon-free energy for the state's customers. It will potentially cover up to one-half of Millstone's expected output for five years. The legislative session in Connecticut is scheduled to adjourn on June 7. If approved, the competitive auction would likely take place this fall, for power deliveries beginning sometime next year.","Now to earnings guidance at Dominion. Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $0.60 and $0.70 per share, compared to operating earnings of $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Positive factors for the second quarter compared to last year are a return to normal weather and sales growth at Virginia Power. Negative factors compared to last year are lower earnings from Cove Point due to the roll off of one of our import contracts, lower investment tax credits from solar investments, and lower realized margins at Millstone. Dominion's operating earnings guidance for all of 2017 remains at $3.40 to $3.90 per share.","As we discussed on our last earnings call, we believe operating earnings for 2018 will increase by at least 10% over 2017, driven primarily by earnings from our Cove Point export facility, which is expected to be in service late this year. With the growth we expect across all of our business segments, we expect a 6% to 8% compound average growth rate in earnings off a 2017 base through 2020. Not only is this one of the best growth rates in the industry, but coupled with our stated intent to grow our dividend rate at over 8% annually beginning next year, Dominion provides investors with one of the best total return opportunities in the utility space.","So let me summarize my financial review. First quarter operating earnings were $0.97 per share. Weather normalized earnings were $1.05 per share. Second quarter operating earnings guidance is $0.60 to $0.70 per share. And 2018 earnings are expected to be at least 10% above 2017. And finally, our 2017 to 2020 earnings growth rate should be 6% to 8%.","I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning. Strong operational and safety performance continued at Dominion in 2017. All of our business units either met or exceeded their safety goals in the first quarter. I'm pleased that our employees set an all-time OSHA Recordable Rate of 0.66 last year, and we have a goal of improving on that record this year. Our nuclear fleet continues to operate very well. The net capacity factor of our six units during the first quarter was over 100%.","Now for an update on our growth plans. Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station continues on time and on budget. As of March 31, the $1.3 billion project was 30% complete. All three gas turbines, the gas turbine generators as well as the steam turbine generator and casings have been placed on their foundations. All three heat recovery steam generators have been set with modules loaded. With the major equipment on-site, the risk to the schedule is greatly reduced. Greensville is expected to achieve commercial operations late next year.","We have a number of solar projects under development, and continue to see demand for renewables from our customers including data centers, military installations, and the state government. In total, we have announced 408 megawatts that will go into service this year and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, bringing our gross operating portfolio to about 1,800 megawatts, about 700 of which will be in Virginia and North Carolina.","We have begun the process to seek operating license extensions for our four nuclear units in Virginia. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation establishing that the spending on these efforts, which could be up to $4 billion reaching into the next decade, will be recoverable through a separate rate rider. The general assembly also stated the construction of one or more new pumped storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest with cost also recoverable through a rider. We are evaluating a number of options and expect to have sites selected later this year.","We have a number of electric transmission projects in various stages of regulatory approval and construction. $784 million worth of these assets were completed in 2016 including our new system operation center. We plan to invest $800 million in our electric transmission business this year.","Our strategic underground program continues at Dominion Virginia Power. Earlier this year, the Virginia General Assembly confirmed its support for the program and clarified the standards by which distribution lines would be prioritized. We plan to invest up to $175 million per year in this program to reduce the number of outage locations and their duration during major events.","We're seeing improving prospects for electric sales growth in Virginia. New customer connections at Virginia Power in the first quarter were 17% higher than last year. We also connected three new data centers in the first quarter, two more than in the first quarter of last year, and anticipating connecting eight to nine new data centers each year through the end of the decade. In addition, anticipated increased federal spending on defense will provide strong support for the Virginia economy which is the largest recipient of defense dollars in the nation. All of these factors support our expectation that annual electric sales growth of at least 1% will continue.","Progress on our growth plan for Dominion Energy continues as well. Our Cove Point liquefaction project is now 89% complete. Engineering and procurement is essentially finished. Structural steel and large diameter piping installation are coming to completion and the post-installation pipe testing is about 60% complete. Over half of the project systems are now in the commissioning phase, on line with schedule. As we work toward commercial in-service later this year, we will be commissioning the power block this quarter and begin to ramp down the construction-related labor. Last month, FERC approved our request to begin flowing gas to the site in order to begin firing the two auxiliary boilers as a (14:57) step in the power block commissioning. The boiler first test was successfully completed last week.","Third quarter will bring the project to a state of ready for start-up, and construction will reach essentially complete status. We have filed a request with the Department of Energy to export LNG produced during commissioning. Finally, the fourth quarter will provide a period of sustained production of LNG prior to achieving commercial in-service late this year.","We're continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. FERC issued its draft environmental impact statement in December. The report was favorable and concluded that all environmental impacts will be effectively mitigated and that there would be no significant public safety impacts. The public comment period ended in early April. And this week, we filed responses to FERC information requests and all of the comments received during the public comment period. After receiving the final EIS this summer, we expect to receive the final permit from FERC by late summer or early fall. We're in the process of securing all the necessary water crossing and other federal and state permits and expect to complete that process later this year.","ACP and Supply Header have essentially completed the design and engineering, executed the construction contract, and completed over 80% of materials procurement. We remain on track to start construction in the second half of this year and expect completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header in the second half of 2019.","We have an additional six pipeline growth projects underway with $700 million of investment. Five of these projects are expected to be completed this year. We're seeing continued interest in pipeline expansion projects driven by new power, industrial, and LDC load throughout our system. We believe a federal policy that supports infrastructure investments will increase drilling activity and gas demand from industrials and other sectors. Importantly, it will also expedite approvals of gas infrastructure which will, in turn, accelerate investments in needed pipeline expansions. Based on these factors, we expect to secure at least three or four new growth projects this year and significantly more through 2020 throughout our entire footprint, including our traditional Appalachian Basin, our new Western system and our expanding Eastern footprint which has direct access to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast U.S. markets.","So to summarize, our business has delivered strong operating and safety performance in the first quarter. Construction of the Greensville County project is on time and on budget. Construction of the Cove Point liquefaction project is also on time and on budget. We continue to work toward FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project. And as we complete our major projects, we will deliver strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year.","As Mark stated earlier, we expect earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, and a diverse set of positive factors will support continued growth in the years to come. Because of our unique MLP structure, our superior cash flows will also allow a dividend growth rate at Dominion higher than 8% per year for the foreseeable future.","Finally, this will be the last earnings call for Dominion Resources. Following a shareholder approval at next week's annual meeting, the company's name will change to Dominion Energy in recognition of our focus on the evolving energy marketplace and to unify our brand after last year's merger with Questar Corporation. The new logo is shown on slide 17. Our electric and gas distribution companies will unify under the single brand and change their doing business names in Idaho, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The names of our operating segments will change as well, to the Power Delivery group, the Power Generation group, and the Gas Infrastructure group. We will begin using these names in our reporting of operating results next quarter. The name of our master limited partnership will change to Dominion Energy Midstream Partners. The ticker symbols for both companies remain the same.","Our company and our employees are proud of the work we've done in delivering energy for 119 years, and of the reputation we have built through reliable and affordable service.","With that, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will open the floor for questions. And the first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. There's a little bit of background noise here I'm hearing. So first question, if you can. Millstone's obviously garnered a good amount of attention. I wanted to ask it in a, perhaps, a little bit of a differentiated manner. Public Service has talked about their nuclear portfolio as being principally framed around the decision to deploy incremental capital. How do you guys think about Millstone, not just in terms of earnings and cash contribution, but more importantly, in terms of your willingness to continue to contribute capital to that asset and whether it's earning its \"cost of capital\" specifically?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Julien, we're nearing the end of the Connecticut Legislative Session, as you know. They're scheduled to adjourn at the end, I guess, of the first week of June, June 7. Occasionally, that carries on a little bit as they finish up their budget negotiations. We've been in touch with folks in Connecticut. We're keeping keep close contact with it. We've said all that we're going to say about Millstone at this time. But there's no question that continued support of Millstone is very important for us to be able to make continued improvements to that facility, look at potential relicensing in the future years, as we are in Virginia. So it's an important outcome for us, and we're paying very close attention to it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. A second, little bit of a detail. Obviously, you've expanded your solar portfolio over the last year pretty dramatically. I'd be curious if you're thinking about the continued ownership of these solar assets after or throughout the ITC recapture period, as that winds down. Have you ever thought about potentially rethinking your ownership through this ITC period?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","I think the answer is a complicated answer to a very straightforward question, I think, because partly, it depends on what assets you're talking about. The assets that we're developing through our regulating customers here in Virginia and North Carolina, we have full intention to continue to own those. In fact, the way some of them are structured that are now under contract, we will own in the future once (22:41) certain period of time. And as far as harvesting part of the portfolio that's a little bit older, I'll let Mark answer that part of the question.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Julien, we kind of guided everybody a couple of years ago on what our direction would be on our long-term contracted assets outside of our footprint here in Virginia and North Carolina when we sold down a third of a number of solar facilities, and we're still able to utilize the ITC. So once that window is over, which is typically five years, we'll look at the economics around that. And if it makes more sense for us to go ahead and sell those assets and recycle that capital into higher return businesses, we will look at that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Lastly, I suppose, if I could expand on the utility side of the business just very briefly. You all have been emphasizing growth on that side of the business of late. Can you elaborate a little bit on the potential avenues for future growth and the rider treatment therein? I suppose of late, you all have been emphasizing the repowering investments on the nuclear side. Are there any other such mechanisms and riders we should be paying attention to, as you think about the next wave of VEPCO reinvestments?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Well you have the existing riders that have been around since 2007. For example, the GENCO riders like Greensville County. There was a clarification of the law to make sure that very significant investments that may be necessary to extend the lives of our North Anna and Surry Power Stations to 80 years will be recoverable through riders. We have our undergrounding distribution or undergrounding rider that covers 4,000 miles. Now we have 56,000 miles of distribution lines in Virginia but about 4,000 have a higher likelihood of extended outages when we get significant storms because of the topography or the trees that are in the neighborhoods or whatever. So we've been working on those.","The new one. I'm not sure, folks, on the fact that we actually own 60% of and operate 100% of the world's largest pumped storage facility in Virginia at our Bath County Power Station. It's the closest thing to a real battery that can work with renewables of any scale. We've been looking in the South Western part of our state that could use continued economic development, and those will be subject to riders as well. So and then if you're continuing to operate a coal facility and you need expenses around environmental spending to keep that plant operated, for example, coal ash ponds, remediation, et cetera is also recoverable through a rider.","So there's lots of opportunities and, as we've said, the Virginia economy is beginning to perk up a little bit. New connects were 17% higher in the first quarter and the sales growth is strong. Mark can give you the details on that. The budget that has been agreed to through September includes significantly more dollars for defense spending which many have been asking for in Congress for years now. Mark?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Julien, I'll just mention weather normalized sales for a moment. Our lagging 12 months of growth has now exceeds 1% in the state. We had an extremely strong first quarter in terms of growth. Data centers are just an unbelievable growth machine for us where if you look at it they're now about 18% of our commercial load. Tom referenced we're going to build eight or nine, bring them online. I should say we're not going to build them but somebody else would build them, bring them online annually over the rest of the decade. And we're really seeing good signs of strength in the economy. So we're quite bullish on sales growth and construction in the state and we'll see how that works its way out through the rest of the year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Last quick detail if I can. On the Supreme Court, the Virginia Supreme Court specifically. If there's an outcome on the rate freeze, just what's the timeline for you all needing to file because, obviously, you'd revert back to this biennial system I presume anyway? So I'll let you respond.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","The case, of course, does not involve Dominion; it involves APCo. Its impacts would likely impact Dominion. We're not going to comment on that since the Supreme Court has it and they'll issue their opinion in the summertime.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you all very much for your patience.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. Could you elaborate a little more on the capital opportunity and some of the additional pipeline spending that you alluded to through the remainder of the decade?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Diane Leopold runs our newly called Gas Infrastructure group. She can comment more fully on that.","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Okay. Hello. Yes, we're in negotiations and discussions with local distribution companies, with large-scale industrials, and with power producers and some gas producers also really throughout our region. So in that Appalachian region, we're seeing a lot of industrial load looking to come back. Same again in our Eastern region, in our Carolina area. And then in our Western growth strategy, we're also looking at some of the local distribution companies and industrial demand in that region. So much of it is demand-driven, and we're already in the later stages of negotiations in some smaller projects and expect that to increase as we move towards the end of the decade on some of the larger projects.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Is there any, like, dollar figure that you can attach to that in terms of the current CapEx forecast?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","It'll be over $1 billion.","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Yeah. It's in line with our projections and our growth strategy, and certainly continues to increase as we move to the early part of the next decade.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So it's fair to say that it's in the current forecast?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Yeah. It's part of our overall growth plan that we've been talking about since 2015. As we've said, whenever we've given out these growth plans over the years the later part of the period is \u2013 We know where all the gas projects are in the first two, three years, and as we go through the period we start filling up the bucket later in the years. That's what Diane was just speaking about.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And is there any commentary that you can provide on Blue Racer and the status of natural gas liquid processing in the Southern Utica and how that business is progressing?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Michael, this is Mark. It continues to progress but at a slower pace than we thought several years ago. They will have good year-over-year growth from 2016. We're seeing some modest increase in drilling. So the guidance that we gave a quarter ago, between now and 2020, we feel comfortable that Blue Racer will be a contributor to that. But we think it'll certainly be much slower in terms of growth profile than what we thought two or three years ago.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","These other guys have been extremely thorough. So I only have one question, but it's in 27 parts. Just kidding.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Okay. We'll write them down as you go.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Now that you've been the owner of Questar for some period of time, can you tell us relative to the base plan that you thought you could achieve in terms of the three segments of the business, the LDC, the pipelines, which you \u2013 and maybe this is building on the last question a little bit \u2013 which you thought were underinvested and lacked focus, and also the regulated E&P business, how do the prospects look for those three segments now that you've got your hands on them for an extended period of time versus your base case in terms of the growth outlook for those businesses?","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","Hi. So this is Diane Leopold again. All the business are performing well and they're in line with expectations. On the distribution side, we're on track to be investing $65 million in pipeline replacements in 2017 as part of our infrastructure replacement program. Customer growth last year was about 1.9%, so in line with what our expectations were. We had a large recontracting, one of our largest contracts, on Questar Pipeline. And we also had some incremental capacity signed with Questar Pipe that was a contract with Questar Gas that will be in service late 2019. So we're continuing to focus on business development there, as well as proactive integrity management on our pipeline and storage facilities.","On the Wexpro side, we had a successful Wexpro II application for inclusion of additional properties into the cost of service framework. So our drilling and development plan is on track to deliver strong cost of service results there. So we're in line with all of our expectations. We're very pleased with it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","And the growth prospects on the long-haul transmission segment there. One of the sort of upsides that you guys talked about when you looked at this platform was the longer-term trend of gasification in the region, and how you thought that that would ultimately trickle down to more growth opportunities we're seeing. I cover PNM, so I know \u2013 I see what they're doing with the San Juan power generation station, for instance. As you look at your longer-term growth plans, is that growth opportunity at Questar already baked in to your aspirations, or would it be incremental?","Diane G. Leopold - Dominion Energy, Inc.","No. That one's really incremental. That was always going to be longer-term anyway. So, a lot of our growth prospects in the nearer-term were not relying on that. Obviously, the Clean Power Plan, we still do believe that, in the future, there will be facilities that are going to move from coal to natural gas. But that's really into the next decade, and will be incremental.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. So I think most of the topics have been hit on. I just wanted to touch base on solar power and, obviously, you're continuing to grow and deploy more and more capital there. Is there a possibility of a step change upward later in the decade, as solar costs keep dropping, to the point where you might think about making broader resource shifts towards solar, or do you think it's likely just to be more gradual, and there is some sort of a step change coming up that you see?","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Well, as we've mentioned in the past, we're shifting our focus away from these contracted assets, the assets we've been buying out, particularly in the West. I think we got a couple more to do this year. Paul will comment on those. But we're focusing in North Carolina and Virginia, our regulated customer base, and we filed a new integrated resource plan document, and for the first time, solar passed the economic test in any significant amounts and that IRP says you could logically build up to 5,200 megawatts of solar over the next 15 years. Now, as you know, as you build more renewables like that, that comes hand-in-hand with pipelines and gas-fired peakers to support the renewables when they are unable to operate. So, we'll have to see how that all goes over the next few years, but that is becoming a real increasing possibility. Paul, go ahead.","Paul D. Koonce - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Steve. This is Paul Koonce. Over the last couple of years, 2016, 2017 especially, we have really refocused our effort on meeting customer needs here in Virginia and North Carolina. We have one project that remains under construction out West, in California. It'll go out into service later this year. But all of the projects that we've announced over the last two years have either been in North Carolina or Virginia, really to meet specific customer requirements on the DBP (36:24) system, and I don't see that changing. As Tom mentioned, we filed an integrated resource plan earlier this week, which I think highlighted the cost competitiveness of solar. So it is going to be an increasing part of our mix, but it'll be here in Virginia.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. That's all I had. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So I wanted to go back to the load growth that you guys are talking about, strong new connects, and the data centers. So how does it reconcile with PJM's ongoing negative revisions to the load growth projections in the Dominion zone?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Hey, Angie. It's Mark. I think we're going to be stronger than that. And, again, they've identified our region as one of the, if not, the strongest grower in a revised plan. But what we've seen in the last year and what we were expecting in improved military spend in the state we think will drive our growth to at least 1% (37:34) and maybe higher. And I'll let Paul expand on it.","Paul D. Koonce - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Angie, just one important distinction I'd like to point out between PJM's forecast and our own forecast. They characterize solar as a load reducer. So when they look at load growth, they subtract from their load growth the amount of solar generation that comes on your system. So I think that's part of the difference that you see there that requires some investigation.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And just one question on the quarter. So could you quantify the tax benefits? And is this just something that's going to reverse later in the year and what exactly was it related to?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","You're referring to the slightly better than guidance tax, not ITC's, right?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes.","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Angie, it was about $0.02 for us, above expectations and they were also around the state and federal tax settlements. We anticipated that that would occur this year, but it occurred a little bit earlier in the year than we had thought. So that will not be incremental at year end.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then the last question on Millstone. So the guidance of at least 10% year-over-year growth in earnings between 2017 and 2018 does not account for any legislative help in Connecticut to Millstone?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","That's right. We said in the last quarter call that we've assumed at that point in time what the market strip was with a CPI type growth through the next several years. So if there's a different bidding approach in Connecticut that would be something that we'd have to factor into guidance.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","CPI type of growth to forward power prices?","Mark F. McGettrick - Dominion Resources, Inc.","That's what I mentioned on the last quarter's call, that that's what we had on our forward growth rate for Millstone. CPI type increases.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas F. Farrell II - Dominion Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude this morning's conference call. You may disconnect your lines, and enjoy your day."]}}
